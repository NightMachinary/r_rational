*** I'll admit that I personally feel Ted Chiang has mined out the [[#s][]] but I'd love to be proved wrong.

**** I think plenty remains to do -- both of Chiang's stories are about [[#s][]] but there's plenty to say about the social effects of finding out that you live in one.

**** I'm not gonna get bothered looking for specific posts, but it's hard to call saying that calling a conservative movement racist also means you're a potential murderer, or believing the ess-jay-double-yoos are infiltrating geek culture to make fun of twue nerds, anything else than paranoid reactionary crap.

***** If you cannot produce three specific examples, then we have no reason to believe you're not just bullshitting and taking shit out of context.
