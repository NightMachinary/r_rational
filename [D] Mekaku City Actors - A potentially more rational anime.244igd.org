I started watching [[http://myanimelist.net/anime/21603/Mekakucity_Actors][Mekaku City Actors]] yesterday and I was surprised when I saw some flags marking a good anime. The show is about a group of kids, each with a unique power, and some mystery involving all of them.

The real kicker to this show came in episode 3 when I was shocked to see the group devise and execute a rather well thought out plan in what I would call a rational manner. There was a problem, they knew there environment, they gathered information, they dealt with sub-problems, and ultimately they solved the problem. [[http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1158765&show=120#msg30325745][I wrote a big post]] breaking down the plan, pointing out important aspects, how it was created, and potential holes (all of which could have been covered). It was a treat to watch these events unfold and if it continues this maybe one of the best anime I've ever seen.

I mentioned how the powers were really interesting. Its not really a spoiler to say they are, so far, all based around perception. Its also not really a spoiler to share what powers are revealed by episode 3 but I'll spoiler tag this anyway. [[#s][The powers include]]\\
These powers all strike me as being very subtle and I love how they are all based around perception. None of these powers are directly offensive which is important when the group has to resolve a conflict.

This is a Shaft show so if you know the Monogatari series, the style is in the same vain as that. The style is really unique and I guess I'd describe it as minimalistic, and really clean.

A potential downside is that it has a lot of talking, so maybe be ready for that.


** No.

Just watched first 3 episodes because of your suggestion, but there is nothing particularly clever or rational within that plan. And it was very simple.

There are many anime with serious rationality themes, but this one is not one of them (yet).

*** I'm new to the world of rationalist fiction so I'm not entirely sure what the general standard of clever or rational is. I also don't know what qualifies as simple. Could you elaborate?

****** The main problem, as people on animesuki forums wrote very clearly, was that the plan itself was improvised, and had many points of failure. They went with it because it was the plan of the brother of the idol and because they weren't in real danger anyway, not because it was the best possible plan in that specific situation.

******* I don't use animesuki so a link to this conversation would be appreciated. I did investigate the forum and found [[http://forums.animesuki.com/showthread.php?p=5100101#post5100101][this post]]. I think I can respond to all of these points so let me know if its right. I'd also ask you to entertain [[http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1158765&show=120#msg30325745][my own break down of the plan]].

******** Nice analysis. I didn't even realize that double checking from the part of the idol. I do think you're over-analyzing at the end, though.

********* You think I'm over-analyzing the part about Momo's brother's (I don't think we've been told his name) recklessness? I'm not sure if there's an explanation as to why he would move with such disregard other then the reason I mentioned.

3 in the linked post there does point out something awkward. I did not consider that Seto could have OK's Momo's brother's plan although it does make sense. However, that post points out that Kano and Seto could have created a more controlled distraction rather then rely on Momo's brother. The problem is that this implies that Momo wanted a distraction which I don't think she did. Sato, Kano, and Momo's brother could have done nothing, except wait for the right time to release the monitors, and the plan would have still worked.

** Yeah, I dropped mekaku after watching ep 3 because of how terrible it is. I wouldn't describe it as having particularly rational qualities at all, either. I'm quite surprised to find that someone percieved it in the way you did.

*** So I will point out that most of it is not rational at all. the exception being the plan in episode 3.
