So I've been thinking it's time for a new recommendation thread, but to avoid repeat from the last recommendation thread or just reposting the recent submissions, I'm making the requirement that the story has to be something drawn.

Comics, graphic novels, manga, webcoimcs, or anything else where the story is told through pictures instead of words.

** This thread reminded me to catch up on *Strong Female Protagonist*. The angle it takes to explore superpowers/heroes is an interesting one, and the execution is good.

*Re:Monster* is good. Munchkinry. Perhaps a bit indulgent.

*** SFP buys in too much to internet feminism for me to take it seriously. I have some problems with the characterization and dialogue after issue 5 starts. But I haven't read 1-3 recently, so I might have problems with them as well.

Feral's arc (issue 3) was the best one, in my opinion. It made me cry.

****** Yeah, I just caught up. I think it's stayed roughly as good as the Feral arc, honestly. Which is to say, really really good.

I agree that the moonshadow stuff is more feminism-charged than the other stuff the comic covers, but I don't think it's as if the comic went out of its way to unabashedly push an "internet-feminist"-y stance. They made Furnace, who was in part the embodiment of anti-false rape accusations, a sympathetic character, and made sure to deliberately acknowledge male rape victims. It all seemed fairly reasonable and balanced to me, or at least enough so that it didn't leave me behind.

The breakdown on 157 was pretty good too, and really built upon the ongoing exploration of the particular themes of ethics and social responsibility that the comic covers and was so well done in the Feral arc. I mean, the comic has a little bit of tell not show going about it when it does this, both with Feral, the current arc, and other moments, but in general it's striking a chord with me and I think it works pretty well.

******** Before he got tasered and kidnapped, we find out that he has a conscience, his parents and friends were killed and/or dead, and that in the end he's fundamentally trying to do what he thinks is right based on his ethical convictions, at least in part - so, you know, he's basically shown to be much like most of the other relevant characters in the comic.

Now, he is hoisted on his own petard to not make you feel too bad about him, I suppose. But I think he was given sufficient fleshing out to be a sympathetic character, or that's how I perceived him, anyway.

***** The use of some bad statistics such as the wage gap, as well as the straw MRA asshole who /just happens/ to be a rapist, and the toxic ending to the MC's toxic relationship with the mentally ill supervillain.

It didn't derail, it just stopped being interesting to me when I last read it. At some point I started merely tolerating it, and that's when I try to notice my lack of engagement and disengage entirely.

******** She was very clear that she didn't know.

edit: that might not be true, I think it's also possible to interperet what occurs in the comic as showing that he wasn't a rapist. It's arguably the more defensible position given the evidence the comic gives you. It's all mostly dependent on whether or not the truth serum interrogation actually occurred before Alison showed up.

** *Superman: Red Son* is my favorite Superman comic (the pitch is that Superman's spaceship lands in Soviet Russia instead of Kansas).

*[[http://www.shigabooks.com/?page=001][Demon]]* started out as being very much the sort of thing [[/r/rational]] would love, but has sort of descended into madness. I don't know, it's weird. Consider this a half recommendation?

*[[http://english.bouletcorp.com/][The Bouletcorp]]* does a lot of really neat long-form comics. It's definitely one for RSS though, since he tends to drop a big chunk every few weeks rather than being on any sort of schedule.

*Y: The Last Man* was good, and was part of that genre of "some big thing happens, here is the result", though the ending was a bit weak. It's finished, so it's got that going for it.

** For the ridiculous repertoire of bizarre facial expressions and the amazing dialogue (not to mention the self-awareness and hilarious action sequences), my current favorite webcomic is Paranatural.

The manga Liar Game, which focuses on game theory in the setting of, well, actual games. That the participants are forced to attend, after being roped in by the first round where they were either put into huge debt or blackmailed based on how they won. The protagonist is extremely off-putting at the beginning, but the other main character is awesome enough to offset it until the protagonist grows into herself as a competitor, which does happen.

The MSPA comic All Night Laundry. Incredibly well done, more than slightly creepy, and with a lot of mysteries to be unraveled.

That's all I've got off the top of my head, and I'd link them if I wasn't on mobile.

*** Liar Game: while they never explicitly spell it out, I really like that the female protagonist wins many game through the power of [[#s][]], which no-one less idealistic could do. She still needs the male protagonist to unleash that power in clever plans, but neither could he win without her.

Shame that she has to drag that idiot ball for so long though.

** I'll tentatively put out "El Goonish Shive", if "one of the male protagonists has the power to turn into a girl" isn't a put-off for you. [[http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=1061]["Bringing Silly Back"]] is a decent place to start. Kind of like Sluggy Freelance, in the genre of "bunch of normal characters who gradually through the story acquire superpowers form different sources". Unlike Sluggy, the plot is a little more tightly bound together.

[[http://grrlpowercomic.com/]["Grrl Power"]] is a superhero comic that is very self-aware of the superhero genre, but not to the point of parody. Character driven, not combat driven. Very funny. Not particularly dramatic, but learning the universe, characters, and settling in is plenty interesting to keep me reading. Humor gets an "A", clever use of powers gets a "B+". Characters are smart, but the author hasn't tried to break the universe yet.

I recommend the more recent version with refined art over the terrible webcomic art the story was originally told with. Yusuke Murata's art is amazingly high quality; it's gorgeous, the manga would be worth recommending on the strength of the art alone.

** [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SluggyFreelance][Sluggy Freelance]] is the best comic on the web in my opinion. Very good art (a bit rough for a while in the start, but gets better fast) perfect mix of sci-fi, fantasy, comedy, and drama. It's also super old, more than 15 years (it was one of the first webcomics), and huge (daily updates for much of its run, currently updating 5 days a week). Which means a huge archive which I think is awesome.

Has slowly shifted from comedy (From "The Slug Files": [[http://www.sluggy.com/comics/archives/daily/980320]["Muldy! Watch out for that raccoon!" SWERVE! "Look out! Baby Duck!" SWERVE! "Look out! The only man who knows the truth behind the conspiracy!" WHAM! SPLAT! "Doesn't that just figure."]]) to high drama -- check out the 4U City [[http://sluggy.com/comics/archives/daily/100322][Green]], [[http://sluggy.com/comics/archives/daily/100510][Blue]], and [[http://sluggy.com/comics/archives/daily/110214][Red]] arcs and their [[http://sluggy.com/comics/archives/weekly/090803][setup]] for a great tense and well written sci-fi thriller in a setting almost reminiscent of the game Paranoia, but IMO done better.

Second best comic on the web is [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GunnerkriggCourt][Gunnerkregg Court]]. Really cool art and great writing.

Third best comic on the web is Schlock Mercenary. Nifty sci-fi with some cool rationalist elements, but sometimes a bit slow moving for my tastes. The author also does cool book and movie reviews.
