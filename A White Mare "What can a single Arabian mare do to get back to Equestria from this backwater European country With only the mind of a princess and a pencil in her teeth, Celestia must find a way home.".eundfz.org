*** I'll probably check it out, but I'd note that Celestia inventing a super-algorithm to mine bitcoin is more of an "informed intelligence" thing - we're being told she's smart enough to do this and has done it, rather than seeing her act in an intelligent fashion.

Could you maybe supply a not-too-spoilery example or summary of an example of her being intelligent in a way we can see?
