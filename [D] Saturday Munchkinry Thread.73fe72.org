Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

Feel free to munchkin any or all of the powers, or just the one /you'd/ choose IRL, or the one someone looking to maximize their cred as a historian would choose, etc.

Tried to strike a balance between clarifying the nature and extent of each power in-text and not being overly long, and it still ended up simultaneously too wordy and ambiguous in places.

*** Well, "Literature Review" sounds almost like a superset of "Olden Omnicompetence". Sure, it doesn't give you physical skills, but the omnicompetence doesn't give you extra strength or flexibility, either, so you'd want to practice in either case. Plus, it's not just instinctive, so you could actually teach it.

However, it seems to me that the most important power is the one that breaks normal physics, namely Material Transposition. Removing nuclear waste is fairly mundane, but being able to create nuclear fuel by drawing from a plane of infinite energy is something else.

Note that you might initially find it hard to locate a complete cubic foot of U-235, but you only need to start with a small sample, because you can double it every 3 hours.

I'd meant for the two to roughly represent the difference between [[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/knowledge-how/][Epistêmê and Technê]]. My impression is that e.g. historians of art aren't themselves necessarily good artists, unless they've practiced it independently? Plus, the omnicompetence one gives you non-public knowledge (if that's of any use) and makes you an omniglot, too. IDK how much something like finger dexterity can be partitioned into "physical ability" and "skill", either, e.g. in the case of playing a piano, so left it ambiguous. Plus IDK that expert piano players automatically get a leg up in something like video games, where a deciding factor can be how many operations per second you can perform.

*** I think the most interesting and useful powerful powers here are the "Council of Greatness" and "Olden Omnicompetence" examples.

The usefulness of the Council of Greatness power is contingent on my ability to transmit information into and out of the council. It's a [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/qk/that_alien_message/][That Alien Message]] situation, except the population is 1400 instead of billions.

The listed categories are interesting. I don't know whether any interesting ancient philosophers would have considered themselves philosophers. I don't know how to define what a 'leader' is, or understand why we have a group allocated to each of artists, musicians, and writers (had I selected the categories, all these would be represented by one group). But they promise not to disappoint, so I'm all for it! I think I'd step into it and say, "OK, guys and gals, what do you all think we should do? Oh, and we can select 200 more folks, let me know who you want."

It's sort of like making your first wish from a 3-wishes-genie to know what the best possible next 2 wishes would be. I now have the combined intellect of some of the top 1200 people who have ever lived, who never need sleep or eat. And they're supernaturally cooperative and motivated, which is also critical.

The next question is whether "Olden Omnicompetence" encompasses mental 'talents' such as reason, memory, philosophy, rhetoric, creativity, charisma, etc. Forget the sculpting of statues and forging of swords, I'm the intellectual amalgamation of the Council of Greatness myself. With all this business acumen and political wisdom (which were undoubtedly talents held by some people prior to 19000 BC, much less 1900 AD), I can easily hire a modern machine shop or factory to do any production I need - no point in trying to pull a Connecticut Yankee operation. This power seems to neglect to some extent that my physique includes my brain. But if I can exceed Bach's musical creativity, well, my current brain has no hope of doing that even less than my body trying to do a triple backflip. This power limits me to one brain that needs sleep, food, etc. unlike the Council's 1200 brains that can all work full time, but completely removes the bottleneck of getting information into and out of the council.

Kinda bummed that Summon Spirits requires "easily searchable limits". It would have been fun to munchkin it by summoning "an employee of the company which will experience the greatest growth in the stock market tomorrow". Also, "ghostly memories do not persist across summons" seems like a severe limit on my ability to use more than two such individuals.

Postcognitive Projection feels somewhat limited. I think the most useful information would be that which was written down exactly one decade ago - there's lots of corporate or international espionage that's still completely relevant after 10 years.

Material transposition has a historical element, but seems orthagonal to the knowledge-is-power ideas behind the other options. Also, the radius of the Earth is only a few thousand miles. I'm probably going to summon vacuum for a long time trying to figure out the coordinate system. And when I do succeed in summoning "rock", that rock is, at first, likely to be explosive magma at thousands of degrees and many, many gigapascals. So I'm not sure I'll survive the learning curve here.

It does break physics, which is unique, but Olden Omnicompetence and the Council of Greatness break not physics but the limits of society and talent, which could be equally useful. The Council, especially, turns me into a walking strong AI robot.

** This is from a school play I had to perform a long time ago. The story itself was sadly more interested in beating us over the head with the moral than in exploring the societal/metaphysical impacts of the power in question, but I think it makes a good optimization target.

You have access to a very powerful magic artifact: a crown that when placed on a persons head turns every human in existence into an exact copy of that person until the crown is removed. You do not have direct control over your copies; they are exact duplicates of you at the moment the spell takes hold, but start diverging immediately after.

*Notes*:

- The copies do not gain the skills or knowledge of the people whose body they are inhabiting.

- You do not have a psychic link or other special method of communicating with the copies and the memories of the copies are not merged back into yours when the spell ends.

- People retain no memory of what happened while the copies were inhabiting their body, no subjective time passes for anyone but the bearer of the crown.

- There is no time limit on the use of the crown, nor is there a limit to how often it can be used.

- Your clothing, including the crown itself, is not copied along. Note that this will make it difficult to conceal your identity afterwards as your face will be on every security camera on the planet.

- When the spell ends everyone turns back into their original body as it was when the crown was used (including wounds, diseases etc), but they are not teleported back to their original location.

- If a copy dies while the spell is active they remain dead until the spell ends, after which the original body is restored in the location of the corpse (or the nearest empty space to its centre of mass if the body is no longer in one piece).

- If the person wearing the crown dies, the spell ends immediately.

- There is a speed of light delay to the effect of the crown, so you can't use it for FTL signalling.

Considering the power of the crown I'm having trouble coming up with good exploits for it. Anything that requires passwords or biometric identification is out, so you can't just wire a bunch of money to an account of your choice (and this would likely be detected and reversed as soon as the spell ends anyway). I suppose you could assassinate a bunch of people if your copies can somehow identify the person whose body they are inhabiting, but I'm a little sceptical about how much good you could really do by just killing a bunch of specific people, especially if it is going to be very obvious afterwards that it was murder.

Also worth noting is that, depending on your definition of such things, you may be committing suicide approximately seven billion times every time you use the crown.

*** I don't remember ever reading a power here and going "/What? What???/" over and over like this. Well done.

Study up on critical skills like doing the job of a pilot or power plant operator in medias res. Strive to understand warning signs in any language.

Do pregnant women turn into a copy of me with another full-grown copy of me bursting out of their stomach?

Using it for longer than a few minutes the first time might break whoknowswhat system that was not designed to handle me. A minute might be enough for most versions of me realizing that this was a terrible mistake to shout that message to whomever nearby has a smartphone so they can post it to twitter or something. Study up on /swift/ error reporting and switching keyboard languages. Some of those pitiable, soon amnesiac versions of me might be able to cobble together some writing-based cooperation with those pitiable critical people they just bestowed narcolepsy upon.

Taking it off immediately pits the world against me. Giving them less than a few minutes at a time /might/ be able to stop knowledge of my identity propagating too far. I suspect some military or clique of hackers would be able to improvise some protocol I don't understand.

Sleep deprivation is a thing. Taking 8 hours of continued control after 16 hours for the world to intermittently prepare for that might be okay, but it would be easier to have a copilot to swap shifts with me.

In fact, this crown might be better suited to some other person. Knowing that FAI is critical is well and good, but maybe this is important enough to find someone who /also/ speaks all the languages and has all the worldkeeping skills and whose face is known to none and who doesn't burst all the clothing every time he appears.

**** Ooh, raising someone specifically for the purpose of wearing the crown is an interesting idea. I had considered finding someone else to wear the crown, but figured it would be difficult to find someone who shares my exact ethics, believes me when I explain the rules of the crown and is both willing to use it and more suitable for using it than me.

My thoughts were mostly along the lines of wearing the crown once, doing what needs to be done and then hiding it away never to be used again. Repeat use is just too risky, I think (plus all the collateral damage happens again every time you use it). Sleeping could indeed be a problem, though I imagine you could always just ducttape the crown to your head.

*** You can't wire money, but you can steal physical goods/money. Set up a number of specific points located across the world, either based on GPS coordinates or landmarks or something. Then put on the crown. Every copy of you figures out where they are, where the nearest location is, and where the nearest valuable goods/money are. Maybe it's just whatever's in their wallet, maybe it's a nearby store with now unguarded goods, maybe they work in a bank and have access to some money not under combination lock. They take all their stuff, and go put it in the location (bury it or place it in a P.O. box or storage shed that you've prepared ahead of time). The idea here is they can walk/drive to the location relatively quickly, then return to their original location after a preset amount of time, when you take the crown off. Then you can go around gradually collecting your loot from all of the locations.

If you want to be moral, you could do the same thing but only stealing from previously designated people/places that do unethical things and then use the money for good things.

Alternatively, if you wanted to be more subtle, you could set up a website ahead of time and have your copies go and type in their credit/debit card numbers, personal information, usernames/passwords, or any other information that they can find written down either in physical folders or on their computer (if it's not password protected, or they're already logged in). This way nothing would be missing until you steal their identities potentially months/years later.

Also, I think the assassination could be good if you have a way of identifying, say, members of ISIS even after the switch.

Security footage could be a problem. You could try to have everyone cover their face immediately and try to look around for cameras that caught the change, but I doubt every single one of them would get caught. It would be obvious to everyone that something had occurred given that everyone in the world lost time, and they would only need a few cameras that you didn't notice in order to get a good look at your face. The best solution would be to find a way of temporarily altering your face as much as possible in a way that would be copied. If you grow out your hair and then tie it around your face as a mask, would the copies come into existence with their hair in the same hairstyle? If so, that's probably your best bet, then cut/dye your hair afterwards. Otherwise, you could try to make your face swell up from bee-stings or some sort of chemical, such that the copy people look nothing like you will after you heal.

You'd stand a better chance at a net positive if you scouted out unethical rich people ahead of time and only stole from them, having the other clones sit around idly, but, unless you can complete your theft incredibly quickly, I think you'd still come out negative given the sheer amount of man-hours that would be lost around the world during the time you're wasting multiplied by 7 billion, possible causing disasters as important infrastructure goes untended and airplanes aren't properly piloted, and workers in poor countries lose daylight hours and leave tasks unfinished that your clones wouldn't know how to do or that they need to be done in the first place.

This might mean you can control who gets turned into a copy of you and who doesn't, depending on how it works. Let's say I put on the crown for a second and then take it off. Would that only convert humans within a lightsecond of me into copies? Since the rest of humanity would be further away than the FTL speed of the crown's spell.

If so, move far away from the rest of humanity, bringing only your target converts with you (like a bunch of embryos in a test tube). Put the test tube in a power plant of some kind, and put on the crown for just long enough to convert the embryos into copies of you to generate power from their extra mass, while not long enough to convert far away humans.

For privacy, you could give people boxes that lock from the inside with a password required to open from either side, so they lock themselves inside the boxes before you put on the crown, and the fact that copies don't gain information from their hosts ensures the copies can't get out of the box and so people have peace of mind knowing their replacement copies didn't do anything.

That's a fascinating view of identity. I can see how it would create interesting, and very different, reactions to an upload or simulation problem. Hm.

The crown wearer would have perfect continuity, while other instances of myself might be startled by the transition, perhaps from the transition from "having my arms raised just above my head holding the weight of the crown" to being whereever I am. I don't think that this new "I" would go into an existential crisis on realizing that, though, I'd continue on whatever goal the mind-state that was me a few seconds ago and perhaps a thousand miles away intended to do. If that was "Try to keep doing whatever your previous self was doing and avoid catastrophes. And if you find yourself staring at an open Bitcoin wallet, wire some to this address, so that original us can have some funds to continue working on the plan" I'd go about it. I don't see why I'd suddenly become jealous of the crown-wearer, or fearful of my imminent cessation.

Yes and the shitty thing is that you know beforehand that at the instant of putting on the crown your odds of being the one wearing it are one in over seven billion.

As for the copies following through on the plans created by the original. Well for one there's absolutely no selfish motivation to do that, from your perspective you will never get to reap the benefits of whatever actions you take to help the original.

Regarding whether it makes sense for you to fear your imminent cessation. Well for one the fact that another very similar entity to your mind exists seems irrelevant to that, for one their fate doesn't affect your own future experience of continuing to experience things or not. Importantly though is that people don't seem to realize that if you somehow don't care about your own future anticipated experiences but just that of all minds sufficiently similar to ones own, then that has serious implications in the current actual world.\\
Basically if you aren't primarily concerned with your particular instantiation of minds close to you in mind space. Then one has no real reason to care about death or many other things if you think /any/ variety of multiverse is probably true since pretty much every multiverse theory would have enough worlds to have plenty of near/perfect copies of yourself.

Of course some of our disagreement is possibly just that you just have no real fear of death, and it always unnerves me the sheer number of people of people on reddit I encounter who seem to lack that. The number of people of people I encounter who say they would be indifferent to death if they could be replaced with a copy of themselves in the process is rather bizarre and I suspect can't possibly be representative of the general population.

******* See the difference here is the lack of continuity of experience, after all there's no more reason to expect to experience the things reconstructed you experiences any more anyone else. Whatever ongoing processes in the brain generate one's subjective experience do not seem likely to be connected to any aspect of your personality (for instance you wouldn't expect oblivion from having your personality changed by a drug).\\
Thus it seems like if you care about things from the perspective of your own internal experience you should be totally indifferent to whether other iterations of yourself exist elsewhere or will in the future when considering a course of action that would permanently cease the processes in your mind responsible for generating experiences.

As for the transporter example specifically, the obvious counterpoint is that if it merely scanned you /then/ created the copy it would seem clear beforehand which iteration you expect to continue your experiences from.

There's also another thought experiment relevant here. In this one you and someone else with a remarkably similar personality and intelligence will have your memories scanned. Then you are both memory wiped, after which each brain has the memories that used to belong to the other inscribed in it (between the memory wipe and memory inscription the brains are still aware but are like newborns).\\
In this scenario you know beforehand that after the memory switch one of you will be killed, but you get to choose which. So do you choose to let live the individual who bears your memories or the one that has the same brain as you do right now and thus an unbroken chain of experience?

Sure all those things are features of one's brain, but given these scenario involve digitizing them in order to recreate your brain or inscribe them on another brain it's not so clear cut. So in a sense they are only happen to /currently/ be features of your brain but are fundamentally information/processes which can have pretty much any substrate.

As for the individual who bears your memories always being you, well disputing that has been the whole point here. Because the processes in your brain (or equivalent substrate for AI) that do experiencing are not reliant on you maintaining some consistent personality or memories in order to continue functioning. So if you care about being able to predict future experiences then it becomes apparent that in that context you should consider yourself to be the continous processes in your brain which have experience.\\
This is of course somewhat confusing because when dealing with other people the thing you consider to be them is generally going to be their personality and memories, since that is presumably the reason you cared about them in the first place. So from your perspective there's no real reason to not treat copies of people (that are close enough that you can't tell the difference even if they're not /actually/ that similar) as if they were the same. Effectively when it comes to other people you don't really care about their internal experiences, just their behavior.

It's important to keep track of the fact that you're talking about different things in these two cases even if you/others call them both "you". One of those conceptions is useful for predicting behavior which is what you care about in other people, but the other is the one you actually want to use to predict your own future subjective experiences.

But using it under present circumstances even for a fraction of a second, I feel, would 1) overwhelmingly make you out to be the most famous person in the world, given the huge number of high resolution + live feed + remote backup video cameras trained directly on faces doubtless active at any given time, and 2) result in some huge number of deaths and at minimum billions in property damage, as copies of you fail to make the split-second decisions involved in operating heavy machinery (cars included), resulting in crashes that kill you, and when the crown is removed and people find themselves teleported into burning wreckage... I suppose you could ready yourself for split second decision making, but that jerkiness would probably not go so well for everyone undergoing surgery, as surgeons find their scalpel-holding hands teleported minutely right, severing some vital whatsit or other...

** You have a one in a hundred million genetic brain anomaly. It is dormant until a bad car accident puts you in a coma. You wake up faster than the doctors expected, and it turns out that not only did your brain heal itself, but it also grew new connections between your prefrontal cortex and parts of your brain that are normally beneath consciousness. You discover that you now have significant conscious control over your autonomic nervous system. Specifically, you can

1. Exercise a lot of control over your heart rate.

2. Exert your muscles past their normal brain-imposed limitations.

3. Turn any of your senses on or off at will, including pain.

4. Cause yourself to fall asleep instantly, or alternatively keep yourself awake and focused much longer than normal (though the effects of sleep deprivation would still slowly set in and reduce your performance; you just wouldn't consciously notice for a long time).

5. Focus your full attention on anything you choose, and be able to instantly change focus to something else of your choice, without any significant mental break.

6. Control your emotions very precisely. For example, your could suppress stage fright and make yourself feel extremely happy about being in front of people. You could change how you feel about particular people and things, even change your basic disgust response.

7. Alter your sexuality at will. You could make yourself asexual for a period of time, and then later make yourself attracted to very specific people or things.

Is this ability a blessing or a curse? How would you use it to make yourself wealthy and powerful? I came up with this when trying to think of the absolute minimal changes needed to make someone a superhero, changes that are very close to plausible. If you're wondering how it could be a curse, note that more conscious control is not always a good thing. There would be the constant temptation to just turn off all pain signals, but this is a terrible idea, since you could seriously hurt yourself without knowing it. Similarly, there would be the temptation to turn off all negative emotions, but that may not be good for your mental health in the long run.

2. Use my focus and emotional control to bootstrap myself up to an Elon-Musk-level work-ethic.

If you're up for it, you could even make loads of cash being the world's most sought-after prostitute (there would definitely be people into it even if you're only average looking).

5. You're basically the perfect romantic partner for the same reason - no matter who you're with, you can genuinely think of them as the sexiest person on earth. Use this and your previous fame to marry a rich person, if you can.

6. Use your focus and emotional control to try and develop the world's best memory, using standard mind-palace techniques. Win the world memory competition every year and collect the cash prize. Combine your memory with your Elon-Musk level work ethic and become a super entrepreneur.

7. Or, avoid all the above and instead use your complete self-control to become the world's greatest spy. You would be the world's best liar, and also deceptively strong.

*** That's not really all that well as it looks like at the first glance. It is kinda cool, sure, but pretty dangerous in the long run.

Muscle control leads to strains and heavy joint stress all the time. You need to be very precise with muscular groups to not dislocate something. It may be better if you get familiar with how limbs move (I mean we usually move them subconsciously, not controlling every strand by one), build some mass, keep joints in good health, all that. Though if you do not overuse it, there are some benefits, and overall tone is much better.

Turning off pain turns into habit, and combined with previous one, it is not a good thing. Luckily, in modern society there are not many situations where you need to clench teeth and keep going, if you're not a soldier or boxer or something. Though thinking of it, you can be pretty good martial sportsman with pain tolerance and trained overcharged strikes. Bonuses for keeping calm all the time or going into primal rage at will.

Emotion control is very nice, though the main problem is (as I think) that emotions are just reactions of your personality to external stimuli. You can suppress them constantly, but that leads to a whole lot of bad stuff, starting with neuroses.

Changing your personality helps with that, but it goes pretty deep and you got to be very knowledgeably about yourself. To change how you feel about particular person, for example, requires you to understand what do you like and don't like about them, where this likes and dislikes come from, how they interact with each other and so on. Sure, you can just hardwire the feeling of euphoria to this person, so you will be exctatic all the time while interacting with them, but if you had any negative responses to start with, it will backfire pretty much the same as the suppressed emotions.

Speaking of euphoria, luckily it is not exactly possible to accidentally slip into nirvana, because there are some limiters on amount of happiness hormones produced and then brain recalibrates itself so experiences lie in some range, so after a while it evens out. But I bet with some amount of effort you can make yourself into an eternally happy vegetable. Not really a good use of those abilities, sure.

Some may say that changing you personality so that you have completely different reactions (and nice, stable change requires altering a solid part of network) is turning into another person entirely, like you die as yourself and all that stuff. I prefer to think that if I have continuous memories, I remain the same person, and even more, that many possible versions of personality constitute some "meta-ego", and current personality is just one of the configurations. Well, it really helps to have self-imposed utility function that you keep constant through changes, so you don't lose track completely. Memory altering is a thing too, you'll be at least changing emotions associated with said memories to help with personality editing, but I don't need to point at dangers of this.

Full attention focusing looks promising, if you can forcefully induce state of inspiration when you don't see anything else and work on problem with your maximum potential, you can achieve a lot, but I think it depends on your talent and skills and such, so it will be more or less useful for different people. But I bet this mode is very taxing and mentioned sleep deprivation won't really help with keeping you healthy.

At the end of every loop, or when you die, you have 1 minute to choose what to send back. This information goes to a simple table listing each bit for each loop iteration. At the beginning of the every loop, you are told these rules and are given a laptop with access to the table. This access is magical and until you turn on the laptop, there is no effect on the physical world. The laptop is otherwise just a laptop.

I expect that the strategy I would end up with after the first week would take into account the following:

- Tactics like above allow arbitrary communication out of a loop iteration.
- Experiments on the laptop are in order. Can table contents be queried other than one bit at a time without influencing the world other than through query outputs? How large/infinite is the table adress space?
- Breaking the laptop turns the loop infinite. Checking the 10^{ludicroust} bit early in each iteration prevents this, but might stop other strategies from working past that mark.
- Every second that has not been exactly replicated in a previous iteration is one in which some idiot might hook up a random number generator to a CPU and spawn an AGI that takes over the loop. Try not to bring about exponential amounts of original time.

*** I'm assuming that by "deterministic" you mean that everyone starts in the same initial conditions and will propagate in the same direction, so everyone and everything will do the same things every week except as altered by your actions. Without the extra information, you would always make the exact same decisions and get the exact same result, but since every week gives you a different code, your behavior will be different, if only chaotically. This should mean that any decisions you make before seeing the bits should be identical in every loop, only deviating after you've looked. Thus, you can plan and create a protocol for sending and receiving messages in binary and be confident that every other version of you has come up with an identical plan.

My first plan is simple to implement, but has only monetary payout. Pick a lottery where you can pick numbers that resolves in less than a week, and create a 1-1 function that maps integers to lottery tickets. Each week, you buy lottery tickets based the length of the string, and if you win the lottery you exit the loop and are rich, if you lose you restart the loop and pick a 0, making the string one digit longer so in the next loop you will buy a different lottery ticket. You are guaranteed to win eventually since you'll go through every possible list of numbers, and the winning ticket should be the same every time.

If you want, you could do this with multiple lotteries, buying one ticket from each, and not exit the loop until you win all of them simultaneously, so long as you think you can you'll actually get paid despite an inevitable investigation that will occur.

Alternatively, you could use this as a protocol for trying any chanced event such as gambling at a casino, or spending a week in a random town trying to discover the love of your life, as long as you have well-defined criteria for how to vary your behavior based on the string length, and what counts as a success so you won't loop forever.

Alternatively, you could be more sophisticated and actually attempt to send messages to yourself. If you commit to a method for converting between text and binary, you could write questions for future yous to investigate, and then have them investigate and write an answer. If you spend N iterations writing out "What are the winning lottery numbers for PowerBall on [DATE]" then the next few people write out the answer since they'll know the answer at the end of the week. Even though every version of you would know the answer at the end of the week, even the ones asking the question, the question allows the you at the beginning of the week to know precisely what the numbers are referring to, and allows you to ask a second question after the first answer, and a third question, and so on. You'd probably want to include some form of error correcting in your binary encoding in case some version of you dies before learning the answer, or accidentally and chaotically changes the answer, but is forced to leave a 0 or 1 anyway.

Once you have an method of sending arbitrary messages back in time a week (so long as the messages are about reliable results that multiple versions of you can get consistent answers about) you can shortcut answers to any sort of scientific or social experiment, or stock market data, or prediction of events that resolve in a week. Find which stock has the biggest upswing (or downswing), find a method to convince a bank or investing company to commit to that stock (or shorting it) and giving you a cut, add that to your to do list for your final run. etc.

Over and over and over again. Probably take a week off each time and go on a fun vacation.

But hmmm, does the laptop have limitless storage and search capabilities? Are there any limits to how many loops I can go through?

So the loop is deterministic barring the information I access on the laptop, eh. I could try using the current values as a seed to perturb my actions enough, and try to cooperate across iterations to dowse for buried treasure and stuff (maybe including treasure buried in e.g. scratch-off tickets in gas stations, etc.). I think I might probably be able to establish some sort of schelling point code in the first few iterations of the loop which subsequent loopers would follow (e.g. have each 1 represents a square meter, starting at the south pole and spiraling clockwise up to the north; 000s represent places to investigate upon exiting the loop), and a week should be enough to get myself somewhere and start digging. I reckon stuff like lottery tickets would be too sensitive to initial conditions if they're the draw-balls-out-of-a-container sort (when I choose to exit do I play through one more final loop, or just continue on as I was from my exit time? If the latter, I could precommit to exiting only after I've had a really, really, /really/ good week, using that aforementioned seed as perturbation, though I'd probably be convinced to exit far before then, and trying to make use of seeds corresponding to however many bytes worth of data would eventually get my computer bogged down to the point of worthlessness).

Actually, my first moves would be to pay some smart people to brainstorm with me on how to exploit the loop -- some $$ could grease their palms enough to seriously entertain my crazy thought experiment. Then I'd take their advice into consideration and change my plans accordingly.

*** Provided that the computer has infinite memory and infinitely fast access to that memory we can use this to cheat in much better ways than a regular groundhog day loop. Each iteration, follow the following algorithm:

1. Find the index of every bit in the memory that is set to 1 as well as the fist index that does not appear in the table.

2. Convert each of those indices to text by taking the binary value of that index and treating it as the binary context of a text file.

3. Send the text file corresponding to the final index to a bunch of AI researchers and ask them if it contributes some new insight into creating friendly AI.

4. Scan the remaining text files in reverse chronological order, looking for messages of the type: "Please skip index <n>". If you find any, discard the text files corresponding to those messages.

5. Read any non-discarded messages in chronological order, followed by the message corresponding to the final index.

6. If steps 2-5 take more then a week time, end the loop. Otherwise take the rest of the week off (but do read the replies of the researchers from step 3a as they come in).

7. At the end of the loop, if you felt that the new text file contributed something new to our knowledge of FAI (yours or that of the researchers) or it indicated good indices to skip set the bit to 1, otherwise set it to 0.

This does not guarantee that we end up with a working FAI at the end of the loop, but it should provide a significant amount of new insights and it is significantly less risky than my original plan of treating the index as a python script and running it.

Edit: In addition, it is probably wise to first use [[/u/Gurkenglas]]'s suggestion to take a week to revise the above algorithm. Then you could also agree with yourself on some kind of signal for an emergency revision of the algorithm (eg. Three consecutive 1s means ignore everything before this point and read the next 10KB of bits for instructions on what to do next).
