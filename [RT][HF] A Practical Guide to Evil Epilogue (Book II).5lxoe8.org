***** My guess? Part of it is she didn't get to properly *speak*, not before he attacked. If Heiress'^{1} theory is correct, without that, Black doesn't get bound to banter with her. Then, Wander might save her from Black's attack, but it doesn't let her counter-attack, and he had a nice series of lethal-to-a-normal-human strikes prepared before she even appeared. Three strikes and you're out- at least for someone as bound in patterns as the Bards.

Bard has high social power, connections, and a deep understanding of the pattern... but in-so-far as brute force combat power? I suspect even Page or Heiress could trump her in a fight. If you can flee, though... you don't need a combat power, and Wander is good at fleeing.

^{1} well, someone else's theory that Heiress noted, but I don't believe we know the original source.

Also, unless I'm missing something, Dread Empress Triumphant's Name was Empress, not Triumphant. Maybe a new name of Triumphant has been forged, but I doubt it wouldn't have been mentioned when talking about said Empress.

** So I've been thinking: If, as of tommorow, our planet had Names, who would get them, and what would they be?

Obviously we'd have stuff like President and Pope and Prime Minister and Chairman and so on, but not every name is just for the leader of an organization. For example, I think we'd have a NASA exec gain the name Missile Man, and Oprah would probably get a name of some sort.

*** Elon Musk would probably get The Engineer. Rodrigo Duterte seems to be gunning for Tyrant. Donald Trump would probably be The Demagogue. Dwayne Johnson would be, if not The Rock, or The Most Electrifying Man in Sports Entertainment, something like The Superstar.

Mark Zuckerburg would be, I dunno, The Watcher? Warren Buffet would be The Investor.

The difficulty is that many of the roles that are cultural touchstones for us are cultural touchstones specifically because they can generically apply to a broad range of people, and the most exemplary individual is probably unknown to the public at large. There's certainly evidence via Heiress' plan that public perception has influence on Naming, but for instance, The Soldier in our world is probably some Spec Ops badass no one has ever heard of, Assassin likewise. Plus, just the fact that we're a post industrial society where most of the stories that affect are business dealings and politicking instead of heroic epics. We'd probably see names like The Manager, The Teacher, The Nurse, or The Lawyer, The Salesman, The Accountant, and again most of those people are completely unknown to the public at large.

I don't think anyone ever gets a name they'd dislike, and "Demagogue" would reflect poorly on trump. I figure there would just be a standard "President" Name for the US, of which one aspect always has to do with our nuclear weapons.

***** I'd probably see Demagogue as a transitional name. Could be Demagogue -> President, or Demagogue -> Revolutionary, etc. I can see your point about not getting names people don't want, but would argue that Catherine damned near had Queen of Callow forced on her by the Angelic Choir, and was only able to refuse it via monumental spite. I'd bet there have been plenty of people who were Named something they didn't intend or didn't want, but either by magical compulsion of the Name, or just by practicality came to fully inhabit and embody the name.

Black is also an interesting point of data as he seems to have deliberately distanced himself from the more self destructive tendencies of his predecessors, but I'd be interested to find a character who regrets, resents, or is actively trying to rid themselves of their Name.

Anyway, good ending to the second book. I really want to know the deal with the Wandering Bard. Anyone have theories on what it means that Almorava died, or what exactly triggered it? Doesn't seem like an acute case of alcohol poisoning, but... maybe? It also very much seems like her Name is like a complete invasion-of-the-body-snatchers kind of thing. That's... creepy.

There's been a lot of non-human name drops in the past two chapters too. More about the Giants, Elves, and ratlings. I'm looking forward to the worldbuilding that's almost certain to come in the next book.

I'm trying to wrap my head around what the history of the Elves is. The author confirmed that there is an entire kingdom of elves on another continent, but it won't come into play. It sounds like these Elves were kicked out, took over the Golden Bloom (from whom?), hid in Arcadia for a while, and are now back... do I have that right?

*** I think, essentially, the Wandering Bard's personae exist only in the capacity to be attached to another Hero's story. Almorava was part of the Lone Swordsman's story, and now her new persona will be a part of the White Knight's. I think "died" is almost as much a figurative description as a literal one - Almorava simply ceased to exist. The storyteller's death is never a part of the story, and with this chapter done, Almorava just disappears from history.

We may get more details on it later, but my guess is that Aoede simply didn't exist before the Wandering Bard took up the identity. My immediate comparison was to regenerations of the Doctor in Doctor Who. This is just the next mask worn by the Bard.

*** I think Janus is mostly right. Wandering Bard is like...

If this was Worm, the character is the Shard, not the human with the powers. If this was Exalted, it's a sentient Exaltation. The intelligence isn't in the body, it's in the metaphysical entity above the body.

The Wandering Bard is a sentient soul which occasionally switches bodies, but maintains a perfect stream of consciousness throughout. It's true immortality, but only in a completely deterministic way - she seems to have very little control. She follows the stories because that's what she is.

As to the Elves, well...

What would you call a group who opposed race-mixing, believed in full racial superiority, lost a battle with visually similar ideological opponents, and fled to a distant land to hide in the forest?

The concept sounds [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratlines_(World_War_II_aftermath)][pretty familiar]] to a student of history.
