So If you already know about this feel free to just go read the latest post [[http://mspaforums.com/showthread.php?58468-Oh-My%21-Generic-Monster-Girls%21-FINALLY-A-REAL-TITLE%21/page10][here]].

However last time I just dropped a link into the middle of this a month or so ago it seems like people were confused.

So a bit of an introduction pre-amble.

This project is an exercise in taking something quite absurd/silly/uncomfortable/weird as a premise and exploring it as a physical event and then actually playing through the social and personal ramifications. I'm also using this as a project to intentionally polish up my visual presentation via 'art style evolution'.

I'm going to aim to keep it SFW but at the same time I have no desire to pull punches either (subject matter only, if worse comes to worse convenient view obscuring props or fades to black will be the order of the day).

The point is to be authentic and rational (but not necessarily rationalist although a few characters aspire to it with various degrees of success).

If that sounds like something your interested in check it out from [[http://mspaforums.com/showthread.php?58468-Oh-My%21-Generic-Monster-Girls%21-FINALLY-A-REAL-TITLE%21][here]].

Also this project is interactive and ongoing so if you have your own views/comments/critiques of it feel free to comment either here or on the forum thread.

Balderdash! Nonsense! Whoever made up these rules needs to get off my lawn!

** Is anyone mildly disappointed to find out that this wasn't referring to "Oh My Goddess"? I was hoping for a rational fanfiction of "Oh My Goddess" with monster girls in it.

Still funny story here and I find it easier to follow than Deeprise. Brilliant work with the drawings.

*** I've got a lot of stuff to get out, and I'm more then willing to swing a couple hundred anime references. Honestly considering the setting it would be weird if no one acknowledged them.

** Way too much focus on tumblr-esque political correctness to be enjoyable.

*** That was actually an attempt to extrapolate cultural trends.

Not necessarily the easiest thing to do well.

But at a broad sweep consider this. The timeframe in story is long enough for the people who are tumblr-esque politically correct to be in their fifties or sixties and established in various fields.

I could definitely see it needing to be toned down, but I think that will mostly happen anyway as I get more individuals/different backgrounds into play and interacting.

**** That's an interesting point. Though, do people tend to keep the politics of their teens/early 20s into their sixties? How many baby boomers are still actively thinking in terms of the hippie movement?

***** Some of them never let it go, others treated it as a fad. You could make an argument today's 'green' movement and the prevalence of things like whole foods and the like in the states is a direct repercussion of the hippie cultural prevalence.

****** It may make some sense for contemporary social justice to be carried somewhat into the mainstream of the future, but the way it's depicted seems to overestimate the sustainability of tumblr's brand of social justice.

******* Mostly I was just aiming for more tolerance, was not really going for terribly high qoutient of social justice. Then again I was also kind of trying to make my own relatively moderate standing on most issues seem kind of 'old man racist' as a contrast... Like I said Projecting cultural trends into the future is hard.

I'd love to hear your break down of what parts seem like they would have been unsustainable to persist into the future if your up for it. I find there is a lot to gain from civil discussion with one's critics then trying to tease critique from those that are already sold on a position.
