Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

I refresh the page. Same message. I trace my ethernet cable back to the router in case this is some belated April Fools joke and I'm connected to my son's network. Still plugged in - still my router. I check the gap under the door to my son's room just in case - no blue light. I put my ear to the gap - no humming of the computer fan. Not a prank, then. I return and refresh the page. Same message.

Darn.

--------------

I stop by the book store on the way to work to see if the author published in print as well. Nothing - either he's an unknown or using a nom de plume.

--------------

I lounge at my desk station pretending to ponder the reports arrayed before me, twirling a pen in my off hand. My solution. My solution to the final exam. What's being examined? Story comprehension... ability to solve the Iraq war... JKR style magic, since Hussein has a wand? Maybe, if Bush will die and be resurrected in three weeks time. So, Saddam is a wizard, JKR style magic is real, and Bush will die and his corpse perfectly revivified by necromancers. Hmm... Saddam who? Maybe it's not Hussein. Maybe it's just some wizard named Saddam. And could resurrect mean... no, that's a stretch. Necromancy it is, then.

So I need to take a Saddam and have him while naked and holding his wand face the cardinal direction from which Bush et al. approach - whenever that may be. Where to find a wizard named Saddam?

--------------

/Ding-dong/.

Oh, that'll be them! I change into my lead-lined hazmat suit and answer the door. "Hello! You'll be the Obliviators, then?"

They look confused, but realization and determination soon replaces their confusion. "Sir, we're just going to have to ask you some questions about your editorial in the weekend edition, then we'll be on our way."

I affect a moue of confusion, myself. "I'm sorry, I don't quit- ah! Of course. I forgot you think I'm a muggle. Haha - what a cock up that would be, eh?" I try to chuckle when I realize verbalizing the onomatopoeia 'Haha' isn't a convincing way to pretend at laughter.

"Yeah, listen, I'm actually muggleborn, Hogwarts class of '82 - my wife didn't take too kindly to the whole magic thing, and I agreed to put my wand in a locker while I warm her up to it a bit. I don't know where the magical area here is, even, haha." Darn - chuckle more, chuckle more... they're buying it, keep chuckl- okay too much, stop chuckling.

One relaxes his hand. "Happens to the best of us. My cousin moved to Germany; had the same thing happen to him. Made for a rough first few years. You're newly married?"

"No, will be a decade next year." They're chuckling, now! Chuckle at their pace, not too fast, not too little - damn I'm good at chuckling. "Anyway, sorry to bother you and all, but do you know a wizard named Saddam?"

The silent one looks to his partner and back, then nods.

"Great! If you wouldn't mind telling him to stop by any time in the next three weeks, I'd really appreciate it. I heard a prophecy that very clearly indicated he will die unless he does some rather silly things at a specific time."

"We'll be sure to pass along the message, sir. Have a good day, now, and if you need to contact us again, just head down to Ivers and Mounipe; there's a cobbled alley there. Head in to the dentist's to the alley's left."

"Thank you, and I'll remember that, thank you. Ivers and Mounipe, dentist to cobbled alley's left. No more editorials for me."

I close the door.

--------------

"Now turn... three degrees clockwise, Saddam! No, that's four! No, that's two! That's four again! There you go. Just stay like that for a couple hours. I'll make us some tea."

** /Batman v Superman/ is such a fart of a movie. My least favorite parts:

- Dream sequences all over the place.
- Batman indiscriminately killing people with a machine gun.
- Enormous plot holes.
- Unclear motivations from most of the central characters.
- Conflict that could have been cleared up by just talking about things for five seconds.
- Conflict that gets resolved in stupid ways.
- Interesting questions that get abandoned in favor of giant setpiece battles.
- Extremely poor tie-ins to future movies.
- Lois Lane saying, "Superman is many things, but he's not a killer". /Holy shit, are you fucking kidding me, he publicly killed Zod in the only other movie in this continuity./ He's a killer in the sense that he's killed someone, and he's a killer in the sense that he's proven himself capable of killing if there's a need for it. She is never called on this. I would accept this at a bad retcon if /B v S/ didn't have the events of /Man of Steel/ so central to it's piss-poor plot. It's not a retcon, it's just stupid.

I didn't go into the movie having high hopes, but it failed to live up to even my lowered standards. And I suppose in that way it was bad enough to be entertaining. Also, it had some good cinematography, so I guess that's nice.

**** I think you misunderstood several parts of the plot.

Lex Luthor didn't want to kill Superman because he was scary powerful. He had an ideological dislike of the idea of a "godlike", all-powerful being, and wanted to prove to the world that he was "either not all good, or not all-powerful". This is stupid, but he behaves reasonably in pursuit of this goal.

Superman does not have super-speed in this setting. I can see how you might have missed this in Man of Steel, but they explicitly had a scene where he wasn't fast enough to stop an explosion.

/Batman/ was the one who argued that Superman was too powerful to be allowed, a threat to everyone, etc. He has several scenes where he talks about his fear that Superman will snap, including an extended nightmare sequence.

Superman was looking for (following?) Batman because he didn't like him, not looking for Kryptonite (he has no idea it exists.)

Not a good idea to wield Kryptonite melee weapons near the guy who can vaporize/crush them. Better to depower him first. Not sure why he made a melee weapon in the first place, though, instead of say, a gun - maybe he doesn't like guns? Obvious explanation, but never established, plus he uses actual guns.

The time travel makes no sense and will never be referenced again, probably.

This film has a bunch of actual plot holes, obviously, but I wouldn't say the characters are incoherent, and I enjoyed it.

That was my guess, but it's awfully clumsy. Like "we need a scene where Batman steals the kryptonite, oh and also a scene where Batman and Superman have an early tussle, and oh god will you look at the runtime, let's make it the same scene. Oh and Batman is going to need that kryptonite, so we'll have to spend a quick shot to undo the outcome of that fight."

***** I might do a similar review for /Civil War/. I have a nasty feeling it's going to be really quite bad (while still having good moments, given the beloved characters and such.)

The central conflict stems from Iron Man, who has spent his films running his own personal military interventions and vigorously defending his right to do so from the government, fighting Captain America, a man empowered by the government using secret government science because he was such an incredible patriot, who has worked for the government almost continuously since that day (his childhood dream,) and whose only break with the government has been because he (correctly) felt SHIELD weren't receiving sufficient oversight ... except Iron Man is fighting to make superheroes work for the government, and Captain America is fighting to let them do whatever the hell they like. Also, much like the comics, Iron Man's side is clearly correct but Cap's side will clearly be treated by the narrative as the "heroes"* (and, unlike the comic, will probably win.)

This does not seem conductive to a character-driven narrative.

*[EDIT: this was an accident in the comic, according to the authors. Iron Man was /supposed/ to be a hero going too far in a good cause, not the villain. There's a reason the comic isn't exactly well-liked.]

I mean even if Cap wins, why don't they just shoot them? They're all humans mostly.

- Run the exe on a computer connected to the internet, but not connected to the machine.
- If nothing has stopped you from entering 0 after a month do it. Then use get a replacement program from the best universe.

Giving the example between getting Flash's speed force and Lex Luthor's intelligence, which would be better? I argue that even if Luthor got the means to harness the speedforce, it could be limited by being too expensive to be affordable perhaps requiring exotic materials or beyond the technology of our era, take several years to develop it or just being deemed impossible.

Meanwhile Flash speed would allow to directly break those physical limitations and a character with it would thus be able to achieve a greater intelligence by using the timespan required by the character with superintelligence on iterative methods and enhancing his brain. He would be limited by the perspectives and flexibility of his mind but may be able to reach superintelligence iteratively.

This thought came from the search for limitations on the capabilities of a genius rational character on a story. Its said that sufficiently advanced science is indistinguishable from magic, but can it really break the laws of nature? I think it could only find a way around them and be limited by the costs and resources required to achieve the same effects.

Thoughts?

*** Depends on which Luthor and which Flash.

As you say, several DC characters have successfully harnessed the Speedforce using handwavium (mostly Batman and Flash villains), so sufficient intellect might be enough to get you both with a bit of prep time. It all depends on the setting.

On the other hand, quite a few versions of Flash have considerable mental enhancements; the current one [[http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11115/111159554/3983771-3304356-bfr1.jpg][can use his "speed mind" to accurately simulate the universe several years into the future]] and [[http://imgur.com/a/C1fhN#3][perform path-to-victory]].

There's really no right answer here. But personally, I'd go with the Flash - Luthor's plans always fail, so whatever he has going on that lets him build death rays can't be that useful.

**** Indeed. Not to mention that Luthor's superpowers are superintelligence and being rich. He requires quite the amount of resources to fund his experiments and technology in his crusade to beat the man of steel and in some incarnations he took years building his business.

An individual with Flash's power due to not being limited by physics could accumulate wealth faster by doing many jobs simultaneously (provided he also doesn't tire faster due to Speedforce) and, if amoral, can simply steal the things he needs.

The files even still have their original ID numbers, so that you can look them up in the Naxos catalog and find the albums that include them. (More-recent [[http://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza][Paradox]] games have less-voluminous (but still pretty good) original soundtracks composed by [[http://www.andreaswaldetoft.com][Andreas Waldetoft]].)

/[[http://store.steampowered.com/app/221380][Age of Empires 2]]/ has a pretty fun soundtrack. I like the original game's ten tunes, as well as the first tune in the /The Age of Conquerors/ expansion (included in the base version of the linked Steam re-release), but I have little liking for the other nine /Conquerors/ tunes, and I've bothered to copy only six tracks from the /[[http://store.steampowered.com/app/266840][Age of Mythology]]/ soundtrack out of the game folder.

I'm not sure I see how a system of codenames can experience success or failure. However, the system of friendship (without scarequotes) that I was using at the time was fairly successful. It essentially was the same as my later "friendship" system, but with three members (including me and the people who later would become "Friends" One and Two--then referred to as Demigoddess and Demigod) rather than two, and with no recordkeeping. (This method was made convenient by Facebook's "Group Messaging" feature, which allowed each conversation thread containing three or more people to be separate from the others as its own "Group Message".)\\
This arrangement collapsed after the person later known as "Friend" One temporarily (for several months) stopped responding, for unknown reasons. IIRC (my memory is fuzzy here), I continued interacting with "Friend" Two for some time before finally instituting the more-organized "friendship" system, into which One was inducted later on.

If it is possible for entities to lie to us and make us believe the lie by force (or even without force, if we have no way to make an informed guess as to whether a statement is a lie or not), then no, we don't.

Like, say you devise a strategy A that works perfectly against a disutility ratchet X. Then I just introduce another entity Y that says the same things X says, but will, when confronted with strategy A, destroy the world.

When entities can lie about what they'll do, then no strategy is safe.
