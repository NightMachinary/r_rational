** It's actually kinda crappy, but I still read it for some reason.

I don't like when it says "games has this and this thing" like it's some universal law and I have never seen anything like that. Like in chapter 6, "There is something called wall-hitting in games. Monsters won't attack you if you have a wall behind your back."

It would be way better if the character said there is this thing in a game he plays and checks if it works here, but that shouldn't work too often either.

The guy is a bit stupid too. Continuing school feels pretty stupid when he doesn't have to actually study anymore, it's mostly a waste of time he could use grinding and he could meet the guys elsewhere.

His friend says stupid stuff too, like in chapter 8, "If you want to live a normal life, don't train your ability anymore. If you plan on training, be prepared or else you might be killed." He has lots of stuff he can train without anyone noticing. And getting stronger makes it harder to kill you.

And he said you'll get killed if you win a lottery with your powers, but apparently his family can win all the sports competitions they want.

He should also really talk to his mother...

He's also said to be addicted to gaming, but how many times have we seen him play any?

The sister of the friend in chapter 10 checks if he is a fake with a hit that should crush his bones...

I did like that the guy started with melee before going to magic.

Another thing like this is Tate No Yuusha No Yariagari. It's actually a novel, but it has manga too, but the novel is way further. I think writing might work better for these kinds of works. The writing is a bit crappy both in that and the gamer, though.

edit: also, dlc? seriously?

Although I do want to clarify that I wasn't being literal. He can pretty easily attain vast-to-infinite power if he really dedicated himself to it. Maybe not literal godhood.

As most games have a power curve sensibly limited by diminishing returns and level caps, no, this is not a road to godhood.

****** Or it works on something closer to Disgaea rules.

You can beat those games with levels in the early hundreds. But the level cap is 9999, and if you know what you're doing it actually gets easier to level as time goes on, so your gains are exponential.

****** Most games that spring to mind to me are exponential in their returns. At level 10 you do 100 damage, at level 50 you do 8000 and at 99 you do multiple attacks each doing 99999.

******* Or you play a game like Disgaea where it starts showing damage in millions/billions(276.34Bn! 23.47Tn!) to keep there from being too many numbers on screen.

I need exponents to show how much damage I do. Though, numbers that high are only really feasible by stacking modifiers really high.

******* Diminishing returns in levels gained through grinding. The ineffectiveness of staying where you are with the same enemies diminishes because they either net the same XP per kill while the to-level requirement grows, or the XP per kill gained shrinks to nothing. Sometimes both. It's a mechanical approach to encourage progression in the game.

*** If you want an evil gaming genius, try Mewgle from Brave New World by Ri2. He's a clone of mew who loves games and he's one of the most powerful demons in the series, AND he nearly succeeded in usurping the big bad "ruler of evil" Deoxys himself, and almost turned all reality into an RPG in a prior incarnation of the Omniverse. But he was stopped by Ash's squirtle, Leonardo, who used his cool superpowered sunglasses to see through Mewgle's plan, and break everyone free of the virtual reality they had been trapped in without realizing it. Mewgle and Leo became arch enemies and reincarnated many times, fighting countless battles over the eons.

Long story. Literally.

In other news, if you're the author of Roll the Dice on Fate (some subtle clues are hinting towards that) I'm loving it so far.

At it's most basic level the plot is the plot of Paper Mario: The thousand year door, but set in the world of Pokémon Mystery Dungeon Red/Blue rescue team and [[#s][spoiler]] There's more to it than that though. It's really epic and I highly recommend it.
