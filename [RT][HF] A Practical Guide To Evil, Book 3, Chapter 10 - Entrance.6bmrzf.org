** Masego is the best.

  ‚ÄúThat doesn't sound good,‚Äù Apprentice said. ‚ÄúI suppose it's a good thing we have you along.‚Äù

  I glanced at him.

  ‚ÄúWhat's that supposed to mean?‚Äù

  ‚ÄúYou're very good at murdering our opposition,‚Äù he said, genuinely believing he was giving me a compliment.

  I occasionally forgot Masego had been raised by villains. For him that probably counted as praise.

  ‚ÄúYou don't know for sure I'm going to kill someone,‚Äù I said.

  ‚ÄúNot gonna lie, I'll be disappointed if we don't,‚Äù Archer noted.

  ‚ÄúI've done diplomacy before,‚Äù I continued.

  ‚ÄúI don't think extorting the High Lords counts,‚Äù Apprentice said.

  ‚ÄúOr looting that angel,‚Äù Hakram added.

  ‚ÄúI think bullied might be more accurate,‚Äù Masego said.

  ‚ÄúIf you guys keep this up I can guarantee you someone's getting killed,‚Äù I said.

  ‚ÄúThat's the spirit,‚Äù Apprentice said, patting my shoulders. ‚ÄúNow let's move along, Catherine, we're blocking the way. You really need to pay more attention to your surroundings.‚Äù

  He strode into the hall before I could come up with a reply, still gaping.

*** He really is. Masego also seems pretty loyal to Cat despite being an immoral monster. I hope we have several side stories involving him.

Is he immoral or amoral? I think he leans more toward the latter. He has little in the way of a conscience, but I don't think he purposely sets out to do terrible things. Just to learn... which may lead to terrible things, but hey! For +Science!+ Knowledge!

** I am now 100% on the "Archer joins the cause" train. She's a delight. Even has the sass of the fifteenth down.

*** Yep. It's going to be fun to get to know her more. She still seems like a bit of an enigma at the moment. I do wonder why she's joining Cat and whether Ranger asked her to.

***** Only four? Honestly I'm not sure where to stop counting with Robber, Juniper, Alisha, and Ratface all having important roles. But I think you're right for the core team.

******* Yeah, good point. During the last book I was thinking Robber has a chance of a name. But this book no so much.

******** Book just started. Also Robber is spreading his fame as a marauder amongst the highborn traveling to Liesse.

He's also something of a legend amongst his own people as being "extra" crazy.
