Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** There is some potential for crazy shenanigans on the horizon.

You can buy a home CRISPR kit now: [[http://www.the-odin.com/diy-yeast-crispr-kit/]]

And there is a 3D printing "open source laboratory equipment" movement building to help supply 3rd world hospitals: [[http://www.appropedia.org/Open-source_Lab]]

At some point in the near future (5 years?) it will be pretty feasible to set up your own private lab with an expensive 3d printer and use easily acquirable reagents like from Sigma-Aldrich or similar to essentially conduct your own biotech experiments or replicate those recorded in the literature/patents.

I have no idea how this will be regulated but hopefully someone smarter than me has already thought of this because there would be some risk for exponential harm to ecology if, for example, someone uses documented methods to reproduce a GM crop without putting in terminator genes to sterilise the seeds. You could have super competitive, insect and pesticide resistant crops let loose to outgrow anything else, potentially hybridising those traits with other species of plants once in the wild and irreversibly changing the world we live in.

Someone is going to try using CRISPR or similar on themselves. Try to change their eye colour or something.

I predict many scary stories of "mad scientists up to no good in their basements" in the media sometime soon.

Edit: now with fewer superlatives.

*** I feel like the mad scientists don't belong in quotes. Sure it's a bad name for it, but this is seriously something that should be scary. Something I've thought about a lot recently is that there's kind of a built in assumption about the way a lot of us think about the future that the power to prevent destruction (the powers of stability) will at a minimum of scale as fast as the power to do harm. The problem is that I can think of nothing that actually means this has to be true.

For example imagine tomorrow we discover a way to using only transistors, capacitors, etc and household AC to produce anti-mater in meaningful amounts also imagine we have some way to contain it. Obviously none of this has happened or will happen but ignoring physics there's no reason it couldn't happen and something like it certainly could.

What would this discover do to the world? I'd posit humanity would be pretty much gone within 10 years. Luckily anti-mater isn't and can't be that easy to make or contain, but what if it becomes that easy to make a super virus? What if it becomes that easy to build von neumann machine? I'm kind of scared to think that we might live in a world where anyone of moderate wealth can build something with a level of destructive potential inline with a nuke. The world is already getting cheaper and cheaper to destroy. It took the US an insane amount of resources to figure out how to build a nuke. Now regardless of politics it looks like Iran could have made one on a fraction of the budget.

What do we do when the budget needed gets down about 100k?

** Work has officially begun on my boat.

Whoever last worked on it did a pretty bad job. There are holes in the roof that aren't seeled well enough, and that's letting water in between the fiberglass layers.

I'd like to document the process. I like tumblr, because of its "ask" feature. But there's so much else I dislike about it. Basically every way they do things rubs me the wrong way.

I guess I have 3 options

- Create my own blog platform

- Use my old wordpress blog (traverseda.wordpress.com)

- Use tumblr

Ultimately my goal is to build a record showing that I'm experienced with this kind of thing. In the longer term, I'd like to help people move onto boats, which should be a lot more practical with oneweb.

Boats are a good way to experiment with alternative economies/governance. A lot of the technology developed should help with colonizing less hospitable environments. Like space, and deserts, and earth is some of the pretty-bad predictions about global warming are true.

** *Exercise*

In previous attempts at exercising, I've never lost weight; never gained in strength or dexterity; never even gotten a second wind. I've never met any significant exercise goals. But in the long-term, exercise is still worthwhile. So I'm trying something new: Changing my self-conception to Someone Who Exercises Daily. No expectations of any gains, rewards, or second winds. Just someone who slogs through the painful routine each day, every day.

I've picked a routine that can be done anywhere, with no equipment: Burpees, in descending sets (ie, for 15, do 5, 4, 3, 2, 1; for non-triangular numbers, add at the start, ie for 17, do 7, 6, 3, 2, 1), adding 1 per day. (Supposedly, burpees work all the major parts of the body, etc, etc.) If-and-when I make it to 30-descending, I'll consider changing it up.

Today: Did 5 burpees.

Also today: Set up [[https://twitter.com/DPR_exercise]] to semi-publicly keep track. (Or, as an RSS feed, [[http://twitrss.me/twitter_user_to_rss/?user=dpr_exercise]] .)

As part of my attempt at changing my self-concept, I'm making a somewhat public precommitment to performing the acts that my modified persona should be doing. Ie, I intend to post to that Twitter account each day as I finish that day's exercise; and by having publicly posted the existence of the account, there is now a theoretical possibility that an unknown number of people on the internet will be watching that account, and at least in certain dark parts of my subconscious, there is the possibility of silent social disapproval if I fail to live up to my stated standard. (I often use the 'elephant and mahout' model of the mind, with the elephant as the subconscious. I'm hoping that this particular trick will act as one more whack on the elephant's hide to nudge it into moving the way I-the-mahout want it to move; and if not, the cost was writing some text, which is well within my budget.)

There is so much information, and misinformation, about exercise, with so many people saying various mutually-contradictory versions of "everyone's body works /this/ way, so obviously you should exercise like /this/", and so little way for me to verify any of it on my limited budget, that I'm kind of used to being told that "you're doing it wrong", without any way to respond.

I've bicycled. I've walked-for-exercise. I've calisthenesed. I've worn weights. I've tried a few things I don't recall offhand. I can't afford a gym membership, or a trainer, or personal equipment, which places some limits on what those unrecalled routines might have been.

#+end_quote

I'm trying to work not directly on improving my body, but on altering my mindset to lead to behaviour that, one day, may lead to an improved body. One of the key mental thingummmies in question is motivation. Historically, and very similarly to other people, if I have a specific goal in mind when I start exercising, and fail to meet that goal, I've tended to become discouraged, not see the exercise as worth the effort, and give it up. With a bit of Zen-like mental judo, however, if I go into an exercise program without any such expectations, then there will be nothing to be discouraged about, and I'm thus more likely to continue exercising to the point where some gains actually result.

***** I hear you about the tons of contradictory information out there. There is, like with almost everything, no silver bullet. A lot of the contradictions come, however, from the different goals and ideals that people implicitly project on you when advising. If people assume that you want to look pumped up, then they are going to recommend completely different things than if they assume you want to be able to do a handstand or run a marathon or hold your straight leg over your head.

On top of that, everyone's bodies indeed do not work in exactly the same way, so optimal routines will vary greatly from person to person. Still, people's bodies work quite similarly to each other. Even though a specialized program tailored just for you will be much more efficient, a generic approach still will take you miles compared to doing nothing or doing something that is not expected to work.

As you have pointed out, the motivation is perhaps the most important part of it all. Yes, you will not have immediate results. Yes, you will end up falling ill or otherwise being unable to train for some periods of time, and all your hard-won progress will disappear. You will have to get back up and KEEP PUSHING.

It is unfortunate that a personal trainer is not an option for you, as that would really be an excellent way to kickstart your process. Here are some generic points that should help you in the long run (in no particular order, but numbered for easier reference)

1. You have to learn how your body works. You have to understand the process of how the food that you eat allows you to do burpees and how doing the burpees may or may not help you burn fat or build muscle. There are many sources online, e.g. this one: [[https://knowledge.freeletics.com/en/understanding-metabolism-impacts-training-results/]] (the whole knowledge base is quite good).
2. Treat your goals not as goals but as predictions. If your predictions fail to come true, then either your understanding of how your body works is incorrect, or you did not train as hard as you planned to or otherwise did not follow the plan. Like with all failure, do not get disappointed. Treat it as a learning experience.
3. You are going to mispredict lots and lots and lots of times. Do not fall victim to the Dunning--Kruger effect, it is not simple.
4. Aim to do better than you did last time. Not just in the number of repetitions or weight, but also in the elapsed time. If it took you 10 seconds (or 10 minutes) to do 5 burpees today, make sure that tomorrow, you do 5 burpees at least one second faster. Sometimes you will fail at that. Do not let that get you down and keep pushing.
5. Mind the nutrition. If you want to lose weight, consume less than you burn. If you want to gain weight, consume more than you burn. Mind what you eat, not just how much. Learn the basics of human nutrition. Again, there is a lot of helpful stuff here: [[https://knowledge.freeletics.com/en/nutrition/]] (Note: I am not affiliated with freeletics, although I endorse them)
6. Sleep well.

****** I mean, trivially speaking, 100% of people are immune to exercise for a given value of exercise and "pre-training" physique. I exercise 2-3 times a week (powerlifting/strongman/gymnastics type stuff for 1-1.5 hours) and am decently active-ish on my rest days (I'll walk around 5-10mi a day on average, maybe go on a 1-3 mi run a few times a week, often engage in vigorous... other activities, and bike/paddle/swim/climb/hike/wrestle/etc. on the weekends), but have pretty much plateaued given my current "training" volume and intensity. No matter how long I keep at what I'm currently doing, I won't be running 4:30 mile, or lifting a 6/5/4 plate dead/squat/bench, or sending a >5.12, etc. in the foreseeable future. None of those things are terribly unique or exceptional accomplishments, and I could probably get to some of them if I really optimized for performance in those activities, but despite, by all accounts, "exercising" fairly regularly, I've reached a point where progress is slow and fleeting.

Likewise, individuals who are fresh out of a coma or zero-G outer-space or paralysis or a full body cast or whatever will get fabulous results from exercise consisting of walking a few hundred feet around the block. Individuals who are sedentary but otherwise healthy will see their "noob-gains" from that sort of thing dry up pretty fast unless they progressively overload their neighborhood stroll (or whatever it is they're doing; skimming some of the referenced papers, one's abstract states that "on the other hand, the initial level of a phenotype is a major determinant of training response for some traits, such as submaximal exercise heart rate and blood pressure (BP) but has only a minor effect on others (e.g., VO2max, HDL-C)." No shit!).

20% of people are also immune to learning! I determined this by making individuals across a range of ages practice their ABCs, and a large subset of them did not improve in their writing ability. Even when isolating that subset, no dose-dependent response was observed, and not a one went on to pen the next great American classic. In fact, past a certain point, /100%/ of everyone ever was immune to learning. Hot damn, alert the presses! It's like people don't realize you need to adjust as you go (for both exercise and diet -- if you're losing metabolically active tissue that you hitherto had to carry around, guess what, your metabolism changes!) when things are changing for them to keep changing (at least when it comes to physical activity).

Anyway, sorry for ranting. I guess my point is that, outside of anime characters, /everyone/ has "a gene that prevents people from growing muscles beyond a certain point but doesn't put them in hospital". Everyone hits their limit (given a current level of stimulus) somewhere.

I can see the above being the case. Although I believe, if I read that comment correctly, the 5-20% was gleaned from looking at each individual study. As opposed to an aggregate (which he mentions would be difficult to do) And there's also a lack of mention of weight loss.

So I think saying 5-20% of the population is immune to exercise is a borderline facetious statement on its own. It doesn't really make sense either, barring conditions that make exercise extremely unsafe/impossible. Your body needs fuel. The more you use, the more you'll need. That's practically inviolable.

**** For one, in all my reading, I haven't come across the concept of 'immune to exercise' before, and it doesn't match up with my understanding of biology. Do you have handy any references thereon?

For another - starting exercising is just one sub-plan of a larger overall plan I'm working on. Put one way, the larger goal is to become an Actually Competent Person(TM), capable of protecting and promoting my values in various future situations I'm increasing my estimates of. There are certain characteristics that I expect such a ACP(TM) to possess, and which I'm starting to look into new methods of acquiring.

Put another way, I'm aiming to be a person of the same approximate realm as a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competent_man][Heinleinian protagonist]]. (Without the negative implications.)

Put yet another way, I want to be a person who you would be willing to destructively upload from cryopreservation into the state of an em.

None of these examples quite cover the target zone I'm trying to describe, partly because I'm still developing my understanding of what my target goal would require of me. But all of them seem to involve being willing to perform physical exercise with no visible results therefrom.

More specifically, I've recently been sorting my ebooks with the Dewey Decimal System, and have realized that I currently can't even provide proper definitions for any of the subheadings of 512 (ie, 512.2 is groups and group theory, 512.3 is fields, 512.4 is rings, integral domains, and ideals). (Come to think of it, Heinlein had a comment on this one, too: "Anyone who cannot cope with mathematics is not fully human. At best he is a tolerable subhuman who has learned to wear shoes, bathe, and not make messes in the house.") It would be nice to be able to understand the videos of [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw/videos?flow=grid&sort=da&view=0][3Blue1Brown]] intuitively rather than having to struggle on any given concept.

Another goal is to improve on my weak areas instead of reinforcing a strength. I am something of a classic nerd, in that my social skills are lacking, which means that I am not very good at communicating my point of view to random people, let alone persuading them of it. Possible specific items here may include rhetoric, drama, dance, music, and developing an artist's eye. Not all at once, as I'm not even where I can start learning on some of these, but as of today, I can start carrying a harmonica and practicing with it in spare moments to start getting some of the fundamentals of breathing and embrasure down.

Some other particular items may include learning sign language, French (necessary to understand my country's federal politics very well), another spoken language, Morse code, and one or more programming/scripting languages; various driver's licensing; trying to gain certifications in first aid; swimming; and any number of other specific skills that don't come to mind offhand. I suppose I could pull out my GURPS rulebook and splatbooks for ideas :) , but honestly, even just figuring out how to improve myself in the ideas I've mentioned in this comment so far is likely to fill up my time for some time to come.

And now, I'm off to start my "what can I start work on improving /today/" by reading a book or two on harmonicas, picking something from [[https://www.harptabs.com/songlist.php?DisplayBy=view][here]] as an initial tune to work towards not being obviously terrible at playing, and figuring out where I can go to make awful noises on one without bothering anyone. :)

I often use a certain site which lets me sort via a popularity statistic Amazon doesn't cover. We're getting a touch off-topic, though, and should switch to PMs if you want to talk more about it.

**** I've wondered about exercise immunity for strength. When people are in a coma, [[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25296344][their muscles will atrophy]]. If exercise-immune muscles don't respond to the exertion asked of them, then we'd expect exercise-immune people to waste away like a person in a coma, but that doesn't happen. They can still stand and walk and do the things a normal sedentary person can.

(Of course, there'll be a spectrum in how much strength people gain from exercise, and maybe it won't be very worthwhile for people at the low end. Testosterone level is known to associate with gains from exercise, and that can be altered if people want.)

** Man, for as much as I read (that's a lot a lot, like regularly reading 200,000+ word fanfics), I have NO idea how to critique my own writing. Sure, I can do technical edits here and there, and improve phrasing and whatnot. But beyond that it's foreign to me.

*** I've thought about ways to become better at critiquing my own writing, and realized that it comes down to appropriately modeling how readers would respond to it.

Which I feel like I'm /absolutely terrible/ at.

A general mass of strangers isn't so bad, but individuals are complicated. Modeling my friends isn't too hard in most circumstances. But when it comes to book recommendations or what aspects of stories they like most... I can give a rough estimate of whether most will like or dislike a story, but the oddest things always catch me by surprise. Things that might bring me close to tears they might find tacky, or vice-versa.

For example, I recommended Worm to my step-brother. I thought he'd love it. He did... until he reached the interlude with the Travelers backstory and stopped reading. He said the interlude was just so frustrating to get through that he'd rather not finish Worm.

I don't grok that. It's just outside my mental model of what a reasonable person's response would be. Like, I understand that he just doesn't enjoy the interlude's characters or plot, that's fine. I enjoyed that interlude myself, but I can see why it would be annoying to someone who just wants to get back to the main story. But to dislike it so much that he'd rather just stop reading than even just skip it, despite my assurances that he can without ruining the rest of the story?

I just don't get that. I updated my model of him accordingly upon finding that out, but the existence of such bizarre (to me) perspectives makes it hard for me to critique my own story from readers-like-his perspective. Am I writing interludes so offputting that some people are just going to stop reading? I hope not, but my step-brother is a live example that this is the way some people work, and I don't understand why enough to stop my own story from hitting those same problems, other than "don't make them too long." My interludes are just a chapter long, so hopefully that's not too bad, but it's still a worry of mine.

I think getting better at critiquing your own work comes from receiving lots of detailed critiques from individuals and keeping each in mind as a lens through which to critique your future work. Blending common feedback together from anonymous readers is useful too for sure, but that's not as dynamic.

**** Thank you very much for this. I get what you're saying with regards to the difficulty in modelling individuals. There's certain somewhat-meta aspects of games and stories (namely, Undertale and Homestuck) that I really enjoy that brings other people out of the narrative.

Basically, what I'm getting from this is to just keep writing and eventually, when I'm comfortable with the quality of my writing through my own ham-handed editing to publish it and integrate feedback. Which is reasonable and obvious enough, I suppose. :p

***** Also consider finding up to three people who can act as volunteer editors, giving you early feedback /before/ you post it publicly.

I don't write much prose, but it's very useful to be able to bounce ideas off someone throughout the process... and it can be painful if you polish something before people have a change to give the basic feedback.

That's about the size of it, yeah :) Unlike a lot of professions, writers don't often have teachers or mentors, especially not individual ones. We learn from the writers we read, and the readers of what we write.

There's only so far you can go on your own, and coalescing all that information into actionable changes in how we practice our craft is a tougher challenge than in other activities that have more tangible and objective metrics, which means the more open you can make the channels of communication between yourself and readers, whether friends/family who are willing to beta or reviewers online, the better. Publishing authors have the advantage of a dedicated editor to go over their work with a fine-toothed comb and help iterate draft after draft, and to make up for our lack of that, we need to expose our work to strangers and listen to what they have to say.

It's an interesting topic, and we'll probably do a Rationally Writing episode on feedback and integrating it sometime soon :)

**** Another option is read the stories of others, make your own critique of the story, read the published critiques of those stories and then try to find similar flaws in your own work that you can improve on.

***** I like betaing fanfic for similar reasons. I notice the author doing something that feels wrong, tell them off, then realize I'm doing it myself and need to go fix my writing.
