A common rational fic theme is that of a protagonist who spends his time learning the rules of his universe and then exploiting them to effectively change the world. Yes, we use our knowledge of science, tools, etc to change the world but so far in our history it's been slow going(although certainly accelerating within the past few centuries). But no real world breakers on the scale of shadow clone batteries, infinite money exploits, insta-win techniques, or felix felices. Is the something basically different about worlds we can imagine and the world that we live in that makes ours real?

Is it conceivable that tomorrow a scientist will do the real life equivalent of putting a portable hole in a bag of holding and suddenly the world goes kaput or we end scarcity? Is there a reason our reality is world-break resistant, or is it just that we haven't done it yet?

Edit- I probably should have titled this post, why isn't reality world-breakable?

Edit 2- Comments have made me realize I hadn't refined my question enough before posting it. Thank you for the discussion. Here is the latest iteration.

What characteristics of possible realities(or story worlds) contribute to ease or difficulty of world breaking exploitation?"


** In addition to what's already been mentioned, the reason there /are/ all these very powerful exploits in fictional worlds that fanfic protagonists can munchkin is that often in fiction the author takes humans or something roughly human that can do things we can do in reality and adds abilities (magic, ninjutsu, futuretech, whatever) on top of that. Those abilities are going to be something extra that in many cases is going to be easy to munchkin because millions of people haven't already spent their entire lives trying to break them - only the author has spent a couple years of his or her life trying to plug the most obvious gaps, if even that.

I suppose that a certain number of agents of roughly equivalent intelligence working on exploits eventually reaches an equilibrium when the fruit within their grasp is taken. Then it takes a collective effort as has been enabled by information spreading technologies(printing press, internet etc) and the improved methodologies to begin standing on one another's shoulders to reach the higher fruits we're grasping now.

I tried to think of a real world example. The best one was "human-level intelligence". And sure enough, the humans went and "took over the world", bending it to suit their preferences. It's a single superpower we've munchkined into doing all /sorts/ of things.

*** Not only that. The way you munchkin reality is basically "science", but /science itself is a technology/---just like "the checklist" and "the calendar" are technologies---and it has, itself, advanced over time.

The "scientific method" is easily described, but /science/ is not. /Science/ is constantly expanding: double-blind experiments, replicated studies, statistical analyses (itself a huge swath of technologies, including things like "excluding outliers" and "deriving significance" and "predictive power"), causal models, longitudinal studies, simulations, and even things as simple as /clean rooms/ and /writing down predictions in advance./

If a person from 3000BCE somehow put themselves into "the scientific mindset", they might be able to realize that "experiments can teach you things!"---but they wouldn't have any of these tools. They'd be like the Ancient Greeks, thinking they could [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/nf/the_parable_of_hemlock/][prove Socrates "into" being mortal]], or /think out/ whether the building blocks of matter are water or fire or quintessence. "Be empirical" isn't a helpful thought to think if you don't first think a bunch of other things, like "there is an objective reality" and "Cartesian dualism is false; /everything/ in my causal model exists within the world accessible to my senses", and "knowledge cannot be immoral", and "things that would be more surprising if true are more worth finding out", and so forth.

Now, if you could take /today's/ scientific process and bring it back to 3000BCE, it would be very easy to discover tons of things very quickly and turn them into a workable "bootstrap" for Becoming God (relative to 3000BCE people.) But people 5000 years ago would no more be able to implement the prerequisites for the "technology" of science than they would, say, the "technology" of modern sanitation. Their /thinking/ would be all wrong for it. You wouldn't be able to /explain/ it to them without basically requiring they live their lives over in the modern day. (Look at early alchemy for an example of some people trying to explain chemistry, and other people not understanding and receiving the words as cargo-cult mysticism: the /subjects/ get held as sacred, but the /process/ is mostly discarded as unimportant, or only performed with specific subjects for ritual significance rather than with /arbitrary/ subjects as a method of /learning things./)

**** Well, we do, but it just becomes part of the background.

Take the example of the infinite money hack. Let's say that I figure out a way to make gold out of a cheap, common ore. Well, what happens? I become rich! Well, I become rich if I can keep the innovation to myself, which I probably can't. But in either case, the market then adjusts, gold becomes common, and things change. A hundred years later no one really thinks about it; that gold was a precious metal is a historical footnote.

This really happened, by the way, just not with gold. Instead, it was [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_process][the Bayer process]] of turning bauxite into alumnia which is then turned into aluminum by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall%E2%80%93H%C3%A9roult_process][the Hall-HÃ©roult process]] (invented at nearly the same time). Fifty years before that, aluminum was more expensive than gold or platinum and one of the precious metals. Bars of aluminum were proudly displayed by royalty and Napoleon had a prized set of aluminum cutlery. The Washington Monument was given an aluminum cap!

Today, aluminum is used for cans of soda. We make airplanes and fishing boats out of it. Children use bats made of the stuff to play games. Aluminum trades at $0.70/lb while gold is something like $16000/lb. Yet this is now just the way of the world and few people remark on it.

Since you put that one in as goal for "breaking reality" -Western world civs have, for some intents and purposes and certainly compared to the historical standard of human living, ended scarcity. Look up cargo cults...

Productivity is still going up at a steady rate (though some argue that we are in a great innovation stagnation atm). We are just at the beginning of the wet nano/biotech boom. Cost for solar energy is in free fall. Cost/development of drones is in freefall. We already have drones that do nothing but care for solar parks.

As far as some previously very very rare and scare products are concerned, we have done it and abolished their scarcicity completely. These are music/books/information, copyable at the low low low cost of electricity it costs your PC to run the copy instruction. If you had told someone from the 17th century that instead of paying to find,train and support an entire village of maybe 50 musicians to play great symphonic orchestras, you now need to work 3 hours in a drudge type job to get a 20$ mp3-player.

Today a laptop with specialized software, total worth of maybe $5k allows you to compose music and listening to it right away. It still takes talent, but the entry cost is now significantly lower.

- 300 years ago we started inventing really significant machines.\\
- 50 years ago we put a guy on the moon.\\
- 30 years ago we invented a world-wide repository of all human knowledge.\\
- 10 years ago we invented always-available access to all human knowledge (smartphone), and also the ability to always know where you are in relation to anything (GPS).
- 5 years ago we invented a 3D bioprinter

***** It feels to me that abstract language engaged our brains enough to take us most of the way to being intelligent, but being "rational" or "sane" by modern standards is a product of writing---and especially of the printing press and its effects on the /accumulation/ of knowledge over time, and thereby the /expectation/ of knowledge.

Shamanism used to be a thing---a respected role in tribal society for people who "think differently" to play. People in biblical times seemed to still be not-all-there, frequently prone to hallucinations and manias that they thought of as apotheoses---God speaking through them---and other people just /accepted/ this idea, again treating these people with reverence. People would explain the world in terms of their subjective reality, and /seek/ subjective experiences that diverged greatly from the mundane---because this was how you found your spiritual self. In fact, "reality" was thought of as the illusion; the divergent subjective experience as the tearing-away of a veil.

It seems like this mode of thought went on in much the same way in nearly every culture (excluding, interestingly, each culture's equivalent to ascetic monks) until pretty much the Enlightenment. After that, people began expecting one-another to be increasingly well-read and school-taught; to be able to engage with the "fashions" of an intellectual culture that just rose and rose in prerequisite knowledge. And this forced an agreement that "objective reality" was now the good: it was what people could agree on enough to argue about, and it was those debates that informed thinking and culture more generally. The average person was expected---required---to be "sane" to participate. The touched were now rejects, rather than respected, because they couldn't engage with the ongoing intellectual discourse; and the public now saw clarity of perception of "truth" as the desirable state, with divergent subjective experience relegated to counterculture.

(Unless, like lead, it's the exposure to these things over time or at a certain age that causes the real problem; in which case each improved sanitation policy would show up as a longitudinal change in the first generation to never be exposed to the regulated vector. A constant stream of these policies could add up to a smooth curve as a child born in each further year is exposed to fewer and fewer vectors.

Writers tend to be willing to go a bit beyond what they consider reasonable (which is most likely already optimistic by itself) with the intent of making the story more interesting.

In real life, munchkining can and does happen, but most of the low-hanging fruit has already been claimed, so to speak. What's left typically requires a group effort involving specialists from multiple disciplines and million to billion dollar budgets to make it happen. It may have only taken a single smart homo ergaster to harness fire, but nuclear weapons required the Manhattan Project.

** It is worth noting that fictional universes, when they diverge from our own, tend towards differences that are interesting and exploitable from the perspective of our own value system, further refined through our tastes and sense of ideas needed to be expressed. Where they are coherent enough to define, this forms a very, /very/ small subspace of possible realities.

** Obviously the first answer is we did. Westerners conquered and colonized most of the world with their superior technology. Oxygen using microorganisms killed most anaerobic ones. Numerous lifeforms have become dominant across the planet at one time or another.

The second answer is that the universe obeys logistic growth, not exponential growth. When some new trick is found and some group rapidly expands and spreads they eventually hit some new boundary like amount of food or land space and stop growing. Multiple realities or planets make world exploitation easier.

The third answer is the complexity and social context of technology. To make more advanced science and technology there's a complex chain web of requirements around it, which is required for new things to work.

The fourth answer is copying tech. Scientists leave nations, scientists get captured, any world breaking tech gets copied soon enough. You can get a temporary advantage, but it'll vanish after a couple years.

The fifth answer is that the world is really big. If you produce some toxic gas it'll just kill a few people around you, not everything. Good technology use requires a large group working together to do it and overcome barriers to it's use. No single scientist can make much of a change to the world.

The sixth answer is that the universe is old. Oxygen got around, most of the rocks around are fairly stable and we can't do much with them. Most of the radioactive particles are done with. Nothing big sciency is going to happen without a lot of work.

** To your second edit - the most important characteristic of a reality or story that would contribute to the ease of world breaking exploitation is the intelligence/power gap between the protagonist and the other characters, as well as his ability to influence others. A powerful new discovery, whether in itself world breaking or not, obviously amplifies the effect of the former elements.

For example, if someone that was incredibly more intelligent that most of the people in the world (multiple times smarter than the smartest person) was alive now, they would be able to discover all sorts of things on the cutting edge of science and technology that would be world changing. However, if he a lived in a world where no one would listen to him, he still could not easily break the world (I.E. if he was transported to medieval Europe where new knowledge was treated as heretical at times). If a person of average intelligence and knowledge from today's world was brought to a world full of pliable idiots, he could break that world without too much trouble. See Idiocracy as an example (though they are perhaps not as pliable as would be useful, but still, one man of average intelligence solves one of the world's greatest problems and potentially saves millions of lives).

*** It occasionally occurs to me that if someone /really/ wanted to spread science, naturalism, rationality, etc., they'd find a handsome 2-meter-tall male and a (somewhat shorter) voluptuous, silken-haired woman - both with pleasant voices - and train them as propagandists, especially by outfitting them with the various wearable signals of respect and authority.

It's amazing the shit people will eat up if someone tall, rich, and well-dressed says it with confidence.

** Around a year ago I was thinking about how to conquer the Earth. There weren't any real good ways to go about it, supervillian-style or otherwise. Even getting your hands on a nuclear weapon won't make your faction a minor danger. Hell, even several hundred, you're only in a state of MAD with the other major powers.

It took about 3 hours for the phrase "Efficient Market Hypothesis" to reworm its way into my consciousness.

The only solution I could think of was a particularly dangerous X-Risk in my control (Grey Goo, Bioweapon) or somehow get an FAI in my control.

Neither is particular easy or wise.

** Theory: Munchkinism appeals to geeks because we're used to the experience of being the smartest people in the room, but being curiously unable to translate that into lasting advantages. (Exception: specific job markets.) We're on the tail of an intelligence sigmoid, but we want to be at the start. Secondary factor: most fiction is not about this; hence opportunities are commonly left on the table. Hence: fiction where intelligence (and/or our native interests, compare /Wizard's Bane/) gives us access to previously inaccessible opportunities.

** Because our universe has a maximum speed of causality (speed of light) and a conservation law for mass-energy. "Munchkinism" is usually/often based on exploiting a piece of worldbuilding that allows for unbounded growth of something-or-other using nonconserved basic resources.

Almost any universe in which the basic /stuff/ of existence is nonconserved is going to be massively fucking Munchkinable. In fact, you'd expect our kind of conservation-expecting life to never even evolve, since evolution would find the Munchkinable Thing /first/, in a Cambrian Super-Explosion of life-forms capable of exploiting whatever allows them to generate /more stuff/ to sustain themselves out of literally nothing.

** I think the answer is that it is munchkinable (in ways that compare to fantasy, not "Donald Trump exploits human gullibility" ways), but only by sufficiently intelligent entities. Humans are intelligent enough to eventually bootstrap to that point through science and engineering over many generations, and individually intelligent enough to contribute to science and engineering, but are not intelligent enough to consolidate the necessary understanding of rules. At least not within their naturally allotted lifespans.

That said, I'm expecting a major exploit to occur soon, when someone figures out how to turn asteroids into useful machinery, and actually sends the equipment up there to do it. This will naturally result in an explosion of industrial activity around the sun with a much sharper exponential curve than we are used to measuring as economic growth, because the energy availability is higher (a function of how much sun-exposed area you can spread solar collectors over), and the cost to form viable structures is lower in the absence of gravity (so the amount of materials that need to be moved to tap more energy is lower).

There's also the prospect of bootstrapping AI. It's just that our intuitions about how to program intelligence into computers have tended to fail for quite a long time, indicating that our brains are poorly adapted to this task. (We'll probably brute force it sooner or later, but I'm more sanguine about replicating space robots because it's easier to brute force something with a lot of resources than a little.)

** Rolling with your edit from "exploitable" to "breakable", I went to the same conclusion as Khafra: anthropics. If the universe was easily breakable, it probably would have been broken already.

Fiction tends to take that stable reality and add a new layer to it. These fictional universes haven't been rigorously vetted for instability. You take Earth, and add magic, but without billions of years of evidence that magic won't spontaneously explode everything.

Or maybe comparable planets out there explode all the time - cue Fermi paradox. I dunno.

I try to design stable magic systems when I'm worldbuilding, because I like my stories to be fantasy allegories of our society more than explorations of exploitation. But it's difficult to give someone even trivial powers without it immediately leading to the reformation of society as we know it.
