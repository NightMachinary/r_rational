** For those that aren't familiar with Psi, it's a mod for the game Minecraft that allows you to create spells based on linking effects ('tricks') with operators and constants to create an effect.

To simplify it a bit, the mana ('psi') cost is related to the number and strength of tricks, and the ability to cast it is based on the caster's psi, the complexity of the spell and some limits on effect radius.

This post discusses the results of this person's experience with combat in the game using Psi. The interesting part is that they had to throw out the whole concept of classic fantasy mage spells when confronted with the reality of using inventable magical effects to target and kill other players.

*** Reminds me of the Eragon series. In that magic system, there were a multitude of ways to kill someone instantly, but in the time taken for a mage to pronounce a spell and for it to take effect, your opponent could get one off too, leading to instant mutually assured destruction. So combat between mages became a matter of battling telepathically (which could be done wordlessly) to gain control over the opponent's body and prevent them from being able to enunciate spells.

**** I never understood what happens if you decide to defect from that prisoner's dilemma. Like, cast an insta-death spell as your opponent is still trying to dominate your mind. I mean if you do it out in the open you become a priority target for all enemy mages but if you do it in private no one ever needs to know about what appears to be near suicidal ruthlessness.

  And second, it was mentioned that in a head to head battle if a mage cast an instant-death spell their opponent generally had time to also cast one.
#+end_quote

Yeah but if I understood right then it seems that if they expect a telepathic battle of wills they won't start casting their own insta-death spell. And if you use the shortest one they can't possibly both notice what you're doing and do it themselves too except if they are insanely more skilled than you, in which case they shouldn't have had an incentive to tele-battle you first.

I'm not saying this should always work, just that it should in a case where your opponent thinks you're going to do the sensible thing and you decide not to. Prisoner's Dilemma pretty much.

** The primary reason for this thing happening is that offensive power entirely outclasses defensive power within the strict radii. A single successful hit can either cripple or outright kill the opponent, and within 64 metres, targeting is extremely strong. Within 32 metres, entirely /passive/ effects are deadly, no aiming required. This situation only arises when both combatants have these capabilities and are aware of each other.

As with nearly any setting where this kind of power is available, however, the element of surprise is virtually insurmountable.

** Thank you for sharing the link. Reading a story with laws like this would indeed be very interesting.

Regarding your title, however: it still isn't strictly a real-world experiment, since the laws of the system can easily be redefined. For instance, most magical systems work around this issue by introducing resistance to magic for magical creatures. Usually it's something about having first to overwhelm the opponent's mind\mana to be able to directly influence the physical space\body they are occupying (often it's even easier to kill somebody then modify them magically with\out their consent).

In [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RyuugisTheGamesWePlay][/The Games We Play/,]] for a non-obvious example, the monsters which were technogenic in nature and lacked magic and “soul” could be killed simply by violating their body structure (no magic = no defence against magical interruption). The author didn't use it to its full potential, but it was there. Similarly, in [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/DungeonKeeperAmi][/Dungeon Keeper Ami/]] one's body was considered one's own “magical territory” --- meaning that its owner had more power over it in some aspects than anybody else.

** So, a properly equipped player is an aerial teleporting artillery sniper with a kill radius... But that's only the archmages. The less powerful might only be able to sustain a few teleports, or a single projectile. Army tactics might focus around training people until they can use projectiles, then graduating a few to specialize in killzone spells and act as a living minefield to keep the enemy from closing and activating spell circles. Stealth and extraction specialists might infiltrate and trigger spell circles within enemy fortifications, so frequent landscaping spells to destroy all cover within the Spheres they might use to hide while teleporting would be important. You might even have a balance of combatants who use the spells and engineers/researchers who build them. Another valid method might be decieving enemies into triggering spells and wasting Psi, then closing for a close-range kill once the effect expires.

*** That's the jist of things.

When there's more than one player per side, things get a bit more interesting. There is a trick (spell effect) that teleports all entities in a certain list (say, all nearby players) forward in the directions they are individually spacing, and another that adds momentum to a list of entities in an arbitrary direction. You can make mass flight spells, that'll effectively grow stronger as the group grows, like the Yangban from Worm. That's actually quite a good analogy.

**** That'd make for some devastating strike teams - one group uses psi to carry everyone in at speed, maybe based on a disc arrangement, then one player ports out of the spell area-of-effect and engages enemy at close range - except the enemy has just been spending psi trying to snipe the group from the sky, so the paratrooper has psi advantage.

Spell circles don't actually require a sensible-sized target; the side of a single block of sand about to fall will do just as well as a 3*3 platform.

Your mention of paratroopers reminds me: you can actually turn invisible, and there's a couple ways to cancel fall damage. Being inside each other's kill radius /usually/ goes in favor of whoever has the best regeneration and health potions. So you can fly into the sky, turn invisible, take off your pants, parachute down, then put your pants back on to kill everyone.

Unfortunately, any sensible opponent will be way up in the air on a moving platform. *Projectile spells can't have an effect unless they hit something*. Unless there are targets every 32-64 blocks, you can't really carpet someone who's flying.

******** Could you make a spell that materials something small but solid to use as a target, projects it horizontally and upwards at a fixed angle, and then shoots a projectile that explodes on contact with your initial small target?

So it sends off the target at 30m/s at a 30 degree angle to the player, then sends an explosive spell that will impact the target 2 seconds later, based on precalculations predicting where your target should be?

With a range of spells covering various angles and with various timers, it seems like carpetting the air could still be somewhat effective

********* Minecraft doesn't quite work that way. Blocks don't move according to physics. You can generate a block 32 metres away from yourself and then cast something at it, sure, but there's no way to make moving solid targets.

With a bit of effort though, you might be able to make a projectile spell that generates a block 32 metres behind its target, then destroys the original target. Then you'd be able to march a solid target through the air toward your opponent. The problem is that at engagement ranges, it'll take four or five spell casts to get to your opponent. A common method of flight lets the user travel at 8m/s. Projectile spells travel at 32m/s. At an engagement range of 128m, four projectile spells will need casting for the last to affect a sphere by the opponent, and will travel 32, 64, 96, and 128 metres respectively. Thus the total travel time is 10 seconds, in which the opponent can dodge by 2.5 blast radii.

*** If you're new to mods, I recommend using mod packs. They gather together a collection of most of the most cool mods and also make sure that they work together well. I've moved on to building my own using Forge and the specific mods I like, so I don't know which packs have Psi in them. Every pack has a mod list though so you should be able to find one.

If you want to play around with Psi by itself, you just install Forge, edit your profile in the minecraft launcher to use the Forge "version" of minecraft, and put the Psi jar file in a /mods/ folder in the directory where your forge install is.

The [[http://www.feed-the-beast.com/][Feed The Beast launcher]] is the most popular. Another is the [[https://www.atlauncher.com/downloads][AT Launcher]]. I would have stopped playing minecraft a long time ago if it weren't for mods. As is, I probably have more hours playing it than any other game. Psi is relatively new though, so I haven't played it much at all yet.

Go to %appdata% and open your roaming folder. Open your .minecraft folder. Open your mods folder. Drag and drop psi into said folder. Run minecraft.
