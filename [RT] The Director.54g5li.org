** A loose sequel to [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/n2huyv4pale3of2/Starwhisp.pdf?dl=0][Starwhisp]], which you might want to read first

** Fascinating.

While Starwhisp was a complete story in its own right, this one felt like it left more questions than it answered as a sequel. It feels like there's a whole world built up out there, but I can't see enough of it to know what's actually happening. Hoping for more!

As an aside, on my mobile device, the PDFs are most easily handled if you remove the '?dl=0' from the URL.

** *Very* similar to a scene early in /Use of Weapons/ by Iain Banks.
