** And thus concludes the second part of the climax! And with it, incidentally, the last of my beta-reader's notes, since this was where he dropped off. It's amazing he spent as much time on the story as he did, really, considering he was never into Naruto to begin with. Let's hope the chapter doesn't have any more flaws as a result!

I'm really looking forward to hearing what you guys thought of the climax!

*** Well, I was really looking forward to the Kyuubi's unleashed power, as it so often happens in Naruto fics, but I guess it didn't happen here.

Doubt it could be called a flaw, but it's always fun to see that overwhelming power to get a feel of a fic

**** The fundamental premise of the fix is that problems in this world can't be solved with raw power alone - heck, it's in the story's description. Unleashing epic power is fun, true, but it wouldn't work as a solution to a rationalist story I feel.

***** I can understand that, it makes perfect sense.

But you know, sometimes you want a problem to simply be removed from your sight rather than fixed.

** Just thought I'd pop in and comment saying that I've been loving the read thus far and keep up the good work! Authors don't often get positive comments due most only feeling the need to speak up when the dislike something... but I thought I'd just return some of the positivity that I gained from reading the last three chapters. Secondary, more selfish reasons, include that many fanfictions get abandoned because Authors get too discouraged to finish them.

If you don't mind answering (you can spoiler it, if need be), what were the four levels Kakashi was playing on during his escapade? So far I've got this:

- Kakashi is currently weakened enough to not defeat Zabuza easily. (core / first level)
- Kakashi is actually strong enough to defeat Zabuza, but wants to flush the real him out. (second level)
- Kakashi is weakened and desperate and wishes for a simple resolution. (third level)
- Kakashi is strong enough to fight him, chase him off and survive... but not enough to kill him or find the real him. (fourth level)

*** Thanks! It's true that lack of comments can be discouraging - I stopped updating for almost two months when I wasn't getting much positive feedback at the start, though that was also because I was depressed from the Trump calamity. Anyway, to answer your question, the '4th level strategy' doesn't refer to the attack itself, but to the way Kakashi orchestrated the events leading up to it. Think of it this way:

#+begin_quote
  1st level: Haku tries to kill the Bridge builder in his sleep.\\
  2nd level: Kakashi anticipates this, and uses genjutsu to fool Haku into thinking he killed the bridge builder so he can kill Haku instead.\\
  3rd level: Haku anticipates this, and instead pretends to execute the first level plan so Kakashi will defend Tazuna which will exhaust Kakashi so they can kill him.\\
  4th level: Kakashi realizes their strategy at the last second, and instead pretends to fall for their trap by going to the Bridge alone and thereby giving Zabuza the perfect ambush position, so his students can protect the villagers while he uses Genjutsu to fool Zabuza into attacking and wasting his chakra while also uncovering the location of Zabuza's real body.​
#+end_quote

It's basically the same stuff that Quirrel and HJPEV also discuss in HPMOR, where they also refer to "playing at level X", which is why I didn't go into too much detail discussing it. It's also covered in the same chapter that explains genjutsu, however (Armoury Economics, chapter 8 if I recall)

**** Glad that I could provide my little bit of encouragement. :)

Oh neat. Yea, I remember the example given as well as the HPMOR discussion. That is partially why I was trying to think of it from the context of changes to a single individual, perhaps. Eg. A Ninja pretending to be a Civilian With a Dark Secret pretending to be a Merchant (or something along those lines). Perhaps it primed my thoughts in that direction or perhaps I just didn't spend enough time thinking on it in a broader context. >_<"

** I'm late but I only found out about this two days ago and I've been steadily reading it.

Sì it's obvious that it's inspired by hpmor, maybe too obvious at the beginning but I saw the quality improving as time went and the latest chapters have been amazing.

It'd definitely a story I can't wait to read each week or however much it takes for chapters to come out
