Also, Interlude ×•, set in 2017:

#+begin_quote
  We learned that Uriel, the only entity keeping any of this even slightly functional, has some serious issues of his own and does not entirely inspire confidence.
#+end_quote

Present tense, which implies Uriel is still alive.

***** I don't see him falling. Remember that he's the one who understood Thamiel /immediately/. Empathizing with evil is really bad for angels, but studying it analytically seems safe (if you can pull it off).

*** The sub is not necessarily strict on /only/ truly rational fiction being posted - if it's sufficiently rational-adjacent to be enjoyed by the same sort of demographic/mindset as the people who have collected here, then it's probably fair game (self-regulating community, it keeps getting upvoted)

Also the author is a part of the LessWrong/rational crowd; his blogging is more rational than his fiction.

**** The sidebar says:

#+begin_quote
  A subreddit dedicated to the discussion of works of rational and rationalist fiction
#+end_quote

Why not start [[/r/LWBookClub]] for stuff that doesn't belong here but is written by the right people? Rational fiction isn't going to gain popularity if people see it as synonymous with LW circlejerk.

Imagine this sub was filled with One Direction fanfic. That would be terrible moderation even if ten thousand OD fans voted everything up. People: vote down if it's in the wrong sub no matter who wrote it. [[/u/alexanderwales]] and other mods start actually enforcing the shit in the sidebar.

PS. Nothing against Scott A, I've loved all his writing that I can understand.

Sounds cool, I would subscribe to it. Don't personally feel strongly enough about it to put in the effort to create/promote/moderate though. But, I mean, no-one's stopping you, if you want to.

#+end_quote

Minor false equivalence there: what we're seeing is (presumably) rational-fiction fans voting it up, not a group coming from /outside/ the community doing so. Unless there's an 'entryist' group of Unsong fans who don't participate in the rest of the sub, but that seems unlikely.

But I take your point; if we all collectively decided to upvote pictures of ducks as part of some sort of bizarre in-joke, that wouldn't make them rational fiction.

Although... if this comment were widely seen, I wouldn't bet /against/ it accidentally starting a trend involving pictures of ducks. Maybe I'm mistaken, just my read on the collective personality of the sub.
