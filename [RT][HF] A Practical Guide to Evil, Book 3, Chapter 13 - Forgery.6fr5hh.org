** I feel like Cat should have asked Apprentice what having a Winter title would represent already. It seems like a thing that would be /very important/, you know.

** I love the exposition here. Learning more about the fae, Find, Archer, Cat and what she's trying to do in both the coming confrontation and more generally was perfect. A very solid chapter and now I'm stoked for the next one.

*** I think the problem is that the fae are mostly used to fighting other fae. They set the story up for Cat to fail. If they were fighting fae, then once that happened she'd be doomed to fail. But humans are less bound by stories than fae. She still can't win without the story on her side, but she can change which story it is even though it's already started. It's like you're a chessmaster who can see ten moves ahead, but when your opponent realizes they're going to lose in five moves they can just move around their pieces and pretend they made a different move five moves ago.

** Some of the comments on the chapter page got me thinking... at first I was imagining that, since we know Cat's plan in advance this time, things will inevitably get mucked up (because there's no dramatic tension if the story simply plays out all this planning again). But now I'm considering that the plan will work but the fallout will be what really comes back to haunt Cat.

Also, if Killian is part fae, likely from the Summer Court, I could see her somehow becoming a victim to the after effects if Cat inherits a Winter Court royal title. This passage in particular:

#+begin_quote
  Killing her birth father on the field, she became a Princess of Winter only to find the horrible fate still dogged her: she was sent as as the champion of Winter to settle a duel, only to find the man who'd raised her to be her opponent. This evidently being a tragedy, she won again and destroyed everything she'd ever loved.
#+end_quote

... seems like it could end up with her being sent to duel a Summer champion and the Summer Court forcing Killian to act out the role. Or it could stay closer to exactly what it says, and somehow Cat's new role will end up requiring her killing Black ("the man who raised her"). Of course that's probably going to have to happen at some point anyway, so I guess it's not that much of a shock.

*** I think you're really on to something here. Killian involvement and Cat needing to choose (for example) between Killian and part of Callow would be a really appropriate escalation of current events. What would Cat go through to either revenge or reverse the loss of Killian?
