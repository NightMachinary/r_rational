Hey, everybody! The recent release of a new r!Animorphs chapter reminded me to let this sub know about my new projects.

First off, for those who enjoyed /[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/455qdh/eden_green/][Eden Green]]/ or would like to check out an indie scifi/thriller, [[http://homework.never-ends.net/newnight/][here's the cover and plot info]] for my new novel, /New Night./ If anyone would like an advance review copy, comment or PM me; all I ask is that you be ready to post an honest review on Amazon/Goodreads on/before October 28, 2016, when the book premieres to the public.

If you didn't read /Eden Green,/ you can read an in-universe reporter summarize events as a free web serial, /[[http://homework.never-ends.net/city/][City on the Edge of Nowhere]]/. This is my first time doing multimedia web fiction and I'd love to hear any comments and contributions.

I can't imagine writing in any other genre besides rational(ist), which makes you guys my target audience. I can't wait to watch everyone eat up this latest work!


** I definitely enjoyed Eden Greed, so I'd love an advance copy.
