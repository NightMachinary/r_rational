Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

*** I'm not 100% sure about this but if I had to give a simple definition of rationality it would be the realization that you are one of the problems that must be solved and the art of solving it. This would imply the most important techniques is how to apply evaluations to yourself and the things you care about consistently. If you learn how to flawlessly identify problems but you only identify them in the beliefs you dislike and other people then you are now worse off. Please be aware I am not very good at this sort of thing and I might be wrong.

***** Intellectual honesty compels not to try not to sound like a cult. Other communities do not have to pass this test, because they can just not say such things. Whether this community is a cult can be evaluated seperately of what the philosophy sounds like, and the philosophy awards bonus points for developing the philosophy before one tries to make sure that it doesn't bring about a cult.

*** I think there is a tendency for people to isolate "emotions" and "rationality" as these separate domains that never intersect. Taken to an extreme, you have people who argue that "emotions/feelings don't matter," which seems to fundamentally deny the biological reality of what emotions are. Emotions are real, insofar as they're caused by chemicals in your brain (which is part of your body), and they have real consequences. Nobody would deny that parts of your metabolism like blood pressure, breathing, and so on are a real and manifest thing that affect your overall health, and your emotional state affects all of these.

One of the reasons that this should matter to you as a rationalist is that it means that things that people think of as intangible (like "fulfillment" and "happiness") are real things, and you can take an approach that treats your life as an optimization problem where you can take concrete steps toward the goal of maximizing your long-term happiness and fulfillment. That is a whole topic all on its own, but if you have a few hours to spend on the subject, I'd recommend listening to the podcast interviews that Naval Ravikant has done with [[https://tim.blog/2015/08/18/the-evolutionary-angel-naval-ravikant/][Tim Ferriss]] and [[https://www.fs.blog/2017/02/naval-ravikant-reading-decision-making/][Shane Parrish]]

*** That's a rather large field. Can you describe a bit of what your mathematical background is, and where you want to go with this?

Are you interested in studying the proofs of the theorems of vector calculus? Or are you more interested in learning physics that uses the language of vector calculus (such as Maxwell's Equations)? Or is it a stepping stone to learning differential geometry?

***** Nooooooo, just deriving the MLE for linear regression, when you treat X samples as a matrix of column vectors and Y samples as a single column vector. Doing the derivative requires some vector-matrix calculus that doesn't /quite/ work according to the rules of unidimensional calculus.

Besides, don't be silly, deep learning won't produce AGI. Unless you're Ilya Sutskever. Then it totally will, but you're wrong and a horrible person.

** Paging [[/u/DaystarEld][u/DaystarEld]] and [[/u/Frommerman][u/Frommerman]]. The sleeplessness is back even worse than before, but I don't feel anxious this time. Two weeks ago it wasn't getting enough, for the past three nights I've stopped sleeping altogether and I have no idea why.

I lay in my bed all night feeling relaxed like I'm about to fall asleep, but never do. I scheduled a therapy appointment with my healthcare provider, but the earliest they're available is next month. I'm starting to consider just going to the hospital.

The supplements I've taken for months to help me sleep have stopped working and meditation isn't helping either. My mind isn't stuck dwelling on stressful topics, I'm too tired to even think, if anything I'm just bored. Not even taking melatonin helps.

I called in sick to work yesterday and probably will today since I don't have enough energy to focus or do manual labor, though today they actually want to have a meeting about putting me back on my old schedule. However, I went to bed at my old time last night and still didn't sleep.

*** I have actual medication to let me sleep on anything approximating a schedule, as Melatonin stopped working for me a while ago. Other than that, I have no advice other than to say that not sleeping is a serious condition and that if it continues you definitely need to do something. You could probably go to a quick clinic rather than a hospital to save on money, they'd be able to prescribe you something without an insane bill.

**** I asked friends about seeing a doctor and one said the medication they got knocked them out, but left them groggy all day because it didn't put them in a deep sleep. I don't know if that would be an improvement over now, and I'm not even sure if going back to my old work schedule will fix this.

***** I use Trazodone, and it doesn't do that to me at all. Obviously all medications work differently on different people, but you don't have much of a choice here. Not sleeping can literally kill you. You have around a week before it does, as the record longest time without sleep is ten days. Though I doubt that will happen, as you are likely getting short periods of sleep you just don't notice, this is still potentially life-threatening and definitely causes long-term damage which may shorten your life span.

Deal with it. You can't afford not to.

*** Nothing to add on top of Frommerman's comment unfortunately. My list of insomnia solutions mostly includes things you've already mentioned: meditation, sleep inducing sounds (raindrops, babbling brook, ocean waves, white noise), melatonin, non-fiction reading. If none of those things help, then I'd advise seeking medical help, and hope that some stronger form of sleeping aid is useful without side effects.
