** Authour of "Myou've" here.

In case you're interested, my initial goal was to see if I could write at least a thousand words a day, and post them; which I managed to accomplish for a few months. It also meant things underwent minimal-to-no editing; there is plenty I would change if I went back to it.

The plotline of what's posted is incomplete. I do have an ending in mind and plotted out, but it's been some time, and I don't know that actually writing it out will ever make it to the top of my priorities list; the whole Chessgame of the Gods group has moved in different directions since I was last a part of it.

*** Please, PLEASE do continue. Even after all this time, I think about it and consider it among the very best fiction ever. Not "best fanfiction" or "best amature fiction" or "best book because of not reading a lot" or anything like that. Literally better than shakespeare, tolkien, even some of Eliezer's work. Better than movies and games with teams of hundred and millions of dollar in budget, without renormalizing their advantages over any written text away.

(This category also contains quite a few of the big rationalist fanfics, and other than that mostly Homestuck, so I'm not claiming to be unbiased of for this to be objective. Still, know you have a BIG fan.)

What the fuck? Ok, I might have to try reading this.

***** Now I feel like I have to point out that while all of what I wrote above is /technically/ true, and also emotionally true for me personally, there are a bunch of ifs and buts due to mainly addressing the author personally and likely suffering from quite a bit of motivated cognition.

*** Wow! The author himself!

Do me a favor and, if and when you ever write more rationalist fiction, post the updates on here, eh? I look forward to seeing more of your work. :D

*** I would like to echo the 'please continue' request. Due to the lesser ridiculousness of the self-insert and more believable characters, I consider this story superior to HPMoR, and even all this time after the last update, I fervently hope that you continue at some point. Because, as someone stated previously: In my preference ordering over fiction, this is at the top. Better than any original fic I've read, better than any non-rationalist fic, better than any other rationalist fic, it is simply the best. Even if we don't even get a chapter every month, that would be preferable. I lasted through HPMoR's update schedule, I can take 'a few chapters every few months if I feel like it'. Anything is better than a complete hiatus.

**** Definitely, this was a fantastic read. I have it saved on my tablet in the section that acts as a shrine to ridiculously awesome fiction. You've made it on my list with HPMoR and Hitchhikers :)

*** Please write out the ending. It's a very good story. If the Chessverse has moved on, then simply declare your ending a non-canon sidestory.

** A much-less-loved but still-rationalist MLP fanfiction. Over 110 chapters; I'm only starting it now, but it looks promising.

*** It starts well but it become a bit much of a trudge for me. The focus seemed more about demonstrating the intelligence of the author than advancing the plot.

** I just read through it all very rapidly. I have work which I'm peeping actively trying to avoid, but the fact remains this was good enough to be the sole subject of my attention for a few days. But... barely, I would say. I did consider stopping and I think I would have were it not for akrasia (which receives an honourable mention in-story).

It's pretty readable but not standout level well written. I enjoyed it a roughly similar amount to other fics I've read. Biggest caveat: it's incomplete, something I forgot to check for. I'm not normally a fan of incomplete stories.
