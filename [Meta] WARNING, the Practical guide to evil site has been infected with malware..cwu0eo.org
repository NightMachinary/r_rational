There's a link regarding tragic news about the site operator instead of the story text, according the the PGTE discord, this link will infect your computer with malware.

EDIT: It now appears that EE has regained control and has fixed the issue. The only way of getting malware was through clicking a link and that link is now gone, and the chapters have been restored. If you click on strange links that start auto-downloading files for you, do not open them.

PS, not sure if I should delete this now or if mods want to put a "solved" mark or something on it.


** Wait, isn't PGTE a WordPress.com site? This sounds like either a hack of the author's account or some form of XSS attack in a plugin on the site.

** I don't know if this is a well known piece of malware, but googling the phrase "tragic news about the site operator" gives links to [[http://www.beststoryinevertold.com/][this website]] which seems to have been infected by the same thing - same link, same text, same warnings apply. Nothing else turns up with that exact phrase, and I'm not familiar enough with Wordpress history in order to know if something similar has happened to other blogs in the past.

****** Well, it's been on the BBC for more than 12 hours, so it's not like, niche news

I mean, if anything I thought it was a bit inane to refer to it as of it wasn't heavily reported international news.

******* Anecdotally: it didn't pierce my filter bubble, because I mostly read US news, and it looks like the story didn't hit the English-speaking press until after I had already checked the news for the day.

Speaking more generally: If you link to the news, you both help pierce other people's filter bubbles, provide a resource where people can go to learn more, and you refresh your own knowledge of the news.

Anyways, here's a detail-full news article, for people who have yet to read about it: [[https://thehackernews.com/2019/08/retadup-botnet-malware.html]]

I don't think this malicious .doc file is related to the RETADUP network, because: 1. VirusTotal [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/cwu0eo/meta_warning_the_practical_guide_to_evil_site_has/eyfc7qa/][initially reported]] that no antivirus detected the .doc file as malicious, which would not be the case for a known virus 2. The server hosting the .doc is located in .ru netspace, not in France or the USA, which is the case with RETADUP's known command-and-control infrastructure.

But those are weak assertions.

***** I care less about attribution and more about:

1. taking down the malware server
2. securing affected accounts
3. restoring compromised sites

It doesn't look like any of the attacks from today's WordFence compromise list [[https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2019/08/malicious-wordpress-redirect-campaign-attacking-several-plugins/]] so I'm guessing someone guessed EE's password.

Always use unique per-site passwords, and enable 2FA when possible.
