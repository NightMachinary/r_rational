[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5q71ml/weekly_challenge_utility_monster/][Last time,]] the prompt was "Utility Monster". The winner was [[/u/MagicWeasel]], with [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5q71ml/weekly_challenge_utility_monster/ddgxus1/][their story]]. Go read it now!

** This Time

   :END:
This time the challenge will be *Games*. It's your choice of either games in the sense of gamification, or games as conflict resolution, though ideally I'd like to see a mix of both. Making up a game from scratch would be appreciated but is not required; it's also not necessary for the reader to know all the rules of the game in question, so long as they know the ones that are important to resolving the conflict. There are a number of IP franchises that revolve around the playing of games or sports, many of which I think are ripe targets.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, March 15th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Rules
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rules
   :END:

- 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. *This is mandatory.*

- No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

- Think before you downvote.

- Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

- Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

- All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

- Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

- In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

- No idea what rational fiction is? [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][Read the wiki!]]

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-time
   :END:
Next time the challenge will be *Types of Conflict: Man vs Nature*. The story should depict a person pitted against an animal or some other external force of nature. The most common type of Man vs Nature conflict is a natural disaster, though simply surviving in a hostile environment counts and some varieties of hunting stories do as well (so long as the thing being hunted isn't given human characteristics). Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 3/15.* Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5xlljb/challenge_companion_games/][is available here]]. (Apologies for the delay.)

Ok, quick .readme.

I've been lurking for...well, for quite some time. Almost all of my reading material comes from this sub, so I just wanted to thank everyone involved in the community for countless hours of thoughtful entertainment.

I've bandied about ideas for stories for years, but upon writing this I realized that this is actually the first thing I've written. Ever. (discounting essays for school back in the day and such like) So. Feedback appreciated - criticisms, praisisms, you name it.

Yup.

K.

Toodles.

*** You actually saved me from posting. I was going to post something last minute that was long and rambley and point out how important rules are and thus declare myself the winner on multiple levels. Now you are the only person with an eligible post. Best of luck.

Granted, I dont pay enough attention to know how important said rules are, but it seemed within the spirit of the sub to enter because of that, I was planning on posting as close to the deadline as possible to not give you a chance to notice it and fix your error :P

Good story btw.

****** Whoops! I actually thought that was only needed for the stories which were too long to fit in the comments.

I wish I could say that I broke the rule to make a point about rules in a game, but it's too late to work a story around that idea ..... actually I think I have a idea for a second entry....

I appreciate the compliment!

*** Interesting concept, decently executed. My only serious complaint would be that it should be more fleshed out, but considering the venue you get a pass. Two minor quibbles: there's a confused gender in the second Thailand section, and it's SoD breaking that anyone, no matter how "promising" would be allowed in on some high level government meeting in a novelty tee shirt.

**** The concept's something I've been playing with for a while - if I decide to keep going, I have a figurative ton of flesh to out.

Shoot, I thought I'd gotten all the gender issues! That's the result of thinking I had a balanced cast, then re-reading and realizing they were actually all male-identifying. Last minute changes ensued.

Yeah, I agree with the t-shirt thing. Still struggling to expunge all of my Hollywood stereotypes, I suppose. Thanks for the feedback!

*** Nice story, but it's a little confusing to understand the aliens' motivations. Do you have any hidden background information on why the aliens would loop time for the entire human species rather than just Quentin?

**** Yeah, it was actually tied into the *error* in the initial announcement. I've got a whole bunch of stuff for this, but I had been procrastinating writing anything for months, so I took this as an opportunity to just get something, anything, out there.

Don't want to ruin anything in case I end up going forward with it, but there's definitely a reason.

** The Game - Word Count: 322

EDIT: As [[/u/Rouninscholar]] so 'helpfully' pointed out, I was supposed to post my story as a link rather than as a comment. I actually thought that everyone else did a link because of the limited number of characters in the comments rather than as a rule.

Thanks [[/u/Rouninscholar]]!

*** This may be a little short for most people's tastes with it being /barely/ over the minimum word limit, but I hope people like it!

The sharp-eyed reader may have noticed that the counter incremented every time I wrote the phrase, 'the game'.

For those who may be confused at what game is being played in the story, here's a link to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_(mind_game][rules]].

I wonder how many players will be angry at me for talking about the game?

***** Yeah, I love talking about the subject, because it's a fascinating look into what makes a meme so good at replicating itself into other brains. By using ironic processing (attempting to not think about something makes it harder to forget), the concept becomes self-reinforcing and nearly impossible to forget.

The best way I have ever learned to 'win' by forgetting is to use the same advice people are given for emptying the mind in meditation. Don't get upset when you are focusing on a thought or try to force yourself to stop thinking. Treat the thought like a butterfly. Let it linger in your mind and allow yourself to continue thinking about the game. Without over focusing on it, your mind will naturally shift to other topics (or empty itself) in due time.

Also the real rationalist in my story is never given a speaking role. She's contestant #42's best friend and told him to ignore the instructions and guided him into 'accidentally' winning the game. After all, if you don't know what the game is about, how can you ever lose?

Food for thought, game theory works by writing pay-off matrices of the rewards/punishments of different moves and using the matrix to calculate the best strategy to use. However, how can a pay-off matrix be created for the game?
