Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** In 24 hours you'll have the opportunity to create a number of duplicates of yourself, identical in every respect to how you are currently, with the exception of any new memories you obtain in the next 24h -- mostly so that, upon being generated, your duplicates aren't surprised by their apparent teleportation to a new location. If you prefer, you can generate duplicates with no 24h-updated memories. They'll appear instantly, standing next to you, but with no dangerous displacement of air or splinching/telefragging and with no greater density than one per 3 cubic meters. Furthermore, they will not appear in any immediately dangerous positions themselves unless they've exhausted all possible less-dangerous nearby 3m^{3} blocks within a 5,000 mi radius -- if you're standing in a highrise, duplicates will first fill your floor, then fill nearby floors, then spill out onto the streets below (but initially fill along the sidewalks, away from passing cars), and so on.

Duplicates will appear wearing a replicate of a typical outfit you'd wear during your day-to-day, or a plain black shirt, sneakers, and jeans; your choice. Your first 1,000,000 duplicates will have on their persons the equivalent of 1,000 USD in your local currency, acquired through completely legal and legitimate channels (i.e. not created ex nihilo or stolen), or a selection of world currencies. All duplicates beyond the first million will have the equivalent of 1,000 USD in precious metals at current spot prices. Duplicates are physically identical to the you reading this currently and persist in the world just as /you/ would -- in other words, they're "real" and permanent.

You can create any natural number of duplicates, from none at all to 10^{40} or more (which in the latter case would probably accrete into a black hole, or trigger a new big bang, or something, depending on the number you choose). You can only do this in 24h, and never again afterwards.

*1)* Given who you are and what your goals are now, how many duplicates do you create, if any? How well do the duplicates (including "yourself") cooperate with each other? What steps do you (in the plural) take to ensure cooperation? What do you set out to accomplish? What do you actually anticipate accomplishing, and how? In what way do governments and societies at large react to your new multiplicity?

*2)* Given the goal of WORLD DOMINATION, how many duplicates do you create and how do you go about achieving it? Are you ultimately successful? Let's say WORLD DOMINATION requires that the 97 most populous United Nations Member States formally recognize and cede power to you as global leader within 20-years time. At least thirty percent of humans alive today must also be alive then. If you do not succeed in this task, Unspecified Bad Things happen, so let's say you're very highly motivated but not completely “bloodlusted”. Additionally, what is the smallest number of duplicates that could conceivably succeed in this task at least 5/10 times?

*** For (2), can you just clone enough copies to cover the globe and to immediately physically subdue essentially everyone who is not currently both alert and armed? You will probably need a bunch of copies to commit suicide and have the others resort to cannibalism to avoid an immediate mass-die off, and you'll need to reduce the number of copies down to at most several billion eventually anyway, but this seems like perhaps the most guaranteed way to achieve the stated goal.

***** Hmm... I feel like accomplishing this with many fewer people might be difficult. I could probably reduce it by a bunch by locating myself somewhere in the Atlantic and producing enough copies to take over the US and Europe and using conventional means to take over the rest, but I would have to worry about China starting a nuclear war that would reduce the requisite population below the desired threshold. Maybe I could get around that by force-evacuating people from cities, putting them in bunkers and letting them live off of cannibalized extra-me copies.

But without putting in enough people to take a major country essentially by force, I think you are going to have problems. Its going to take a lot of people (even if smart and well coordinated) to take over the world unless they were already very well positioned (which these are not). Furthermore, if you located in a remotely advanced country, you will probably quickly run into problems with bureaucracy as most of the copies of you don't have/have only matching identification. Once it becomes officially recognized that there are a bazillion copies of you, things will probably get weird.

Actually, now that I think about it, if you want to win with many fewer people, you would probably need to do so by somehow leveraging the public reaction to this discovery.

--------------

Closer to the spirit of the question...

Our cooperation should be borderline inhuman. I'm pretty sure that no recently-diverged copy of mine would choose to act against my/our goals; moreover, they/I would be more likely to /tell/ other duplicates about any rebellious thoughts they would have instead, in fear of going rogue. Us having perfect cooperation is /the/ source of our strength, all of us being cooperative is preferable to alternatives, it's a typical timeless prisoner's dilemma situation, any duplicate of mine would know that, and so would do his utmost best to make sure he stayed loyal.

I think I'd settle on around 10,000 duplicates. Not as many as possible, but on the safer side.

Step zero would be choosing a deserted-enough spot and moving to it, creating duplicates there so they don't become obvious to the world at large.

We would then agree on means of long-range communication on the spot: using the Internet, and a website that would be created during the following weeks. We would agree on how we would distribute ourselves.

Then we would covertly move to almost every city in my country, about ten duplicates per city. 1,000 USD is a large enough sum of money in Russia, so they would be able to freely live on it for a few weeks at least. Upon arrival, they would rent an apartment, buy a laptop, get the Internet access, some would be tasked with creating the website for us. We would converse and plot.

Then we would enact [[http://squid314.livejournal.com/293753.html][/The Story of Emily and Control/]] on mass-scale: each of us would choose a different method of doing X or a different interest to pursue, rate how successful it was upon completion, then we would collectively adopt the most successful methods/goals.

I'm a programmer; some would be freelancing, some would be trying to get a programmer job, some would be trying to get an unrelated job, some would be doing independent research and living off the money my other selves earned, etc. We would be doing collective brainstorming sessions, where we would deliberately diverge our daily experiences, then think on the issue and discuss our thoughts online.

We would be open to new ideas, changing our strategy and tactics if better ideas become apparent. We would offer support to each other, ensure that we're all happy with the way we're moving forward.

The whole thing is bizarre and innocuous-looking from the outside enough that I don't expect us to be noticed by the government until it's too late; we /would/ deliberately try to avoid recognition, staying away from getting into noticeable positions/commiting crimes/being around too many cameras, wearing at least basic disguise when it's absolutely necessary and eventually going through сosmetic surgery, choosing to get a full-time job only at places where it wouldn't be necessarily included in some global database. Our website and other methods of communication, as well as money transfers, would be properly anonymized and protected soon enough.

I expect us to become a civilization-scale force in a decade or so. /How/, I don't know, since I lack the raw intelligence by definition. It could be through advanced software products, or scientific discoveries, or writing worldview-shattering books online, or hacking something important, or earning enough money to buy the world, or writing a FAI, or all of the above, or something else entirely, such as pushing one or a few of us into influential positions and letting them benefit off of the collectivemind's work.

Contingencies: I'm reasonably confident that, in such a situation, a duplicate of mine would willingly kill himself if the greater whole decides it's optimal^{1}, doubly so if our strategy would appear to be working. Suicide missions are possible as well.

A risky gamble! I'm actually not sure what would happen if you spawned so much matter. Some quick back of the enveloping would put the mass of the universe in a sphere with radius ~70 lightyears -- I'd be curious how the system would evolve if that were to happen.

The tricky bit here would be finding a spot that's remote enough to avoid detection, yet close enough to civilization to be able to obtain necessary supplies. The duplicates don't spawn with food/water/shelter/etc., and while it can be bought using the money they each carry, logistics for any spontaneous remote settlement would be a nightmare (large festivals have a hard enough time at it, without needing to be kept secret and with having more than 24h prep on a much larger budget)

Getting to a city would be helpful w.r.t. not dying from starvation, but avoiding detection in cities would be much trickier without substantial disguises from the get-go, I'd think. And even then, across thousands of individuals I'd reckon you'd run into authority figures pretty quickly for entirely innocuous reasons, and (I'm not sure how law enforcement in Russia works nowadays) if there's any centralized information system, it might seem strange to get a citation in e.g. Omsk and Volgograd in the same day, and passersby might notice themselves passing the same person more often than anticipated unless they ran in entirely different circles, and eventually you'd find yourself on the news or something, even if accidentally.

We would be supposed to spend about a day or less here, sorting ourselves out, then leave the city by various means, ranging from trains to hitchhiking to buses. Are the duplicates' bodies created as mine was at the time of reading your message? I had a dinner not long before that, which is convenient, allowing my duplicates to easily live for a days or a three on snacks alone.

Still, the logistics of covertly distributing 10^{4} people in a timely manner is indeed the most tricky part. Hmm. I should probably spend part of these 24 hours figuring out the best place to situate them at, allowing transportation of large quantities of people, a sort of traffic hub.

I could burn all my money and ask for loans to equip every duplicate of mine with enough food to live a week and a train/bus ticket, and hope that we'll manage to send them all off to their destinations by that time.

Yep, it would probably still be necessary to cut my numbers by about a half just because of that. Fucking logistics.

Well, yes, but a likely response to that is "meh, it was probably a mistake or a lookalike, whatever", not "CLONES ARE TRYING TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD NUKE EVERYTHING". If it's a murder case or a large money transfer or an interview or something, then of course someone may take notice, but myselves would deliberately /avoid/ those, running away or even commiting suicide if it's absolutely necessary.

Over large enough periods of time, someone of course would just /happen/ to notice and become unexpectedly interested, but by that time myselves would already have gone through cosmetic surgeries and/or became disguise experts.

Of course, over large enough periods of time, someone may notice even /that/, but by that time we're probably already a force to be reckoned with, and could take care of ourselves, one way or another.

I'm confused how you could do a back of the envelope calculation on that, since Graham's number is vastly too large to express with normal notation, like I don't even know how you could easily do calculations with it. Also I can say you are /*staggeringly*/ wrong in your calculation since the number of planck volumes in the observable universe is only a /mere/ 10^{186} (not even very long in normal notation systems!) so once you made that many clones the entire rest of the universe would be infinitesimally small in comparison (if anything that's an understatement).

Anyway with that many clones in such a small space (graham's number of literally /anything/ within any finite size space you can reasonably express with normal notation is going to be absurd) it's really hard to say whether the outwards pressure would counteract the force of gravity or not. Either way it would seem that you would have a wave of destruction travelling outwards at lightspeed, whether it was an event horizon or pure energy.\\
Except that since it would so totally dwarf the mass of the entire universe and be more energy dense than the entire universe when it occupied a planck volume it's hard to really say with much certainty that it /would/ actually be limited to lightspeed. In fact upon looking at wikipedia I strongly suspect such an energy density would cause a period of inflation on a scale and speed utterly dwarfing our own universes period of inflation. So it may end up creating something like an eternal (well not eternal but lasting so long as to be incomprehensible) inflation style cosmos even if such a thing didn't previously exist.\\
Of course there's also a case to be made that such an energy density is literally impossible so the entire scenario is just fundamentally wrong and unresolvable. Though whether trans-planckian scales are actually possible in this sense is probably impossible to say.

Anyway either way graham's number is just *so* large that there's probably no alien race that could ever encounter this wave of destructions in any form /other/ than by being outpaced and engulfed by it.

#+begin_quote
  ...put the mass of the universe in a sphere with radius ~70 lightyears...
#+end_quote

and not a Graham's Number of duplicates, since working with that would be tricky and its well beyond the point for me where all big numbers sorta look the same.

Specifically, I googled "mass of the universe" and [[http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/about-us/101-the-universe/cosmology-and-the-big-bang/general-questions/579-what-is-the-mass-of-the-universe-intermediate][this]] was the first result, which gives 3E55 g, which I misread as kg, so we're actually working with 3E52 kg. Assuming the average person commenting here weighs 75kg, we have 4E50 persons generated, which given the 1 person/3m^{3} stipulation, gives us 1.2E51 m^{3,} given an initial radius here of about [[https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=radius+of+sphere+with+volume+1.2E51+m%5E3+in+lightyears][7 ly]]. So off a bit from my initial hasty ballpark!

Incidentally, a black hole of that mass would have a Schwarzschild radius of 4.71 billion ly, so I'm not really sure how the whole thing would play out!

Sorry for any confusion!

Well, we'd immediately run into the problem that I have one wife and one child, who do not also duplicate. In other words, our collective is immediately faced with a very scarce resource. I think that would be something of a pain point, though maybe it could be overcome.

Given that, I'm tempted to go with a very low number of clones, especially since I'm not confident that having thousands of me would be a net improvement in my lives. I suppose the idea of being able to have lots of one-man startups, or play D&D with myself, or start a writing collective are all attractive, but ... well, if I wanted to leave my wife and son to go spend all day writing, I could do that /now/ (and I don't want to do that).

I'd also be extremely worried about the attention that would be brought down on me, both by the media and the government; all clones are probably not citizens. And $1000 starting cash isn't all that much, especially considering that we only have one SSN to share between us, making finding work quite difficult if we're not just fronting as though we were a single person.

Yah jobs would need to be found fast, though currentYou could ofc dip into savings and liquidate investments and such for more breathing room. I figured the $1000 would be enough for food in the short term and transport to some different city (where each you could check into a homeless shelter while getting on your feet), or a few weeks in a cheap motel.

*** Well I'm going to go with the boring answer and say that like most people i'm really not going to be able to accomplish world domination with this power. I'm just not ever going to be willing enough to sacrifice my life for most such plans to succeed (plus if I have to create such an absurd number of clones that die in order to take over the world you'd have to go to pretty great lengths afterwards for that to morally justifiable).

As a result I'm just going to have to try to go to a somewhat less sinister government (as in I think many european countries are less likely to hold me prisoner than the US). Then I'm going to become extremely famous for my abilities (since I don't really think I have much chance of evading notice for too long while using my abilities in useful ways anyway). Obviously fame will directly get me money, though that along will likely be somewhat unimpressive when split among my selves. After that though I would probably do the sort of things Noumero mentions with trying out many different things so that the whole collective can reap the rewards.\\
In addition however I would likely be highly prized for certain professions or tasks since after a while people will get a very good idea of my skills and psychological profile and there will be a large appeal to employing someone when you know exactly what you can expect from them. Of course I won't create any clones to take jobs I would hate, though I can likely make jobs easier and save massive amounts of money by eating soylent, sharing living expenses and divvying up the time at work (though many jobs can't easily have workload just split with clones who weren't recently created). Plus I would absolutely run d&d games with myself and do that sort of thing because it sounds really interesting.

As for original me I would likely spend most of my time learning new skills that would be useful for my clones and doing physical training and the like (it says they're identical to you reading it right now so I'm not exactly clear whether this would work, but on the plus side that might mean my clones will never be old). Since the comment seems to imply only the original has this ability and thus they need to be the one to learn anything that they want to be imparted to any new clones.

*** Boring answer: I'd create one, maybe two duplicates and we'd alternate which day we attend work. Maybe see if after a few weeks my duplicates are different enough from me that they'd be willing to each focus on a different one of my subgoals - have one attend university, another start a small business, the third focus on writing. Otherwise, split the subgoals between us as best we can (university would be most tricky as we can't equally split attending lectures or doing tests.

That said: it'll still make me less effective at my job since I won't remember conversations and meetings. Because my work is project-based, I'd assign my clones different projects and take copious notes of meetings and conversations. If someone comes up to me on YBJ day and asks about SECP, worst case I can say "sorry, I'm really pressed / sorry I'm not really sure let me double check", make a careful note of their SECP question, and have my SECP clone come back to them the next day for the discussion.

I'm poly so the impact on my family life, while no doubt a big deal, won't result in clone/s having to abandon my/their partners. Getting a second clone will probably require a third bedroom or fold out couch to be acquired.

All I anticipate accomplishing is working part-time whilst having a full-time income.

** You can create zones of altered gravity within a half-kilometer radius, essentially adding another vector to local conditions. You must be able to accurately visualize the area to be affected in detail (being able to see this area is best, but not strictly required if you know where all of the large masses in that area are and how they are moving at the time this power begins to affect them). The energy required to affect these changes comes from somewhere else, but the level of mental detail required is difficult to maintain for long periods of time.

You can affect about four cubic meters of space at a time, in any shape you desire, with a level of precision equal to about a centimeter. The level of gravitational change depends on how much space you are affecting at one time; affecting the full 4m^{3} would barely be able to counteract the effects of Earth's gravity (1G of change, essentially), and the effect scales logarithmically with area; a 1cm^{3} area could be increased to almost 7G of gravity.

These zones of increased gravity can affect objects and people alike, but due to interactions with other powers, in order to affect living beings and any objects held or worn by them, they must either be fully included within a zone or must be willing to be affected by the power; concentrating 7G on part of someone's heart won't work, so the most that can be applied to the average-sized adult is around 5 or 6G, evenly spread out across their body (depending on how accurately you can visualize the space they occupy and mentally predict their movements).

Given all of these caveats, how would you use this power in personal combat?

*** Well, seeing as 5G - 1G = -4G, applying this anti-gravity on a person would cause them to fall straight upwards much much faster than you would regularly fall straight down.

So... why would you ever fight hand-to-hand? Just target them from far away, and once they are affected they are either off to outer space or stuck, desperately hanging on to the ground to avoid being sent to outer space. And now you can just throw rocks at them until they let go or die.

Alternatively, if for some reason you can't bring the fight outdoors, the question needs to be further defined. Are you restricted in the direction of this gravitational pull? For example, can you pull/push someone eastwards with your gravity? If so, push them out of the building then upwards into outer space.

If not, then pull them straight down instead. 5G + 1G = 6G, which is enough to give them severe blood flow problems, especially to their brain. They would be forced to adopt postures not friendly for combat, like lying on the ground, in order to keep pumping blood to their brains. Then, once again, you can just stand far away and throw stuff at them.

**** You can't apply the anti-gravity to the person, just the space they occupy, so once they get farther than a half-kilometer away they've left your sphere of influence. You can certainly fling people into the air at high speeds, but anyone worth getting into a fight with is going to have powers of their own, and may or may not get hurt by a landing like that.

Flinging people out of doors and windows sounds like a neat plan, actually, but if you break line of sight you have to be able to predict where they are in space in relation to you and how they're moving; you don't gain any innate sensory knowledge of the space you're modifying, and if they can manage to get a body part outside of that space their own powers will allow them to act as though unaffected.

The blood flow thing, I didn't consider that, so that could be cool. I did modify the question from 'hand-to-hand' to 'personal combat', since you're right, not much point to getting up close and personal unless you want to show off.

***** Oh right, forgot about the half kilometer radius, hmm. Ok, new plan: again, shoot them upwards using maximum anti gravity, but now, before they leave your sphere of influence, adjust your gravity manipulation to the point where they simply float in midair, no movement in any direction.

Now that they are stuck in midair, they can't really move, since there's nothing solid near them for them to push themselves away from. They could blow air out of their mouths, but you can just counter that minor force by adjusting your gravity. They could throw stuff at you, but unless its something super fast (like bullets shot by a gun), it would be easy to shove the projectile out of the way in mid flight using gravity.

Now, if they have guns, then you'll need to work extra. I do not recommend using your gravity on the bullets, in most cases, it won't change their trajectories fast enough. Instead, if you're outdoors, you should pull up the ground to form an earth wall to block bullets. If you're indoors, you should just take cover behind furniture and stuff like a regular person. Then throw them out the building as before.

For more specific strategies, you're going to need to specify what superpowers you're fighting against.

That's entirely fair. For context, this would be in the RWBY universe; it's an OC's Semblance.

If that doesn't mean anything in particular to you, Semblances are varied and mostly unique to the character that has them, and everyone has Aura, which is like a personal forcefield that heals/protects/empowers themselves, right up until it runs out.

Guns that transform into melee weapons are common, a substance called Dust can be used to create ammunition that interacts with one's Semblance, and first year students at a military academy are routinely flung kilometers into the air, as an entrance exam, with the reasonable expectation they'll figure out how to land safely.

******* Oh... oh. That will be hard. The people in RWBY are just too hardy to be taken out by anything 7G worth of gravity would throw at them or them at, unless you have a loooot of space to accelerate. But then, seeing as you have to keep up with whatever you're accelerating in order to keep it within 0.5 kilometers distance of you, air resistance would burn you up. So you probably won't even be able to scratch them using conventional methods.

You're going to need some drastic measures.

First, you need to shoot yourself out into outer space. You will need to bring along a bubble of air around yourself, or you would suffocate or die from decompression. However, air is not solid, so it will constantly be trying to disperse. Nevertheless, 5G of gravity is enough to keep it around you by constantly changing the direction of gravity and applying it at the outer edges, effectively batting the ball of air back and forth around yourself. You will also need to compress it to heat it up so you don't freeze to death in outer space.

Now, fly yourself towards a large meteor, and push it towards Earth using your gravity. That, at last, will be enough to kill off your enemies (along with everyone you know and love).

*** Can you split up the power on multiple areas at a time?

Your power can easily move a small tank-like metal block/sphere for you to sit in. This may make you invincible against some opponents.

You can fly. With a spacesuit, to the moon, in about an hour. With some more run-up and proper targetting, you can orbitally bombard the enemy.

You do not need to be in line of sight with the enemy. Every camera feeding information to you can be used as a remotely operated drone. Anywhere you can "see", you can poltergeist around. Homing grenades come to mind.

As long as you can accurately visualize all of those areas and the major masses within them, yes. I haven't decided on what exactly the threshold for what constitutes a 'major mass' is yet, but furniture definitely is, the average contents of someone's pocket definitely isn't.

I hadn't considered using wireless cameras as drones. Although you don't need line of "sight", you do need line of "effect", so it's got to be within a half kilometer, but that's still pretty potent.

*** I tried doing the math for a torus filled with steel BBs. Even at 1/5ths partial air pressure, and using micro areas of 5gravities to swing the BBs around like a makeshift railgun, with optimal conditions, I can only get them up to about 110km/h at terminal velocity. So you can make a fairly decent gun, but worse than you could just buy.

Worth trying just to see if the math works out. Unfortunately it does not.

**** What if you just took a standard gun and altered gravity so that no matter what direction you were firing in the bullet was always 'falling'? Would air resistance prevent you from getting too much in the way of additional speed, do you think?

***** Guns already fire projectiles at way over terminal velocity. If you fired one from orbit straight down, the projectile would actually lose kinetic energy.

At best it could help you fire long distances accurately, if you make a hollow cylinder of outward gravity that reduces air pressure within it. Sort of like having an invisible really long rifle barrel.

Edit: though you could get a lot easier long range shots by counteracting downward gravity so there is no bullet drop over distance. And making the bullet fall toward your target would reduce wind drift on the bullet.

So, all in all, could be great with a sniper rifle.

***** That gives me another idea. You never said the direction of gravity has to be in objective reference. You could make an object fall at 5g toward a moving person as its gravity point.

Carry a bunch of needles (either injections or acupuncture) and make them fall toward the nerve clusters of your enemies at 4g. While using 1g worth of force to make them effectively weightless. The gravity doesn't affect the person, it is just the point that objects fall toward.

*** Well, you could certanly use it to hurl projectiles at great speed. Throw something at them, and then while it's in the air, create a gravitational field pulling it towards your target. If it accelerates for 4 meters at 1 g (9.8 m/s), then by the time it leaves the gravitational bubble it's going 39.2 m/s. You could do even better, though; you don't need a 4 meter sphere, just a narrow tube shaped space, so you could either make it a lot longer, use a higher G force, or both. (The exact best answer would depend on things like how much g force you get for how much volume, how aerodynamic the object you are throwing is, ect. ) And with practice you should be able to make it so your object would never miss, by making the gravity pull the object right to the target.

*** I can use this power to fly. Quite rapidly. If I am in danger, therefore, I can quickly get away.

Thus, I always fight at range.

I can protect myself from most ranged attacks with an invisible zone of altered gravity between me and the shooter. If I change the direction of the gravitational pull quickly and unpredictably, then I'm hard to hit (not impossible, faster and more massless missiles will be less affected, and I'd need a lot more power to be able to handle lasers, but it should handle thrown rocks).

I can also use my power to accelerate missiles. If I'm trying to be lethal and have no inhibitions, the answer is sewing needles dipped in poison; they're small enough to be extremely rapidly accelerated, cheap enough to buy in quantity, and the poison may not be necessary but may also help. (Major targets are eyes, throat, heart).

If I'm not trying to be lethal, then trying to pile enough gravity on the opponent to hold him down and cause him to black out is probably my best bet.

** What would you do with a Green Lantern ring? From what I understand, the biggest limitations are that the constructs are made of hard light (so you can't make food or fuel or anything like that), they're limited by your imagination (so you can't summon "a machine that solves Problem X" without knowing what that machine would look like), and they disappear when not being actively maintained.

*** I guess it depends on whether I'm still beholden to the Green Lantern Corps, or whether I have a hypothetical Green Lantern ring without all the baggage of being a Green Lantern in a world that's constantly beset by alien shenanigans.

If it's just normal Earth, then I guess I put my efforts toward space travel; I can make an enormous amount of money putting satellites into orbit, doing maintenance, and eliminating space junk. I can help to establish a Mars colony pretty easily. And if I remember Green Lantern well enough, I can travel well in excess of the speed of light, so I can aid in the understanding of our universe.

In terms of actually making stuff ... well, part of how I'd /start/ is using my wealth to hire a team of experts that would explain to me how certain things work, and who will help me to design things that I can imagine. Depending on the limits of the ring, I might be able to solve the nuclear waste problem, or clean the oceans of plastic, or a number of other things. Maybe I could single-handedly put a stop to climate change with the right sort of massive air purifier. You need to maintain concentration on what the ring creates, so the obvious workaround is to create lasting effects and/or infrastructure.

**** Honestly the biggest problem I have with visibly using the ring, letting others know about its existence, is that the ring can be stolen. It's a superpower that's inherent to the ring, not you. I.e., someone steals it, game over.

In a sense Green Lantern is the most useless superhero, everyone else is still something even when all their tools are taken away. Even batman has his bat brain. And Iron man has money. Hal has nothing at all. Nothing.

So, I could use the ring to assemble non-Ring machinery and objects. Like a really long rope made of carbon nanotubes. (It shouldn't be /too/ difficult for me to get as far as a space elevator, which will then give me access to the mineral wealth of the asteroid belt... though having a Ring gives me access to that in any case, I guess...)
