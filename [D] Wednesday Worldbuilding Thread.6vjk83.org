Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** For elves, there are two competing ideals; fäsh and shilaal. Fäsh is sometimes translated as "perfection", but a closer reading is "homeostasis", in other words, a thing remaining as it is. Shilall is sometimes translated as "improvement", but a better, more complex translation would be "integration of the positive".

Fäsh is the idealized end for an elf, a point beyond which no change will ever be made again, because all possible positive qualities have been integrated, thereby making shilaal unnecessary. Fäsh /by itself/ is not a good thing, because of course homeostasis is possible when a thing is suboptimal - enduring, but not perfect. The specific word for "fäsh with no room for shilaal" is "ulfäsh", which "elvish" comes from in the human tongue (and the human extrapolation, "elf", which the elves disdain to use).

The elven relationship with shilaal is complicated. On the one hand, shilaal is by definition good, but on the other, shilaal is also /aspirational/; the goal of shilaal is to move from fäsh to fäsh, which offers quite a bit of room for errors and in some cases will result in either extended negative effects before fäsh is achieved, or sometimes even death. Ideally, shilaal will be as fäsh as possible. Where a human will sloppily swing a sword over and over again until he finally gets it right more often than not, the ideal elf will study and meditate on the sword until he can perform his sword stroke perfectly the very first time he ever does it. Rapid iteration, in other words, is not for the elves.

*** I like it, which means I want to change it a bit: consider the sword swing example. At the moment I see a tension between "will not swing" but "will study/meditate". After all, the new knowledge has to come from somewhere. So I propose that the elf keeps its current state so firmly in mind, like a computer backup, that essaying a swing would not necessarily change itself - unlike the human who rewires himself with every swing or thought. Then, any new information - from swinging, or reading about it, any practice that would make sense from the current state - would be used to create a mental conception of an idealised swing, and only when that conception becomes complete does the elf adjoin it to its current state. (It seems too easy to integrate small bits of improvement, which seems to be allowed by you at the moment.)

So the elf might well swing the sword "clumsily" a few times before he adjoins an ideal swing. You could have it as a matter of status the fewer times some form of practice is used before the ideal is reached.

An elf would have to be careful what sort of things they decide to achieve: if they pick something they can't create an ideal conception of in a reasonable time or using forms of practice they can easily think of, then they might never finish, and they'd have this huge chunk of memory taken up which would be a psychological itch and occasionally spit out some new form of practice that would seem very strange, like, for the sword swing example (though I expect elves to handle that just fine) maybe they pick too broad a conception of swing to start with, and they end up having to try to get idealised proprioception like a sense of space that goes for a hundred metres in each direction down to the accuracy of what their fingertips can sense. A rare success along these lines would give differentiation among elves, because you'd get these from initial mistakes and lucky breaks, and most elves wouldn't want to take such a risk.

You could get forms of madness from incomplete conceptions. Taboo madness might arise from multiple such. Or what happens when they successfully complete a conception, but it's a large one and would dominate their behaviour afterwards, and it becomes harder to think of them as humanoids because of it. Exaggerated example: all their motions have some of the motivation of a sword swing in them, because it's all mediated by a spatial sense which was created with that as a base. Plenty of opportunity for "quirks" that don't detract from perfect sword swings that way.

** I'm brainstorming methods by one might uplift or otherwise increase the intelligence of an animal. I'm personally interested in methods that would fit a science fiction sort of setting but more fantastic methods are welcome, since I hope that this can be of help to others as well.

Current ideas:

- The standard "do some gene tinkering, make the brain bigger" method. This might be sufficient for e.g. chimpanzees or even large dogs, but smaller animals will probably not qualify.
- Implant a very small computer, which essentially simulates additional brain matter. These uplifts are cyborgs, and they almost certainly lose their higher reasoning abilities if the computer is damaged.

*** For me, the biggest question about uplifting was always why anyone would want to? Digital artificial intelligence can do things humans can't, can be programmed with safety features, and are subject to relatively easy modification as needed. Biological artificial intelligence is basically just a human, but more expensive to both create and maintain due to different biological and psychological requirements.

The one story I've read that justified it to my satisfaction is Freefall, where the purpose was to create people who could colonize a planet with biochemistry that was compatible with some animals but not humans. Eclipse Phase gets an honorable mention for being a setting where mind uploading is so common that uplifts just means more options for your body, but I could never reconcile that with the systemic racism they face.

**** Another reason that might be interesting to explore is that certain animals may think differently, which could lead to unique ideas that would be difficult for a human to visualise. Cephalopods, especially octopuses, are quite smart, but have taken a different evolutionary path to humans. Maybe a sapient octopus would be better at visualising higher dimensions? It would be an interesting idea to explore in any case, and might see more interesting uplift candidates than apes or dogs.

*** From your examples I'm getting the feeling that you're wanting ideas on how you have a small brain case fit a "humanly intelligent" brain rather than on, say, what the machine itself would look like or anything about the social consequences. So I'm gonna focus on those aspects, though the whole thing is pretty interesting to think about.

You're basically limited to a few broad methods:

- Make the brain bigger

  - Bigger head for bigger brain
  - Squish/reshape organs, have brain matter distributed somehow (think the incorrect meme about stegosaurs having a brain in their hips)
  - Cyborg tech: brain chip interfaces with "the cloud" for brain power (plot opportunity: if the internet goes down, the creature gets downlifted)
  - Cyborg tech: brain chip interfaces with "harddrive" that is implanted in skin or worn as backpack (hard for suspension of disbelief with sufficiently advanced tech, since the hard drive should be pretty tiny).

- Make the brain more efficient

  - Cyborg implant
  - Genetic engineering (retrovirus?): have the neurons more efficient, closer together, etc

- Re-optimise the brain

  - Birds (say) are really optimised to control their wings for flight (or: dogs for smell/etc). Perhaps if the parts of their brain used for flying were co-opted for higher thought, you'd be able to fit human-level intelligence into that brain. Practical upshot: the animal makes some "trade off" for its intelligence.
  - As above but you use tech to "give back" the ability that the brain is no longer able to do e.g. give the bird a jetpack, or e.g. replace the part of the brain that controls the heart beat with a pacemaker (from an anatomical POV not sure how much "thinking power" the pons or whatever has)
  - As above but make the animal a head in a vat/robot so all the machinery associated with controlling the body can be used for thought (inverse of the "give them a cyborg intelligence chip" idea)

** I think I've found a way to rationalize the slice of life genre. In the transhumanist future setting of Eclipse Phase, civilization on Earth was wiped out by the Singularity and the survivors fled into space. To help rebuild civilization, they decided to raise thousands of children in a simulation at accelerated time. This being Eclipse Phase, it of course all went horribly wrong and the kids were all driven insane, but what if it had worked?

The kids would grow up in a environment meant to resemble reality as closely as possible, but lack the ability to do any real harm to each other. It'd be a relatively tranquil place where they're sheltered from anything more than inconvenience in order to condition them into being good citizens. Their lives would generally revolve around education since they're being trained to help rebuild society.

That sounds a whole lot like a slice of life anime, doesn't it? Students dealing with low-tension problems in a world where bad things just don't happen to them regardless of their decisions or aptitudes. Even if they try to physically hurt each other, there are no lasting consequences to it. Yet it all still looks like our reality because they will eventually leave for the outside world to make a life for themselves.

** Trying to make a short post today, but as always it's about vampires! Specifically, vampire clothing!

A lot of the time fiction has vampires wearing either really old-timey clothes (I guess because they're used to them), or just whatever people are wearing in the "present day". Old-timey clothes are often justified with "well it's what they grew up with!" and present day clothes with "they want to blend in!". Both of those justifications don't really work when you think about it.

The idea of a vampire from ancient Rome just casually wearing a toga around is kind of lame, because did that vampire decide there was no fashion that appealed to them more in 2000 years of time and who knows how many different continents than a fancy draped sheet? Were they not as amazed by purple dye as everyone else?

But then the idea of a vampire in 2017 sporting purple hair and an undercut is also kind of lame. If this vampire is not trying to "fit in" with human society, why would she care about following a fashion trend that's only ~5-10 years old for anything other than a bit of fun? And if she is, she could "fit in" with clothes that are slightly dated: no need for her to be fashion forward. But really, why wouldn't she have tailors make her exactly what she wants to wear, and if it's a bizarre combination of a poodle skirt, corset, and stilettos, if she's only wearing those around other vampires and humans she's about to eat, why does it matter?

Actually, on the purple dye thing: I could see a vampire enjoying wearing purple for a few hundred years after it was cheap to do so just because of the novelty of it. Are there any other "advances in fashion" that are surprisingly recent that vampires might be really into? Like, I suppose there are vampires out there who have tons of velcro in their clothing because they think it's so amazing and cool and new?

Obviously, the older the mean vampire age, the older fashion will tend to be as a result of inertia.

**** I didn't want it to get too bogged down in my very expansive mythology, but since you asked, My Vampires' population went through a bottleneck ~1700 CE, reducing from 20k to 800 individuals. It recovers to ~20k in 1900 and then I believe that growth rate puts them on ~100k in 2000. This also makes the median age /very, very young/ (85% of vampires are less than 100 years a vampire).

#+end_quote

My Vampires certainly do and it comes up a lot, but I tended to write it as the colour and the way e.g. the sleeves are rolled as being what has the effect rather than whether your suit is more appropriate to the 70s or the 90s. Essentially, a pale yellow shirt means you're appreciative that an important friend is honouring you with a visit, and it doesn't matter if it's a singlet or a button up. This doesn't make that much sense though it does give vampires a lot of flexibility in what they choose to wear if they want to blend in - but they normally don't need to.

So I wonder if my saying "vampires clothing colours, the way they fold sleeves up, and the way they lace their shoes matter, but it doesn't matter at all whether they're wearing a 3 piece suit or a bathing suit" is dumb. /Probably/ they all intersect: a suit means something different than a bathing suit, and a yellow t-shirt means something different to a yellow button up shirt, but whatever outfit you choose is "Turing-complete" so to speak.

Here's a self-indulgent excerpt from my story to explain a bit how the clothing works, I might edit it to make it more explicit though:

#+begin_quote
  William couldn't help but take note of the precise angle that the night porter was wearing his hat at; the place he had rolled his sleeves up to, and the number of times he had folded the sleeve to do it. To a vampire, such aspects of one's attire were carefully composed, and each button, each fold, and each accessory brought a meaning to the outfit. If the porter had been a vampire, he would be signalling for a private meeting with a superior. It was unambiguous. It was absurd; he had never heard of a human stumbling upon a coherent message like that.

*** I'd expect the new vampires to look timeless, and the oldest vampires to look like painfully trendy hipsters.

Figure I'm a vampire. I get turned. Then, I get distracted by vampire culture. Years 0-20, I fit in as a native. Years 20-60, I look like a weirdly dated native. Maybe I was a kid who latched onto my parents' fashion.

At 60-80 years, everyone who grew up wearing my outfit is dead. I'd look unnaturally dated, so I'd need to take a while to learn to look normal again. Fortunately, I still have some baseline understanding of culture to work from.

Contrast with a vampire who's 300+ years old. They'd have no idea what's going on culture-wise. And wouldn't want to spend a year talking to young people to figure it out. Those vampires should throw money at the problem.

This means that I'd expect old vampires to have a "cultural assistant" picking out their wardrobe, explaining current events, and updating them on slang. In some ways, it would be a form of conspicuous consumption. It also means that old vampires are taking advice from people who's livelihood depends on chasing new trends.

So, the Master Vampire would have a hipster undercut and all-birds shoes. They'd be fashion-forward in ways that require tons of effort (on behalf of their assistants), while 'timeless' clothing would be a new vampire thing.

Agreed; these could even be human. There are definitely wardrobe services (you know, trunkclub and all that but for rich people), and there are high-level English teachers who teach people how to turn phrases like natives. Vampires can quite easily make humans do their bidding so this is easy.

Then again, turning a human into a vampire is very difficult, and there's no clear benefit from doing so; so perhaps some of them periodically turn a young, "with it" human into a vampire and learn the appropriate human nuances from them. But that would probably be too large an investment for something as unimportant in the scheme of things as fitting in human culture.

*** I think practicality and mix-and-match mentality might play a big role in it. Your roman vampire for instance, she may simply adore handbags and not be fond of pockets, simply because she didn't grow up with the concept of pockets. She wouldn't care about that accessory or utility in her clothes as much as someone from a different era (or same era and other cultural background).

On the other hand you may have a strong tendency to delineate generations of vampires, since age is a prestige thing and you signal your age by the way you clothe yourself. Think of age-correlated ‘uniforms' or styles in clothing here, something to show fellow vampires “I'm from this era!”, while at the same time not appearing too outlandish compared to normal humans. This might tie in as an identifier, actually, if that's a thing. If vampires don't immediately recognise their ‘species' clothes may be a valid tool to indicate what they are. Kind of like early christians (when they were still a sect, not a religion) and the fish.

Lastly and unrelated, if you don't have any plans for events taking place during the bottleneck event, you can simply leave it unexplained as well. Just have it as an event with recognisable naming, and keep in the back of your mind what that particular vampire might think of it, and have it not mentioned much. Compare, for instance, to 9/11. It's a date, and you don't need to explain to virtually anyone what happened on that day, since it's a day you were (likely) alive and a consequence you were affected by, in whatever way. When you speak with other people, you don't go into the particulars of that day, since you don't need to -- everyone /knows/ what happened.

The same applies to your vampires, be they sired pre or post event. They will know what happened, they will be affected by it, either directly or indirectly, and it will likely be a touchy subject for the older, which means it'd be reasonably avoided by the younger lest they anger their elders. And since it's been centuries, the event and its particulars and circumstances won't likely come up. It's not recent history for humans, and even for vampires it likely won't be. Important, yes, but how often do you think of WWII in everyday life, for instance. You life was shaped by it, but not in any way you would time thinking on. Unless that's your kind of hobby and interest, of course, but that's not the point.

Anyway, that my 2 cents.

That is a very good point. Vampires can probably recognise each other based on smell and such, but that probably requires a level of proximity. (Vampires don't have to breathe, don't have to have a heartbeat, don't have to have a warm body, etc, but can choose to do any of the above).

Using that as a point of comparison is excellent. Any time vampires talk about the /Catastrophe/, I should replace Catastrophe with 911 and see how it scans. Thank you!

***** I have thoughts. Here are some:

First of, Hécatomba is an entirely valid name. It will work if you use it. Be advised, though, that I as a native German speaker and avid reader don't remember that word being used, ever.

However, it is a good callback for the ancient vampires, since they /will/ know that word, know about its /current/ use and also its /historical/ significance.

That said, names are /weird/. They pop up and are generated somewhat randomly, and if you want to have any indication as to how that occurs naturally, look to the past, because these days there's historians and media that will slap on their label and that will propagate. For instance, take wars. WW1 was usually called The War, until WW2 happened. Hereabouts it's still simply called The War, and differentiated to the other world war only when necessary. If it comes in casual observation though, it's only The War. I presume the US treat these two wars linguistically differently, since they had many more wars since then, and we were entering the age of mass media around that time anyway.

So look further back, and elsewhere than war (contemporaries will likely referred to any last war that personally affected them as The War, and only clarify when necessary). You're effectively talking about natural disasters, and the only with such an impact in modern history that come to mind are plagues and volcanic eruptions, maybe. The most noteworthy of the former is called the Black Death, because 1) you died from it and 2) black is a malignant colour (the necrotic tissue turning black is a more modern explanation). Contemporaries of the time called it differently, though: the *great mortality*, or the *great plague*. I assume the reason for this was that pestilence was not that uncommon, but the scales for that epidemic were unprecedented in such a way that even ‘decimation' is to weak a word to use.

My point is, contemporaries refer to stark events differently than later generations (or their historians). The former will feel less need to specify what they talking about, since it was the most radical/intruding/incisive event in their personal history, but the latter will treat it as mere history. Important, yes, but ‘come on, that was, like, three hundred years ago. That's basically ancient times.' Youngsters may call it Hécatomba, but the older vampires will simply call it Then.

Which is also a good way to drop the name, and then leave it infuriatingly unexplained for the next two novels, because it's not even tangentially relevant to the current story threads.

  Oldie: No, /Then/.

  Youngster: Oh! You mean the hécatomba, why don't you say so?

  Oldie: Do you want me to continue or not?

  Youngster: Yes yes, go on.

All this writing made me curious, do the vampires have a lingua franca? I mean, they're all old enough to learn a couple languages (assuming they don't run into storage problems in their brains with age), but languages evolve with time, and disuse fosters forgetting, even of languages. For the middle ages it would have been Latin, or Pidgin Latin, or whatever traders spoke, and for the ancient times it was bastardised Phoenician and such, but the thought remains: did a lingua franca emerge for vampires?

Lastly, you can have vampires speak off-kilter in dated and anachronistic language (a staple of immortality fiction, I'm told) under a specific circumstance: they speak a language they didn't for quite some time. It will have dated terminology, dated grammar, and will likely reflect the social status and stratum they frequented when they learned the language. You lived 20 years as a baker Cologne in 1500 before moving to England for the rest of your time? Your German will reflect that; you will not only have a dialect, but a sociolect and a chronolect, +to coin a term+ [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronolect][which is an actual term in linguistics]].

I found the word "hécatombe" in there, which is why I added it to my French vocab list. Now, admittedly I don't know if me finding it in a very niche book means it's a common word in French or not, but a [[http://www.wordreference.com/fren/hecatombe][FR-EN dictionary]] translates it to "massacre" or "slaughter". But I did find it "in the wild" rather than in a "word of the day" list, whatever /that's/ worth. (not that it necessarily matters: the rest of your post kind of makes me reconsider it altogether)

#+begin_quote
  However, it is a good callback for the ancient vampires, since they /will/ know that word, know about its /current/ use and also its /historical/ significance.
#+end_quote

Vampires and language is a weird concept, really. They learn a language at a time and place, and with their better than human memories they probably remember it for quite a while, and can relearn it within a few weeks. The more languages they learn, the more easily they pick new ones up, too. And, well, from a vampire conception of time spending 2 months learning a new language is not a major investment. But they might not pick up on nuances of words as they change, unless they make a habit of reading a lot of human-created media (which they probably have little interest in).

#+begin_quote
  For instance, take wars. WW1 was usually called The War, until WW2 happened. [...] I presume the US treat these two wars linguistically differently, since they had many more wars since then, and we were entering the age of mass media around that time anyway.
#+end_quote

I'm Australian so I'm not sure how the US names the wars; I know that WW1 was called "the great war" before WW2 happened though.

#+begin_quote
  [a bunch of extremely good perspective on what people called things that effected them personally, culminating] Youngsters may call it Hécatomba, but the older vampires will simply call it Then.
#+end_quote

YES. This is very true.

#+begin_quote
  Which is also a good way to drop the name, and then leave it infuriatingly unexplained for the next two novels, because it's not even tangentially relevant to the current story threads.

    Oldie: No, I met him some time ago. We were cleaning up the consequences of That Time and wore these stupid plague masks. Well, now we say stupid, but at The Time it was the only recurse we had.

    Youngster: At which time, you mean? The Plague?

    Oldie: No, /Then/.

    Youngster: Oh! You mean the hécatombe, why don't you say so?

    Oldie: Do you want me to continue or not?

    Youngster: Yes yes, go on.
  #+end_quote
#+end_quote

I /really, really love this/. My story's supernatural romance and I have all these implied wars and plagues that I am going to be leaving infuriatingly unexplained, so an exchange like this sounds like a wonderful idea.

#+begin_quote
  All this writing made me curious, do the vampires have a lingua franca?
#+end_quote

I didn't picture them having one: I pictured them communicating in whatever language they happened to share, possibly with some levels of prestige if you both happen to speak e.g. ancient frankish circa 300 CE. My story opens with a vampire going to Italy for an Opera, but events like that are planned far in advance (as well as e.g. vampire meetings to discuss business). So I'd imagine the promotional material would say "Lady Vettori is writing an opera. It will be shown in Rome in July 1944. Language Italian circa 1870 with parts in Arabic circa 1750." or "You have been called to see Queen Anastasia's presentation of her newest progeny. To take place in August 2015. Ceremony to be performed in contemporary Russian and Old Roman Latin."; a vampire can spend a few months learning/brushing up on the language as required. And if you never learned Old Roman Latin, either because you could never be bothered or because you are too young, well, you'd better have a friend who is able to do you the favour of teaching you, or hope the vampire who created you is willing to tutor you.

#+begin_quote
  disuse fosters forgetting, even of languages.
#+end_quote

That's true but IME it comes back when you try to use it again: I remember I didn't speak any French for some 5 years, went to Lyon on holiday and after 3 days I started having words come into my brain. Like, I'd get the feeling that the word for A was B, and then I'd look it up in my travel dictionary and I'd be right. More words came to me as the days went on (forgot the word for "stamp" and then the next day "timbre" was just in my brain, fully formed). I imagine vampires would be even better than me at this, because my French wasn't great to begin with.

#+begin_quote
  For the middle ages it would have been Latin, or Pidgin Latin, or whatever traders spoke, and for the ancient times it was bastardised Phoenician and such, but the thought remains: did a lingua franca emerge for vampires?
#+end_quote

The thought of vampires having their own "secret language" is quite compelling. I wonder if they would just speak ancient Korean or something and call it a day, or if they'd construct a language? I suppose much like esperanto many vampires would try and few would succeed.

#+begin_quote
  Lastly, you can have vampires speak off-kilter in dated and anachronistic language under a specific circumstance: they speak a language they didn't for quite some time.
#+end_quote

Yeah... my vampire speaks that way, but I feel on some level you have to give characters vocal tics to make them easy to tell apart when written, and I don't think he's too bad. (Just FYI, I have a bad habit of plopping prose from my mostly-finished story in worldbuilding threads in order to demonstrate things, so in keeping with that bad habit I've put some sample dialogue to show you what I mean. If you object to this habit, let me know and I'll stop doing it to you!)

#+begin_quote
  It will have dated terminology, dated grammar, and will likely reflect the social status and stratum they frequented when they learned the language.
#+end_quote

Yeah, doing that requires a hell of a lot more research than I think anyone can really expect to do for a story. I'd like to be able to do it but... not gonna happen I don't think. Something I /did/ try was, if a character was speaking French, I'd write the dialog in English (of course) but structure it as a "literal translation" of what the French dialogue might be. So things like avoiding gerunds, using "more old" rather than "older" since French doesn't have the latter construction, etc. A beta reader said it was a stupid convention to make since I should try to have my English represent the way they sound to a French speaker rather than try to make them sound like a French speaker speaking English, if you get me.

STORY EXCERPT:

--------------

“Thank you for bringing my clothes.” William said, shrugging on his shirt. It was a dark maroon that reminded Red of the thick blood that had been in the warm cups at the ritual.

“Happy to help.” Red shrugged.

“Now we have a gargoyle, things are going to be easier than they once were.” He remarked, carefully doing up the buttons.

“So... you're going to...” He paused, searching for the words. “Keep him?”

William smiled. “Yes. Although my defeat has been rather humiliating, I believe he shall be an asset.”

Red nodded. “Yeah. I'm feeling a lot better about having him around, too.”

“Ah, he has been of assistance whilst I was away?” He walked to the bedroom.

Red shook his head, following. “No, it's not that. I've been talking to him a lot. It's... a little creepy. But he's happy... He's not unhappy about... serving. Which is good, I suppose?”

“Oh, is that so?” William asked with mild amusement. He went to the cupboard and selected a pair of dark brown suspenders and started buttoning them onto his pants.

“It's still weird. But it's for the best. I wasn't sure how we were going to release him without making things worse, but he seems happy, so...”

“Why would we do that?” William frowned as he examined himself in the mirror, adjusting his curly blonde hair yet again. “Such a creature will be extremely useful when I return home.”

Let's talk this concept: An orbiting focal lens which aims light over random sections of the planet whenever it lines up with the sun just so.

I so want to some discussion around this idea.

Would the earth even be habitable if every eclipse was so deadly?

*** We'd need some math. According to [[http://tsanad.blogspot.com/2011/04/living-on-moon-how-bright-is-night.html][this site]], "The energy hitting a square meter of the Earth or moon each second is 1400 Joules". The moon is 2,159 miles wide, which would give the circular lens a flat surface area of 3.6 million square miles. Divide and then multiply, and that's [[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(3.6+million+square+miles+%2F+1+square+meter)+*+1400+Joules][13 quadrillion Joules]] per second. That's on the level of an atomic bomb every second.

/However,/ the lens would be imperfectly focusing except under just the right conditions (even assuming the lens was tidally locked like the moon is), we can't actually assume 100% energy focusing, and the effects of the beam of light would by themselves cause particulate scattering that would negate at least some of the effects. The Earth would almost certainly get hotter, and there would be wide-spread devastation along the path (and outside it due to the heat and energy, which would probably cause destructive weather), but I don't think it would be /uninhabitable/, just difficult for civilization.

I think the big question is what effect a focal lens like that would have on the oceans, since that's where most eclipses happen. The "once every hundred years giant wildfire from the eclipse" would probably have /different/ life (especially trees) more adapted to periodic fires, but it would still be feasible.

But if the water temperature fluctuated by several degrees every few years, this could have a big impact on microscopic sea life and might make things uninhabitable to life as we know it.

Realistically though, if the lens was always there, life probably would have evolved to be able to handle those big temperature variations (or the ocean is so big / eclipses so short that even reasonably frequent temperature variations like this would only have local effects anyway), so life would probably be OK.

Fynbos (a plant kingdom that currently exists on Earth) is so well-adapted to periodic fires that it actually /requires/ periodic fires to survive (the seeds of several species won't germinate without enough heat).

It's not that hard to recognise; it's got very thin, very dry leaves. Much like kindling.

***** Yeah, I actually live in such a biome! I actually have a friend who works for the "forest department" and she goes on helicopter rides and sets parts of the bush on fire, because fire is so common/important in the local ecosystem and it's better to have controlled burns during winter than giant bushfires in summer.

In fact, [[https://www.dpaw.wa.gov.au/management/fire/fire-and-the-environment/41-traditional-aboriginal-burning][bushfires have been used for tens of thousands of years by the local people]] for all sorts of reasons!

*** I wouldn't worry about the large-scale effects too much.

We'd have the same average solar radiation as if we didn't have a moon. Instead of shading a large area and losing that energy (which is what happens in a normal eclipse), you shade a large area and shunt that energy to a small area.

*** [[https://what-if.xkcd.com/145/][Relevant What-If]]

The most dramatic effect possible with lenses is doubling the brightness of the sun in some areas.

Right now, the sky is about 0.001% sun and 99.999% cold space. Lenses act to change some of the sky from something (like cold space) to something else (like the sun). During a moonbeam, the sky would be 0.001% sun, 0.001% sun-via-moonlens and 99.998% cold space.

The reason why you can start fires with a handheld magnifying glass but not the moonlens is that you can make a handheld magnifying glass take up half the sky instead of the 0.001% that the moon is.
