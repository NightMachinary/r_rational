*Synopsis*

What if you really were transported to a fantasy world and expected to kill monsters to survive? No special abilities, no OP weapons, no status screen to boost your stats and no cheat mode. Never mind finding the dragon's treasure or defeating the Demon Lord, you only need to worry about one thing---how to stay alive.

A group of young Brits wake up in a strange, fantastical land with creatures from myth and legend. They are given archaic weapons they don't know how to use and told to do their best.

Convinced it has to be some kind of virtual reality RPG, all the people summoned form parties and set off on their adventures, leaving behind the people nobody wants in their group.

Story of my life, thinks Colin.

*** Thanks. Time travel is one of my favourite and at the same time hated tropes. The idea of it is so fascinating, but the execution in most stories tends to be similar and/or have massive plot holes.

I started with the intention of sending it up, but had to actually come up with a system that made some kind of sense. Not the easiest thing to do when you're improvising the story on the fly. Just glad I got to an ending (eventually).

**** You did well! I must say.

Question though; has the rest of the group arrived with Colin? Or is the answer to that question a spoiler?
