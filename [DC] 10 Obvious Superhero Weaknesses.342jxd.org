** I like how Worm takes on each of these problems in turn:

1.  Capes are worn by either really pretentious (and quickly killed-off) idiots, and by the /three strongest superheroes in the world/: The Indestructible Supersonic Superwoman, Light-speed Laser-canon Dude, and Every-Superpower-Ever Man.
2.  Costume designs often have full-face coverage. Notably, a guy who uses tech-genius superpowers to literally be Batman, has his lower face uncovered. Consequently he gets a visor-ful of yellow jackets (and starts wearing a full helmet.)
3.  One of the main characters has a penchant for using super-intuition to figure out people's horrible secrets and blabbing them to their allies. Consequently she gets told to shut up at gunpoint a lot.
4.  The main character has an explicit mandatory secondary superpower to counteract this problem.
5.  Peripheral vision is not mentioned a lot, but most people seem to have fairly tight-fitting masks, or transparent visors (and those that don't, you can blind-side because of super-senses, or they can plain soak any hit you care to dish.)
6.  Rooftops are a bad place to be 90% of the time.
7.  Super strength is either realized through interior telekinesis, or altered physiology.
8.  Healing factors are external to the subject's body, and will often repair gene-damage.
9.  Almost all speedsters enter a different state of being to utilize their speed: foregoing the ability to interact with their surroundings, or only working in brief spurts, or similar limitations. Those that can enter a speed-state at will, interact fully with their surroundings, and don't have significant time-limits, are horribly dangerous in a fight.
10. Super strength of the Third Law-breaking kind is always explicitly telekinetic. All capes with altered physiology mostly go for grapple-and-punch combos.
