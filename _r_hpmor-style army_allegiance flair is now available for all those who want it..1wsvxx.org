** Something Vinge-based would be good. He more-or-less invented serious transhumanist fiction.

Aggravatingly, he didn't name most of his factions, just his leaders. Hmm...

"Erythrina's Apprentice" / "Mailman's Lieutenant"

"Peace Authority" / "Tinker Alliance" / "Ndelante Ali"

"Woodcarverist" / "Flenserite" / "Vrimini Org" / "Alliance for Defense" / "Straumli Blight"

Anybody else have thoughts on this?

What about something /Baroque Cycle/-related, like "Royal Society"? (Also, we surely should have something related to Scott Bakker, the man who can talk about cognitive psychology in language of Tolkienesque high fantasy)

***** I'd be hesitant to use Royal Society (even though I really appreciated Quicksilver) on account of it being a real thing. But that's just me.

For the people who liked Anathem, here are some potential flairs to use:

- Concent of Saunt Muncoster
- Concent of Saunt Edhar
- Ringing Vale
- Concent of Saunt Rambalf
- Concent of Saunt Baritoe
- Procian
- Halikaarnian
- Rhetor
- Incanters
- Lorite

I wouldn't recommend these all being added to the default options. To its own idiosyncrasies (mostly the con-langs) Anathem provides a lot of stuff to identify with.

For the Snow Crash people:

- Cosa Nostra Pizza
- Mr. Lee Greater Hong Kong
- Neuro-linguistic Hacker
- Kourier
