** Synopsis:

#+begin_quote
  A conclave of arcanists meets as part of their ongoing ambition to unlock the secret of eternal life, but one of their guests, Utsushikome of Fusai, is skeptical of their chances of success. Soon, however, the unexpected happens, and a tragedy unfolds at their hidden refuge.

  This story is a time loop mystery.

I'm finding it to be fairly well-written (typos aside), with interesting characters and an intriguing post-post-apocalyptic world. Additionally, the main theme of the story seems to be the pursuit of immortality, cast in a pleasantly positive light.

The plot is slow-moving, but compelling nonetheless.

*** Huh, wasn't expecting someone other than me to start posting this here. I'm flattered, obviously, though.

If you're finding a lot of typos, please point them out in the comments! I don't have an editor because I'm a weird hermit, and often my brain will glaze right over them.

  "It's the 28th of April 1409, at 5:06, and 53 seconds. Satisfied?"

  "I'm fine," I said. This was a lie, though largely in a technical sense, since I was pretty sure I hadn't felt strictly fine since about 1388.

Ah, I see, so Utsushikome is twenty-one. I've been wondering if half the cast were secretly several decades older than you'd expect, but it seems not.

*** While I'm not sure if this is just a joke about her being such a hot mess or not, I just want to clarify that this is not intended as confirmation that Utsushikome is 21.

**** hm, I read it as either Utsushikome giving making a joke about how much of a hot mess she is (that seems pretty in-character) or her giving the date of some bad event in her life.

*** I too had been wondering about our protagonist's age.

*** I'm guessing it's a reference to some traumatic event, maybe the cause of her illness that hasn't been explained yet.
