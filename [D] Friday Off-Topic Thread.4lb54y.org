Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** I'm guessing you all have seen this, but I found [[http://imgur.com/a/ue6ap][this album of deep dream generated art]] to be really interesting. You can make your own [[https://dreamscopeapp.com/][on this site]], [[https://deepart.io/][or this one]], or [[https://github.com/SergeyMorugin/ostagram][grab the code from github]]. Part of me thinks that this is just going to replace or add on to a lot of the filters that are already in Photoshop and the like. But a different part of me thinks that maybe this will actually be useful for creating art, though I think you still need to get composition and balance right, and it does take a little bit of time and practice to get good results.

Call it a filter, call it whatever you want. The results in the album are things I would be willing to hang on my wall. It would definitely be nicer if it were to reach the point where anyone could get those results in a single click, but as long as it's easier than making such images by hand, it's progress.

Imagine a world where "I want image X reimagined in the style of artist Y" isn't something you have to commission an artist for.

Speaking of which. I'm curious what the legal copyright status on images altered in this way would be.

**** Yeah, I've been thinking of getting [[http://i.imgur.com/uTLN2CP.jpg][this one]] of my son cleaned up and framed (there are some problems with the base image that make it poorly composed, which luckily shouldn't be too difficult to fix in Gimp, even though I suck at image editing). The real reason that you won't get great results in a single click, and probably for quite some time, is that photographs and paintings have different artistic "rules" which would be fairly difficult to teach a computer. Also, most photographs are now taken by amateurs who only have the most basic understanding of what makes a photograph good. Also also, the computer doesn't understand what's important and what's not, which is one of the reasons that it often screws up facial features in the filtering process.

Copyright ... is a /really/ legally grey area. They're almost certainly derivative works, but that only helps you a little bit, especially if one or both of the base images is open source or public domain.

** An interesting question: *[[http://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/373830][When did the Roman Empire fall?]]*\\
- 395: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodosius_I][Emperor Theodosius I]] dies. The empire is divided between his two sons into two portions, administered from Constantinople and from +Rome+ Milan.\\
- 476: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odoacer][Odoacer]], commander of the WRE's +barbarian+ Germanic mercenaries in Italy, deposes [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romulus_Augustulus][Western Roman Emperor Romulus August(ul)us]] and declares himself King of Italy. Though he pays lip service to the previous Western Roman Emperor, Julius Nepos (who fled to Dalmatia after being deposed in favor of Romulus Augustulus), he refuses to allow the latter's return to Italy.\\
- 480: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Nepos][Julius Nepos]] dies in Dalmatia. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_(emperor)][Zeno]], his eastern counterpart, abolishes the Western court and holds /de jure/ sway over the "united" empire from Constantinople, though he has little /de facto/ control over the West.\\
- 565: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justinian_I][Emperor Justinian I]] dies after reconquering large areas of formerly-Roman territory in Italy, Africa, and Spain. His successors soon lose these gains to Germanic tribes and to the Sunni Caliphate.\\
- 636: The Sunni Caliphate's forces annihilate the Eastern Roman army in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Yarmouk][the Battle of Yarmouk]]. The ERE abandons Syria to Muslim conquest, and soon loses Egypt and Armenia as well.\\
- 1204: Constantinople is conquered by the leaders of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Crusade][the Fourth Crusade]], who establish [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Empire][the Catholic "Empire of Romania" (or "Latin Empire")]]. Competing Greek claimants to the title of Emperor are set up in Nicaea, Epirus, and Trebizond. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Nicaea][The "Empire" of Nicaea]] eventually destroys the Latin and Epirote claimant states, regains Constantinople, and proclaims a restored ERE, while Trebizond remains independent.\\
- 1453: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople][Constantinople is conquered]] by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmed_the_Conqueror][Sultan Mehmed II of the Ottomans]], who proclaims himself Caesar of Rome.\\
- 1461a: Mehmed II conquers [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Despotate_of_the_Morea][the Despotate of Morea]], the last independent remnant of the Nicaean ERE.\\
- 1461b: Mehmed II conquers [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Trebizond][the "Empire" of Trebizond]], the last independent remnant of the pre-1204 ERE.\\
- 1806: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor][Holy Roman Emperor Francis II]] dissolves the HRE, as Napoleon threatens to conquer it and transform it into a France-dominated federal structure.\\
- 1917: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_II_of_Russia][Tsar Nicholas II]] abdicates the throne of the Russian Empire. Russia formerly was seen as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Rome][a "Third Rome"]]: The great-great-grandfather of Ivan IV "the Terrible", first Tsar of Russia (as opposed to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Moscow][Muscovy]]), [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Palaiologina][was]] an Eastern Roman Emperor, and Muscovy was instrumental in bringing (Orthodox) Christianity to Russia, just as Constantine brought Christianity to the Mediterranean.\\
- 1922: The Grand National Assembly of Turkey [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolition_of_the_Ottoman_sultanate][abolishes the Ottoman sultanate]].\\
- (Some other date that the pollster didn't consider)

So, what are the prerequisites for being able to declare yourself the Emperor of Rome?

As weird as it seems even to me, I'm inclined to think that the most consistent answer for the /final/ end of the Roman Empire is *1922*.\\
- Religion: To say that only Christians can be Roman Emperors is ridiculous when the Empire was pagan for centuries before Constantine and Theodosius.\\
- Legitimacy of claim: To say that only non-usurpers can be Roman Emperors is ridiculous when there were zillions of usurpations even before the Empire split.\\
- - (There are, of course, /degrees/ of legitimacy. If [[http://www.ckiiwiki.com/Empires][the rules of /Crusader Kings II/]] are taken as a /vaguely/-accurate example, actually controlling most of the title's historical territory is necessary to proclaim yourself ruler of it, but you'll have a hard time conquering enough land to do so without either declaring holy wars or having already inherited a claim on the title. Nowadays, any "historical territory" or "hereditary claims" of the Roman Empire would be laughably weak, after so many centuries have passed--unless Turkey can be called the Empire's republican successor... but we're talking about the Roman /Empire/ here, aren't we? Such a digression!)\\
- Culture: To say that only Romans can be Roman Emperors--that the Roman Empire can be usurped only from inside, and any usurpation by an invader is illegitimate--to me seems like a slightly-stronger argument (in favor of 1453), but still rather arbitrary, since the Roman Empire contained sizeable populations of many cultures.

Alternatively, if continuity is required, I'd go for *1204* as a /temporary/ end to the Roman Empire, before its Nicaean restoration, since none of the claimants seem to have had particularly-strong claims before that time. This opinion may be influenced by the Fourth Crusade's treatment in the Historical Improvement Project mod for /[[http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings][Crusader Kings II]]/, which outright destroys the "Eastern Roman Empire" title and fragments it into claimant states whenever it loses Constantinople or is held by a non-Christian.

*** I've always thought of it as 1453, when Constantinople fell, which is also conveniently about 1,000 years after the WRE fell. Until Constantinople actually fell, you had a large territory that for the most part was a direct successor (politically and legally) to the Roman Empire, and the people and nobles living there identified themselves (and their state) as Roman. /They/ thought they were in the Roman Empire, if nothing else.

I think there's a good argument for 476, though--this is definitely the fall of the WRE, at least. After this, Rome had basically lost control of Africa, Mauretania, Iberia, most of France, Italy, etc. Europe and many of the other civilizations touching the Mediterranean were plunged into a thousand years of war, darkness and barbarism. Although the ERE/Byzantine Empire was known as the Roman Empire after 476, in retrospect we don't call it the Roman Empire. We call it something else. It certainly isn't the same, even if it's a legitimate successor.

***** It always ends up as a discussion of what exactly constitutes continuity of the Roman Empire. For example, if the empire was still whole and the WRE never fell, but they shifted to speaking Greek, you wouldn't say "well, this isn't the Roman Empire any more". Heck, there was a huge religious change away from the Roman gods to Christian monotheism, and even with this big change we still thought it was the Roman Empire.

So, it /is/ true that the Byzantine Empire (which at the time, was called the Roman Empire) spoke Greek more than Latin. I don't think this is a sufficient-on-its-own reason to say they're not the Roman Empire any more--at least for me. If the Empire was whole and gradually changed language to speak Greek, I'd still think it was the Roman Empire, so that means if I think the Roman Empire fell in 476, this alone cannot be the reason.

This can be especially true on subs like this one (and [[/r/magicbuilding]]) in part because few people have either the training in technical writing to make technical details readable, or the training in prose writing to deliver exposition well. Worse, sometimes people seem to have only gathered some surface level understanding of what makes text easily readable, so they include section breaks and bullet points willy-nilly.

As the Democratic Party leadership, you lose a LOT of face if you say "hey Democratic Party members, we've decided that even though a majority want Clinton, we're going to run Sanders instead. Primaries were fun, but now adults are talking, okay?" or something. Basically, the Superdelegates can't afford to do anything other than give all their votes to whoever has the most regular delegates in terms of long term party health. Imagine the furor if they defied the will of the party membership! This is also the basic reason the GOP won't just be like "Hey guys, we quickly rewrote the rules of the primary when nobody was looking, and now Mitt Romney(or whoever) is the nominee instead of the candidate the people want"-- the primaries serve an important purpose, which is legitimizing the candidates selected by the parties.

How catastrophic is it /really/ if the Republicans win a /single/ Presidential election, versus completely alienating the entirety of your own party? Even if you hate Trump! Let's say, for the sake of argument, that Sanders clearly can beat Trump and Clinton clearly can't. Let's say, for the sake of argument, that the Democratic Party leadership is unified and makes a decision together on how to allocate their superdelegate votes. Let's say they want the best for the party instead of for themselves. Let's say they have the power to make Sanders the nominee, and backlash from Clinton for having a fairly won nomination taken away from her won't hurt them. Even granting all that, it seems pretty clear they have to follow the will of the party membership if they want anyone to take the process seriously. Could you imagine the amount of protest voting and the total shitshow it would be? The Democratic party might go through one of those "splinter into 5 parties and reform" things that happen occasionally, or just lose a bunch of elections etc.

***** Indeed. Hillary is actually running a somewhat rational campaign if you consider everything from her point of view. She has no interest in doing anything but enriching herself through the Clinton Slush Fund (I won't call it anything else, because only 10% of the money donated to it goes to charitable works)

Far too many people trust her than should, so she's taking advantage of it. She's investing in the ignorance of the masses, which is normally a very good bet.

However, I think that Hillary is so unlikable as a person that she will lose to Trump. Trump is roughly as unlikable, but he's telling people he's going to fix things. Hillary is basically saying everything is fine and more of the same would be good for the country.

Bernie would make a better Democratic contender because he actually has a personality. Whether or not he actually believes the impossibilities he spouts is not so certain.

The demand is that someone dies.

1. Ceteris paribus, I think I should rather die through inaction than kill through action.
2. Ceteris paribus, I think I should rather whoever survives this experience come away with the emotion of "someone died to save me" (or perhaps ignorance of the situation, if they weren't told) than the emotion of "I killed someone to save my own skin" (whether remorsefully or remorselessly).

Postulated exactness of the duplication aside, we're different people /now/. And certainly more so as the hour goes on. So I'm not sure the idea of us being the "same" person should alter my choice. (It does mitigate a couple of things though, like the death-fear of not being able to continue what I've started, and the question of whether the life of the person I'm saving is "worth" more or less than mine.)

Consider an alternative description. Universe is constantly branching so that every possible configuration is explored. Coil's power 'only' allows him to retain the mind-synchronizing connection between his two selves in branches of the multiverse that naturally occur at the moment he does the 'split'. When he 'destroys' one branch, what actually occurs is that his mind state stops synchronizing. One instance of him goes on happily believing that he has actually destroyed a disadvantageous branch, while the other quickly realizes the horror of having to deal with the consequences of his actions multiplied by the amount of times he did this to himself, coupled with grim certainty that the other him will forever remain ignorant of the truth and will keep doing this.

****** Lmao, no. You are not. I just thought about how cliché it is in movies when someone is "marked for death" because they saw the face of an assassin or something. I can't think of any specific examples right now, but I've definitely seen a few.

*** Depends on what you're talking about. If it's just [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveNoWitnesses][Leave No Witnesses]], then that's fairly rational; witnesses can contact the authorities, they can positively identify you later on, and they'll be called in the event of a trial.

But the more extreme version, where the assassin expends enormous amounts of resources trying to chase down people who know his identity ... that's quite a bit harder to justify.

*** Who saw the assassin? An aide to the President, or a random passerby? The position of the person that saw the assassin's face changes dramatically how long it would take for the assassin's details to be ousted.

*** Cost-benefit analysis is required. How much would it hurt for the assassin's face to be known vs. how difficult it would be to kill those that know the secret. As mentioned by others below, it can go either way, depending on the story.

For example: If magic is involved, and the assassin will die to a curse in a week if they do not keep their identity secret, then from that assassin's point of view (given that they are an assassin and are already known to be willing to kill people), it's rational in almost every situation.
