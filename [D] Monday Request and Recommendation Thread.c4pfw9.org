Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** Alright. I've been busy reading a lot these last few weeks, so I've got a few stories to recommend. First and foremost, if you're not reading [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-political-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.660569/][/A Young Woman's Political Record/]] you should be. It's been recommended here before, but I can vouch for its quality even if you haven't read/watched /Youjo Senki/. Very funny, a neat piece of alt-history fiction if you can get past the silly names for all the countries, and generally deserving of the popularity it's gathered.

I've been reading a lot of Worm fanfiction, again. I read through that one Gamer!Greg story I told myself I wouldn't ever read, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/greg-veder-vs-the-world-worm-the-gamer.601118/][/Greg Veder vs. The World/.]] It's okay for a gamer story. The power level is only just really starting to escalate to ridiculous levels. Somebody mentioned that the Lung fight was the best in recent memory, but I personally think the fight scenes in the last few chapters have bloated the story and really slowed it down. Other than that, it's okay.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/nemesis-worm-au.747148/][/Nemesis/]] by BeaconHill is still excellent. I'm really loving the premise, and showing the contrast between Taylor's utilitarian practice sessions and the actual silly results is a stroke of genius. It's goofy and I love it.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/magical-girl-escalation-taylor-worm-nanoha.28074/][/Magical Girl Escalation Taylor/]] is a Worm/Nanoha quest that's taking entirely too long to get to the interesting crossover bits. It's finally starting to ramp up in that regard. The first arcs were a little stiff, but after the story moves to Philadelphia it really grows into its own. I think by trying to emulate Wildbow's method of building an ensemble cast (different gangs with different motives, all thrown into one place and given something to fight over) the author became better at writing Wildbow characters in general. The highlight of this quest for me was the After Action Reports the author creates at the end of each arc. I've never seen something like it done in a quest before, and it really opens up a new avenue of communication between the GM and the players. In them, the author tells the players what they did wrong, what choices were dead ends or red herrings, and on occasion, how they exceeded expectations. I really hope this is a device that more authors pick up on and use. I'm definitely going to keep it in mind if I ever write a quest.

Non-Worm stuff: more quests! I went into the Discord and asked for recommendations, which they kindly gave to me. I'm still working through some of them, but I did manage to finish one. [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/deep-red-avatar-the-last-airbender.50358/][/Deep Red/]] is an Avatar: The Last Airbender quest where the players control an OC older sister to Zuko and Azula, named Akane. The writing in this story is unparalleled for quests, which is why it's a shame that the players are dumb as bricks. The voting goes on /somewhere/ other than Sufficient Velocity, I think, and the author just posts the finished chapters there. But wherever they are, the voters seem to have a very heavy bias for and against certain characters, which leads to predictably bad results. I'm looking forward to seeing where this goes, and I'm really happy that the author seems willing to punish the players for acting too stupid, but I'm concerned about the impact that will have on the pacing. It already feels like an arc has been cut too short because of their actions, and I can only imagine what that means for the future.

Finally, I think I'll talk about [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23173/the-simulacrum][/The Simulacrum/]], because it's something that's been posted to the subreddit before. The premise is that the main character is in a world strangely reminiscent of a generic harem battle anime, without any memories of how he got there. I really feel like this story squandered the potential of the introduction and the first few chapters. First of all, the fact that it's strangely reminiscent of a generic harem battle anime is a problem because in order for those tropes to be recognizable, the characters and worldbuilding need to be as generic as possible. But instead of leveraging this unreality to do something /cool/, the story and the protagonist just sort of forget about it and thrive within the system. The whole "we're in a fictional universe" thing is mostly put on the back-burner until the protagonist wants to hang a lampshade. Which leads us to our second point - the protagonist. He starts off strong by making interesting observations about the simulated nature of his reality, and seemingly "breaking free" of his programming. But then he just slots himself right back into the main cast, without a thought as to whether /they're/ mysteriously compelled to act the same way he was. And then, when he starts to supplant the harem aura of the /actual/ protagonist, his best friend he's just as clueless about girls liking him as he would have been if he had never read TvTropes. +10 points for noticing the status quo, -âˆž points for doing the bare minimum amount to change it, beyond being slightly more lampshady than your average harem anime. Call me again when your protagonist is so scared by the harem aura that he decides to move to a different continent, or something.

None of these stories are really rational, but I considered them all worth reading to the end of the current content, even if I had to prod myself a few times to finish /The Simulacrum/. All of them except for /Magical Girl Escalation Taylor/ have the common theme of the protagonist's picture of themselves being different from how the outside world sees them, to varying degrees. I know I wasn't super clear on quality. If I had to rank them, the order would be this:

1. Nemesis
2. A Young Woman's Political Record
3. Deep Red
4. Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest*
5. Magical Girl Escalation Taylor
6. Greg Veder vs. The World
7. The Simulacrum

EDIT: Come to think of it, I did have a bit more to say. I read [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/battle-action-harem-highschool-side-character-quest-no-sv-you-are-the-waifu.15335/][/Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest/]] after /The Simulacrum/. I gave up a little bit before the latest chapter, at a good stopping point, because it's nearly dead (unlike any of the other things I posted above) but I feel like it did a better job doing what /The Simulacrum/ tried to do. The characters are intelligent enough. The setting distinguishes itself from other generic settings by having the "Antagonists" be a genuine ongoing world-ending threat. And by playing /as the Waifu/, you get to avoid falling into the same trap /The Simulacrum/ did where the main character basically just supplanted the "true" main character of the story. I'd place it higher than /Magical Girl Escalation Taylor/, with the caveat that it's not and probably never will be finished.

The site in question is fiction.live, which used to be called anonkun I think. It's definitely lower quality than SV, and there's a lot of porn, and the site has some pretty janky/terrible design the owner refuses to fix or allow other people to fix. That said, the basic idea of the posting system does make it easy to churn out quick posts and quests, as I described in the Deep Red SV thread:

#+begin_quote
  Whilst I mostly agree with you, for all its faults fiction.live does let a QM churn out their content at a pretty high rate, with fast votes being called and resolved quickly to help move things along. In a less serious quest where you just want people to decide how many hats your wizard is going to steal from the defeated gnome warriors before moving on, having an answer in 60 seconds (5, strapped to your head and beard in a pentagonal format to boost your demonology stat, obviously) is much more convenient.

**** I figured it had to be pretty quick, because all of those vote interrupts were definitely quick. I believe the author waits a little longer for the more significant choices, too. The numbers were higher when they were doing the vote for whether or not to burn Zuko - it was a good seventy people, whereas earlier and later it rarely reached forty total. It's fudging the numbers a bit, but given how much that choice dug the players own graves, I'd have been hesitant closing it too soon as well.

** I want to recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9402014/chapters/21285149][The World As It Appears To Be]]. It's a rational Overwatch fanfic by the guy who wrote Cordyceps. Haven't seen it linked or recommended in a while now. Of course it ignores characters or story stuff that hadn't been revealed by Blizzard at the time this fanfic got into its stride, but that shouldn't really matter.

In return I am looking for a recommendation for a time travel or crossover fic in which an /intelligent/ character finds himself transported into (and confronted with) a world more advanced than his own. Preferably said world should not be much more advanced that current IRL. The basic idea is that I want to see something approaching the typical knight gets ported to current day city kind of situation but not, you know, dumb. And because this is niche I am of course willing to read it even if fantasy elements are involved and/or the time jump from 19th->21st to neolithic->classical age or anything in between or fantasy/magical equivalent.

Im about halfway through and the character interactions are so fantastic. They feel real and using Winston's social anxiety is perfect for deconstructing dialogue and getting characters to talk about why they act or feel the way they do in a way that IS show dont tell.

*** /Strange Bodies/ by Marcel Theroux is roughly what you're looking for. An operation is developed that can bring the mind of an ~18th century person into a living 21st-century body. It's a very weird book and takes a while to get to the point, but pretty interesting.

Also, /The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O./ by Neal Stephenson has a marvelous character who (minor spoilers) is the last living witch, having used her last spell to enchant herself to age much slower than normal in order to live long enough to access the technology necessary to resuscitate magic.

EDIT: Also also, /Anathem/ by Stephenson has characters who have been cloistered in their monastery/university for their whole lives and/or multiple generations, who get exposed to the modern culture of the story (which is roughly Earth-analogous, but is not Earth). It's also one of the best sci-fi adventures ever written, I'd say on par with Dune.

Quite the opposite, actually--the outside world has all sorts of false stories about what goes on in the monasteries, but the monasteries don't really concern themselves with what goes on outside. To the point where they don't keep track of what the dominant form of government is, instead calling whoever's in charge "panjandrums" as a catch-all for "whoever those dummies have picked to rule them these days."

I remember that there was a ten tiered punishment system with one of the earlier tiered punishments being memorizing the digits of pi, and it was sometimes used on acolytes for internal political reasons. I remember that acolytes made all their friends on the inside and that leaving was considered analogous to dying. That nobody cares about the outside world bolsters this point - that's not a natural state of affairs.

There's also Codex Alera. I've no real idea how much munchkinning there is in the series since I've only just started reading, but it's a long running high fantasy series with elemental magic as one of the sole abilities, so it's probably bound to have some.

The magic takes the form of spirits that someone can bind to themselves, and the spirits are aligned with one the the six elements (the standard 4, plus wood and metal). It's written by Jim Butcher and IIRC the original premise when he started writing was "what if the Roman Empire had Pokemon?".

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13002064/1/A-Young-Woman-s-Political-Record][A Young Woman's Political Record]] (seconding [[/u/Robert_Barlow][u/Robert_Barlow]] above)\\
[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/break-them-all-original-precross.12960/][Break them All]] - basically just munchkining a magic system\\
[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/][Dungeon Keeper Ami]] - read this without knowing the supporting works... it has its faults but it does what it's trying to do well\\
[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/13168/fork-this-life][Fork this Life]] - Isekai'd as a fork. Silly premise but transforms into a neat exploration of the world & magic systems

Less rational works, but still tentatively recommend:\\
[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22848/post-human][Post Human]] - Human turned AI. Unpolished but some good ideas\\
[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23290/deeper-darker][Deeper Darker]] - fun romp, space opera, great (but somewhat inconsistent) characterization\\
[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/24241/sundered-soul-a-cultivation-wuxiaxianxia-novel][Sundered Soul]] - YA western-style xanxia\\
[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/24203/homicidal-aliens-are-invading-and-all-i-got-is][Homicidal Aliens are Invading and All I've Got is This Stat Menu]] - early days yet but the premise is that two aliens societies are fighting and in order to protect / co-opt help, some humans on earth are given special powers

** If you have read Dresden Files and Worm I would highly recommend [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-high-priest-worm-dresden-files.752524/][The High Priest.]] It is a fanfiction crossover where Eidolon gets transmigrated to the Dresden universe post Echnida arc. The key to this fanfiction is the spot on characterization. Mischaracterization is a huge turn off to me where canon characters are turning into OCs but the author of this fanfic has it on lock. I would say its rational-adjacent due to the fact that certain higher powers in the Dresden universe are acting how they should toward Eidolon. It's ongoing and the last chapter was left on a real big cliffhanger that I can't wait to see how it unfolds.

While I'm here I am getting really addicted to fanfiction crossovers where a canon character from a higher tier 'power level' is transmigrated into another canon universe. Any recs?

**** You decide upfront that "should X happen I will /definitely/ do Y, no matter what." Even if it seems like a bad idea at the time X actually happens. If you reliably stick to it then you can make deals in which your opposition knows you will not respond to any bribes or threats.

***** Actually, you have described regular commitment.

Sorry, but this is a really annoying common misconception to me. If you tell someone else "if X, I will Y" then that's just something people do. And, a lot of the time, there's no reason beyond "I said I would" to actually do Y once X has happened. This means that Y, if it costs both people something, isn't a very credible threat.

For example: We're partners in crime for a bank heist. I took a much larger fraction of the loot than you did, so you threaten to go to the cops unless we share the gains equally. But I refuse, because I know you don't want to go to prison yourself, and so will probably not actually follow through.

Precommitment requires that you are somehow forced to do the (often mutually-bad) thing if/unless some condition is met. So, a dead man's switch in case of betrayal would be a good example. This removes the point of choice, where you have to decide to follow through with whatever you said you would do.

Saying that you will follow through is, to put it bluntly, not actually something that will guarantee you follow through. It's a mildly recurring problem in worse ratfic I've read, so please don't think that I'm angry at you - but I really hate this misconception that deciding you will do something is a game-theoretic superpower.

The translation quality is average but the few issues I have with it doesn't distract from the plot at all.

You can find the premium chapters available on Boxnovel.

The setting is based in a steampunk early Industrial Revolution Europe and mixing in inspirations from the SCP Foundation, Cthulhu mythos and the video game Bloodborne, with plenty of dark elements you'll expect such as monster-derived alchemy, murderous cults and cannibalism. The writer is pretty good at foreshadowing and has written multiple successful series before on Qidian (Chinese equivalent of Royal Road).

** I strongly suggest David Baldacci's 'Memory Man.'

Rational, not rationalist.

Detective fiction. Shades of Singularity human memory capacity, but people with the gifts and issues he has do exist in the real world.

I have been pleasantly surprised to be able to logically stay one step ahead of the protagonist, based on what the protagonist himself discovers. While at the same time the author isn't making it entirely obvious exactly what is going on. I am currently five hours from the end of the audio book, and I /think/ I know who the guilty persons are, but I am not entirely certain.

If the author Deus Ex's the story, I will be sure to return and burn this recommendation to the ground tomorrow.

EDIT ADD: Finished the audiobook. I was wrong about who I thought the antagonist was.

There was a little more data hiding in the end of the book than the first half, but still enjoyable.

Decker's mental abilities, issues, and quirks make him a lot like a pseudo Sherlock Holmes, but the author provides the readers a lot more information than Doyle does, as far as I can remember.

EDIT ADD 2:

Upon further thought, I am going to continue to recommend this as a good read, with some good rational aspects, but the rational parts are more directed at eliminating suspects than solving the mystery. While this is, in fact, how a lot of real police work is done, the final chase and resolution are marred (in a rational reading sense) by quite a few instances of the author hiding behind the main character's psychological quirks to keep the reader from knowing what he is thinking.

I am more than a little convinced that an editor requested/required a major rewrite of the last half of the book to change the primary antagonist from the character I had pegged, to another character which only makes an appearance directly in the last half of the book.

TLDR: Fun read, but less rational overall than the first half of the book led me to believe.

Maybe through some kind of combination of the following factors:

1. getting the right help and educational resources and friends/supports at the right times
2. improvements to diet/exercise/medication
3. high stakes: if they don't overcome their psychological impairments and become more skilled than the average person and do so as fast as they can, then they will totally and permanently fail at life
