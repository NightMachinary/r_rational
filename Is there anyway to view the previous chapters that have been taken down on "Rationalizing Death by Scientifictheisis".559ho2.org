Started reading a while ago and was on chapter 2 but when I came back it was rebooted or being restarted cause the author didn't think it was good or something. I thought it was good and was wondering if theirs anyway to read those previous chapters.


** There's someone on here who has been archiving every single chapter of every story. It's a work in progress, but if somebody can recall who that was, then maybe Rationalizing Death was on there.

Let me know if you find what you're looking for? I'd also be interested in reading those chapters again.

** Send me an email address via PM, and I can send you a pdf file of the 10 chapters. I save an offline copy of every story I liked, so that's why I had it.
