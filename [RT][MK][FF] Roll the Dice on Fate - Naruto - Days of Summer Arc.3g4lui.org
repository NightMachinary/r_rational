** So, Tetsuo's a cat with nine lives, eh? I wonder... If he incarnated across the multiverse, which includes Naruto, and the available universes for reincarnation are roughly symmetrical to earth, then most chakra-brain reincarnations should be babies, due to the high infant-mortality rate across history. Unless the SI chakra brain is not in fact part of the bloodline package?

*** Ah, well if every generation had a copy of Tetsuo then I think his mum would have known what to expect and spoken to him a bit while he was a baby.

Although a scenario has been described where that would be the case for subsequent generations. Wherin he basically forks himself into the heads of his kids, either later in their development as a helpful nav pixie or earlier as the controlling intelligence. No idea if it'll ever come up. At that point the story would morph from 'fight to save to world' to 'Konoha conquers the multiverse to forcibly institute human rights'.

**** I mean, how would a baby that died to one of the many causes of infant mortality know it was reincarnated?

***** Ah, I thought you meant something rather different. My bad.

Edit: Now that I think about it, that is a rather interesting theory of yours. I shall have to keep it in mind.

****** That said, it brings up /another/ thought: wouldn't it suck to get reincarnated, and die of shoulder dystocia shortly afterwards?

******* Well that would just be unfortunate. On the upside if you're being reincarnated then probability points towards souls or something similar being a thing, which is good. On the downside, your immediate death upon reincarnation implies bad things about how much the deity/deities like you and your eventual destination.

** Eminently enjoyable so far. This fic will probably become one of my favourite ones as it goes on.

** In this arc we have worldbuilding, fluff, the casual displays of dispassionate violence that are essential in any hidden village and a prank war.

No news yet on Magical Vivisectionist Pretty Oro-tan.
