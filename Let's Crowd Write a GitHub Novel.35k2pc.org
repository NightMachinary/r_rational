** I think these things always end pretty badly, at least if you're trying for anything serious. Collaborative writing is really hard.

*** Well, it looks like it's getting some interest on HN, so a lot of smart people are curious about the idea.

Maybe we could figure out the right way to do that.

**** I think the problem is that collaborative writing means more work, not less. You have to coordinate. You don't simplify, you exponentiate. And you have to compromise your own artistic vision or whatever.

It could work with a small number of people, say, 2, and if they knew each other well, respected each other, could meet or communicate somehow in depth regularly, were similar enough to understand each other, worked well together, and write passages that sounded pretty similar. Like Gaiman and Pratchett in /Good Omens/.

***** I think what you'd want to do is make a novel that could work within those constraints. People write differently? Make the differences in voice a /part/ of the novel, and embrace what would otherwise be a flaw. There are books like /If on a winter's night a traveler/ that intentionally do changes like that.

But I agree with the general point of collaborative writing being difficult.

***** Apparently people at [[http://anonkun.com]] are doing it.

People in writing rooms on tv shows are doing it.

HPMOR hivemind has been successful.

Wikipedia is another good example.

It might be less optimal and harder to organize compared to when one writer does it, but it might have some advantages. At the very least it can be fun, and a cool way to gamify the writing process(which is why I'm interested).

****** Sure, it's fun, and not necessarily impossible, although I don't think scriptwriting and Wikipedia are close analogues, and [[/r/hpmor]] didn't actually write anything together, though individuals produced a lot of cool stuff in a sort of mutual creativity explosion. But I don't mean to be a sourpuss, go for it and have fun.

Is that a good sign for trying to write a novel?

** This is an x-post from HN. I thought you guys will be interested because collaborative writing was discussed here a few times.

Do you have any suggestions on how we could go about the process?

What are your thoughts on this experiment?

** I like the concept, but a story needs more than a beginning sentence for people to cooperate while writing it.

** The format of the novel is important. If you are careful in how you structure it, you can manage it.

[[http://penandcapesociety.com/drew-hayes/super-choice-adventure-chapter-1/][Super Choice Adventure]] by the Pen and Cape society is an example where many collaborating writers worked together, each writing a short scene and completing a decent story overall.

Now, if you want to write the next great novel this way, err, good luck.
