** Seeking Power has seen another update, and as always, it combines excellent characterization with rational themes and a compelling story. After the rational fic [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/196256/the-moons-apprentice][The Moon's Apprentice]], the author has improved their writing even further. Highly recommend.

** I just started reading your fanfiction but I'm enchanted. This is just right. Funny, to the point, likeable. Thanks for the read.

** You know; against my better judgement. I'm going to ask how and why the warning: ponies flair came about and why it is necessary?

*** Ponies have become somewhat incendiary on the internet as a result of their extremely passionate/vocal fans (bronies) advocating the series, and the resulting backlash from non-fans and outright haters.

**** To agree, ponies can be... grating. I had a "brony" friend in college who implored me to watch MLP:FIM with him. I did one day and watched two episodes he'd selected. I didn't know how to not come off as an asshole when he asked how I liked it, but I guess I said something politic enough to not end a friendship. It just seemed pointless, and I'm not a person who dislikes children's shows on principle or anything.

However, I've weirdly enjoyed some pony fanfics posted here---Friendship is Optimal to name one, so I might give this a read!

***** Nothing wrong with that, I'm in the same camp. I've even said to my own brony friends that if MLP was the exact same show with people instead of ponies I'd probably love it. But it's not, so I don't. I still love FiO.
