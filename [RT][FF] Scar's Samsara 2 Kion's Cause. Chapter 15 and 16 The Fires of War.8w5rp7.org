** Two chapters at once again, since the new rules in the sidebar say authors can only post once a week - at least I don't think that rule was there before. If anyone else wants to post the (biweekly) updates, they're welcome to do so of course.

For those who are waiting for an update to NTBS, muchos apologatos. Trying to write two stories at the same time while also doing my dayjob turned out not to work at all. I may have very slightly overestimated my multitasking skills. So instead, my plan is to finish this story quickly, and then go back to updating NTBS. Again, sorry for the wait!

*** Sigh, one of the annoying things about "new reddit" layout is that it effectively erases the old sidebar (which, in our case, was pretty well written and effectively summarized what we're about).

Most subreddits for some reason have dealt with this by hastily writing a new sidebar, rather than copy-pasting the old one. I guess someone for some reason hastily added a "weekly" rule during this re-write.

We're really /not/ an active enough subreddit for that sort of rule to make sense. If someone was spamming the same work over and over maybe, but there is a chapter update here, so it's arguably a different work. I vote you just go ahead and post and ask for forgiveness if the mods don't like it.

** I have just binged Scar's Samsara, and mostly liked it.

I have some issues with Diabolus Ex Machina in recent chapters, but overall it is an entertaining read.

Still, it is hard for me to take Disney-based universe of talking animals seriously. It is a fun deconstruction, but I have hard time imagining it working at all.
