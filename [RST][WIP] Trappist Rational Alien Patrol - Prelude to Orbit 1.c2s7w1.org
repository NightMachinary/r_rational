*** Why not?

The goal of the Trappist aliens are to understand human belief and understanding, and to correct discourse through the methods of rationality.

Perhaps you're not fond of the medium? Or the use of literary devices which might deviate from rational fiction tropes?

**** We have a list of characteristics in the sidebar. The biggest point against this is that it's got unbelievable characters doing things that don't make any sense, sloppy worldbuilding, and a boatload of strawmen. If you want to mount a defense of this, you're going to have to do better than just stating the premise. And yes, the format/genre of the work means that it gets judged more harshly, because that makes it less likely to be something that the people who frequent this subreddit want to see. The discussion of real world politics (e.g. climate change) also raises the bar, especially given the thin frame.

***** Seems you're misreading the use of allegory as "unbelieveable characters" and "strawman", I'm guessing you've never read anything like Candide. If it's not something the people of this subreddit want to see, they should be able to decide for themselves with voting instead of having a gatekeeper decide in-advance.
