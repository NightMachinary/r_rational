Rewatching it and wanting more, but with better decision making.


** An RT Breaking Bad would have him never getting into the business to begin with. It was never a rational act and, if he'd thought about it much more he would never have gotten involved. A rational!Walt might have never gotten out of Gray Matter Technologies and instead have been rich and happy. It was sort of implied that he got out due to a bad breakup?

As big of a fan as I am of Rationalist fiction, not every story can be improved by a rational protagonist. The very thing that makes Breaking Bad great is Walt's irrationality. He is a little man in a bad situation and is the villain protagonist of his own little story.

*** I guess that I don't want a completely rational Walt, just a bit more :)

** I think the problem is that many of the things that advanced Walt's 'career' were very high-risk acts of desperation that in no way would have seemed rational considering the information he had at the time. Often he survived and progressed due to sheer luck and was close to getting killed several times by Krazy 8, Tuco, Gus and the nazis (and the desert!). But had he not risked himself this way, he'd have no chance of success.

*** In ways, some of those risks were calculated. He already had no money, he was going to die of cancer anyway.

If we were going to go with full [RT] Walt would take the money from his old partners at the very beginning, get better treatment and that would just about be it.

I also don't want a Peggy Sue Walt. I want one who will make some of the same mistakes, but then rebound a bit better. Someone who can learn from their mistakes.

I am more concerned with his choices regarding Jesse, how he dealt with his family, how he dealt with Gus.

**** Note - "Peggy Sue" and "Mary Sue" are entirely different tropes and, despite the similarity in name, are etymologically distinct too! The former is derived from the film [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_Sue_Got_Married][Peggy Sue Got Married]], and the latter (I believe) from an old Star Trek fanfic.
