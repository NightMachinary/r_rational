** Is the author ever going back to writing Lighting up the Dark? It's so good and I miss it :(

For those who haven't read it, the incomplete fic is freakin awesome. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9311012/1/Lighting-Up-the-Dark]]

**** It is being worked on. That is not dead which can eternal lie etc.

But I can't give you anything concrete in terms of a timeframe, much as I'd like to. There's a bunch of bigger-picture planning I need to get done before I can get back to writing actual updates, and that is a thing which requires quite a lot of time, energy and motivation to get right so I don't write myself into a corner later on (which is oh so easy to do with rational fiction, /coughoverpoweredplayerabilitiescough/).

****** Well, QED.

At least once a fortnight, @eaglejarl and I stop in mid-discussion and one of us goes, "oh Shub-Niggurath, Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young, do you realise that because we gave them X ability/ruling, they can now potentially do Y and effectively end the quest at the next voting deadline?"

Edit: to make it clear, neither of us, to my knowledge, is Shub-Niggurath, the Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young. Its dread name is being invoked solely for emphasis.

******** Well, we're not talking Nyarlathotep here. Shub-Niggurath is a being of the primal wilderness, and unlikely to be au fait with online forums, or indeed technology at all.

Granted, seeing as Nyarlathotep has a thousand masks, can probably pass for Shub-Niggurath to anyone without serious occult knowledge, and is capable of functioning perfectly in human society, it's impossible to be sure that we're /not/ talking about him here.

I've always been unclear on that...is it Shubbie who has the Thousand Young, or the woods that she comes from? What does it even mean for a woods to have a thousand young?

******** Shub-Niggurath is the Black Goat of the Woods, who has a Thousand Young. The Young, IIRC, are what you get if you cross a tree with a tentacle monster, and throw in some goat for good measure.
