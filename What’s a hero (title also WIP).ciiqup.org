*What's a hero*

In recent years multiple heroes have risen up out of the woodwork with different origins. At first these heroes were celebrated. Treated like celebrities, high ranking citizens, and even (to the disapproval of most) gods. Many of them worked for companies to endorse their brand. Jobs such as selling food or other products, wresting or other legal superpowered fighting sports, talk shows, and even sometimes starring as themselves on tv shows and soap operas.

Of course the government wanted to use them for their own gain and the personal safety of that they the people however due to multiple rallies and complaints of the regular people they decided not to touch them in the end. However due to the massive destruction of cities due to extinction level events public opinion slowly turned on the heroes, forcing them to work under the military's jurisdiction. This wasn't completely bad however. They were actually paid handsomely for their work and the superhero group was much more organized and many yellow coded (c ranked) heroes actually risen up to red coded (a ranked). This was actually a nice change for everyone but collateral damage was inevitable when the ”big guns” had to eventually go and fight.

The vast majority of people who already felt threatened by beings with higher power than them wanted heroes groups to be disbanded. Many people were outraged they could rebuild the cities but not get the lives back of the people lost? They started setting desecrating sights and monuments of heroes even doing the same to government funded and ran sights, going as far as to burn down comic book shops think they glorified heroes too much. The military eventually decided to disband the group, thinking the backlash wasn't worth it, excluding having the black coded (s rank) heroes into society. They heroes red coded and below were all integrated into society forced to never use their powers. The government of course had a contingency plan. Thanks to the heroes who were alien in origin they had access to technology that significantly improved the world's, equating to high tech police officials and especially the military.

Thanks to this new law though there has been a spike in superpowered crime activity. Gang wars, hit men, mafia, especially and predictably in the lowered class areas. The story revolves around this guy who wanted to be a superhero since he was a kid and who just figured out after a near death experience his pets are actually aliens.


** Yo, just at first glance you need basic formatting to make the text readable.

Add an empty line between the header and the story, make the header bold to make it clear that it's a title. Add paragraph breaks.

Otherwise, it's just an unreadable wall of text, regardless of how good it is.

**** No problem. Also, if you're serious about it, I do suggest you host it on a site of your own rather than on reddit. It takes only a few clicks to create a brand new Wordpress site or blog!

***** Well yeah and thanks but I wanna learn how to animate then bring it to life. But I suppose you're right as using Wordpress or something as a jump off platform

** The premise could be good, though it sounds at least sort of similar to The Incredibles or The Watchmen.

The big thing that makes stories like this shine is strong characters, both heroes and villians.

** Just a heads up, your post has probably been downvoted so much because you're only supposed to post links to or discussion of rational fiction. This would've been more appropriate to post in one of the weekly threads - possibly the Wednesday Worldbuilding thread - rather than posting it as its own thread.
