I would really enjoy reading a story about overpowered warriors explained a bit more rationally. Power levels are hilariously out of sync with each other and I think it is unfair that, while Goku and Vegeta are so incredibly overpowered, regular humans such as Krillin can't even compete.

I would enjoy a story, possibly from Krillin's perspective about how he survives (or even thrives) in such a brutal environment.

Anything like that out there?


** I remember one that started awhile back set from Gohan's perspective that seemed promising, since Gohan's the most studious/intelligent of the Z warriors, but I don't think it ever took off past a couple chapters. I think the universe itself is ripe for some rationalizing, what with the crazy technology (capsule corp, FTL travel, etc) especially if the superpowered humans start using their abilities for things other than fighting.

*** Right after I commented I remembered their automatic Deus ex machina machines. Dragon Balls can be terrifically overpowered and are in canon, seeing as Bulma is the only person making an effort to gather them in the entire world.

**** To be fair, those things are hidden like HPMoR!Quirrelmort's horcruxes. They're not on top of unclimbable mountains or in deep caves or anything like that. They're just somewhere. If you don't know about the radio emissions, they're impossible to find.

***** This is actually a good point. In canon, highly advanced bad guys get blindsided by the Z squad's "Dragon Radar" - our heroes' ease of finding them really is a miracle exception.

Bulma's also built a time machine. Come to think of it, she's probably a great candidate for a rational protagonist.

...man, now I want to read this.

****** The bad guys also have something like that. There's just isn't as good.

If you give a rational protagonist a time machine, things can get very crazy very quickly.

******* True. Ditto for wishes. There'd obviously need to be some limitations placed on everything.

My imperfect knowledge of the story gave me the impression the time travel works on multiple-universe theory, so if you want to include the time machine, you could follow the "original" universe - they can help alternate universes, but it's not a fix-everything button.

**** I would think the "key wish" to unravel the series would be understanding of how to /create/ dragon balls. (Presuming they power is in them, and not in the dragon they summon. If it's in the dragon, the wish would then be about dragon physiology and genetic engineering.)

***** According to GT, it's the balls -- the dragon balls store a lot of energy (both positive and negative) and that energy gets released to power the wish, and any energy left unused by the wish goes elsewhere.

Whether you want to consider GT canon or not is not an argument I'm going to get into.

**** In fairness, other people made an effort. It's just that Bulma has the resources of the worlds most capable tech corporation at her back, and her first quest for the dragonballs happened to lead her to Goku, of all people. So, between them, they pretty much wiped out or converted the competition.

Without access to dragonballs to study, Freeza still had an easy time hunting them down on Namek, just by virtue of the Namekians leaving the balls with village elders, and Freeza having scouters. By the time the Namekians caught on and attacked the scouters directly, there were only two dragonballs that freeza didn't already possess.

As the movies show, if someone were to actually do half a decent job of searching for them, no one would even notice, unless they happened to pull out the Dragon Radar for some reason. I suppose a security-minded Bulma would take a look at the dragon radar every week or so, just to be safe.

** Okay, it hasn't been mentioned yet, so I feel required to point out "DBZ Abridged". I never watched the original shows, but this has me laughing out loud. To my surprise, I still ended up legitimately invested in the story anyways. Turns out if you cut out all the dead air and lengthy monologues, you're left with a half-decent story.

*** Some data points: This is by far the funniest internet periodic video series I've ever watched, and I regularly watch 5 or so. I consider it better than Yu Gi Oh Abridged - which I'd been watching for several years before discovering DBZ abridged. The first few episodes are only sort of okay, though.

**** Seconded. Season 2 (Frieza Saga) is by far my favourite.

** There was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10304402/1/Gohan-and-the-Saiyan-rationale][Rational Gohan]] (too short)

And [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2mp1g9/any_good_dragon_ball_z_dbz_rational_fics/][here's]] the last time your question was asked, not much there. The only actual suggestion was the !Good Cell fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4746383/1/Honor-Trip][Honor Trip]].

Well. I'm afraid we have only one choice left.
