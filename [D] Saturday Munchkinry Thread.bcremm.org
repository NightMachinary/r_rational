Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** *1) How would you munchkin your powers as a flying brick?*

- You wake up one day and realise you have the powers of the archtypical generic flying brick superhuman.
- Through a series of improbable coincidences and some hasty experimentation, you've discovered the following:
- Flight: You can fly, though you've only tried going at low subsonic speeds. You don't know if an atmosphere is required.
- Durability: The first few times you tried flying you accidentally fell 9 stories. It hurt a little, but you didn't seem to sustain any injuries.
- Strength: You slammed a fist on your table and the table broke. You tried picking up your refrigerator and managed it easily without breaking a sweat.
- Speed: You can /at minimum/ sustain a sprint to comfortably keep up with the vehicles on the road, though you could definitely fly faster,

And that's basically it as far as you know.

- You don't really know your upper limits.
- Apart from a few stunned eyewitnesses, no one really knows of your abilities (you are not notable).
- You don't know how you got these abilities, whether you can do anything else, or who else may have them. As far as you can tell, everyone else appears ordinary.\\
- Your reaction times seem to be similar to a normal human.\\
- You don't seem to require consuming additional calories as a result of using these abilities.\\

Apart from turning a generator crank up and down really fast, what would you do? How would you attempt to safely discover/test their limits? Would you attempt to keep a low profile? How would you best utilize your abilities?

Flying brick powers are, unfortunately, not very well suited to low-key staking out the offices of a skeptics association.

You have a superweapon the likes of which the world has never seen. Maybe. I need a physicist on this.

Send the brick into space, where there is no air resistance and so you can accelerate it to whatever speed you wish, subject only to the laws of relativity (which I don't really understand). 50m/s^{2} of acceleration, constantly applied, will let you get to about 1/10th the speed of light in a week. With enough time, I think you can slam the brick at near lightspeeds into things you want to destroy, like satellites, space stations. Maybe even Earth cities.

***** Rather than being used to get into orbit, this brick would be incredibly useful after being placed in orbit. As [[/u/sambelulek]] mentioned, this gives you 150 N in any direction, /with no reaction mass/. That last one is the key, because it means that your delta-V is no longer limited by the amount of mass that you can carry with you.

As an example, the Voyager probe weighs 825.5 kg, so the brick could give it a continuous acceleration of 18 cm/s^{2}. This doesn't sound like much, but you could accelerate to the current cruising velocity of 17 km/sec in 1 day. Imagine being able to send a Voyager probe anywhere, for no additional cost beyond reaching orbit.without needing to wait for appropriate launch windows. After the probe is accelerated, the brick can be retrieved to be used for the next probe.

The Apollo missions have more mass, about 14 tons, which gives 5 mm/sec^{2}. A Hohmann transfer to Mars takes about 1.4 years. With continuous acceleration of 5 mm/sec^{2}, flipping around at the halfway point, that can be reduced to 85 days. This could be further reduced with aerobraking, some conventional acceleration, etc, but that would be a rough estimation.

[[https://space.stackexchange.com/a/841/20145][Here]], somebody did the math on how long it takes to go to each planet with 1g of acceleration. Divide those values by 5, and you get about 3 days to go to Neptune.

Outside the solar system, it would be a pain to get back. For those, you would accelerate the probe, then bring the brick back. The probe would then be either a fly-by, or aerobraking, depending on what you are aiming at.

- You telepathically control an ordinary sized, hollowed out clay brick that is trapped inside your abdominal cavity. (Your organs are fine, and the brick was sterilized before insertion.)
- It weighs a little over 3kg, and is as durable as a typical well made fired brick.
- You weigh a little over 75kg
- With a thought, you can command the brick to accelerate in any direction.
- You are instinctively aware of the brick's position relative to yourself. Mainly because you can feel it moving around inside you.
- It can generate thrust to continuously accelerate (itself) at up to 50m/s^2 in any direction, but is otherwise subject to normal physics. (So it will achieve much lower velocities since it has to drag your body around.)
- This ability only works while the brick is inside your body, and your proprioception and control of it propagates at lightspeed.

You feed off the demons powers, making you functionally immortal: you stay young forever and cannot die expect through deliberate suicide. The demon is trapped inside its prison and cannot interact with the outside world except on the first 24 hours of every year, when the demon gets control of your sense of hearing and sight, making you see or hear anything it wants you to.

The demon works by HPMOR!Sorting Hat rules, it's as smart as you are and knows everything you know, but it hates your guts and want nothing more than getting you to commit suicide or, if that is not achievable, make your eternal life as miserable as possible.

It cannot trick you into believing that what you're seeing is real as your other senses are still working normally, but it can drag up anything you secretly feel guilty about, make you relive memories you'd rather forget (and even subtly tweak them if it wants to) or it can just play into your insecurities and try to talk you into believing that you are a terrible human being.

*** First thing that comes to mind is taking note of the parachute-tattoo and unlocking skin magic. Then, saving the first-cowardice girl and convincing her to help you grind some basic fighting (and maybe throwing, with rocks on the ground) skills so you're not /completely/ helpless.

Not sure how blood and bone magic would work, but maybe try to mess around with zombie bones for a boost, and get Amaryllis to explain blood magic for a quick cantrip.

*** I'm a been lurking on this subreddit a while, but this actually my first time posting here. Mostly I've delurked since I find this scenario interesting.

*Also this whole post is pretty much a giant spoiler for the serial up to the latest chapter*

The only non-excluded OP combo in the there that we know of for sure is the recently revealed still + soul magic so that would be what I would go for. I'm mostly just going through the book, but there really isn't that much about mechanics and the world(at least that I remember) to really diverge.

*The rough roadmap would probably look like this:*

Get through tutorial with maximum possible MEN but keep a few points for other requirements of various magics.

Going into the desert town is mostly a waste of time. Convince Amaryliss to skip it if you can, otherwise go through as quickly as possible avoiding confrontation with the gold mage (should be doable, maybe), if you can't avoid it abandon Amaryliss for now.

Uniqities didn't contact you until late in the story, but it is implied that they would be approachable under right conditions. Use them to get to Atheneum of Sound and Silence as soon as possible.

Next you need the soul magic. It is somewhat reasonable to assume that as with spirit magic(also get this while you are there anyway), you can unlock it in Library. This part hinges on getting hold of Raven and getting her to take you there. Then convincing her(or the other librarians) to show you enough Library magic to unlock it (which shouldn't be a problem).

Get good enough with soul magic to do the sacrifice. Raise Spirit high enough to get rid of the level problem. Raise as many skills as high as possible.

Enlist Bethel to help you steal the artifact preventing sleeping. Raise Still magic to 100 and other magics as high as possible with what you have left. Rob them blind.

Use your temporary OP powers to level as quickly as possible so you are not helpless if you fall unconcious.

Game Over, mostly.

*Problems I see with this:*

- The physical attribute was needed in the Tutorial but could you get by with blood magic instead. Could you convince Amaryliss to show it to you as you met her?

- Can you avoid Harold if you go soon enough? If not, you would be toast. You could leave it for after Library, but you would not be able to kill the antimemetic monster(you could just run for it though).

- Do we know how to contact Raven? Could we find out?

- This really needs cooperation of other people, you will probably need points in SOC.

- ROB would most likely not appreciate cheesing it.

/Optional Extras that should'nt take too long and should help if you can¨t get long enough with minimal combat:/

- Unlock all of the magics that do not have onerous requirements.

- Gold Magic - this seems really good and the problem here is not unlocking it but getting to keep it. For our purposes, you can get enough gold for the first few motnhs, after which it mostly doesn't matter. You will either have completely OP powers which will make getting enough gold until you win trivial or you will be dead. And that's assumimg that the meta stilling doesn't work on the gold counter.

- Velocity magic - the obvious solution would be to drop down the Boundless Pit and teleport away after you get it. The fall wouldn't take that long and the Pit is deep enough. I honestly can't tell how survivable that speed at low level would be though.

Surely that would only work if the speed required for Velocity magic is below terminal velocity? Since it only takes 12 seconds of free fall to reach terminal velocity, you likely wouldn't even need the Pit. Given this fact and that the speed needed to get velocity magic increases each time someone achieves it, it could be well above terminal velocity by now.

***** Looking at it now, the needed speed (over 600 miles per hour) is much higher than the terminal velocity so simple freefall wouldn't work. Though MC had a skill along the lines of Tinker(Inventor, Mechanic?) and it doesn't seem impossible he could build aerodynamic shell that would work. The issue than is the survivability of the shell, and Joon and getting the skill high enough(or commissioning the shell). It wouldn't be as easy as I made it out to be though, shame.

** Would you rather be able to at will accelerate your thoughts and perceptions of the world by 50% (i.e ”mental processes”) or the speed with which you and parts of your body move (i.e. ”physical processes”), with no accompanying change to the other in either case? Assume that all changes are purely biological, with no supernatural tomfoolery --- to the extent that there exists natural human variation in these abilities, your muscle fibers, neurons, etc. have been subtly altered to result in the above speed-up. Mental processes here would entail things like processing visual information (incl. reading) and contemplation, and would effectively provide you with 50% more subjective experience, but the world around you (incl. e.g. people talking) would appear as if to move 33% slower; physical processes could include things like running (so your so-so 6 min mile would become a very impressive ~4 min mile, excluding the effect terrain deformation or whatever has on running speed), digestion, and recovery from injury, but not e.g. the “mental” components of sleep, though you may feel more “physically” refreshed on less. However, this turbo boost may require a period of adjustment, as your current sense of coordination has been tuned to moving at slower speeds. Required secondary powers would also be in effect (e.g. moving faster means generating more force, so you might also be a bit stronger, insofar as needed).

Having chosen an option, what would you do with it?

And alternatively, if you had to choose an option to /permanently/ apply to yourself, which would you choose? If any at all.

*** Mental processes easily. Most activities that I do are mentally-limited, not physically limited. Reading, typing, writing, thinking, etc. Additionally, for physical processes, actual muscle strength/speed is not my limiting factor; heat is. The faster I run, the faster I'll overheat, so any added muscle/speed would allow me to maybe sprint faster over short distances, but over long-distances I'd still be limited by heat.

With faster mental processes, I'd probably switch to a job which (relatively) minimizes social and physical aspects while maximizing use of enhanced mental ability, like software development, aerospace engineering, etc. and use faster mental speed to complete projects faster than anyone else would be able to in order to get paid 'rockstar' salaries. Or potentially just start making indie games.

*** Important question: Does this age you?

If I choose 50% physical speed, does that effectively cost me a third of my remaining lifespan?

Since the power is apparently purely biological, I would suspect that this is the case.

The question then becomes, what's the limiting factor on your age? Check your family records, if they suffer from things like heart disease, then your limiting factor is likely physical. If they suffer from things like Alzheimer's, then it's mental. Choose the power that doesn't cut short your lifespan.

**** Third option - age: You age at 50% of the rate for your remaining lifespan. (If this happened before you were born and you "would have" lived to be 100, this would make it so that you'd live to be 150 (at which point you'd only look 100).)

***** 50% of the rate would take 100 to 200.

Assuming 100 goes to 150, then compared to mental speed this has the same amount of lifespan experienced. The advantage of aging slower is that you get to see more future. The advantage of thinking faster is that you are effectively smarter in the present.

*** My guts goes towards the mental speed improvement but honestly I'd be worried that conversations with regular people would become even more tedious than they already are, so I'm not sure it's worth it. If the mental improvement allowed me to solve problems I couldn't previously solve it would be different but it only allows me to solve problems that I already could solve, just with 1/3 less time spent.

Physical speed does have the advantage of increasing metabolism so I can eat more delicious food.

If I could turn it on and off at will I'd definitely pick mental speed.

If it did all of those I'd take it in a heartbeat.
