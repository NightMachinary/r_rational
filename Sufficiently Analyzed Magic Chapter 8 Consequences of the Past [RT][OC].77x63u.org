** Glanced in on this. I am... honestly extremely confused as to why, in his introductory meeting, an ambassador would go straight to the most shameful things he could say about his civilisation. Covering up completely, delaying, glossing over... the ambassador seems to fail completely at diplomacy, or even necessary-for-a-job-level bureaucratic savvy.

**** Intriguing. Assuming that the ambassadors aren't able to extract memories or thoughts without permission from those they're meeting with, interference/brainwashing by a hostile third party? (That is to say, the events made might not even have happened, the ambassador only parroting a story concocted for the purpose of starting a war?)

(If it /is/ that an ambassador can't keep secrets, either mindwiping ambassadors specifically, or else preemptively editing the more heinous deeds out of the history passed down to the majority of the population, seems preferable (ethics thrown aside). If ethical and honestly confessing, then a complete surrender to others (and requests to treat innocents well) rather than nonchalantly reporting... whether the case or not, now trying to imagine the sort of society that the Onward could hypothetically have departed from that could give them the impression of their behaviour as approval-worthy, rather than shameful acts taken in desperation.)
