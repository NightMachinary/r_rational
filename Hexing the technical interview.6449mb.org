**** "[[https://aphyr.com/posts/341-hexing-the-technical-interview][Hexing]]" is about writing the raw bytecode of a JVM class to solve a graph problem. "[[https://aphyr.com/posts/340-acing-the-technical-interview][Acing]]" is about an unusual construction for linked lists, and implementing an algorithm for reversing it.

Both are technical interviews where the candidate is a witch, in both behavior and proposed solutions.

***** Ignoring the arcane metadata, the actual *code* part of JVM bytecode is a lot easier to write by hand than most older machine languages.
