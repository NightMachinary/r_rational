**** If you have an account, you can watch the thread and have it send you emails when someone posts in the thread, and it won't be anyone except the author because of how old the thread is.

I didn't think Louise had it in her to be so...compelling.

** This really should be labelled /transhuman/ Louise, considering she's already made it there, really.
