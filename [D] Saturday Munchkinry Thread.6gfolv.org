Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** [Shadowrun 5e, notable setting divergences. Tl;dr: You have intelligence beyond the limit of normal humanity, and limited precognition. How do you break out of your illusory world or stop the spread of the Necronomicon in the cyberpunk future?]

Your alias is Redline, and you are thirty years old. Long ago, you were seized by the unshakeable sense that your three-layered world - Matrix, Meatspace, and the Astral Plane - was entirely fake. Drawing on the teachings of Gnosticism, your terminal value is to discover the true nature of reality, and break out of the illusory imitation you find yourself surrounded by. For the past 8 years, you have been running the shadows, performing deniable criminal activities for the megacorporations and other powers that be, ever since the fateful car crash that took your left arm and promising career as a concert pianist. Until recently, this was in order to pursue illegal cognitive augmentations, hone your skills, and to seek the one secret that could finally allow you to make sense of everything.

Two years ago, London fell to madness, and the rest of the UK shortly followed. The entire island was cut off from the outside world, all access prohibited by order of the Corporate Court. Two of your occasional colleagues, a rigger and a pixie, made it out before the interdiction was fully enforced, and they claim to have previously worked with the person responsible, an anarchist elf adept that the rigger speculated was not entirely of this world.

Supposedly, a Deep Run into the foundations of the Matrix went horribly wrong. Everyone survived, but in the process the elf made a bargain with a simulated elder god. They woke up with a physical copy of Al Azif beside them, an apparently impossible occurrence. By all accounts, this tome insidiously corrupts all of its readers. For a short period, this was limited to the elf, the pixie, and a dragon the elf offered the tome to on a whim. Then the elf died, revealing they had set up a dead man's switch to send a digital copy of the book to everyone in range.

By now, it has become clear that the containment has failed. The Black Lodge, the most powerful secret society in Europe, has already been completely compromised. On your previous mission, you discovered the tome had spread to the Seelie Court, a metaplane subject to accelerated time and with hidden portals across the globe.

Your team is split between going down fighting, or fleeing somewhere the corruption will be unable to follow. You are currently gazing out onto the Berlin sprawl from the cramped confines of the coffin motel room, pondering your next move.

You have a newly installed, custom-designed cybernetic left arm, illegally overclocked for precision and power. Hidden behind its armour is a prototype cyberdeck, a reward for hacking the e-ghost of the dragon ex-president of the UCAS. These alone make you a formidable opponent in the Meat and the Matrix, even without all the other gear and gadgets waiting in the smuggling compartments of your tankcycle, thirty stories below.

In addition, you are a mystic adept, capable of channeling mana into spells and into your body. You have focused on enhancement and are currently affected by almost a dozen permanent spells. Through a combination of this magic, nanotechnology, genetic optimisation, and tailored nootropics, your logical abilities are at the limit of what is possible for anything but an AI or a dragon. You can even outsmart most of those.

Lastly, you have discovered that, by performing an hour-long ritual and crushing 8 magic 8-balls in your metal fist, you can achieve limited glimpses of the future. It seems to be affected by what resembles the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics: vague questions covering a month into the future receive mostly helpful, unambiguous responses, while very specific queries or those relating to the immediate future are cryptic and barely better than chance at the best of times.

**** Unfortunately it seems to be the latter. Even if it wasn't, you're not comfortable with putting all your confidence in this technique just yet, as you don't exactly know what's answering the questions.

For example, one idea you've had is to go to an isolated location prior to starting a hack and ask whether you will interact with anyone in meatspace or the astral in the next week. If this is the case, you can immediately return to civilisation, in order to effectively defuse the prediction. If not, however, you can camp out and be confident that the hack will go undetected as otherwise you would expect a High Threat Response team to come hunt you down.

***** I'd expect that to fail for the same reason specific or short-range queries do - it begets paradox, for you might be interrupted iff you hack, which you do iff you are told you shan't be interrupted.

So one hypothesis would be that it gives you the least cryptic answer that avoids paradox. One way to test that would be to ask for whether you are going to press this button right after the ritual, press the button if it said I would, and see how cryptic the message was.

Another hypothesis would be that it gives you the least cryptic answer that it is sure, based on its fallible heuristics, will not turn out to be wrong. [This one would be the most lenient possible hypothesis if a pen-and-paper GM is supplying the answers.] In this case you might be able to figure out stuff about its heuristics with particular questions - a possibility that presents itself to me /for some reason/ is that it is good at predicting anything that doesn't depend on the future actions of you and a select number of your acquaintances.

******* In fact (your thread is brilliant!) the powers of Intelligence and suspicion that the world is fake should combine exactly to break the fourth wall by in-character entertaining the hypothesis that I'm playing a PnP. A way to test this, after the tests from the edit in my previous answer pointed in the direction, would be to flip an object into one of two containers without looking, ask whether the first container I (or my acquaintances) check will contain the object, and see whether the answer was unambiguous and correct. For a GM can fudge the object to be in a superposition of the two positions and entangle it with my future actions, so long as I only observe its position after my player reveals the entangled action to the GM.

Your point about the answers being the minimum level of vagueness necessary to ensure they're never wrong, for the sake of the GM, is an excellent one. That's probably the best way to consider the divination powers. It definitely would be fun for me (if not for the GM :P ) to come up with a series of tests in order to deduce exactly how the divination works. Sadly, the rules themselves are rather vague and lacking in detail, so that line of investigation probably wouldn't be practical out of game. However, I do really like the idea of using different queries to eliminate various hypotheses of how the mechanism of the divination works, as that's exactly the kind of process that would be in character for Redline.

And then, next question - are there any hints that suggest that the /past/ might be in some sort of superpositioned state that is collapsing with every prediction?

And... can Redline influence the way that the Past's superpositioned state collapses by correctly phrasing the questions?

(I know that predictions work in the FATE system by making actions that support the prediction more likely to succeed and actions that prevent it less likely to succeed, that's another option Redline might like to investigate).

** You've discovered a genie and wished for reality-warping powers. Unfortunately, in typical genie fashion, it has twisted your wish, and your powers are now limited to fictional realities. You now have complete control over the canon of every fictional universe.

This control is not retroactive, so you can't significantly change real-world history through changes to influential books, but the physical books, and any other record of the stories involved, will be altered to match. How do you best take advantage of this power under the following two scenarios?

*A:* The "any other record" stipulation includes everyone's memories. No one notices the change, but if a historically significant work is changed, this does cause some confusion when people notice that the rest of history doesn't seem to line up.

*B:* The aforementioned stipulation does /not/ include anyone's memories. People /do/ notice the changes, but most chalk them up to faulty memories, because all records point to the new canon, including hard-copy ones. A few people count the changes as more proof of the "Mandela effect", but generally aren't taken seriously.

Suddenly, all the aforementioned figures, along with Harry Potter, Luke Skywalker, Batman, etc. yearn for the possession of, IDK, rocks from a very particular quarry that happens to be in my possession. Hell, make it a holy site, and me its rightful heir, and also there's a very strong taboo against counterfeiting these rocks or taking any actions to harm those who own the land.

***** I think maybe if you were subtle about it and didn't change anything too strongly at once in the first case, people would write off historical inconsistencies as motivated thinking/hypocrisy, and the semi-universal nature of the changes would potentially help there (if all these great figures agree on some important truth, then surely it must hold some merit!)

In the second case, "inorganic" advertising/product placement might be tricky/suspicious, but I think if it's sufficiently un-commercial I could still make a killing -- e.g. buy up the art of some old, dead, obscure painter, and change fictional works to extol their immense skill and revolutionary ability. Then, after revealing that I've miraculously found a hidden collection of their paintings I can sell them off for some obscene amount of money. If art is more about signaling than "objective" quality it shouldn't be too suspicious, compared to Jesus loving the refreshing taste of Pepsi or whatever.

Since the power is limited to fictional realities, it must have some way to distinguish fiction from non-fiction, right? If I write a non-fiction book, and then introduce a detail about some unknown event or principle, does the book become classified (according to the power) as fiction if that detail does not correspond to (nonfictional) reality? If so, I feel I could use this as a way to divine hidden truths, e.g. by writing two books consisting of:

"The sky is blue. P = NP. My hair is brown."

and

"The sky is blue. P =/= NP. My hair is brown."

Since my hair really is brown and the sky really is blue, I can try to alter the propositions relating to color in each book, and thereby see whether P=NP by virtue of which book's canon I can manipulate.

If contracts can qualify as works for the purposes of this power, you can have all parties write them out and add "The sky is blue and I fully intend to abide by all the terms in this contract" at the end, and then check to see whether you can alter the contracts afterwards.

Hmm... what if the authors believed they were creating an allegory /for/ history? Like, if a Biblical account is a fictionalized version of something that actually happened, like if the parting of the Red Sea story was meant to be a more exciting version of the actual event where they sailed across the Red Sea or something. (Purely an example.) Is it considered a fictional text, because the author deliberately added in details they knew weren't true, or a historical text, because the author was generally trying to record events they believe happened? I'm inclined to believe that it wouldn't count as fiction, just like you can't edit all accounts of American history just because George Washington was lying about his age and no one ever found out about it.

*** I'm surprised no-one has given the obvious answer of creating a fictional text taking place inside an eternal hypercomputer which is running a FAI that is aware that it exists in a fictional universe. Then most of the story would consist of the FAI monologuing about how you would instantiate it in the actual world or otherwise doing things to pass information to you.\\
Hell while you're at it you could write in that the FAI has knowledge of every single quantum event that happened in your universe's past and gains knowledge of any new quantum events in real time (obviously you can't give it perfect future knowledge because that would require making the real world's quantum events non-random). So the directions would go from general directions on making a FAI to effectively a fairly accurate path to victory.

Given the stuff about how the story progresses naturally you said to Noumero I can't see any way of realistically getting rid of this exploit, without making it so fictional characters are incapable of knowing that, and without also not allowing the power to generate any new information.

A "fictional universe" is the abstract context in which the narratives take place. In this respect, you don't have complete granular control over the works themselves. Think of the power as replacing the works with works from a parallel universe in which the author had had different intentions. So if the change you make is minor enough, or not related to the main story, the book might not change at all.

So you could, say, alter DC canon so that Bruce Wayne puts all of his money into AI development, but that doesn't mean that the full code of the resulting AGI would now be included in every Batman video game. Likewise, you can't directly make a book longer; you could add diversions to the main quest to delay the heroes, but the author may decide to gloss over the details to keep it to a readable length. There may be minor fluctuations in mass, compensated for by taking matter from elsewhere, but you couldn't make a book unreasonably massive.

And you could manipulate history books? That's /so/ broken. You could analyze the behaviour of humanity based on arbitrary premises, initiating wars or conflicts then seeing how simulated people reacted.

Better yet. Take an empty piece of paper, then decide to write an autobiography/a diary. Diligently fill it with information a few days/weeks/months/years. Then use your power on the result, changing the empty piece of paper fictional!you held at the beginning to contain some kind of message, such as “go break into NSA” --- obviously precommit to follow all messages displayed before initiating this plan first.

******* No I can't, but the powers granularity is also limited by one's ability to be able to tell the difference. So i'm still confused as to whether this power actually /does anything/.

*** This seems almost like normal perception. What you're getting from this power is guaranteed accuracy, known precision, immunity to confounding factors (e.g. conductive objects feel colder), and the ability to express yourself in common units.

As for the limits to granularity, I can easily detect a 1' step up or down. Does that mean that I can tell whether I'm at 5000' or 5001' of elevation? If so, I may have more ideas...

*** This might be one of the most useless superpowers since you can get it just by practicing. Practice weighing lots of stuff and you'll be able to tell how heavy something is to a "high degree of accuracy" that is "limited to the granularity of your natural perception".

So the only thing this superpower does is save you the effort of practicing measuring stuff.

*** Does this power only extend to specific types of measurements? Your examples seem to all be physical, but what about less physical measurements?

For instance, right now if someone tells me a lie, I can sometimes perceive whether or not they're lying to me (depending on a number of factors). With this power you're suggesting, if anyone lied to me, would I be able to 'accurately measure' the boolean value of whether or not they're telling a lie?

Taking that even further, statements people make can have a measure of objective accuracy. For instance, if I'm staring at a blue phone and say "The phone is blue", that statement is objectively more accurate than me saying "The phone is red", /regardless of whether I personally believe that the phone is red/ (for now, let's ignore the arguments regarding the world/perception/etc as all an illusion or theater of the mind, and assume things can objectively have specific color attributes).

So with this power, could I judge the % accuracy of a person's statement, regardless of what they personally know? If so, you could use methods of increasingly educational guessing to accurately predict the future, just by having someone tell you that something happens in the future, and judging how accurate the statement is.

**** The power doesn't provide you with extra information; it just allows you to more numerically process the information that you have. So you could tell, for instance, that there's a roughly 70% chance that proposition P is true based on your current knowledge, but you couldn't predict the future through wild guessing any more than you could measure an object through a photograph with no reference points.

***** Is this subject to cognitive biases? For example, what would it tell a theist that asks himself how likely his theist beliefs are, or what a neutral observer would think given what the theist has observed of the world?

Does the power help with mental arithmetic?
