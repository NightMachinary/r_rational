  Just to give prospective readers an idea of how long it is, the first 100K words alone cover just the first 24 hours of the story.

*** Really? They have relativistic space combat! No scifi ever has relativistic space combat!

Just because they have FTL travel is a pretty poor reason to ignore the sheer sciencyness of this work. FTL isn't /disproven/ either, and no scifi ever has been able to get away without /some/ handwaving.

The way I see it, the story explicitly asks you to suspend disbelief about magic, FTL and incomprehensible alien tech (which I suspect is because magic), and everything else is thoroughly hard scifi, meaning extrapolable based on modern science. Not only that, it sets hard rules about the limitations of technology and then follows them scrupulously.

The equivalent to my mind is saying Blindsight isn't hard scifi because Vampires.

Both stories are about as hard as modern scifi can get. 4 Mohs

**** /No scifi ever has relativistic space combat!/

There's kind of a lot of SF that has done this, particularly various military SF.

Basically, if you have to take all the magic that is at the core of the story, all the FTL, and all the incomprehensible alien tech, and all the elements where the "soul" and "mind" are tied to magic gems and happiness and the like (not a result of physical and chemical processes in neurons but instead magic)... and you label that all "not really part of the story in spite of being core conceits of the story" then what remains is, indeed, medium-hard science fiction. However, if you take all the FTL teleporting and time-travelling dragons and psionics out of McCaffrey's Pern what you have left is also 'hard sci-fi'. And if you take all the bene-gesserit and future prediction and FTL travel and magic forcefields which turn into nukes if hit by lasers and the like out of Dune, you have a 'hard sci-fi' book. And if you take all the capsaicin out of chili peppers then the peppers aren't spicy. By this sort of metric we can easily place /anything/ as hard science fiction, by deciding that the stuff that is soft doesn't count.

This is a fundamentally unhelpful way to think about things. Stories are not defined as sciency because everyone obeys the universal laws of gravitation and because nobody violates the laws of thermodynamics; they are defined as /not sciency/ by the presence of not-sciency elements, not by the addition of sciency elements. Almost all elements of almost all stories will always follow science because science matches up to inherent expectations of the universe - 95%+ of stories involve humans that obey the rules of chemistry and biology, for example, but the fact that the humans have the Krebs cycle occuring in all their cells and stuff gets you no credit at all when you have the humans in question use soul-based magic to travel back in time to do a groundhog day scenario to attempt to rescue their friend from a magic immortal alien ferret's machinations.

Hardness of science fiction cannot be logically assessed or measured by presence of science-based stuff because 99%+ of all background stuff in all worlds is science based; only the /absence/ of science-violating stuff makes sense as a metric.

***** Definite 4 Mohs rating. The only things you need to accept is the Madoka setting magic, and FTL.

Two lies. That is it. And even those lies are made internally consistent.

******* Exactly. Harry Potter /is/ set in a realistic modern world if you accept the single lie. It isn't actually sci-fi at all, but if it was it would be 5 on the Moh scale.

I think we are at the agree to disagree stage of this disagreement.

*** Even without the magic, that's fair. I guess I was thinking more of the post scarcity and transhumanist elements, which I associate with HSF.

**** I personally usually use the word 'hard' in relation to science fiction to describe fiction that more closely obeys the laws of physics as we know/understand them today, or when breaking those explains a lot of the physics it's breaking and how it does so in some sort of manner. For example, a work where everything obeys lightspeed limitations and relativity and works within those restrictions to achieve interstellar travel by generation ships or cryosleep or bussard ramjets or digitization and transmission to be rebuilt by civilizations at another star or the like is 'harder' SF than one where people go to Warp Speed and FTL by pulling a big red lever labelled FTL with no explanation.

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfScienceFictionHardness][TVTropes]] backs me up in this interpretation.

There's a lot of really good science fiction that has been as soft as butter (e.g. Dune, Hyperion, etc); hardness is no real indicator of quality.

  Because of reddit's ranking algorithm, there's no way for users to bump old posts to the front page. For this reason, reposts are not only allowed but explicitly encouraged!

This is mostly because (a) there's a shortage of good rational stories, and (b) the sub is still pretty small but growing. Post anything relevant!
