For the last year I've been entertaining the idea of writing a rationalist fanfic of the Time War from Doctor Who. I was having a lot of difficulty with the worldbuilding, but thanks to some help (from 4chan/tv/ of all places), I've gotten around to taking a stab at Chapter One. It's a short thing, less than two thousand words; the tentative title is "Healer of All Wounds". *You can read it [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r2ivYFvBVfpf3oh99cVb1M_Z7q_JMY2hYDR3A38ydW0/edit?usp=sharing][here]].*

So, [[/r/rational]], here's where you can help me out. Did you like it? Comments, complaints, critiques? Where would /you/ go from here? Are there any parts of the Doctor Who universe you'd like to see explored? Any and all feedback is requested. Thanks in advance!


** Which Doctor is this going to be based around, and how much lore from either series (old and new) are you planning on using? Will I understand everything if I haven't seen the early stuff? Will I be able to follow along anyways?

"They tried to impose their homeworld from Dronid." I think something's wrong with this sentence. I don't know what's going on here.

As for stuff I would like to see, in S02E03 (new series) "School Reunion," the plot revolves around the Skasis Paradigm, which is essentially a theory of everything that grants people godhood. I've always headcanoned that the Doctor first learned of this in the Time War, and things went horribly wrong when people tried to abuse it. Just a thought.

All that aside, so far so good. I'd read more of it.

A modified kind of Eighth Doctor, just because he's the one in the Time War (era). Since the crash went differently, there's no War Doctor. I plan to pick and choose from the lore, since there's just so much. But no, I don't plan on leaving anything unexplained. (Even if it means introducing a companion.) Someone with no knowledge of the show should be able to follow along.

An explanation of the mechanics of time travel, and therefore homeworlds etc, will come in a later chapter. Right now, it's fine if it's technobabble.

** If the Doctor Who universe is going to be given a rational treatment, you'll need to wildly diverge from canon with respect to the strategies the Time Lords use. The Time Lords are a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#Type_IV][Type IV Kardashev]] Civilisation, given their access to incredible technology such as TARDIS'. If they are going to put themselves in personal danger, like the Doctor does, then they are going to be easily capable of creating personal equipment, like an invulnerable personal shield, and far better weapons than a sonic screwdriver. The Doctor's TARDIS alone seems easily capable of creating things like that, despite not specialising in creating things, and yet he goes out with little protection, leading to him being captured on a regular basis in canon, and in your first chapter where he is grievously injured.

The scene in that teaser video the BBC released before the 50th anniversary, about a foot soldier fighting in the Time War, would never happen because with access to the powers to the Time Lords have, you don't fight wars with foot soldiers. Even with a soldier based strategy, you would use invulnerable robots, not mortal soldiers. Civilian targets wouldn't need to be defended when you can just evacuate them all with a TARDIS to literally anywhere else in time and space.

Fighting a war changes completely with access to just teleportation, let alone time travel. Incidentally, you will need to make some forms of rules about sending information to past selves, because otherwise fighting a war becomes completely futile, as everyone hears the enemies plans before they are implemented

*** This. Much as I love DW, I don't think there's anyway to make an honest rational fic out of it without totally changing /everything/ to the point that it bears no resemblance to the original at all.

For example, you'll very likely have to change the fact that Time Lords are essentially humans with some extra organs and undefined temporal sensitivity. I can't imagine how any Type IV civilization would still view meatbodies as a sensible idea.

So the Doctor goes from being a smart quirky alien dude to a quirky postbiological superintelligence. This kinda makes any plots with human companions boring, because it would be like taking your pet ant along to save the world. :(

Then again, the Doctor lies, so...

The Doctor and most of the Time Lords will be meat bodies, but there's a very good reason (or at least I think so) that I can't reveal without revealing a major plot point.

Out of curiosity, what in your opinion are the strategies Time Lords use in canon? Especially in Doctor Who, the word is kinda meaningless, so I'm wondering if you're including the EDA, Big Finish Audios, and Faction Paradox in that assessment.

As for the rest of the post, I plan to have most of it covered or rendered irrelevant, so that'll be taken care of.

*************** You've not teleported; you've traveled to another timeline. The old one still exists.

In Doctor Who canon, one of the core elements is the importance of GMT -- that is, Gallifrey Mean Time. See [[http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/2bxxmd/meeting_time_lords/cjajqcb?context=4][this thread]] for an explanation. I've incorporated that part of canon into my cosmology; thankfully, the multiple timeline theory [[http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/2bxxmd/meeting_time_lords/cjaozoh][relieves some of the paradoxes]].

This is through the concept of homeworlds: Gallifrey is the homeworld of the universe / collection of timelines / "cluster. All the Everett branches and universes that have been time-travelled into existence are sort of condensed at Gallifrey. There are various smaller, localized homeworlds, but Gallifrey dwarfs them all. As such, one can travel between different timelines through homeworlds, so if you time travel away from a conflict, you can be tracked and followed. This also means time travel physically doesn't work in homeworlds; they can only be traveled to through space.

The Enemy, on that note, is the civilization of the homeworld of another cluster, and is trying to incorporate the Gallifrey Cluster into theirs. If they succeeded, Gallifrey would be unwritten from time, replaced by the Enemy homeworld. And that's the essence of the Time War in a nutshell.

When you have that kind of power, you can just destroy every star system of your opponent. They don't need to invade Gallifrey when they can make its star go supernova

TL;DR: In order for the story to not be arbitrary, you have to very carefully define to yourself the mechanics of how time travel works. It is surprisingly difficult to do so. I'm 60% sure the model I described there makes the universe conspire to prevent all time travel, but it's better than any of the others I've seen. I started programming a simulation of an extremely simple universe containing time travel under this model to test it but I gave up when real life kept me too busy.

I decided the Daleks needed an upgrade, to be feasible challengers of the Time Lords. An explanation of time travel, homeworlds, and the hypertime clusters will come in a latter chapter, after the companion is introduced.

Agreed. I really didn't know where to go from there; I think I might hack the conversation between the Doctor and the Great Mother to include more exposition.

As for the Neurosurgeon bot, I suppose I didn't make that clear enough. It may or may not become important later on down the road. And if it doesn't, I'll chop it. Either way, that reveal (that the surgery bot sitting by the Doctor's hospital bed was a neurosurgeon) needs serious editing, for clarity and nonstupidity (there's no good reason for it to not respond to the first request).

**** I'm glad you appreciated it. For a bit more:

Particularly for the Daleks/opponents, if you can't make it clear pretty early in the story, it might be better to have a brief introduction /in medias res/ where you have enough throwaway lines to make broad strokes clear before jumping back to the beginning. I think if there's one thing that invested fans and people with no knowledge of the show would both find confusing, it's that the Doctor is fighting a war and it's against neither the Daleks nor the Cybermen.

And when I say early in the story, if you're three chapters or 10K words in and you haven't explained that, I think you'd have problems.

If you do go with /in medias res/, it's obviously pretty easy to jump back to this as 'the beginning', since it's when he first finds out the war exists.

Noted. This is going to be a little difficult, given that, in this story, the Daleks are from outside of the Doctor's / Time Lord's universe, and nobody has any sort of clue as to what they are until much later. (The one difficulty of writing fanfic - everyone already knows what's what. This would be perfectly fine in a regular story, but since most of the readers are already going to know who / what the Time Lords' opponents in the Time War are, it's all kboshed. Why am I putting this in a Doctor Who setting again?)

I think I'll be able to work around that, though, by not having the Doctor directly interact with the Daleks until their identity is established (or pretty close to established, at least). It's going to be very much a Time Lords vs Daleks war, not a Doctor vs Daleks war. If that makes sense.

Bleagh, I'll reread your comment tomorrow and see what I can come up with then.
