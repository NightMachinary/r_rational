In most works of fiction, the hero ultimately wins. The day is saved, evil is vanquished. Often, though, this depends on a very specific series of events to play out, often times very unlikely ones.

It's easy to picture, in many given works, that the number of possible universes in which the hero doesn't succeed are much more numerous.

It stands to reason then that if you suddenly found yourself in the body of someone that doesn't matter to the "plot", the most rational option is to stay the hell out of the way.

Inserts into important characters are, of course, another matter wntirely. Even inserts into characters minor to "plot".

Just something that's crossed my mind on reading a few of these kinds of stories, and stumbling onto the alt history forums. The real world doesn't really have a plot, persay, but if I was, say, suddenly dropped pre-ww2 I'd be terrified as hell to do anything.


** If I was dropped pre-WW2? Nevermind the war's "plot", I'd be terrified as hell just figuring out how to stay healthy, not to mention stay out of what passed for prisons and/or mental institutions back then.

I'd also recommend traveling to / staying in the US pre-1941, but that only really gives you two years before you have to move elsewhere. Although if you had an excuse (medical or otherwise) to avoid the draft, you could probably remain on the mainland for the duration.

Pre-WW2 wasn't /quite/ the Middle-Age, but c'mon, let's be honest here. No-one born post-40's, to say nothing of post-70's, is equipped to live pre-40's, and the war has nothing to do with that.

Not to mention that if you really wanted to raise cash to a level where you could live in 1930s-ish luxury, there are a lot of scams which didn't become specifically illegal until later, or were incredibly difficult to track until the advent of computers. Particularly with communication in some of the more rural areas taking a long time and phone systems only being installed later.

****** Indeed. Although how I, as a 38yo 21th-century product, with little to no knowledge of even the basic facts of life-at-that-time, would be able to do any of that without being sent to the loony bin, well that's what's stumping me.

Eating well. Sounds promising. Except that, in that time, I have absolutely no indicators of what "good food" looks like, or even what effect certified "good food" can have on my modern guts.

Exercise. Well okay, that's a pretty much atemporal thing.

Scams. I have, literally, no idea which scams are known at that time, or of the punishment if I'm caught. By either lawful or lawless powers, might I add. The state of long-range communication networks mean nothing when the scammed can track you down with a little neighbourly inquiry and twenty buddies. (That's if by some miracle I manage to convince myself to try it, /and/ I manage to actually /succeed/. I don't have any particular delinquent tendencies, and frankly I don't know any scam tricks).

Investing. Right. A nobody with no contacts, no referents, no funds and no knowledge of current financial principles. Easy.

ID forging? Again, you'd need intimate local (time and space) knowledge to forge something passable for anything worthy of the time and materials (that you'd have to procure) you'd have to spend for those.

In other words, the only realistic way for any 21thC person to adapt comfortably in the 20's or 30's is, well, to be a native to that period.

Or have magic. A spell to not let people be aware of any suspicious lack of local knowledge. Another to turn local food ready for consumption. Yet another for any of the then-common illnesses we're no longer vaccinated against because they've been eradicated for decades. Etc.

Or have a support network of in-the-know locals. That would be a big help.

******* Why do you act like the food back then was poisonous? Any food from farms that you can visit to make sure they aren't using tonnes of pesticides should be just as good as that of today, maybe even better.

Vaccination was probably more limited then than now and only few vaccinatable diseases have actually been completely eradicated. The rest should be available by asking a local doctor of any repute.

If you manage to succeed with some scam (probably by first establishing yourself for a year or so and then contacting actual criminals, which aren't that hard to find in any age if you actually go out looking for them) you'll just have to follow the age-old wisdom of scam artists and not stay in whatever region your former victims live.

I don't believe I'd be able to enter a crime mob the way I enter a supermarket; and I don't believe I'd be able to /quit/ a crime mob the way I do a supermarket.

I'm not being clear in my reasoning, I think. I took the premise, which I understand as: "One day, I get transported in the 1920's or 1930's. I have no local resources. I am myself with my present knowledge, which does not include any specifics about my new environment. What happens?". From that premise, I imagine how I would react.

I am not actually plotting a time-travel self-insert, where I wouldn't have to worry about my internal plumbing and not much more about sheltering; and concentrating about what's really interesting in a story (how to get money and construct an empire from my knowledge of the future).

I was actually trying to be realistic, and when I get realistic, I don't see myself becoming a scam artist as easily as I can build a VM to add to my RDS farm. I don't see myself easily adapting to a low-tech and low-services time period. I don't see myself easily adapting to a society whose social mores and politics are, to say the least, /not mine AT ALL/.

I'm a product of the 21th century. I depend on structures (moral, social, societal, technological, and more) that simply /do not exist/ prior to the 60's. Suddenly living in the beginning of the 20th century would /not/ be a challenge fit for a epic story, it would be a bloody nightmare which I would not survive intact, if at all.

It goes without saying that any period prior to the 20th would mean death in a week, I think.

Actually, as a French, I see those immigrants you talk about. I don't know if your news networks talk about the Calais camp ("The Jungle")? It's about 160km from my home. 1h30 by car, more or less. They needed modern support networks to get there, and to survive there. Those who didn't, died on the way. Well they also died from treachery, sea, cold, hunger, fatigue and other things not necessarily directly related to a lack of modern necessities, but... Yeah. They died. Lots and lots of them. Mostly because the West (we) consider that it's not really their problem, and they should be thanked that they're already 'helping' as much as they do, but that's another debate entirely.

I'm a white male, yes. I'm pessimistic because I know what I can and can't do. This time-travel scenario is well beyond where I evaluate my personal abilities.

Not being Black, I can only know of their hardships by listening to my uncle. Not being a woman, or any other "minority" (because women are only a "minority" when talking about the power they're allowed to have), I can only know of theirs by listening to my mother, and the other women of my family, and another uncle I only understood in my teens why he wasn't married to his friend (he is, now!), and of course the occasional encounters with social workers and medical staff at work.

Yeah, "second-class citizen" is kind of a thing for me. Sorry.

I don't know how anyone else, of any sex, gender, nationality or ethnicity, would react to being transported with no preparation nor knowledge to the 20's, in France or anywhere else. The scenario was "how would you", not "how would a random citizen". I know /I/ would freak out and probably wouldn't manage in the long term.

From my perspective, there's already so much random events and arbitrary noise in reality that anything which actually happened was probably pretty likely to happen. As such, small changes are likely to just get lost in the noise of randomness when compared to the much larger forces pushing events forward.

Another is that since you are there, something/someone is changing things in ways you can't predict. Assuming that they won't drop anyone else in, or make other changes is risky.

If you are committed to making no changes, it's best to kill yourself early, taking care that no one ever knows about it. That is a huge risk if things do leave the rails.

Perhaps you could leave some insurance, eg. leave a plot-spoiler somewhere they wouldn't find it in the normal plot, so if they do find it the timeline is already fucked.

  What do I care about the probability density of the whole when no particular version of me can meaningfully interact with anything outside his tiny compartmentalized prison?

Well yes, that tends to be my view of it as well, but I was trying to be convincing to someone who doesn't look at it that way. Personally I'd rather maximise the chances of whatever earth/world/whatever I happen to be stuck on, if I had the power to do so.

Either the multiverse cannot be engineered (hint, it's this one), or the Epicurean Riddle comes back to haunt us with evil gods. Don't let the Epicurean Riddle haunt us with evil gods, please, that's how we got Roko's dumb snake.

********** The multiverse is a concept of mathematical platonism. All possible things exist in all possible ways. There is no way to engineer it, you are working from the inside. Anything you 'do' is counterbalanced by all of the worlds in which you did not exist and act in the exact same way. It is impossible to exist in a region defined by a lack of your presence, and by definition this region is not zero.

More strictly speaking, your actions do not do anything to influence the set of all worlds, you only add to or subtract from the subset of worlds that you have in consideration, and your ineradicable presence in the endless branching on the Everett tree means that even these subsets exist in endless configurations dependent on the physics in which you live.

"Manipulating" the multiverse, and indeed, the very idea of a mutable multiverse, is only equivalent to shifting around your own place in a greater and static multiverse. There is no such thing as transcension, you are only moving laterally in the confines of an infinite box that is the same size it has always been.

Grokking the Ensemble, is, as always, very enlightening and mathematically trippy. Thank you for the meditation. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/47io19/self_inserts_is_inaction_the_logical_option/d0es37n][As always, however, this is not important in the slightest.]]

Well that's one way, maybe. Seems far quicker to make sure that each world you turn sends out enough forces to turn 1000 other worlds. Get that exponential growth going.

Nonlocal effects will ensure that even this has a major influence in any universe built on a quantum-mechanical backbone. If you're committed to making no changes, the only time that venitlating an artery will achieve this is in the moments before the insert happens. Afterwards, it's already too late.

**** forget nonlocal effects. The very air you displaced is likely to eventually cause enough of a difference that somewhere, someone's schedule is off by a millisecond. Human plans may keep things on track for a while in spite of that, but if a person is off by a millisecond, they'll have different children. Human reproduction is very vulnerable to the butterfly effect. And then those children are all carriers of your contagious butterflies, and they sure as hell aren't going to bother killing themselves. Long story short, the absolute maximum time you can delay the butterfly effect is one generation.

Nothing less that a destiny based universe could really stop it.

  One problem is the butterfly effect. If taking the last seat on a bus you delay the cousin of someone the main character talks on the phone with a year later, you can fuck up the timeline.
#+end_quote

I agree, unless you're pretty far from the action and pretty close time-wise to the climax, you're going to mess up the story anyway. Since you're going to change things anyway, the best way to do it is to be "deep throat" and feed critical info to the protagonist.

Unless you're basically a homeless friendless bum, that's likely to trigger the butterfly effect worse than if you just try and continue your body's life.

** Nope. Butterfly effect means the second you insert, the canon outcome is completely /dead/. Everything that happens relies on everything else. If something new happens, then information from that event will propagate outwards at the speed of causality. The only rational option if you care about the outcome at all is to attempt to help as your abilities permit. It's fine to do nothing if you're indifferent, though.

Remember that our choices are ultimately the products of physical law, not our will. Changing anything physical will influence those choices, and over time, such effects snowball.

Because however much "Be a fucking tourist and keep a low profile" is the surviving strategy, I'd loose my cool and start trying to fix the world. Mostly, by reproducing books from memory as best I can, because, well, frankly, inserting new ideas into a world is the most disruptive move possible, and it should keep working after I get murdered.

** Something similar was jokingly suggested on Russian military history forum for some of the Stalin's illogical decisions in WWII. That is that Stalin had access to the complete history of WW2 and was afraid to disrupt path to victory (hi Worm). To make one wonder some of the Stalin's decisions were highly competent. The realistic explanation is of cause that Stalin was affected by psychotic bouts and while he was very good in logistics he had poor grasp military tactics, at least at the beginning of the war. However it's not inconceivable, that if not for Stalin's self-destructive decisions/policies like failure to detect (or refusal to see) preparations for Nazi offense, purging officer corps, disarming western border, disastrous performance in the Winter War (with Finland), untimely army reform and more, Hitler may have taken Soviet Union seriously, put German industry on war footing in 1941 (and not in 1943 like in real history) and would prepare for the long campaign, not blitzkrieg. With disastrous consequences for the Soviet Union.

** It honestly depends, I think, on whether the plot is a risky gamble driven on coincidence, or the enaction of a well-planned manuever with lots of redundancies. As soon as you appear, chances of victory go from 1 to some fractional value, but that's true of real life, anyway.

It's not very rational, but the protagonist came to a different idea: the safest place to be in a story in which you're not a protagonist is as close as possible to the protagonist, while making your best to become the tropes that could put your life in danger.
