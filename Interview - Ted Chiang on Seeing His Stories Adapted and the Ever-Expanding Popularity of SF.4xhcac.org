  Obviously, there are still plenty of people who dismiss science fiction out of hand nowadays, but there are also plenty of people who pay little attention to the question of genre when looking for fiction to read. Now there are college classes devoted to science fiction; a writer like Nalo Hopkinson can be a professor in creative writing solely because of her work as a science fiction and fantasy author.

  You spend part of the year on freelance technical writing, and part of the year on a short story.

  As for writers of contemporary fiction, let me mention some stories I admire: “Ralph the Duck” by Frederick Busch; “You're Ugly, Too” by Lorrie Moore; “Men Under Water” by Ralph Lombreglia; “The Bear Came Over the Mountain” by Alice Munro; “Memory Wall” by Anthony Doerr; “Archangel” by Andrea Barrett; and “Medium Tough” by Craig Davidson.

Fresh material to add to the list...

Also, I thought his mention of science fiction as a "marginalized genre" and contemporary realistic fiction as the default was fascinating, or how readers have changed.

Can anyone who's currently involved in that field say anything about the current state of what's accepted/encouraged?
