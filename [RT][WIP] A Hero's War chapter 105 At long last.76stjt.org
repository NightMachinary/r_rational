*** Its an unfortunate part of any thing with meritocracy-like effects.

Its not like this would go away if you removed money or strong markets. This would be the effect if an omni-present ai judged everyones work and cut off the bottom X% form resources better used elsewhere.

**** If an AI's utility function centered around making the community maximally productive, then yes.

If it instead focused on maximising the productivity of each individual - so the less you're able to do, the greater percentage and thus greater weight each gain has - perhaps not.

***** Why would you max the min? Its minamax not maxamin; jacks of all trades was humanity's stone age, specialization is the foundation of wealth.

80/20 laws are harsh and everywhere. You try to isolate the 20% cause of the 80% effect and squeeze it for all its worth, not the other way around.

Unless full employment is the end goal I don't see the propose of finding the the bottom <1% that checks off every bad trait and bring them up. Getting an extra 1,000 dollars worth of resources to tesla/einstein/etc. is likely to do more good towards any goal.

While you would eventually hit diminishing returns; you asolutely drop some % of the population out of the workforce as more trouble than they are worth.

Depends on your utility function. An AI that tagged a segment of the population as "more trouble than they are worth" doesn't sound very Friendly. Being able to opt out of the program, sure, but kicking people out - or treating them as liabilities - based on efficiency, is not a power I'd want to give to a computer.

******* Friendly->best friends or friendly->acting in humanity's interest?

Lets assume we are talking about an unintelligent, war vet with a missing limbs ptsd and a history of child abuse bad enough they will not be high functioning anyway.

While yes a gai could in theory solve each and every one of those problems one after the other. Or it could control the robotic arm it would need to build and control it directly in a factory using non-medical steel, dropping the cost of the therapy and giving the cybernetic implants to someone else.

The factory would likely be able to produce more than one staffed with androids, the therapy could likely be more cost efficient if they took years rather than rushing things to get this guy up and running /now/ and the cybernetic implants lets assume its a straight 1 iq bonus for everyone, it would do better on someone already above average.

If the gai isn't god out of the gate, it would likely be best to keep this guy "on ice", give him new vices that will kill him slower than whatever he's taking and therapy to just keep him barely not suicidal; until everything else is far further ahead; getting space settlements going, all the factories so far beyond up to speed that its effectively post-scarcity for most things, immortality is figured out, etc. Then and only then do you go back and clean up the truly helpless.

As far as I read it none of the adults tried to cheat these children; we had back to back very charitable people during a major social revolution.

*** If you think about it, the 'employer' is essentially taking advantage of children in a tight spot to get low paid child labour in unskilled positions. Welfare is pretty much just random charity from Aesin (chancellor's wife) meant for propaganda purposes than effectiveness.

Although I do agree that the recruiter could probably squeeze them for a bit more or he could be just cheating them in some way... but that would add to the word count of a chapter that my muse didn't want to write. So... yeah.
