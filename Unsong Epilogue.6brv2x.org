** This is mostly a collection of topics about which I feel Unsong underperformed relative to my (high) expectations. These should be read while taking into account that overall I enjoyed the story.

SPOILERS AHEAD

*The bad parts:*

A weak point is the relative uselessness of Unsong (the organization), which is (1) underpowered relative to the real important entities, like angels, demons, Cometspawn, etc; (2) quite useless at hoarding names and (3) becomes completely irrelevant after book 1. From the title of the story (and the logo), one would expect it would be this overly important organization that would influence the events and characters in the book, and this expectation is broken without even being acknowledged.

Similarly, the extremely scary Malia could use some more screen time. She is kinda reduced to the role of a blood bag.

As someone else has said, Metatron is supposed not to talk, but he decides to disguise himself as human and steal a boat to search for himself ar some point. Just so that the seed of the universe grows into something good or something to that effect. The angels actually lie/are wrong when they say that Metatron rides on top of a purple boat which is actually the Leviathan. This is annoyingly misleading for the reader.

The chapter about the War of the Angels is veeeery inconsistent regarding the angels. They go from praising God for 7 days and 7 nights to talking like they're living in a SSC post. It's just too jarring.

Sarah, the kabbahlistic secret weapon (as well as the Vital Name + ensouled Tharmas) is not used in a meaningful way, and the whole sacrifice thing is undone in a couple of chapters after TOK unceremoniously burns the supercomputer as a side effect of killing Caelius. While it might get across the idea that all resistance is futile before the might of TCK/TOK, it comes out as a little underwhelming.

Globally, the pacing is a little off. It takes way to long for us to discover that TCK is actually an important main character and not a minor background event. I felt somewhat betrayed as I felt that the story was straying further and further away from the awesome atmosphere of this fictional depiction of the Bay Area Unitarians (which is still my favorite part of the book). I eventually adjusted, though.

After giving us every indication that it's easy to distinguish a Golem from a human corpse, the book has TCK faking his death with a Golem capable of fooling the Cometspawn. Simeon does believe that fooling them with a Golem might be possible, but we've already seem him being wrong about the Drug Lord and the Captain, so I don't think his opinion was meant to be taken as gospel.

Aaron's misinterpretation of the "fall of a bird" prophecy is irrealistic and out of character. He doesn't even consider the possibility that Robin is the bird, after mentioning that TCK was brokenhearted after her death one or two paragraphs above. The reader doesn't know her name yet, but Aaron does. On a positive note, I really like the fact that his kabbahlistic deduction is visibly very weird and sounded wrong at the time (at least to me).

The "anthropic" explanation for all the coincidences is not very satisfying, but that's probably just my personal preference.

The mechanics of telepathy are poorly understood by the reader, even if they are familiar to the characters. Telepathy seems to mostly work according to the whims of the plot, which narratively is a bad thing.

The story didn't really gain much for being a serial instead of being published in one go or on bigger chunks.

The African soul inconsistency is never addressed: how come many africans don't have a soul and are perfectly ordinary humans while Sara turns into a general artificial intelligence the moment she receives hers?

My other criticisms are related to (lots of) little details, mostly inconsistencies, and nothing about the large scale structure of the novel. They are inevitable for a project of this magnitude without a proper editor. An editor could also "fix" many of the "flaws" I mention here.

*Overall I have to say it's quite good. Among my favorite parts:*

Book 1 is amazing - the depiction of the fictional version of the Bay Area ruled by the theonomic corporations is one of the best things I've read on the internet. I'd have liked more of this.

Props for giving an answer to theodicy. I didn't think the story would actually do it.

I now love biblical whale puns. It's my favorite genre of puns.

Interesting "local" puzzles (the way Unsong discovers the name generating computer, the mystery of the Panama canal, the angel library code, the secret of the seventh sail, the identity of the Captain - or at least the fact that Metatron possesses him sometimes). This is in contrast to the large scale puzzles, which are impossible to guess with any certainty (who is TOK? Why can Malia see Ana while she is invisible? What/who is the drug Lord? Which Golem(s) has Gadiriel created before Sarah? Why did the name stop working? It turns out that the Confounding name confounds people without them noticing and can rewrite Aaron's memories in such a way that he actually holds in his mind a valid mnemonic of 72 letters that makes sente o.O).

Most of Aaron's kabbahlistic rambling moments are great too.

The universe is colorful and interesting.

The distortions of real history are really great, and even better are the tidbits of real history/bible verses/talmud references so outrageous that they seem fake.

The broadcast chapter is great.

Chapter 72 is suitably bleak, especially the very last part. It did feel a little rushed, though.

The epilogue, even if very rushed contrasts nicely with the overly bleak ending of chapter 72 (even if Thamiel's role is a little obscure). It mixes nicely with the Blake references throughout the book.

I don't think that's an inconsistency. It simply may be that having a soul is a sufficient, but not necessary condition for, um... let's call it 'apparent consciousness'.

But if we're talking inconsistencies, I can think of two major ones:

- The Shrouded Constitution anachronism
- We are told angels can't use Names, but the SCABMOM ritual contains an invocation of a Name. It seems Uriel shouldn't have been able to perform it with Sohu; this is never addressed.

**** I don't think your first point is a very serious one. It's just a "timing" issue, right? It can be solved by editing a couple of lines of dialog. A more serious timing issue is Ana's possession by the drug lord, which seems to happen several hours after the events in Vegas. Scott promised he would fix that one eventually (this one actually made me think that the Drug Lord was making an empty threat until Scott corrected me in the comments).

I had failed to notice your last inconsistency! This one's a big one. Maybe it could be solved by making Uriel use the name through some kind of celestial kabbahla (plucking the letters out of thin air) while Sohu says the name? That would be (more) consistent.

Regarding the African problem: it's serious in my opinion because at the time it seems to validate Aaron's perception that ensouling a computer is totally safe, as humans with or without souls are very similar. I thought the whole point of the Madrid conference was to show us that something else might be involved in making Sarah conscious, besides the Vital Name (God's intervention, Raziel behind the Scenes, etc).

***** Remeber, current epoch humans are different from the humans that were created by god. Remeber how trees were redesigned to run on math? A similar process was undertaken for humans, designing them so that they could run without divine light, solely on math. Since we don't see any west Africans after Uriel's machine fails, it's impossible to say what effect that had on them.

What Sarah demonstrates, I think, is that you can artificially give anything, from dust to a computer, sentience with the ensouling name, and that with math you can also give things something equivalent to sentience, though not hooked up to whatever divine machinery cares about souls.

**** Regarding the Prophecy: first, does Aaron really misinterpret the American Pie that badly? He says some correct things, like God's judgement being suspended (hell is destroyed and all that). And we actually never get a completely explained version of the song. Second, father Ellis's interpretation is almost as wild as Aaron's and we only see him interpreting a bit of it (the bit he interprets is correct though).

On the other hand, for the prophecy of the bird you have: (1) the Cometspawn send for the Sercret of TOK shortly after Robin has died , leaving TCK brokenhearted (2) the prophecy talks about "the fall of a bird" (not even a sparrow! And while a robin isn't even a sparrow, a bird is) and (3) TCK listens to the prophecy and never tells anyone about it, for reasons. Both Aaron and Jinxiang completely fail to make the connection that was obvious the moment Robin was introduced... Try rereading that chapter knowing that TCK's wife is named Robin.

I still thought TOK was Acher (I gave it a higher probability than TOK, something like 50% vs 45%), though, mostly because if the characters failed to make this obvious inference then maybe I was in the wrong (also because of the other reasons I mention in the comment where I talk about the puzzles).

**** /Please bear in mind that I might be misinterpreting these "puzzles" as something that can be solved by the reader... This might or might not be Scott's intention./

The "puzzles" were "solved", because the answers were ultimately revealed somehow. I say they are unsatisfying because the story is crafted in a way that you almost have 50% evidence in favor or agains an answer, and no real way of deciding beforehand which answer seems more likely. While I understand that the author doesn't want us to guess the answer too soon, I think that on rereading, we should be able to find some clues pointing in that direction. I don't think this ever happens. Some examples:

- who is TOK? The only 2 pieces of evidence in favor of TCK are (1) why would a relative nobody kill someone who has drawn blood from Thamiel? and (2) why would Vihaan be in league with TOK? Everything else is either neutral or agains: TCK's body is recovered, and still the Cometspawn are fooled; there are loads of red herrings pointing towards Acher; TCK has said Robin that he can't just accumulate sin and kill himself and go to hell (yet he does exactly that in the end!); at one point, Sohu is seemingly memory wiped after Uriel tells her about Acher; TCK wants to maximize sin, yet he makes Las Vegas into a well run civilized city instead of a hive of scum and villainy. The prophecy can be interpreted either way (even if Aaron's interpretation is veeery unconvincing). While the few points in favor are pretty strong, I think this "puzzle" is unfair for the reader because there are equally good points against.

- the Identity of the Captain: same thing... The scene in Panama canal is cleverly crafted so that he can be either God (dog) or Nemo (omen), with no evidence pointing either way. He is the voice of God that never talks, except he is in human form and talks A LOT. Besides, he has a more active role than Aaron. He gets Father Ellis into the crew for some reason (to get Elijah into heaven?). The angels clearly say that metatron is on top of the golden sails of a purple ship (why? To fool the humans? Do angels even coordinate that much?).

- why did the sky crack? Well, apparently in a workd with a well defined magic system based on the Hebrew alphabet, reciting the bible in English has real world effects if it's done in space. This is disappointing after I've read the sentence again and again trying to find something that even sounded like Hebrew.

- who has betrayed the crew of the Not a Metaphor? You could roll the dice on this one. I have a comment in which I outline possible reasons for all the three passengers (I ultimately guess wrong), and on rereading the relevant chapters I can't find any clue that points in the right direction

- who is Malia? Well, this one actually has some hints, but only in the chapter where Robin sells her soul to the Devil. So this one might actually be a good puzzle.

- who is the human-like Golem created by Gadiriel? We get no hint at all in the right direction (Reagan? Really?), and it comes out of the blue, in an otherwise unremarkable chapter.

Again, maybe these are not to be taken as puzzles, and it's my mistake I read them as such. What I wanted to say is that (to me!) the story seems to setup a lot of puzzles that the reader doesn't have an opportunity to solve either rationally or kabbahlistically. Maybe you can get there with some knowledge if Blake's mythology?

Some things are left unanswered of course, but that's to be expected in a universe like Unsong. My point is that while the "puzzles" have answers, the are either not very satisfying or don't seem fair.

For what it's worth, I figured out Robin's scheme well in advance and it made perfect sense to me.

TCK isn't morally perfect, and a willingness to go over-the-top for people he loves is well-established as a moral failing of his. If you want him to turn evil in order to go to Hell, sending his wife there is just the logical choice.

There's a lot more to the magic system than just the Names, though. The whole Apollo 11 thing was based on the "Uriel's machine" part of the magic system, with Adam Kadmon and the non-magical "laws of physics" working like a glitchy computer.

Also, this isn't a mystery, it's the premise of the setting.

#+end_quote

I am rereading Unsong now, and while I'm only partway through, I'm noticing many hints I missed the first time. There actually are a lot of hints for TOK=TCK in retrospect, long before the more obvious stuff. For example, Aaron discusses in the first 15 chapters or so the puzzling prophecies about the Mosiach and how there would be two, an evil one and a wicked one, and how he would either come in the most just or the most evil generation or both. (EDIT: there's even a discussion between TCK and Thamiel a few chapters later about the various messiahs and whether they are the same person) This looks like a throwaway bit of 'weird Talmud stuff', but of course, in retrospect it's obvious that it's quite literal: The Comet King is the good messiah (kabbalistically powerful and devoted to good) but he turns into the bad messiah TOK (equally kabbalistically powerful and devoted to evil), and the Unsong generation is the most wicked generation due to the world collapsing and Thamiel being active but also the most just one after the world gets rewritten into paradise by Aaron-Albion. TCK says when he breaks, he'll break like a comet: visible only to the most far-sighted but continuing on the same course (to destroy Hell) and how comets end in fire and destruction and the end of all things.

Likewise, Sarah and Tharmas's role is foreshadowed by the Rubaiyat "if we could grasp the world entire", the modal realism argument is foreshadowed /twice/ (in the discussion of the 'Digrammatron' and Aaron's discussion of Lurianic cosmology), and even the Captain being Metatron is foreshadowed repeatedly right from the start: while discussing stealing the boat, he is addressed as "Oh God" by future crew and he is described by Lin as "He is" when Ana asks his name. These are not coincidences etc.

I am aware of this prophecy. This sentence says that there would be two messiah, not one messiah that turns into another messiah. Of course you /can/ say that the sentence /is consistent/ with TCK=TOK, but I can't see how it tips the balance in favor of TCK=TOK (if anything, it hints toward the opposite conclusion). It is not quite literal. The literal meaning is that there are TWO messiah.

I'll grant you this one. This is a hint that even after being broken, TCK will want yo destroy Hell. Whether he will be able to or not is another question (he can't if he's been killed by TOK :p), but this sentence is probably a clue pointing the right direction.

This one is too good, especially after the part about the Right Hand of God xD I endorse this as evidence in favor of him being Metatron/God. It's funny that in the comments a commenter suggests that being Metatron is a possibility at this point, and I speculate on the fact that Nemo reversed becomes Omen. We were not that far from the truth. Hidden patterns everywhere.

But in the end, I think the arguments against (he's too active and talks too much) make this 50%/50%.

** I think... I find this story disturbing on a personally existential level.... all of the horrific things the Comet King had to do because of some technicality that you have to be both evil to get into hell yet willing and able to use the Explicit Name to unmake it? A universe were science and math prove to be a shallow facade constructed by an angel that happens to really like math? The only consistent rule being the whimsical coincidences designed to barely redeem the universe enough from evil so that it is worth instantiating in the first place? And of course... all the puns.

The Epilogue... for some reason I don't quite trust the hive mind at the end to fix things. You have... a kabbalist obsessed with puns and bizarre reasoning enough to make would should have been totally irrational and impractical choices, a theologian who care so much about the answer to the problem of evil she would rather ask god that than ask for a way of fixing the world that is currently undergoing an apocalypse, two revolutionary without a cause willing to do violence for poorly thought out reasons, an archangel that had to be explained social skills and basic moral reasoning by a little girl, an very young AI obsessed with her creator... anyway, combining all of their minds, I guess I don't trust things to sort themselves out.

This story had a lot of fun elements, it was just uniquely disturbing at the same time, and I think I wasn't quite willing to suspend disbelief enough to trust that there was a theodicy or to trust Metatron's answer. From failure to suspend disbelief, other details seem a lot worse or more disturbing. For instance... why didn't they Comet King come up with the idea of using the telepathic connection to transfer knowledge of the Explicit name to people already in hell? If one person can't use it, then he could find the right combination of hell bound people, connect them telepathically before they die, and then redeem them after they die and go to hell. It makes the Comet King's wife's plan (or lack thereof) seem really stupid in comparison.

Etc. Etc.

I generally quite liked the worldbuilding and magic and munchkinry (and found the characters to be decent and the writing quality above average), but all of the numerological "fundamental interconnectedness of all things" asides made my eyes glaze over.

** Well, now that it's over, my opinion on the story as whole:

It was a very fun and clever story, the last time I'd cracked up so much was while reading The Seventh Horcrux and that was explicitly a crackfic. If someone had told my I'd like a story with such an abundance of puns I wouldn't have believed them.

The most impressive part were the incredibly convoluted coincidences Scott managed to bring up. I can hardly imagine how much research that took.

The various ideas in the story were very cool, from the brute forcing of magic words, the mechanics of placebomancy, and the drugs effects on reality. The angels were really interesting too.

I also quite enjoyed Sohu and Uriel's story. Ana's and the Comet King's were good too.

At this point however, we get to my criticism. One storyline I thought was mostly pointless was that of Boojum. I mean, sure, it ended up being important that Mark got Malia's blood, but that whole thread feels like it could have been replaced by something simpler without much being lost. I liked Malia's story and I wish we could have seen more of her, but the Boojum crowd mostly seemed to be there to react to Dylan's antics.

And finally, another weak point was Aaron. I don't know if it was intentional, but mostly his role in the story is to be there while important things happen, being done by other people. He had a couple of moments of brilliance, like when he escaped from Unsong or when he used Aramaic against the Drug Lord, but mostly he was just there, moving from one place to another while somebody else did the stuff that actually mattered.

On the whole, I quite liked it and I thank Scott for writing it.

Yes, the newspapers can tell you that the health system is failing, that there aren't enough scrolls with the Coagulant Name for everybody who needs them. They can give you all sorts of statistics, they can show you pictures of the corpses. All nice and well. But somehow, people just don't seem to get the message. Something has been lost. The widow wailing because her husband bled to death after a car accident, she's got something that the guy sitting in an armchair reading the paper hasn't. The widow understands what a shortage of the Coagulant Name means, understands what it means when the guy in the suit says that we can't lower the price or else it would ‘hurt innovation'. The guy in his armchair has been told, but he hasn't understood. A failure of communication, you see? Everywhere people suffer, and the media tells people, but they don't get it.

** I just found this story recently, and while the ride was entertaining, I found myself very unsatisfied with God's answer to Job in chapter 71.

I have always found "sacrifices for the greater good" to not be acts of good, but rather acts of desperation. People sacrifice for the greater good because as puny mortals, people see or have no better options, and fear that if they do not, the world will fall into ruins and everyone will suffer.

To see the omniscient and omnipotent God of Unsong operating on the same logic is utterly terrifying, significantly more so because it could also be true in reality. And also incredibly disgusting, because Unsong's God explains that he gave Job tremendous suffering, not for reasons like saving the world, but for reasons like making a beautiful Leviathan.

I don't think the garden of worlds metaphor properly describes how horrible this is, so let's try another. Imagine the multiverse is a computer, and each world is a picture. A JPG, BMP, PNG, or whatever. The Unsong God states that the Leviathan is a thing of beauty, so say we have a file Leviathan.JPG, which is a picture of the leviathan with a plain white background, i.e., a world that contains only the leviathan and nothing else. He could make two such worlds, but that's like just copying Leviathan.JPG, so now he has two copies of one picture, not two pictures.

So the Unsong God decides, let's make a new picture, LeviathanAndJob.JPG, which still has the Leviathan in the foreground, but behind it is Job, covered in boils and all other manner of suffering. That's a different picture, so now the Unsong God has two beautiful Leviathans. In essence, the Unsong God created Job and all his suffering to be the foil. The contrast for his picture. And considering all the discussion about minor permutations, the Unsong God probably has a full folder of distinct LeviathanAndStuff.JPGs, each with a different hellscape behind the Leviathan, just so he can have a bunch of beautiful Leviathans on his multiverse computer.

There is a BIG, *BIG* difference between creating something and then destroying it, versus never creating that thing at all. It's like murdering all your fully grown adult children versus never losing your virginity in the first place. Let's try a different analogy to demonstrate how heinous this is. Imagine a world where the Comet King is unpopular. So when he asked for women to make Cometspawn, no one volunteered.

And so, Comet King decides that, for the greater good, he should just sexually assault a bunch of women. So he does, resulting in lots of traumatized women and beautiful Cometspawn. You know, the greater good (/sorta/). And at the end of it all, one of the few remaining women who still have their sanity/lives talks to him about why he inflicted such evils upon them, and the Comet King tells her: "Look at my beautiful spawn! Would you rather I kill them all and you as well? Just because you want to selfishly stop your own suffering?"

Because you know, that's totally the same as never assaulting her in the first place (/sarcasm/).

The Comet King at least has a debatable excuse: Cometspawn are vital for fighting hell. The Unsong God's excuse is "Leviathans are pretty".

As such, a God "creating" (computing, evaluating) it doesn't necessarily do anything at all - but it's also possible that there's a Tiplerian [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_Point][Omega point]] of complete self-observation at the end of the universe, which is necessary for that universe to be /"actually real"/. As such, God could offer Job to never have existed /and have that be a meaningful offer/ because the universe's reality depends on an ultimate point of observation rather than an ongoing act of creation.

However, even if he stops interfering from that point, that is a lot like starting a machine, seeing that it will brutally torture and kill countless people, and refusing to turn it off because it also produces a pretty leviathan.

With regard to Omega points, this is a bit of a gray area, but I still say it's evil. Here's a simpler thought experiment: suppose I have a time machine. I now go and brutally torture a random stranger, then use my time machine to travel back to before the torture session. Thus the torture session is not "actually real" (technically), since it never happened in this timeline and no one but me remembers it. Is this ethical? Would it be ethical if I wiped my own memories too?

If it is ethical, then God would also be ethical in creating millions of hellscapes lasting for millions of years, in which he commits all kinds of horrible evils for sadistic joy, while promising that he will turn back time at the end so whatever unspeakable thing he's doing now isn't "real" evil.

In other words, he decided that the universe that would grow from that seed would contain lots of evil, but also lots of good, and so refused to stop the seed from growing. Now, what does the Unsong God consider to be "good" things? He specifically describes the seed as quote:

#+begin_quote

And then goes on to describe a list of "wonders" that the seed has created, including:

In other words, the Unsong God considers leviathans to be things of beauty that glorify his holy name, and so willingly grows seeds of suffering if they also create an adequate amount of "wonders" like leviathans and behemoths.

This statement argues for what I've been saying better than anything I've said so far. The Leviathan is the world. It is the grandest thing, the thing that glorifies the Unsong God's name.

You sure as heck won't find Metatron by chasing the pope or the behemoth or the angel cloud fortresses or any other symbol of goodness. Only the Leviathan. You have literally just stated the best argument for why the Leviathan is the main wonder.

And even if you still don't consider it as the main wonder, surely you can admit that the leviathan contributes a significant amount to the NET goodness of the world according to the Unsong God? If so, the leviathan increases the amount of suffering that god is willing to have in exchange. Therefore, a significant fraction of extra evil in the Unsong world is allowed for the existence of the pretty leviathan.

(1) The Leviathan is great, but the world is better, so the leviathan is only a small part of the happiness.

(2) The Leviathan is great, but the world is infinitely better thanks to infinite love, so the leviathan is nothing.

If you mean (1), my objection still stands. The Unsong God is like a customer going to a theme park, he's willing to pay more to enter a theme park with its greatest attraction than an identical theme park without its greatest attraction. Except in this case, he's paying with evil and giving humans suffering. The fact that he's willing to allow more suffering because the leviathan exists is what I've been objecting to this whole time.

If you mean (2), then his answers to Job become plain weird. Why mention the Leviathan at all if it is overshadowed by infinite good? Why is there so much focus on the Leviathan even though its supposed to only contribute an infinitesimally small fraction of good to the world? While "infinite love" and "transcendent joy" just get mere mentions, The Unsong God expounds plenty on how utterly amazing the Leviathan is and chooses to emphasize it's destruction to Job when Job complains.

Don't you see it? Rather than threatening to erase heaven or whatever is giving out infinite love, the Unsong God instead threatens to erase the Leviathan if Job doesn't shut up and suffer quietly. Why would the Unsong God do that if the Leviathan is just an insignificant thing?

P.S. If the greatest attraction is great enough, I would totally go to a theme park just for that one attraction.

Now, What you said is that it either doesn't make sense or is just plain wrong for (U)God to let the world exist at all if there is evil in it, to the point that it upsets the Good-Evil balance. Is that correct? Now, my point is most aptly described by option (1), but the other holds some weight for me as well: The Leviathan is great. Fine. That's a well established point throughout the story. However, towards the end we are posed the statement: (U)God let's the world exist because eventually Good will upset Evil in the world by itself. Now, we know that the Leviathan exists in the world, and it is Great™, does that mean that the Leviathan is part of the Good that will upset the GEB? Abso-Fucking-Lutely. But it is /not enough/. If there were not enough other wonders in the world brought about by humans and nature to upset the evil that exists /by the very existence of space and time/ (remember that? that was a thing) then (U)God would have just destroyed the seed and tred again with some other universe. Further, I don't think we can clearly say what /is/ the most important thing in the (U)World, because so many had to happen exactly how they did to create, well, Albion(est Uriel's puns were gretaest part in that epilogue). In that perspective it does become a little jarring to see the Leviathan being put so much emphasis on, but I don't think it undermines the point I was trying to make that (U)God didn't let the world exist because of a "pretty Leviathan"(I feel a lot less enmity towards you right now, so using "pretty Leviathan" sounds pretty bad, actually), but because the park would eventually develop into one that not only has some great attractions, but is also very clean and organized and everyone loves.

***** It was completely foreshadowed. Ana only knew about Malia's blood in Mark's locket because she had Erica and Dylan in her head. There were a couple lines devoted specifically to the feeling she got thinking about them that implied they were dead.

It had already been established that thoughts could be passed unconsciously with Sohu and the Vital Name.

It was all but confirmed, finally, when Uriel tells Sohu about how he made SKABMOM, and what it did. He specified that it would work even after death, even. (Edit: and then we saw it in practice with Uriel and Sohu, of course.)

While this was somewhat of a step beyond what had been shown previously, I think it was perfectly clear. Many other readers in the comments (though I will admit that they are the sharpest of all of us) also came to these same conclusions.

How exactly does that solve the problem of evil specifically? Thamiel may have been faking evil, but I doubt the rest of the denizens of hell were. What happens to them? Just erased and put out of their misery? Freed from hell only to have to live with their traumas and horrible suspicions that this is just another "hope trap" by the torture experts of hell?

And what of that little boy who came up with countless methods of perverse and horrific torture methods to use on his mother, and actually used them? Even if he's freed from hell, doesn't he still have to live with the memory and guilt of it? How would he interact with other people now that they all fear and revile him for his evils?

My criticism here is that these issues were never addressed. Apart from Thamiel going "PUNK'D! I WAS GOOD THIS WHOLE TIME!", we got pretty much no information about what happened to the people in hell.

Hell was basically the main point of everything in the story: the moment hell was discovered, all the utilitarians dropped everything to save people in hell. Starving people in africa? Dying people in hospitals? Screw them, UNSONG it up to fight hell! Yet in the end we aren't told anything about what happened to the people in hell, other than the Comet King saying the explicit name, and even that wasn't explicitly stated, just Aaron's best guess of what would happen.

** So I think a fairly obvious takeaway is that Thamiel didn't actually enjoy being evil, he was just placed there to do it by God. His role as God's left hand is to be the root of all Evil; God creates Good which is perfection, and then places Thamiel in all these Universes so that he can act to create Evil. He doesn't enjoy doing it, but he has to.

“So many centuries,” it pled. “So much misery, so many tears, so many years of suffering. You couldn't imagine it, nobody could imagine it, but I did what God wanted, I did my duty, but you have to tell me, please, at the end of everything, did I do good?”

Anyone else think this parallels The Comet King really well?

** Picked this up a few days ago, but while it started pretty good and I really enjoyed the humor and interactions between the two mc's, I can't help but feel 24 chapters in that it has gotten really annoying (though the humor mostly remains).

What annoys me the most is the incessant perspective changes breaking the characters narratives at inopportune, cliffhanger-ish, moments.

Worse yet is that it is jumping wildly between not only /who/, but also /when/, without any clear indicators aside from a number at start of chapter for the year ...which I can't remember who is when anyway. The /who/ is what is needed, though it doesn't help that sometimes there are flashbacks which aren't too apparent until a bit into it (slightly related, author loves to skirt around who certain named characters are such as com+ik+et king, artificially forcing them to feel "mysterious" and slowly revealing through incessant flashbacks).

Some chapters even lack an indication of who it is until a name is dropped maybe halfway in, although this is not always the /mc's/ name (and sometimes this was the case for entirely new characters not introduced so far), and there was a chapter just recently which failed to make it apparent who were speaking until the very end (thamiel addressing the un).

Aside from the incessant perspective switches, there are far too many references that seem to require the reader to have deep knowledge of judaism and related theism, or even related /languages/, while lacking proper author notes for making sense of it. Worse is when those parts are clearly important to both plot and the humor (which is so good I managed to reach 24 chapters before giving up), in particular I remember a chapter which ended in some non-english phrase that from context I could only assume to be the entire punchline to the chapter culminating in a joke. After digging through comment-field it might possibly have been a whale-joke, although I am not entirely certain as even there it wasn't mentioned in any greater depth.

This lack of understanding of some references is only made /worse/ by the lack of author notes (and this time I include comment-field unlike last time I mentioned such notes). It is to the extent I saw a reader ask about author notes, whose comment received the answer (from author) that it would be /Bad Practice/ for the author to make the references more accessible for readers foreign to the languages used.

Admittedly, I do agree it might be so for /symbolic/ things such as characters names, but I can't for those references literally spelled out to the readers, provided they know hebrew or have knowledge in judaism beyond what was touched upon in social studies grades 1-9 (which honestly is not a lot). Yes, technically its all symbolism in this novel, but you can probably infer my meaning if I add that symbolism for names tie differently to the plot, than when a character actually /says/ something where its obvious all characters in the story understands and only reader is left out.

But I obviously can't obviously complain about the /bad/ parts, nor will I. As I mentioned before, the humor is great and reminds me a bit of terry pratchett (especially uriels all-caps). The amount of symbolism author manages to get into the story is astounding even when just considering the stuff I /do/ get, at least if I do some concessions for unknown phrases such as /kabbalist/ or /torah/ and other terms which one can decode from context with fairly high certainty.

I also must laud author for building up a vivid world with a few characters who hold interesting chemistry/interaction (particularly liked the whale-pun segments with 2 mc's), though the descriptions can get rather long-winded and tedious (like when san fran was compared to jerusalem).

And, the absolute *best* part, fittingly saved for last, are the two repeated catchphrases of how /The todium is all kinds of crazy/ (I def. botched the spelling on that one), and how /Nothing is ever a coincidence/.

EDIT: almost forgot, I felt like author were often trying to make jokes related to american geography. I did not get those at all unless context were obvious (like when talking about jerusalems garbage dump and comparing to what I am assuming is some suburb in america). This is one of the things I mentioned could /really/ have used some author-notes, particularly as context sometimes implied something was a /fictional area/ with symbolic or humoristic importance instead, but I just couldn't be sure.
