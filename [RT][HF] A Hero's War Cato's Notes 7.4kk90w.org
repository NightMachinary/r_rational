*** I'd like to blame the gnomes. You know, the ones that steal your socks, but only one of every pair? The ones that tangle your earbuds while in your pockets? The ones that steal something you're looking for, only to put it back as soon as you ask someone for help, making you look stupid?

Man, fuck gnomes.

*** hat if they're not getting stronger, per se, but regaining capability? The zombies may have been designed by the First or the enemies of the First, and have recently gained access to something they didn't have before. And now they're regaining power. Being stripped of limitations. A seal, broken. Pandora's Box, opened.

*** Do any of you guys have recommendations for stories like this? Where a person from earth goes into a fantasy world and uses science?
