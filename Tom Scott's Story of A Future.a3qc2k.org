** I'm not sure how much stock I put in the premise that a company will accidentally create a general purpose AI. That's always seemed pretty unlikely to me.

I can get behind the idea of everything else in the video, such as an AI created for a particular purpose interpreting its goal in a way that is non-beneficial to humans. But I don't think some group of programmers are just going to leave the servers running for a few days and be surprised when an AGI is born out of that.

*** I think the implication there was basically that the really important work was done by the authors of the paper. The programmers just implemented it blindly on a system with low initial energy barriers, and that was enough. If you hand out buttons that nuke the world when pressed, but only if you use an industrial hydraulic press or similar pressure, then the person to destroy the world is not going to be an authority on nukes, or buttons, or possibly even hydraulic presses. They'll just be the person with a motive to put a mystery button in a hydraulic press.

****** I think they mean that, if you're part of team that writes a paper that, if implemented, can cause the rise of an AGI, then you probably know that. You probably, in the course of doing the research and testing your code and all that jazz, have realized that these principals, if utilized under those circumstances, could result in a AGI. You've already done the work, so you should, theoretically, understand what it means.

It would be a bit like if the people who were working on the Manhattan project somehow didn't realise that their work could be used to make a nuclear bomb. Not a very likely turn of events.

Also I think they could be saying that the people who were writing the paper have already done the work, that it is far more likely that they would have accidentally created an AGI while they were testing their own principles, rather than releasing it and having somebody else beat them to it.

******* Not quite, but excellent and thank you: I'm saying one /more/ step: in course of the research that backs the paper... you probably made an AGI. Maybe not one that can bootstrap to god in a week because your grant didn't afford that much compute... But enough.

This has to do with (AFAIK) most computer science papers being backed by actual implementations. So it would be more like the Manhattan Project and the Tsar Bomba.

Or: I'm saying that the engineers working on the company's implementation would have made intermediate AGIs prior to one as mighty as Earworm, because it's not trivial to build a system that scales that simply to 1000x or more the compute, which is what is implied, and what would probably be required to go from "hey let's use machine learning to do copy right enforcement" to "oops godlike AGI".

Point to ANY technology that doesn't have a trail of incremental prototypes behind it.

Not to mention the underlying assumption that the cognitive architecture ALSO scales to arbitrary intelligence. And if you say "bootstrap" I will ask why you don't think current AI development counts. But, this is an issue with AI fiction in general.

******** They probably /did/ make an AGI. Or dozens. With carefully constrained processing power, carefully curated input, and a dozen engineers watching the thing the whole time. There would have likely been several dozen carefully safe AIs in their own little boxes, all around the world, when Earworm came online.

Earworm didn't have carefully curated data, limited hardware, constraints against exceeding human levels, or careful oversight. And now, no other AI ever will...

There probably were issues with the scaling. But by the time those issues cropped up, Earworm was able to find the necessary documentation and resolve those issues itself.

****** Basically, I can't imagine that the company devs would have stumbled upon AGI when the researchers wouldn't solely because they could throw more compute at it. That's not the hard part; the hard part is everything else. Building the system that can do AGI at all. Building it so that it can accept scaling to massive compute.

Tech doesn't leap, it only appears to leap. What happens is you get stuff from elsewhere solving some problem you've had for awhile, and now you can progress, but it's always still incremental.

*** I can absolutely believe on a company team just letting one of those running unattended.

I however do not believe at all they could be the ones to create such a piece of software, as they would then be a lot more aware and careful with it.

If it was presented as a 2 part event (company 'A' creates AGI and sell the code, company 'B' buys it, input some objectives and let it loose) then I would have no problems believing what he described.

That said, it's a hell of a scary thought, companies just selling/renting out AGIs.

It's an interesting thought-experiment here to replace "AGI" here with "Hansonian brain-emulation with arbitrary ability to horizontally scale its computation, given that there's a bunch of unused compute sitting around and no other machine-intelligences fighting over it." (Well, okay, maybe cryptocurrency-mining worms count as machine-intelligences fighting over compute, but they're probably easy to outcompete, in the same way that the first replicators were easy for cellular life to outcompete.)

One of many things: Making shit is hard. Breakthroughs don't look like "oh huh we suddenly have X", they look like "oh hey I bet X works" and then a fuck ton of work and verification and analysis.

*** The video implied that all of the proper hard work was done by the authors of the paper. All of the verification and analysis and all that jazz was done by the scientists who invented the principals the company team implemented.

It's a bit of a suspension of disbelief, I know, (how likely is it that a team of scientists are going to invent principles that, if implemented, could create an AGI, without realizing exactly that?) but I think we should give creators some wiggle room when they're writing a story.

**** In order to do all the verification and analysis and all that jazz... you would have made the AGI_.

They can ask for my suspension of disbelief, but I don't have to give it. It's also not a commentary on the rest of the artistic nature of it, but I do find that these kinds of simplifications detract from the overall message, not just because people like me pick up on it, and not just because working with the least suspension of disbelief required almost always makes for better fiction, but because your message itself is more powerful without idiot balls and deus ex machina.

Two good examples come to mind, in Europa Report and whatever that documentary/fiction Mars voyage hybrid was. In Europa Report, at the end of the EVA, why was he not tied onto the ship? How much more terrifying and poignant would it have been to have your friend strapped to your ship and slowly dying because they can't come inside? In the Mars thing, why would you have not have run the systems check BEFORE the point of no return on your thrust maneuver, and then had something go wrong anyway - you know, like (AFAIK) the /actual/ training simulations?

Take this piece. Mention that the scientists were stopped from powering their AGI with proper compute by their ethics board, but knew what would happen, and you're basically done. Now it's not just a case of lazy oversight on the part of the dev team, it's case of malevolent negligence. There's also a depth there with the slew of prototypes in the academic and corporate labs (not that would need to be featured in the story, but...)

When you have realism the rest of your world builds itself. When you don't, it doesn't. And usually the realism is not that hard to put in, it just takes considering what reasonable people would have done, instead of what you, the author, need to have happened.

Or, to put it another way, near-future speculative fiction that ISN'T rational suffers that much more heavily for it, /and/ requires that much less effort to /be/ rational.

***** I agree with basically all of that, but I think that turning it from a case of oversight, to a case of malevolent negligence, kind of takes away from the message. Of course there a tons of better ways that author could have explained how his premise happened, but I think that 'allowing' (storywise) the scientists to have really known that implementing their principles with the right substrate would result in an AGI, would actually make it less rational. Releasing a study like that, when the potential consequences are known, is just straight up insanity, and would have completely destroyed my suspension of disbelief.

I think the whole thing is, to a point, as realistic is it needs to be in order to keep everything short and sweet, and vaguely rational. If the scientists knew what could happen, then there's no real rational way Tom could have explained them just releasing the study to the public like they did. The scientists have to be ignorant, because otherwise, within the bounds of the story, they'd be very, very irrational. It would be an Idiot Ball so big I'd refuse to believe those scientists were smart enough to invent the principles in the first place.

I do agree that in the course of creating their paper, they should have already created an AGI (I even argued that point in one of my other comments on this post), but I'm willing to accept that as a caveat of the setting. Tom could have done more to explain how that specific corporate lab got it right, but from the way he just kind of purposefully glossed over it in the video, I'm thinking he wanted to save time on details to spend on the flavor of the story.

Essentially, while I agree with your points on world building, I don't think much of it applies to this story in particular. Any story can, of course, be more rational and realistic, but I think this story is just realistic enough that it serves it purpose, and conveys its message, without the irrationality getting in the way.

*** It's a "what-if" presented as a Youtube video from the future describing a company creating an AI with the directive "Remove content on our systems that matches these examples, with as little disruption as possible." with the examples being the European Union's masterlist of copyrighted works.

It's fairly short (6 minutes long) and, like most of Tom Scott's videos, fairly interesting.
