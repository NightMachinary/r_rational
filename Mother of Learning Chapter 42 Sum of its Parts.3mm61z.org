** I burst out laughing when Xvim said mental magic shaping exercises. Of fucking course. At any rate, I hope Zorian begins to learn how to do all his magic unstructured, it seems to be more versatile and mana efficient (although requiring years of practice).

I predict he's gonna leave Cyoria once he is able to idnetifiy the entire cult and plundered the Aranea nest (and perhaps investigated his classmates a bit more and become more socially adept). He'll probably start really exploring the continent now, maybe even finish up Silverlake's request.

Silverlake may even have that soul potion he needs for soul sight. I don't think Zorian will care too much about necromancy (except maybe to enhance his golem), but he'll probably get some good defensive spells to ward off a lich attack.

Furthermore, I still stand behind my prediction that he's gonna become a shifter, perhaps a wolf or something with muscles. I doubt he needs to ability to fly, as he can morph into other animals for that. But being a wolf shifter should give him a good boost to his physical abilities, something I think he sorely needs.

So, I can imagine extreme circumstances where this could be warranted (Xvim refuses to cooperate, Z playing each loop as if it was the last one, Xvim's knowledge likely relevant to the event)... But just doing it because Xvim is mysterios I detest.

  Kael seemed amused that Zorian cared more about his safety than his own, considering that Kael would be restored to normal once the loop restarted and Zorian might not be, but Zorian's moral sense had yet to adapt to the implications of the time loop and he was horribly bothered by the idea of leading Kael to his death in the tunnels and leaving his daughter all alone in the world... even if it was only for a week or so.

  but he had to admit he knew of no other way to deal with the third time traveler. The only other way involved destroying his soul, and that was arguably even more morally reprehensible. Plus he didn't actually know how to destroy someone's soul. And hopefully never would.

  And that was without even considering the moral dimension of the whole thing. Picking on innocent people for the sake of personal training was not the road he wanted to go on, and dismissing their plight as irrelevant due to the time loop striked him as an unhealthy attitude to have. He might have justified the whole thing to himself if it was just a matter of tapping into their senses, since that was mostly harmless, but the Luminous Advocates made it clear this wasn't the only skill he would have to practice on his fellow humans to get right.
#+end_quote

He doesn't want to have a morality license. He's worried about going down bad roads and becoming an immoral person.

  In other words, he needed to develop his mind magic, ethics be damned. He didn't think he could do this on his own, so he would have to seek out other aranea webs for this.

He is however willing to do a great deal of immoral things for the right cause.

Capturing Xvim and interrogating him, while interesting, isn't an action of key importance. Xvim's knowledge doesn't seem to be anything that unique, just exceptionally well practised and skilled. Besides which, eventually Xvim will surely have to admit Zorian's skill eventually, Zorian can just keep improving his shaping skills forever.

Xvim is also a dangerous target to attack due to his skill. It could go very wrong. As he has no reason yet to suspect Xvim as Xvim hasn't yet done anything too radical why would he? We as readers can suspect him, but as far as Zorian knows he's just a very skilled and powerful mage that seriously annoys him. There are no shortage of strong mages around. If Xvim was some sort of super thing, if he'd mastered empathy as well as Zorian with pure shaping skills it's not like Zorian could contradict him. Xvim surely knows more about how shaping works than he does.

I don't really see why Zorian can't just come clean with Xvim in one loop, ask him for some kind of self-signal that he could give him in the next loop to prove it, and then gain his cooperation and presumably answers to any specific questions he might have. Having maintained consensual partnership will mean he doesn't have to hide his knowledge post-time loop, doesn't get desentivised by his actions within the time loop to a degree that it would impact his post-timeloop life, etc.

Ideally, he'll be able to stop the elder demon and preserve his morality, by his reasoning. Morality isn't a mathematical sum, if he hurts or injures people and saves the world the hurt and injured people don't go away.

It is to me. Try expanding it outwards to multiple cases: a general policy of mind reading powerful wizards vs a general policy of not doing that. One strategy clearly has a much higher chance of learning the things necessary to stop said primordial. Obviously you don't want to attack wizards that are /too/ powerful in case they hit you back in a way that actually does lasting harm.

Would your more absolutist morality be mollified if he did the mind reading, then used mind magic on himself to delete any personal or private information gained thereof? That way the people who were hurt or injured people very much /do/ go away.

Seems risky. They might mind read him back. Powerful wizards are dangerous. I'd say that has a lower chance of success. Mages also may keep their best secrets and powers secret to use in super dangerous situations so it's hard to judge how dangerous they are. He also doesn't know for sure who is a cultist or not. If he attacks the wrong person he or she may alert red robes, who could then permamently kill his family.

Besides which, any harm he's done is still done. My point was more that any harm you have done remains harm, even if it's on net a greater good. 5 -ve morality and 100 +ve morality is still 5 -ve morality and 100 +ve morality.

So far as I can tell you consider things to still have normal moral weight even if they end up having never happened to the people the crimes were supposedly perpetrated against, the perpetrator has no memory of any personal information, and in general there is nothing to suggest that it ever happened at all. And you put the majority of the weight on these things that never properly happened? You'll have to forgive me, but that seems quite silly.

************** I think I'll take a shot at this morality discussion.

1) I agree that positive actions don't cancel negative actions and make negative actions positive. 2) I agree that causing other people harm, even temporary, even in a time loop, is still causing harm. That's a bad thing.

HOWEVER.

1) I consider lasting harm more damaging than temporary harm. The shorter it lasts, the less important it is. So, while committing atrocities in the loop is still bad, it is nowhere near as bad as committing atrocities outside the loop.

2) I thing weighting harm is too narrow a perspective. It misses a lot of important details. To avoid missing important details I propose to use state of the world to evaluate actions.

A simple thought experiment. There is some problem approaching (plague, war, doesn't matter). You can prevent the catastrophe by causing harm and doing atrocious things to some people. If you don't prevent the catastrophe, it will cause much greater harm to much larger population.

- If you commit the atrocities, you will steer the world towards the future where you killed a bunch of people, but catastrophe was averted.

- If you refuse to take action, your inaction will steer the future into state where catastrophe strikes and millions die.

I personally would choose to overt the catastrophe. It is obvious for me which choice minimizes suffering. HOWEVER. The utility calculation should not be flattened. It is an important fact that catastrophe-aversion plan includes atrocities. If while searching for the solution I would find an option that averts the catastrophe without the need for atrocities, this option would be superior to both previously discussed ones. This third future would be best.

But if I searched and still see only to options, then too bad. Catastrophe must be averted, and some will suffer for the greater good.

All that said, Zorian is not a consistent consequentialist as outlined above. This irks me a little.

This is the standard way dictators get into power. They claim it's a crisis, invoke emergency powers, and then do whatever they want. Those powers start to become normalized and are used to solve socioeconomic problems often, which leads to a lot of atrocities.

So there's a third option. You take a measured and intelligent approach to minimize the harm. You gather likeminded people, build up your powers with a mixture of ethical and slightly unethical activities, and you only do especially immoral things if you have a very strong reason to do them.

Lots of people have managed to deal with wars and plagues without being evil. They're not some special problem that you should routinely handle with atrocities. You need a really absurd and contrived scenario for routine evil to be the only option.

I agree that people deal with wars and plagues all the time. But do they deal with them optimally? Or is there an "evil" way that lead to the world with significantly more survivors?

I do not advocate for adopting "evil" methods of problem solving here. I am advocating for doing cost-benefit calculations, searching for the best option, and choosing options based on the sum of their consequences.

- To the best of your ability, generate a list of available options.
- To the best of your ability, predict the outcome of implementing options.
- Apply sanity checks (you'd better have good, experimentally proven sanity checks, else this step will ruin your decision making)
- Choose the option that leads to the best consequences.
- Implement the option so chosen.

If the options with the best predicted outcome requires you to, say, nuke a city, you do it.

While initiating the launch sequence you keep seeking for the better option, the one that gets the benefits with less costs.

But if you don't find the better option and time to make a desision is now - you implement the best option available, regardless of how atrocious it is.

As you noted, there are threats that are in the future, and because of those drastic action is necessary.

He doesn't actually know the plans of the invaders or the primordial so he can't plan to stop them very easily, although he is slaughtering his way through them. For Red Robe he's practicing making a superior gun and improving his mind magic, the two things that hurt him before.

The algorithm isn't biased towards extremes, and as I noted is ok on its own. The lack of any data means the algorithm is likely to be filled with your biases, in this case, drastic action.

His current threats are nebulous and uncertain, and not immediate threats to him. There's no clear drastic solution to them, so it's much to early to start seeing this as a crisis requiring drastic measures.

I earlier noted the sort of situation where drastic action is needed- what you noted, where a nuke may be necessary. If inaction means lots of people die, and you have a weapon that can end the conflict it's rational to use it.

Inaction for him means more time to grind.

Zorian needs to focus on getting stronger, and increasing speed of getting stronger. While your concerns about stealth still have weight in this case, squeamishness and moral high ground don't.

Second, loop is an unique opportunity to do things that are high-risk high-cost high-reward with greatly reduced or nullified risk and cost. Plague vaccines research, volatile spell and alchemy experiments, everything that is too risky or expensive (or horrible).

I consider, say, infecting all the humanity within the loop with 100% deadly plague ten times an acceptable price for producing a cure that will eliminate the plague forever.

The plague cure research is just one example. A person ready to pay the price could use the loops to greatly improve human condition. Cures, improvements, transplants, miscellaneous transhumanism... The list goes on.

What's needed is 1) neutralize other loopers and 2) be able to see the possibilities.

I actually have great hopes for later arcs of the story. I like to read about world optimization.

  First, I think Zorian may be outlevelled by Red Robe, and Red Robe may be levelling faster than him.
#+end_quote

He is indeed outlevelled by Red Robe, so what he needs to do is to improve skills that allow him to lessen those advantages- he needs deep scanning to find memories so he can ambush Red Robe without defences, he needs better mental attacks to hurt him more, he needs better guns to surprise him with, he needs illusions and such to avoid his attacks as he did with invisibility, he needs alchemy potions to give himself more of a kick despite his low mana reserves.

And of course, he is doing all of those.

Being outlevelled? Unlikely. Red Robe already has gate, the top level transportation spell. He probably has most of the best magic. He can't steal much more. Zorian, by virtue of starting at a much lower level, is much more able to steal his way to increased power. Red Robe has also likely reached the plateau in his mana reserves as well.

Of course, he'll no doubt have a few extra powerful tricks.

Zorian also has access to the Cyoria library, a resource Red Robe lacks, and all the mages of the Cyoria academy, a big advantage- Red Robe's resources are likely more spread out and harder to acquire.

So it's not clear yet that it's a pressing concern. It's somewhere off in the future. Dire, yes.

Possibly, although liches have been experimenting on these things for a while. Undead are the common way to do transhumanism.

He could certainly steal a lot of useful magic and spread it to the masses.

Alchemy seems like the obvious route to general improvement of society, alchemy and mana crystals powering industry. He could work to get potions of youth out to the masses, stuff like that.

The message from the Aranea implied that the loop was degrading. Those sound like rather slow routes to power, rather than stealing magic, and are a bit risky.

This is a very romanticised view of morality. The actual process that shapes morals is [[http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html][more akin to emergence of fashion]] than to organized effort to set up reasonable rules that you describe. Morality, therefore, can and does contain arbitrary bits and inconsistencies.

Also, some Jehovah's witnesses do in fact think that refusing blood transfusions is more important than avoiding lots of deaths. I think these example are comparable. And, most morality systems endorse harm, provided i's done to outsiders. Slavery, wars, conquests and genocides were all performed by people whose morals allowed, endorsed or even demanded all that.

That's why I think morality shouldn't be blindly trusted. Instead it should be examined and maybe corrected, if flaws are found.

Also, I think people would be much better off if they learned to, as [[/u/EliezerYudkowsky]] once put it, [[http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Shut_up_and_multiply][shut up and multiply]], i.e. apply their morals consistently.

#+begin_quote

Mass murder is a bad thing and carries large utility penalty.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I wouldn't call it "no evidence". There is plenty of evidence regarding existence of primordials. Dungeon, monsters that get stronger with depth, creation myth heard from real, existing gods that used to communicate with their followers, etc.

Sure, primordial could be harmless or benevolent, but considering historical records it doesn't seem likely. You could probably make a case that all this evidence is not solid enough to justify the extreme plans I mentioned. But claiming there is /no/ evidence is flat out wrong.

In this discussion I propose a patch to decision-making algorithm, because I consider current algorithm, with its ethical injunctions, suboptimal and inconsistent. To show the difference between proposed algorithm and current one I provide remarkable edge cases where behaviour of algorithms differs. Of course "it doesn't sound like I'm using my algorithm in any rigorous manner". I don't use algorithm to generate examples, I just provide illustrative examples for edge cases.

Once more: mass murder is not the desired outcome. The desired outcome is the world that fits my values more. If the way to reach this world is mass murder, then this is the path that should be taken. If there is way to this world not involving mass murder, this path should be taken instead.

Minimizing harm is part of the goal. It's just that, for example, eradicating plague by in-loop experimenting is likely to cause much less harm than prevent. If we are in loop: Killing million people temporary (in loop) is preferable to letting million or more die permanently. If there is dimension-hopping going on: Killing million in one dimension is better than letting million or more die from plague later in *every* dimension.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yes, but I wasn't talking about infecting everyone. Global pandemic is detrimental to search for cure. Scenario I meant was "Searching for plague cure, even if there will be 10 containment breaches that cause global pandemics and humanity extinction in the loop, may still be worth it, because number of lives saved by the cure is very large ". Sorry if it wasn't clear from my post.

And, there is no evidence of existence of soul-afflicting plague. Now you are venturing into "no evidence" realm.

I agree with other points you made. Thanks for the reminder about anti-fever potion, I completely forgot.

People who absorb random cultural floatsam do, yes, pick up silly moralities. People who set moral barriers though tend to do so due to experience or reading on the matter.

Humans have a tendency to remain fixated on an initial choice, even when better options come along and mass murder is a crime of immense suffering and cruelty that should be avoided. As such, mass murder should not be plan a and before making plans to do it multiple alternate plans should be made.

Prevention is better than cure with disease. Any cure would have to be propagated across society which is tricky. As such, if Zorian has the time to deal with the plague, he should be invading government stores of information and high ranking official's minds to see what they know. Ideally he'd find the cause and be able to shut that down- a precursor artifact, monster race, secret agents from the liches, whatever. If not, he can gather information about the plague and try to work out how it infects people. It's obviously some weird magical thing so it has some unusual mechanism, see if with enough information you can figure that out. If it appears unlikely to spread he could research a source of it, with the backing of several powerful mages who could nuke the area if anything went wrong. Carefully examine it, and relocate a sample to a remote island, minimizing physical contact using teleportation and mind controlled non time traveling agents. Test it on suitable test subjects, perhaps captured cultists. If anything goes wrong abort hard and do more research.

If there's any reasonable risk of global genocide don't do it. If you kill 10 world's worth of people to save 1 world's worth then that's bad helping.

We know there was something unusual about the plague and that it was resistant to priestly healing magic.

Unless those edge cases are true in story then his decision making algorithm isn't especially imperfect. It's not clear that infecting people with the plague would be a good idea.

It is certainly a concern. Once he has mastered mindrape to the point that it is not mentally destructive it will be less of one, but even then this being a parallel universe thing has some rather far reaching implications.

  The more obvious answer, and one zorian prefers, is to steal their spellbooks or a pass for the parts of the library that have secrets in them. Much less risk of retaliation there and its all in an easy to read format.

Ah, I was operating under the unspoken assumption that these were non-sharing type mages where the most powerful spells were jealously guarded and passed down only in family lines, word of mouth and coded spellbooks ect ect. Under those circumstances minds would hold the most useful knowledge. Depends on if this is a scientific type culture or an alchemist type culture at the highest levels of power. The lower levels are clearly scientific, but as you climb the totem pole I suspect that incentives shift.

There's limits to that, with more complex secrets. As Zorian noted, holding a spell formula in your head is tricky even with their memorization techniques. People will certainly have security measures, but those can be evaded.

Coded spell books are slow to read as well.

Also, a lot of secrets aren't important to people. Teleport, common spell, almost certainly in libraries. Still pretty useful for Zorian.

Nepene is saying here that despite teleport being a "secret" from students, it's still widely available in books, and useful. Just because he's reading someone's mind and finding out their "secrets" doesn't necessarily mean it's useful. And that there's sometimes more useful information already lying around in books which are easier and safer for Zorian to access. Also, I can't remember if teleportation is a secret from students or just assumed to be "too difficult for a student to learn." I think it might just be the latter, looking over chapter 23.

I suggest you re-read the segment where Zorian kills himself again. He explicitly notes that it isn't enough killing yourself when facing a soul mage, you have to get rid of your body too, make it unreachable. Dying is a serious issue for someone who associates with necromancers and is in a time loop. Death is not the end.

*** Yeah. And he's definitely not one of the villains. I think it took me way too long to be certain of that. He's clearly very significant though. I wonder HOW he managed to find out about the time loop.

Wait, I wonder...does the time loop really encompass everyone in the area? What if it's just Zach's, Zorian's and Redrobe's souls going back in time, and no one else's?

And then they interfere with the timeline, so that every time there's a reset the next loop ends up a little different. Also, we haven't heard anything about zach for months and months. Has he been captured? Is he dead? Is he being mind controlled? Is he redrobe? I vaguely remember that last one being disproven, but don't remember how.

And considering that so many people have said that time magic is impossible, I wonder if maybe they're not really time travelling. In the Yugioh Millenium world manga, it at first seems like yugi and his friends have travelled back in time to ancient egypt, when in fact they're all still in the Domino City museum, and they're inside a tabletop mmorpg that simulates ancient egypt, and and since it's a magical shadow game, the events in that game are somehow able to influence the past, overwriting it with the events of the game.

Maybe the Arranea's real bodies were killed, removing them from the simulation.

So, to recap, all of the expert magical researchers think that time travel is absolutely impossible. And only Zorian, Zach and maybe Redrobe or perhaps someone else retain their memories through each reset/loop. Zorian only became part of the time loop because of some sort of accidental soul connection with Zach.

Hmm, this still seems clunky. I suppose maybe everyone could be in the magical dream/simulation, and only a few people retain their memories, although then that leaves the question of why does anyone retain their memories, and why those people specifically?

Any other ways to fake time travel for 2 or 3 people that you guys can come up with?

** Some observations from someone who just finished reading up to this point mostly in one go (over two days, a week ago). I have advantages and disadvantages in analyzing where this is going. I've just read it so it's fresher in my mind, but I've also not had nearly enough time to think about it and I'm sure some of you have read most of the early chapters multiple times. No mater, here's some of my thoughts:

- Damien probably maters, but not necessarily. Especially given it seems doubtful he's in the loop.

- Most likely originator for the loop seems like it would be some sort of ancient machinery. A loot of noise was made out of some kind of magical doors which seems like they might be a possible trigger. In a related note a portal from the same people who apparently made or used these doors exists under the city. Zorain has been given a map of something under the city. This is probably not coincidence. Also why in the world do you have the exit node for your teleportation system deep under ground in a dangerous area.

- Why did all the spiders dye?

  - Probably they didn't. If I was faced by this I certainly would not put all my eggs in one basket. Why not spread out a bit. Red Robes is no good at mind magic and divination can be perfectly defeated so there's almost no chance he actually tracked down and killed all of them. Why she did not tell Zorain this (unless this is what the message was supposed to be about, but I doubt that) I'm not sure, probably she was worried that he'd draw any potential fire back to them.

- Xvim What's his game?

  - Zorain is a pretty competent mage at this point certainly for his supposed age and yet Xvim is always discouraging almost to a cartoonist extent.
  - Xvim may just be a bad teacher, but he's shown himself to be talented and probably on the whole write about the things he is trying to teach.
  - At the same time it's clear that he's an abject failure at his goals. He doesn't explain how to make progress on any of his exercises and it seems that he would be happy to use the entire year on silliness. Is this some sort of trick or is he in some way probing for a reaction.

- Why rebellion.

  - Don't get me wrong but the motivation hasn't really ever been explained. Is it just a power thing? Is the island becoming overcrowded? Why not sooner. What's changed?

- How many loopers are there?

  - At least two
  - Signs seem to point to 3 at one time
  - Red Robes wasn't physical
  - Why? He had no reason to think he was going to be attacked.
  - It can't be easy projecting yourself like that. It seems like it would require some complicated bit of soul magic.
  - Zorain is tagging along because the targeting mechanism for the spell got messed up but why is Red Robes?
  - Two possibilities. He has his own valid soul identifier, but he seemed unreasonably reluctant to hurt Zach also the loop always restarts for Zorain when Zach dies.
  - Could Redrobes be hitching onto Zach in a similar (probably soul magic based) way as the spiders were with Zorain. AKA he isn't actually looping physically, but his soul is being pulled along.

- Why/how did Zach start the loop.

  - He's rich, but doesn't actually seem powerful. He has guardians that control him. If anything their interests run counter to him, they have no reason to turn him into a super mage.
  - Resolutions:

    - He didn't: He too got sucked into somebody else's loop.
    - It was an accident. He was going where he shouldn't have gone and he got sucked in
    - Possibly the soul marker is inherited? Last of his line so he's the only one left with the marker.

      - might also explain Red Robes Did any of his family turn them selves into some kind of an immortal with soul magic? Not why red robe's afraid though

- gods:

  - I have to think gods and their disappearance are relevant somehow. How much power would this who looping exercise take? On the order of the total entropy that was expounded planet wide during that semester. How does it keep it up for literary 100 years. Where is a 100 years of the planets output of magic coming from? The gods maybe in some strange way? Channeled and controlled by some machine?

- What is Red Robes doing?

  - Red Robes is apparently no longer helping the evaders.
  - Reasons:
  - Red Robes is no more. Something has done him in.
  - Direct confrontation with Zach has finally made him realize there is another looper and he is trying to deal with the problem in some way.
  - Red Robes is devising a counter to the Zorain development/ possibly the spiders.

What I would do if I was Zorain

- Put as much of what I've put above to the test as possible.
- Track down Zach. You're a competent mind mage, he probably isn't at least talk to him and confirm the marker you've been tracking isn't red robes. Do it through a proxy if necessary to assure red robes doesn't gain this knowledge
- Travel. Confirm the loop extends across the planet. This is potentially dangerous as behavior when exiting the looping zone would probably be bad, but probably OK.
- Figure out more about the motivations of the rebellion.
- Start keeping an eye out for being out of the loop. Ask the priests during the start of each loop if they are in contact with angels. If so you can be pretty sure your out of the loop.
- Try to figure out if anyone in the invaders forces are disappearing every time at the start of the loop. Red Robes can't control where he is at the start so that's how you catch him
- Consider knocking Zach out of the loop if possible even if it means killing him.

  - Red Robes probably has not had enough time to come up with a perfect battle plan against the spider less city.\\
  - The more time you give him looping the more time he has to do so, at least as soon as he starts helping again.
  - With some practice you probably can beat invasion - super human knowledge.

For those who can't, however, he has provided no value at all, so it's still definitely an inferior outcome unless you think (as I'd assume Xvim does) that anything less than a "completely optimal" mage is worse than no magic at all.

******** Either that, or he just doesn't give more than a shit-and-a-half about teaching, and the shaping exercises are his own mildly pathetic way of proving his own superiority by thrusting impossible tasks at students and sneering when they fail. Like a slightly more subtle Snape. He's kept around because he's a shaping master and a senior faculty member - and you don't fire senior faculty.

******** Even then, if you want to teach someone problem solving, you don't do what he does. First you explain how problem solving works, then you give them problems to do, and then if they can't solve them you give guidance.

I think he learned by this method, so he teaches by it regardless. It 'worked' for him and he presumably ended up feeling superior to most other mages so therefore it must be a good method as far as he's concerned. When kids fail out they're just showing that mages today are too soft and not that his teaching methods are sub-optimal, which reinforces his bias.

***** I think the method he's using lately is kind of cheating- he's supposed to be using his ability to sense the mana in the marbles. He was kind of good at it, in terms of being able to dodge marbles thrown directly at him.

Using the "mana cloud" method to sense the physical object moving through the air (rather than the mana within the object) is not the same thing at all and doesn't help train his mana sense.

Xvim had caught on to this in the restart where he started doing it, by trying to get him to list the marbles by how much mana was in them.

** I would hardly call half an hour to eat a meal "wolfing" it down, especially considering they apparently sat in complete silence for over that length, the reason meals take so long to eat is because you talk during them... Also big dialogue paragraphs with single line interruptions always breaks me out of being immersed. It reads so awkwardly and lacks the constant feedback that a normal conversation would hold (nodding along, saying uh huh, etc). I don't know how you'd text something like that though.

** Just putting this theory here in the unprobable case it turns true so that I can boast in future. I think Zach is a shifter, and was the first supposed sacrifice for the primordial. The time loop spell was created by the primordial itself, possibly to avoid the sacrifice in the first place. The primordial just wanted to take a small multimillenial nap and now it has to wake up and bring destruction to the mortal plane. It's annoyed as hell.
