*** I think it's also relevant that FAI are likely to want to grab resources as quickly as possible in a way that would look nearly the same as a UFAI (after all very few utility functions are going to care about not exploiting dead systems when that energy/matter can be used on other things) to an outside observer. And hell when you consider von-neumann probes then exponential expansion seems inevitable even without AI.

So I guess my point is that the Fermi paradox is a problem pretty much regardless of what you believe (provided you don't believe in something crazy like the supernatural).\\
Still I think as Isaac Arthur's great filter videos demonstrate, without any massive questionable singular great filters. You can still whittle down the probability of civilizations arising enough to make it plausible we are the only civs in our past light cone just using a great many smaller filters.

Another interesting (if terrifying) idea, is that GAI's that end up becoming the only conscious mind in existence (whether through killing off their creators or having their creators eventually merge with them) are the norm. So were that the case, a GAI could have only one if not a handful of separate "observers" as it were so most minds that ever existed would actually be among the precursor biological civilization and thus we shouldn't be surprised to be in the majority of minds to ever exist.\\
Actually I'm rather disturbed at how plausible that seems, especially given it would also set a great filter ahead of us, which is the worst possible case scenario..

You should be careful not to conflate "a consistent naturalistic worldview must allow superintelligence" with "worldviews that don't include superintelligence as a possibility must be supernaturally based". /You're forgetting that most people do not have internally consistent worldviews/.\\
Of course for these purposes it doesn't even matter if superintelligence is impossible, since people might just believe that for some reason it isn't likely to dominate civs even over cosmic timescales. Obviously that belief wouldn't make any sense but if you go around expecting that everyone believes things that make sense, then oh boy are you going to find the world a very confusing place.

As for the anthropic argument for extremely difficult goal alignment:\\
Basically it's an extension of anthropic ideas that you ought to expect yourself to be an observer who isn't a bizzare outlier. Thus if nearly every civ quickly leads to a very small number of minds dominating their future light cones until heat death, then it would be extraordinarily if you ended up by chance /not/ to be a T0 primitive biological civ before they created UFAI. The reasoning is similar to why a multiverse makes finding ourselves in a universe conducive to life utterly unremarkable.\\
Of course because anthropic reasoning is always an untamable nightmare beast none of this solves the issue with boltzmann brains. As always anthropic reasoning is one of those things that is clearly right in some circumstances but invariably leads to conclusions that don't make any sense or continually defy observations and it's not clear getting to those insane conclusions can be avoided since the logic doesn't have any clear ways to dispute it.

The queer thing is that almost everyone working on FAI thinks differently, which is why notions like acausal trade or the malignity of the university prior are taken perfectly seriously.

As for acausal type reasoning i'm not sure it really counts as not affecting the universe in any way since in most scenarios that involve it, it does affect the universe at some point.

/I'm/ not forgetting anything. I'm also not conflating "supernatural" with "paranormal". Perhaps I'm realigning definitions in a manner most people don't, but from my perspective superintelligence means "intelligence beyond the natural bounds of mankind". It may very well be that superintelligence is possible according to our present understanding of physics and science. This makes it no less supernatural.

Still I think it's amusing that you say you don't mean paranormal, since you could use a definition of "paranormal" similar to how you defined supernatural that would still be equally linguistically correct (in terms of the meaning of the prefixes) and mean the exact same thing as how you're using supernatural. After all "para" can just mean abnormal.\\
However, in both cases it would seem clear that using the words that way, even if correct by some linguistic definitions is clearly wrong on the standard of how words are actually used (which is the only way any language derives meaning anyway) as well as nearly gaurenteed to confuse almost everyone you talk to unless you constantly spend time clarifying that "supernatural"=/=/supernatural/

Oh no I was referring to boltzmann brains, basically if time continues forward forever, then eventually vastly more conscious brains created by pure random quantum events will have existed for some period of time than minds from before the heat death of the universe ever did.\\
Thus if there will only be a set number of minds like your own before the heat death, but an arbitrarily large amount of boltzmann brain versions after heat death then the odds are ~100% that you are a brain just created out of nothing in an empty universe deluded by a whole set of false memories of events before the heat death. Meaning that you ought to predict with great confidence that you will almost immediately stop experiencing the hallucination of your current existence and begin dying due to lack of sustenance in the next few moments.\\
So if you accept the fairly solid seeming premises then it seems as though one must conclude that you were only created at this very moment and will in a mere instant from now cease to exist or begin dying.

Also by your definition whether something is supernatural is not an innate quality of an object but a feature of our knowledge about it which is pretty obviously divergent from what people generally consider the term to mean.

Most importantly though it means superintelligence isn't actually supernatural by your definition if it exists anywhere in the universe or in another universe, since that would imply there is somewhere where it /is/ well within scientific understanding.

While it sounds sort of weird if you haven't heard that implication of thermodynamics and quantum physics it's not exactly controversial, in fact it would be basically impossible to deny it as not being trivially true.\\
First off it's worth talking about the fact thermodynamics is statistical, meaning there's a non-zero chance of getting free energy from nowhere even if you never expect to see those sorts of chance occurrences to any significant degree over non-absurd timescales. Quantum phenomenon are similarly probabilistic such that when taking into account virtual particles in the quantum foam there is a non-zero chance of any configuration of matter coming into existence from nothing (which shouldn't be surprising since thermodynamics already allows for that, given the right random configuration of matter could allow that with classical physics).

Suppose that an entity does spontaneously [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h02a2HSB58M][pop into existence]], complete with knowledge of quantum physics, thermodynamics, cosmology, anthropy, etc. Is it more or less likely to come into existence with beliefs that are correct concerning the universe it is now a part of, or incorrect?

That is to say, if you were to postulate that you just now began to exist, you would also have to postulate that your beliefs about how the universe works are almost certainly wrong. So, as long as we further postulate that our beliefs are correct, we must also suppose that they are incomplete in some manner that makes the Boltzmann postulate unlikely.

The point of maxwell's demon is that you can extract free energy using a method like that if you disregard the energy that needs to be spent to gain the information that the demon possesses.\\
However the demon just selectively opens a gate to let in particles of a particular temperature, you could also just have that gate operate randomly or was always open. In those cases there would be a non-zero chance that by sheer coincidence only the particles of a given temperature would go through the hole/open gate and you would end up with a temperature differential that could run a heat engine.\\
Similarly a great deal of a particles properties can be probabilistic such that there's a non zero-chance that through its component ingredients quantum tunneling a brain appears on your desk at any given moment.

As for the last part of you comment, well that is one of the classic responses to the boltzmann brain paradox. However, you should note that it still doesn't actually argue against boltzmann brains post-heat death identical to oneself being more common than iterations of oneself before heat death. Saying that the consequences of it being true would make reasoning itself likely impossible doesn't actually solve the problem. After all nobody really seems to propose the boltzmann brain paradox as being true, just that we don't currently have a good basis on which to say why it's wrong.

While the odds of this may be non-zero at any given time, your mistake here is thinking that the sum of the probabilities over all of space and time is infinite. This is not true.

If the energy density of the universe (post heat-death) were constant, you might expect to find an arbitrarily large concentration of energy at some point if you waited long enough. But the universe is also expanding, meaning that the energy density is continually decreasing. The lower the energy density, the lower the chances of there being a given level of energy concentration. If the rate of expansion were constant, the density would follow an inverse square law over time. Cosmology suggests the rate of expansion is in fact increasing, and will continue doing so forever, making the situation even worse. Integrating the probability over space and time will yield a finite number, so the chances of energy ever randomly concentrating to the level needed for a boltzmann brain is negligible.

Furthermore, the probability of this happening eventually drops from vanishingly small to zero. The amount of energy in the observable universe is finite. Furthermore, it is decreasing (due to expansion) and will continue to decrease forever. Given time, the amount of energy in the observable universe (from a given point) will fall below any given threshold. Once that happens, there will be no probability whatsoever of the necessary energy randomly coalescing.

*************** When it comes to normal matter randomly arranging in various ways that's not really necessary here. Because it occurs to me that you could get a ming or other process at random for a moment just from entropy reversals without requiring increases in total energy.\\
After all you've probably seen [[https://xkcd.com/505/][this xkcd comic before]] the only necessary thing here is that something /anything/ happen in an orderly way. So just random oscillations in quantum foam (as in what's talked about in that fermilab video) will /eventually/ occur in a way that is ordered in the right way as to be a mind for a single instant.

That's sort of the thing about boltzmann brains, so long as time continues and things are occurring you ought to get them inevitably and things on the quantum level even in a vacuum aren't what it seems like you could call nothing happening. Though I suppose this is likely going to vary somewhat on the model of quantum mechanics and in what sense the wavefunction is actually "real" (though if it acts in a consistent way I'm not even sure it needs to be real in any other sense for boltzmann brains to be an issue).

Also you never said any reason why the totally random maxwell's demon scenario presented wouldn't work, so if you can set up arrangements of matter which have a nonzero chance of generating free energy. Then it seems far more likely that there's /some/ random quantum events which can do the same in lieu of any matter given infinite time to work with.

It doesn't work because you can't attach an engine to extract the energy. If the engine were already there, it would prevent the buildup from happening in the first place. If it wasn't, there's no way to know when to attach it without using energy in the observation process.

Just stick any number of heat engines in it they aren't the issue here. Again the whole point of this scenario is that you can get around having to spend energy on observation through extreme coincidence. After all the observation the demon's doing is only really serving as a probability pump in this scenario, thus my point about how sheer chance could accomplish the same thing at a nonzero chance. If the heat engine is in the middle with gates around it then there's a nonzero chance the gas sorts itself into hot and cold sides and continually powers the engine in doing so.

It's not /just/ a description, it corresponds to real behavior plus it kind of is subject to the passage of time, after all what would it even mean to call them quantum fluctuations without time?\\
As for computation requiring energy that doesn't really work here since. Computing in theory doesn't need to cost energy if it's reversible and whether this really counts as "computing" is highly questionable. After all while you need energy to do computation normally this seems pretty heavily an entropic process which is statistical. If you have a probability pump of unlimited power (which is sort of what this is) then you can use the monkies on a typewriter method to get whatever information you want without anything resembling computation happening.\\
That's my point that random fluctuations in /anything/ could replicate the actions of computational process even if no real computation is taking place (but it would /look/ the same which is what matters for this). It's like a version of the xkcd comic where the rocks bounce around randomly, given enough time any pattern that occurred in the original deliberate system would be replicated purely by chance.

Interesting. I'm familiar with the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann-Landauer_limit][von Neumann-Landauer limit]]. And although I'm still trying to wrap my mind around the rest of this, I can safely say it won't work in the way you think.

The way arbitrary amounts of computation can be extracted from such a system depends upon stretching out the duration of the process. By stretching out the simulation over ever longer periods of time, you ensure that it will be disrupted before completion.

As I understand it, you are proposing that some device randomly coalesces that generates a (reversible) simulation of an entity over some subjective time, creating the illusion of consciousness. Since the amount of energy available becomes vanishingly small over time, the device must use arbitrarily small amounts of energy to perform the simulation. I would expect that the amount of energy available (from random fluctuations) shrinks faster than the computation can be performed.

Of course, this ignores the fact that real things in this universe (like a brain) are not deterministic, and so not reversible. A reversible simulator (some kind of quantum computer) would have to retain all the probability functions throughout the simulation. I suspect this would be equivalent not to simulation, but to a description of a proposed simulation.

  The way arbitrary amounts of computation can be extracted from such a system depends upon stretching out the duration of the process. By stretching out the simulation over ever longer periods of time, you ensure that it will be disrupted before completion.
#+end_quote

See the duration also doesn't matter here, because even if the longer it takes the less likely it is to occur randomly, well as long as the probability isn't /exactly/ 0 then given an infinite period of heat death it's bound to occur arbitrarily many times.

My point about reversible computing is that it could in theory use no energy, plus the deal with boltzmann brains is that showing something is arbitrarily unlikely doesn't help you. You need to actually be able to come up with a reason the likelihood of it happening (within our current models of reality at least) is exactly 0.

Also looking at the section in the wikipedia article you linked I read the section about Szilard's engine. This is effectively what I was saying before in terms of a alteration of the maxwell's demon scenario and it is a demonstration of how information equals energy. Importantly though it would be trivially easy to make the pistons operate randomly and thus it seems like there being a non-zero chance of being able to violate conservation of energy that way seems unavoidable.\\
Importantly this seems like it must also allow quantum fluctuations to have a miniscule chance of violating conservation laws as well. After all while the setup imagined isn't at the quantum scale, whatever it would do to get that free energy would need to occur at the quantum scale if you looked closely enough. As in if you zoomed in enough somewhere on the quantum level you would need to see particles or energy arising from nowhere in some part of the system, thus there needs to be some sort of extremely unlikely type of quantum interactions which can occur that violate conservation. That one could theoretically get those results at the quantum level involving only a single photon (since at heat death all you have is photons separated by the cosmic horizon from each other) and some interaction with the quantum foam seems like a considerable possibility.

That actually may not be a problem in many worlds. Since from any given universe's perspective it may look random, however there will be some tiny fraction of everett branches where by sheer coincidence quantum events happen to play out as though they were deterministic. More importantly my point is that if there's some chance quantum events may play out in a way that looks deterministic for a long enough timescale for the boltzmann brain, then since it would be indistinguishable from an actually deterministic system it ought to be the same from an observer's perspective.\\
This is similar to my previous point about how if two systems can be matched 1 to 1 in terms of appearing to hold information (with processes just being made up of many individual frames as it were of arrangements of "stuff") then it doesn't make sense to treat them differently. So a bunch of randomly bouncing rocks form patterns over time which match up to what would be formed in that XKCD comic, it ought to also simulate a universe the same way.

Also even without many worlds by sheer chance you could get the same thing where for a given slice of time and space the quantum foam just acted like it was deterministic for a short while. In regards to brains not being deterministic that's not really relevant unless you think minds couldn't exist in deterministic universes/multiverses.

Then it would be useful for your to actually explain why/link to something explaining what you mean here, since anything else has next to no value online. After all it's not exactly clear how if a probability never reaches zero it isn't bound to happen multiplied over infinite time and an exponentially expanding space for it to occur in.

In many worlds the wavefunction is actually "real", it's just copenhagen where the wavefunction isn't treated as real. Also I feel like I /already/ covered how quantum foam is a term used in the actual science, I already linked a fermilab video I mean I could link the wikipedia article as well but you have google as well.

See it seems like it fundamentally can't be possible for a system which is indistinguishable from a simulation to not also be a simulation. Sure you can come up with descriptions that aren't simulations but none of those are one to one matching patterns over time. For two arrangements of matter over time which are indistinguishable to /not/ both be simulations or not would seem to require that that property of the system not actually be purely a result of its physical state or behavior. Which strikes me as impossible if literally all anything can ever be is it's physical states and behavior.

#+begin_quote

Look I already covered how specifically I'm using quantum foam here before. Secondly I've brought up the fact szilard engine type systems seem to let you get free energy if entropy is violated (entropy being unquestionably a statistical phenomenon) before and you still haven't addressed it which is getting annoying since it's quite relevant here.\\
As for the rest of the passage you called technobabble I simply stated that if you can get overunity in a large non-quantum system, then it makes it seem plausible that there's some sort of quantum interaction a photon could have which might leverage that. Though I encourage you to actually say what you think I was unclear about rather than claiming it all must be gibberish.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus][Calculus]] still says you are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improper_integral][wrong]]. If you did not already know this, then nothing you "know" about physics is trustworthy. What you "know" about probability and statistics is also highly suspect. You have literally been putting words together in ways that do not make sense, because you do not comprehend your own ignorance. And I strongly suspect that you have never studied (with a textbook, not a "science" video) quantum mechanics, relativity, statistical mechanics, or any of the other fields you're trying to talk about.

#+end_quote

Which is just an argument from your own intuitions, so at best you've demonstrated that this /could/ be true and solve the problem. Also this passage from the landauer limit wikipedia page is relevant:

#+begin_quote
  In 2011 the principle was generalized to show that while information erasure requires an increase in entropy, that increase could theoretically occur at no energy cost[6] (instead, the cost can be taken in another conserved quantity like angular momentum).
#+end_quote

As for the claims of me literally spouting gibberish with no semantic meaning and not knowing it due to my own ignorance well don't blame me if I don't exactly trust your assessment because I've encountered more than a few people online who've said the same thing who were unquestionably wrong (for instance someone who claimed to be a psych grad student yet claimed anyone could get a 160 IQ just by studying physics or other similarly intellectual fields).

In this case if you want to play the "you're not an expert in this field game" then I would recommend you read the papers linked to on the wikipedia article on boltzmann brains, because there's writing by /actual particle physicists/ about under which conditions and models of physics boltzmann brains are an issue. And if actual experts think it's a plausible issue then I can basically say with near certainty that you're wrong because the objections they bring up are not at all the same one's you've brought up.\\
However hopefully you can see that that style of meta argument is not exactly the most useful as it has no real chance of either party really learning anything and is definitely guaranteed to lack any conceivable entertainment value.

As for the bit you've tried to call technobabble more than once, I'll just have to try to go into it bit by bit. Firstly you do get the bit about szilard engines right? They are in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_in_thermodynamics_and_information_theory#Szilard.27s_engine][this]] wikipedia article which I couldn've sworn you linked to but looking back at your links I can only see the false vacuum and landaure limit one's so I'm not exactly sure how I ended stumbling upon that one.\\
Anyway do you get how instead of using information to decrease entropy it's possible for pistons/gates operating randomly to accomplish the same thing? Because once you can accomplish something like that in a large system like those examples it seems like there must be something more fundamental happening on the quantum scale, but before considering that you have to get how it works in the simplest scenarios.

*** While an interesting framing I don't think it fundamentally changes the problem. I prefer to view the Fermi paradox through the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter][The Great Filter]] and for reasons that mostly reduce my personal feeling of existential dread, I take it to be around the development of single cell life. To me this means that humanity has already passed the biggest hurdle and can go on to continue with eventually colonizing the stars.

From there I make the assumption that that sentient life is extremely rare on the order of about ~1 planet developing sentient species per galaxy. As the distance between galaxies is extremely large I except sub-light speed travel between galaxies to be extremely difficult and it would explain why this galaxy hasn't been colonized already.

Thus the reason the galaxy isn't just paperclips is the same reason we don't see aliens, it's just too rare.

**** That reasoning doesn't hold up under inspection.

Consider: Andromeda is about 2.5 million light years away, with twice the number of stars as the Milky Way. That distance is decreasing to zero. So, the chance of sentient life developing in Andromeda is twice that of it developing in our own galaxy, and the journey between galaxies, while long, should not be particularly difficult. For a patient entity with a maximization function, jumping to the Milky Way should be an obvious step.

** Anyone want some accountability and pomodoro buddies? I just found this link to a lesswrong study hall via facebook: [[https://complice.co/room/lesswrong]] (lesswrong for those who don't know is a rationalist hub type place)

I've been hanging around on it the past couple of days (probably won't be there today), and it's been very useful for motivating me to meet my personal productivity goals as a "commitment device". Admittedly I've only been using it two days but they've been extremely productive days.

The "complice" website itself seems pretty good too (but expensive! 120 USD/year - I'm on a 2 week trial at the moment), but the study room is free at least.

Would be great to see some of you folks around. Over the next few weeks I'm hopefully going to put some 'doros on my day-to-day job (traffic engineer), my writing project (supernatural romance), and my new degree (nutrition).
