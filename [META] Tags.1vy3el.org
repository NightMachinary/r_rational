There are only so many rational fics in the world. For this reason, this sub is also for hard science fiction, hard fantasy, and deconstructionist fiction (see the sidebar). But there's been some confusion lately regarding submissions of deconstructionist fiction, in particular, with people critiquing it for being not particularly rational or irrational or whatever.

So I've added a note about tags to the submission page. These are what I'm thinking right now:

- [RT] rational

- [HSF] hard scifi

- [HF] hard fantasy

- [DC] deconstructionist

- [WIP] work in-progress (as in, if you're writing something and want advice, or talking about writing something)

- [META] about the subreddit

So, any suggestions? Love it? Hate it? Have suggestions for different tags? Share!


** I think the WIP tag should be split, to distinguish between actually writing things and just planning things to write. Maybe /[WIP]/ and /[BST]/ (Brainstorm)?

** Might I suggest doing it up as link flair? That way the mod(s) can edit the flair in if a user forgets it.

I also think that trying to get them down to such a small name space is detrimenental. I'd format them more like

The great alicorn hunt - [transhumanist, pony, hard fantasy]

**** If you click on "edit flair" in the mod bar it should be a setting somewhere in there. You need to edit the "link flair templates" and check "allow users to set link flair". We don't use it in [[/r/3Dprinting]], so beyond that I don't really know.

****** I don't think you can put just anything into it. It has to be something in the link flair templates. But you should be able to edit it just like a user could, only you'll be able to edit all of them.

** Can these tags be added to the sidebar? That way I can just look at them over there, rather than have to use up brainspace to store them.

** I like it. Multiple tags are surely allowed? (e.g. [HF][RT])

I do have some other suggestions (but maybe they go too far):

- [SE] book series
- [SS] short story
- [WS] web serial
- [NV] novel
- [TH] theory (posts about the theory of rational literature, for example tvtrope-links)

**** Ah yes, I already included 'web serial' which is a kind of web fiction. One could use 'web fiction' instead. Or we split it further according to [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_fiction#Types][this]]. (How could I forget 'fanfiction' in my list.)

** Should there be tags for plain Discussions or Questions? This would trend towards the reddit cesspool that so many of the larger subs become (you know how terribad [[/r/writing]] is these days).
