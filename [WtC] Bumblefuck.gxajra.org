When I first read this, I assumed it was a joke by the author, to use an absurd made up name for the home town. An name that is the go to joke for a small nothing town in a small nothing place. But what if it wasn't? Joon uses it like it's actually the town name, and while this could be the author not wanting to select a real town because he would feel the need to reflect it accurately, or maybe just treating it as a running joke, it could be more. The more I reread the story the more it becomes clear that every detail is intentional.

It seems very possible that in the future Joon will find evidence that he has been altered, or perhaps made from whole cloth, and might confront the DM, who will smile and say that of course he was, did he really think there was a town named Bumblefuck?


** I had a similar thought, and I did some digging. Not sure the significance, but the real-life town of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsons%2C_Kansas][Parsons, Kansas,]] has around 10,500 people. 'Sporsan' is an anagram, and Joon says it has around ten thousand people (ch. 144).

** Juniper never, not even once as far as I know (and I've done partial rereads with a theory similar to yours in mind), refers to his town by any other derogatory nicknames, so I am suspicious as well.

Given the Aerb counterparts of Junipers friends and the Schlossvolk and other DM contrivances, it is well within the DM's power to simulate a isolated rural town just to get the ideal protagonist player character.

** I went ahead and ctrl+fd the entire story for "Bumblefuck", and interestingly enough every time he says "Bumblefuck" out loud he's doing it pretty specifically to explain how small and unimportant it is, and how he was unimportant by extension, which extends the ambiguity quite a bit.

** Or it could just be Joon referring to the town somewhat viciously, as he doesn't have great memories of it and can't be bothered using its actual name when 'Bumblefuck' conveys both the idea and his disdain.

It may have a boring Earth name, but maybe Joon has spent so long referring to it with his private appellation that this is just the name he thinks about it with.

** I think you might be overcomplicating things a touch. Is it silly that Joon's hometown, an insignificant spot in the middle of nowhere, is literally named "derogatory slang for an insignificant spot in the middle of nowhere"? Yes. But it's hardly unique in that regard; it's also intensely stupid, for example, for people to willingly join, fight in, and die for a gang that calls itself "the Fuchsia Coterie." The only thing unusual or potentially suspicious about Bumblefuck is that the silliness is on Earth, not in Aerb. Potentially the DM did hack his memory, but if so I really suspect it was a petty joke, like [[/u/SlantedSlash][u/SlantedSlash]] suggested, not some sort of deep clue.

I assumed it was the author's way of very quickly giving us an idea of the nature of the town in a tongue-in-cheek way, and playing it perfectly straight for laughs.

*** I don't think the comparison to Fuschia Coterie is fair. 'Fuschia Coterie' is a silly name, and things have silly names all the time, but a midwest American town with "the f word" in its name is not realistic.

Agree with your other points.

***** #+begin_quote
  The origin of Dildo's name is uncertain. As early as 1711, it was being used for a tiny offshore island there, but the island's connection with any kind of sex toy is uncertain at best. At the time, “dildo” was a word used for any cylindrical object, from nautical pins to test tubes. It was also a type of tree and a nonsense syllable used in song refrains, so the island's name could have referred to any of these.

**** It's not just that it's a silly name, it's that it sounds like all the other color-gang names were taken and they had to sit down with a thesaurus to find anything that would stand out. "You've got your Red Company, Black Army, Green Division ... Purple Crew, Silver Squad, White Host ... what, even "Vermillion Assembly" is taken? I guess we're stuck being the ... Fuchsia Coterie. Ugh." In short, it's a stupid thing that would never happen being played completely straight, so a lot like Bumblefuck, Kansas.

**** I know it's not a real town. I'm trying to figure out if Joon thinks that's a real name. If the DM /had/ messed with his mind to make him think that name (which is basically "Derisive Placeholder") was real, I think Joon would have remarked on the contained profanity at some point.

***** If his mind was messed to that extent, he probably could not notice anything wrong with it either.

I'd think, because they have had access to earth stuff, that they have taken some maps and he has pointed out where he lived in the team and nobody saw anything weird about that.

Aaaand now I seached it in the fic, and it's mentioned so many times in a way that I'm feeling like maybe subscribing to this conspiracy. AND he has actually said it out loud to the party. I also saw some spoilers, as I have not read some of the latest chapters...

** Yes, it's foreshadowing that of course this iteration of Joon has always been a simulent (or a brain in a jar) living in sim-space. (Arthur being able to be isekai'd despite being reduced to pasta, alongside a 500 year time misalignment, is another obvious flag.)

There's open speculation on the relationship between the Administrator and Joon - the obvious being that the Admin is Arthur spending time with a simulated version of his dead highschool friend.

If there's any greater purpose for this beyond the DM's personal interest, well, solving [[http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLB7AzTwc6VFZrBsO2ucBMg/videos][value alignment in AI]] is impossible as far as we know, aside from the rather imperfect route of human brain emulation. A lot of focus is put on morality and violence - it reminds me of an old game called A Mind Forever Voyaging.
