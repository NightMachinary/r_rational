Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead}


** Here's my attempt to make a cool magic system out of the "If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?" thought experiment, if the answer were NO, there wouldn't be a sound. That is, if events required observers in order to happen.

The key concepts in this metaphysics are /potentia/, /auctor/, and /gravitas/, which produce the /sagma/ magic system.

*Potentia*: an event scales according to how much effect it has. e.g. A tree falling has less /potentia/ than a nuke exploding, which has less than a star going nova.

*Auctor*: An agent capable of observing an event of any given /potentia/. e.g. The tree fell because there was an /auctor/ to observe it fall.

*Gravitas*: the scaling quality inherent to an /auctor/ which enables an event of any given /potentia/ to occur. An ant has less /gravitas/ than a fox, which has less /gravitas/ than a human. e.g. Despite being riddled with insects, the tree only fell when a human auctor was close enough to observe its effects.

*Sagma*: The name given to the metaphysical system by which an /auctor/ can manipulate the relationship between /potentia/ and /gravitas/. e.g. Initiate Bob expended /intrapotentia/ to knock a tree down, but Wizard Dave resisted with his superior /gravitas/, and it remained upright.

*** Refrigeration is easy: put anything in an airtight box. As long as you don't smell the food going bad, it stays fresh.

Mummification stabilizes all wounds on someone unconscious. If nobody can tell they're bleeding, they don't bleed.

A blindfold could be armor, if the person wearing it had enough authority to cancel out other observers. "You peasants aren't authoritative enough to observe me getting hit by your arrows, and I can't see the arrows... so they don't hit me."

I think you need extra rules about when "observation" can come into play, since otherwise a lot of basic processes - plant reproduction? seasons changing? - would get deranged. So, say that "observation" magic is optional, that it has certain triggers, it's not always active.

Skilled fine-scale "observation" should let you really bend reality. It's like the Neo-in-Matrix rule: your belief about reality not changing inconveniently becomes truth.

If you're a skilled enough observation-monk not to observe yourself falling in the water, you don't. You just walk on water.

If you're an authoritative enough observation-noble not to observe people disagreeing with your orders, they don't. People just follow your orders.

Delusion and ultimate power could become the same thing.

To give it more solidity, I'd add rules about how you get observation-strength. Like, do you have to build up a "ideal palace," like a "memory palace," that holds your vision of how reality is supposed to work? That sort of thing. Something people have to do, to refresh their ability to make the world privilege their observations.

But it's a cool idea, as long as it's not totally automatic everywhere.

**** You've got the gist of what I was going for, but I think I wasn't very clear in how the system would ultimately work out. My initial name for it was recursivity rather than sagma(which means saddle) because it would exploit the feedback loop between gravitas and potentia. If an event only happens because an observer is there to witness it, doesn't that mean that the observer is intrinsic to the potentia of the event, even if he has nothing to do with causing it? So the system would work by increasing one's own potentia and using that power to completely subvert causality, not just to exploit it by manipulating what counts as observation like you're thinking.

#+begin_quote
  a lot of basic processes would get deranged
#+end_quote

Yes, that's intentional. I like systems which are hard to master and which naturally result in power stratification(i find power dynamics and the resulting social interactions fascinating), and yet where the effects on society are fully pervasive. In this case, utilizing the system would be necessary for even the most mundane occupations, like farming or tanning. The alternative would be to observe everything all the time in order for them to behave "rationally", which isn't feasible.

An analogy would be in a modern video game, which [[https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/7v85ff/heres_whats_happening_in_horizon_zero_dawn_every/][renders only the things you're looking at directly]], though in this system the gravitas(power) of an auctor(observer) is more like a bubble of causality enabling, which extends an arbitrary distance around them.

Additionally, my preferred technology aesthetic is "lightbulbs but not vacuum tubes", and this system manages that perfectly. A lightbulb and a vacuum tube are very similar, but one has clearly observable and immediate effects, and the other does not. So a lightbulb can function well enough to be worth the expense, but the vacuum tube cannot, so mundane technological progress would be forever bottlenecked there, and advancement of the magic system would become the focus.

***** I'm a bit confused about how gravitas plays out innatural cause and effect. I can see how it works with an action that is "opposed", in the sense that two people are trying to define their own version of reality and the stronger one wins.

But what about a situation where, say, a windstorm blows over a tree and a single person is there to observe. Taking two situations where all else is equal except for vastly different gravitas of the observer, do they witness anything different?

****** In your example the tree would fall as normal to both of them if they were not actively interfering with sagma, yes. Gravitas is like the rendering cone in the GIF i linked, except a bubble produced by consciousness, and varying in accordance with the "level" of consciousness of the individual. So if two people have overlapping "bubbles of rendering", they would naturally see the same thing.

Maybe my original examples were bad because I was trying to keep to the tree falling theme. Realistically, a tree in a living forest would always fall because of the conscious fauna around it, which would combine into a gravitas gestalt. Only in a completely dead forest would a tree not fall.

Err, does that answer your question or does it just raise more?

**** Doesn't seem very similar, based on a quick Google.

The idea is that stuff just doesn't happen if there are no observer(auctor) of sufficient gravitas to observe. That would mean that a forest that's completely clear of auctors for 1 year would remain in a kind of stasis. When an auctor entered it again the "universe" would simulate the events there probabilistically, with the potentia(scope of possibilities) determined by the gravitas of the auctor.

You could use this as a soft foundation for almost any magic system though so its hard to comment any further.

*** ...this has a number of interesting, immediate consequences.

Firstly, things need to be observed to happen. Therefore, things that are not observed do not happen. Therefore, there needs to be a widespread system of observation - like an army of deployable observers - just to ensure that things are observed as-and-when necessary. This will have a certain impact on society;the job of being an Observer will be a low-skilled but nonetheless vital part of society.

Second - anything can be observed. There must be some interaction between observed and non-observed places - perhaps Wizard Dave can use his gravitas to ensure that he can get a thing that he wants (say, a large lump of gold) out of an unobserved location. With the complexity of the desired object making it harder to find (a lump of gold is easier, a smartphone is /way/ harder). But this ability to create things comes with a consequence... what happens if you use it to create /another observer?/

Thirdly, is it even possible to kill the world's best Observer? Given that he never observes timeline in which he is dead (because he would be dead), and given that his observations override anyone else's, how is it possible that his life can end (short of someone else becoming a better Observer)? (Of course, he can still be injured...)

*** Are plants not auctors? What about bacteria? The the insects that live in a forest?

Realistically, a tree in a living forest would always fall because of the conscious fauna around it, which would combine into a gravitas gestalt. Only in a completely dead forest would a tree not fall.

So to answer directly, yes, insects and bacteria can be, but their gravitas would be very low, especially the bacteria. Plants are not, but long lived plants can become the focal point of a gravitas gestalt and thus develop a type of proto-auctor state.

** Random superman :

a random person gets superman esque powers. Completely invulnerable can fly super strength etc

After a year they lose their powers and another random person gets it.

Thoughts?

I was just imagining this in the last thirty years. Probably Taiwan would be conquered. Many dead celebrities/rich people

Revolution perhaps?

Edit: Some random ideas for what they might do:

Canalman - goes around building canals, like Kra canal, linking Caspian to Black Sea, linking Baikal to Aral to Caspian

Moonman - goes to the moon and makes a big happy face on it or something - at this scale I am not sure how long it would take for superman to do something like that

Xnationalist man - really loves their country and tries to do whatever it needs, so if they're Chinese conquer Taiwan, can superman stop the entirety of the American nuclear arsenal? would the USA threaten that? after all they could just fly to washington and kill the president directly. how many carriers would he need to sink before the USA just let Taiwan and South China Sea go?

doesnt do anything man - some happy person, maybe just had a kid or got married, doesnt want to do anything with their powers, for the rest of the world looks like a year has been skipped

Fuckthesystemman - one thing this power would do would be to encourage the elites to make the lower class happier, cause there's a lot better odds of the lower class getting this power than them, and when the lower class does there is nothing anyone can do if they decide to kill every person with 1 billion+ dollars, etc.

Just cause I have a hammer not everything is a nail man - does something else with their powers that aren't using the force, perhaps just lets themself be tested or whatever

Anyone have a link to a random person generator that will give me a country randomly based on population?

I made one.
