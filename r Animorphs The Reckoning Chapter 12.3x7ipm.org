**** You gave yourself a pretty big challenge, then. Because starting with the yeerks being competently lead *AND* opening the war like you said they did *AND* having foolproof hologram technology *AND* a orbital-bombing-proof forcefield *AND* biofilters *AND* space jets good enough to blockade a planet with a fleet of four *AND* Earth being Class 5 *AND* the Andalite military being close to their canon portrayal... are you sure you want the protagonists to win ? Because the only thing that could make the situation worse (outside of the yeerks having even more technology) would be Visser being savvy enough to start his invasion in India.

I mean, I guess you're trying to steelman the yeerks, and I'm making a lot of assumptions here, but they look kind of invincible here. Worst case scenario for them : the Andalites discover them and glass the planet while they're on it. Second worst case scenario : the locals discover them early, fight back successfully, start reverse-engineering yeerk tech, the yeerk leave and glass the planet just to be safe. At this point I would say the only thing that can save Earth is either a really good plan involving the Chey (a good step 1 would be "go to the military, and ask them to provide a plan") or my own organisation, provided the YPM has or will have an equivalent in this continuity.

The Animorphs are also leveled up pretty hard. Invincible bodies, explicit subsuperpowers (Jake's intuitive cognitive modeling, for instance), having the cube from the beginning, several additional hacks whose foundation is public but which people haven't tumbled to, yet. What we're primed for is not an easy Yeerk victory; it's a general bloodbath. The kind of chess match where nobody takes pieces at all until the board is so thoroughly mixed that when it finally tips, things don't stop happening until all that's left is three pawns, a bishop, a queen, and two kings.

Plus, don't forget that Andalites are starting out near their canon portrayal, but are quick learners---a SINGLE STRATEGIST revolutionized the whole military, which isn't that crazy from the perspective of one-guy-saw-a-better-way, but IS pretty remarkable from the perspective of everybody-sat-up-and-listened.

After thinking about that overnight, that sounds a lot more plausible in a telepathic species with a /dain/ functioning something like a group mind. Everyone else can hear Alloran's case in much greater detail than he could spell it out in English, and they can almost see his thought processes. Meanwhile, his detractors would need to come up with much more polished excuses to survive the /dain,/ or else reveal they're just fishing for excuses.

Interesting. In comparison, another rationalist author (Velorien) has stated: "My approach to writing [Lighting Up the Dark (a rationalist Naruto fanfiction)] battle scenes is 'here is the challenge; how would Naruto respond to it?' If I can't find an answer that doesn't result in a Total Party Kill, I don't lower the challenge. I just think harder until I come up with something."

I suppose that's mostly a difference in tone between the two underlying stories; Naruto is a typical shonen anime and Velorien's work reflects that, while Animorphs has a recurring theme of "war is hell", which you seem to be keeping. (I guess? I haven't read your story because I prefer lighter stories.)

***** The thing is, "think harder" is not exactly a solution to realistic combat problems. Worm and Pact from Wildbow do it a lot, and sometimes the result is a very powerful scene (Echidna versus Skitter, Defiant and Dragon arresting Skitter), but on the whole I feel it cheapens the tension (the whole S9000 arc feels a lot less desperate when you know that, no matter how bad things get, Skitter is just going to pull a last minute trick that solves everything). I'm glad Twigs relies on it less. On the one hand, you still have enemies like Sub Rose defeated with a secret /don't tell the audience/ plan, on the other hand you have situations like the ghost thing where their solution is to shoot the mastermind in the face (sort of).

Seeing Ax's thought process was a good intro to the character without being too infodumpy.

I didn't realise at first this was happening concurrently with the yeerk pool chapter, but that may just be because its a while since I read them.

[[#s][Speculation:]]

The fact that the ear implants can also remove yeerks from an already infested person is interesting, I dont think there was any way to do so in canon. Seems like a totally sensible invention for the andalites to have, and removes any tiresome waiting periods.

** Yaaay awesome !!

It seems that Ax is now regretting not paying attention in his "Alien first contact" classes. Truly, the Animorphs multiverse would be a different place if he weren't such a blue-alien-female-centaurizer during his high school years.

Hoorray for base seven. Wait, why not base 14 ?

I like how the first Visser chapter has Alloran going "Who could be stupid enough to completely abandon the advantage of surprise for no benefit at all ?" And then Ax goes and takes out three controllers for not reason. Okay, he knew the surprise was lost anyway, but still. Dangerous.

So, Andalite translation magitech is a thing ? Even in Andalite Chronicles, I thought it was odd, especially if we assume it works with languages harder than English, like French, Deutch or Latin. Like, look at French. You have a straightforward Subjet-Verb-Complement structure at the core, then you add stuff on top. Except you'd need a lot of time to figure that out, because each verb has six forms (for the indicative present tense alone, we're not talking about past or future or conditional here), which are pretty close for some verb families (je mange, tu manges, il mange, nous mangeons, vous mangez, ils mangent) and completely different for others (je suis, tu es, il est, nous sommes, vous êtes, il sont), so you'd need to hear a lot of people using the same verb in different contexts to figure out it's different variations of the same word dependent on its context. Latin is even worse, with no sentence structure and a billion different forms for /nouns/, let alone verbs. and that's not accounting for complicated sentence structures and colloquialisms. So I guess the moral is we're lucky Ax didn't land in France, or less it would have taken him weeks to make his translator work. (okay, probably just a few hours, if he can get the humans to read a dictionary)

**** If it works like in canon, and what Ax says suggests it does, then it actually builds the database from listening to their conversations. Like, self-improving Google Translate that can integrate new languages. The thing is, the time-frame suggested is "listen to a few sentences, then you understand the structure so you get what they say", when it should take hours at least for the translator to even have an idea what is an English noun and what is a verb (even though English is a pretty simple language). I mean, look at this comment section. How many different words do you see ? For each of them, Ax would need the humans to say those words several time in different contexts before he could have an idea what their meaning is, which is pretty unlikely since they don't know anything about him and he can't communicate to them.

Hence, magitech.

*** While I agree with the general thrust of what you're saying (language is magitech) I disagree with your analysis that English would be easier than french/latin/German.

The structure you identify in the other languages at least exists; in English you have the much less useful scenario where one word may in fact turn out to be 6 different words, depending entirely upon context and the words around it.

So, if you scan a basic book of grammar rules and then scan active conversations, you're likely to learn a lot more than you would with a less structured language like English.

If you don't take the first step, it might be slightly harder to learn the base words, but will still be easier to learn the grammatical rules than in a language like English where they're only loosely followed and always have exceptions.

** Yesssss, new chapter!

In canon it was Visser One (not Three) that discovered humanity's potential for infection (class five species), leading to her promotion. Is that an intentional divergence? I guess Ax might not know that.

What are Narahans again? Were they the first species yeerks infected on their homeworld?

How come Elfangor could thought-speak to humans but Ax couldn't?

Interesting that Tobias is the first Animorph Ax meets since they're the closest in canon.
