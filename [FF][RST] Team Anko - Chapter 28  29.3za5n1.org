** Two thoughts:

First: Man Orochimaru and the Fox play off of each other so well, I'd read a bunch of chapters just on this negotiation. I can see the subtle lawyerings and implications from my knowledge of both characters seeping in to what and how they are speaking and it's hilarious watching them fence on multiple levels.

Second: It's really nice of Kyuubi to be so concerned about the well-being of Team Anko. They are clearly the kind of people he has respect for and wants to see protected of his own free will, even without the deal with Naruto. We can tell because he says that he respects some people, and why would good ol' Kyuubi lie?

After all, he's even taken it upon himself to judge and prevent people from gaining god-like powers that could warrant an existential risk to humanity! I'm sure he's doing it out of altruism or at least enlightened self interest, and not just to prevent anyone from matching his own level of near-god power.

What a cool guy.

*** In contrast to your comment, I've suddenly received two or three reviews, one after another, informing me that the team should have escaped from Sound "ten chapters ago" and moved on to the next arc.

I notice I am confused. Exactly what do they think the next arc will /be/, and why are they in such a hurry to get there?

**** I think a lot of readers on FF.net are used to very formulaic arc-based writing.

I'm sure you know that 90% of the fics on there, even the good ones, hit the Stations of The Canon pretty goddamn hard. The Mission To Wave, the Chuunin Exam and all its subplots, Pein, Timeskip, etc.

So likely, they are expecting something similar, a clear 'arc' system of A>B>C>D.

Instead they get RationalSociopath!Orochimaru and LawyerSpirit!Kyuubi. They likely were not expecting that.

** Maybe it's my naivete, or my lack of canon Naruto knowledge, but I find myself actually rooting for Kurama and Orochimaru. Because I don't think that two beings capable of rational thought who live on the world would want to see said world destroyed, so their stated goals make sense to me. I know that something bad is going to happen, and it's definitely going to involve these two, I just don't think it has to necessarily be bad for all of humanity.

** Ooh.

The Fox claims that "Kaguya is dead now, so I can't fulfil my contract with her", but the Naruto setting abounds with [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Summoning:_Impure_World_Reincarnation][ways]] [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Life_Reincarnation][to]] [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Outer_Path_%E2%80%94_Samsara_of_Heavenly_Life_Technique][resurrect]] [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Earth_Release_Resurrection_Technique:_Corpse_Soil][the]] [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/One's_Own_Life_Reincarnation][dead]].

Some of these are hard to pull off (requiring the Rinnegan, which I doubt is as absolutely-bullshit as it was in canon) and some are obviously not going to bring the soul back, which is probably what is required; however, the Impure World Resurrection, if part of Kaguya's body could be found, would allow Orochimaru to release the Fox from that bargain - or, put another way, have the biggest bargaining chip at the table.

I could just imagine oro and kurama pretending to jockey for position and then debate and negotiate for hours until team anko went to bed.

I guess there is no point, because naruto will still know what happened. He hasn't seemed very good at preventing manipulation so far, so it could still work though.

** I'm really enjoying this fic, but since the revelation of The Republic across the sea I'd been having trouble getting invested in that particular conflict on the side of the Ninja. Narutoverse in general seems to be a kind of horrible dystopia filled with monsters in the shape of men who can effortlessly kill people and establish military dictatorships that will never be toppled by the common people. Your average person has few political freedoms, and even if the standard of living isn't literally the worst, it's significantly worse than that of developed nations. Even worse, it doesn't seem like there's any way for it to improve with Ninja running around as a permanent untouchable warrior class.

The Republic seems like it was chakra-free long enough to get over the hump, and now can actually fight against the ninja in The Elemental Nations. They may be assholes, but if they come bearing democracy and industrialization, it may be better the world live under them than under a dictator, even a fairly friendly one like Sarutobi Hiruzen.

That being said, I'm still rooting... for someone, here. Orochimaru is an evil guy, but he's clever and cool and seems to be trying to preserve this world's magic, which is cool. He also might be the only one really capable of standing up to the nine-tailed fox in conversation.

An interesting thought: Should the Republic win, will they be able to contain the Tailed Beasts? Or is this something that can only be done with Chakra? In this light, the idea of the Republic exterminating chakra-users becomes much more worrisome.
