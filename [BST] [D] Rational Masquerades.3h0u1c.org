A common trope in urban fantasy is the "masquerade" - the idea that supernatural creatures are lurking out there right now in our normal human cities, living among us, but hidden. From a storytelling perspective, this has certain benefits- it allows you to tell a story that is more or less set in the real world, for example.

The counterpoint to this trope is [[https://xkcd.com/1235/][what xkcd has pointed out]]: that in the real world, most people have the ability to quickly and easily document anything unusual that they see- and, thanks to the internet, it becomes very difficult to keep a lid on anything. Even changing people's memories won't always help; once a photo or video is online, it's stuck there, and the entire masquerade is sunk. As writers of rational fiction, how do we take this into consideration? How do we worldbuild universes where a masquerade is in place?

Some ideas and considerations:

*Possibility 1: Consider the effects of magic on technology*

This is, more or less, the /Dresden Files/ solution. Magic disrupts electronic equipment, neatly solving the problem of digital photos and videos. You can't take pictures of a wizard casting a fireball because the magic stops your phone from working. This approach has a lot of benefits. It's easy, simple, and lets you ignore a lot of otherwise troublesome things for your masquerade.

But it's not perfect, at least not alone. Eyewitnesses are still a thing, and even if no one can take a picture of you doing it, someone casting a fireball in the middle of Times Square on New Year's Eve is still going to get plenty of attention, and then your masquerade is gone. Magic disrupting technology will certainly make documentation harder, but it's not going to prevent it completely. It seems almost certain that something like magic would be publicly known soon enough without this.

*Possibility 2: Magic must be rare.*

This point might be disputable, but I think it's essential for any believable masquerade: in order for it to plausibly be hidden, it must be rare enough that the average person can go their whole lives without seeing it. The world of today looks the way it does largely because people don't see apparently supernatural things every day. A universe with a masquerade needs to do the same.

Let's say the average person has about [[http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/social-media-affect-math-dunbar-number-friendships][one hundred and fifty friends]]. Analysis of the mutual friends I share with non-family members on facebook suggests that on average, people I know have a 6% chance of also knowing someone else I know. In real life, this is probably a lot higher. Let's guess fifteen percent- just over twice as much- as the average overlap in friend groups between two people. That would suggest that two people (each with the average of 150 friends) would have about 23 mutual friends, which, informally, seems about right to me. That would mean that our average person has about 20,000 people within two stages of connection with them, and about 2.4 million people within three stages of connection of them (this is why you can say with some certainty that everyone is some small number of connections away from everyone else- the amount of people in the network grows exponentially).

For writers, the implication boils down to this: if magical people are 1 in 10,000 in the population, the average person is just two stages of connection away from at least one. If magical people are one in a million, you still don't have to go far to find one. If you need to keep people from noticing magic, it really does need to be something that's not hidden under every bush.

*Possibility 3: For those who have magic, the benefits of secrecy must outweigh the costs.*

Consider your Average Fantasy Wizard(tm), who can cast a spell that creates a fireball. There are obvious industrial applications for this- electrical generation, for example. It's the sort of skill that people will pay good money for. If you want your wizard to stay hidden, you need to make the benefits of them doing so more than the cost of passing up opportunities like this.

It's more complicated than it might seem. Wizards, like all people, are likely to have a diverse set of values. Some wizards might remain hidden because that will help them make the most money, but others might go completely the other way. Some wizards might worry (if they have reason to) of being hunted down and killed by normals, but some will see the benefits of revealing and do it despite the danger. In short, the benefits of keeping hidden need to be something that satisfies not only selfish motives but also altruistic ones. It needs to simultaneously be the most profitable arrangement for the people who want to go after personal gain while also being one such that those who want to help others will not be able to do so more effectively by breaking the secret. There are commonly cited reasons, such as fear of the normal population starting up the witch trials again, but I tend to think a reason like that isn't enough on its own- though I do think that any wizards who are not seriously threatened by a group of armed normal humans are going to go public fairly quickly.

On the other hand, suboptimal social systems do sometimes exist in the real world, simply because everyone believes that any attempt to change will make things worse. Slatestarcodex gives the example of a society where everyone is required to give themselves electric shocks every day, and that if anyone fails to do this everyone else will immediately set on them and brutally murder them. This is a less than optimal society, but it is one which there could conceivably not be an easy way of escaping. Something like this seems promising for keeping our masquerade in place.

*Possibility 4: On human disbelief*

I think most people in the Rational community are familiar with the basic idea of how people will often not change their beliefs in response to evidence. Much urban fantasy uses this idea, saying that simply put, no matter what you show people, they will not believe in magic because it doesn't fit how they view the world. In other words, there's no point in trying to let the secret out; it just won't work.

Strictly speaking, this is the opposite of how things seem to work in the real world, where it's the belief in the supernatural, not the lack thereof, which is held onto. The opposite doesn't usually happen due to rarity of real supernatural events for people to believe or disbelieve in. That said, I don't find it an entirely improbable argument. I suspect that there /are/ people who would continue to hold to materialist beliefs in the presence of contrary evidence, just as there are people who do the opposite. The quality of our beliefs is not generally related to the content of our beliefs.

All the same, while this is certainly something a rational fiction could reasonably explore, realistically, I expect that public demonstration of magic would cause at least some people to believe in it. This might be useful for dealing with certain small-scale events, but I don't see it as something that would sustain an entire masquerade.

Those are my thoughts. What do you guys think?


** /Edit: For more, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ca43f/bst_maintaining_the_masquerade/][see this thread]]./

I have a couple thoughts (though I agree with pretty much all of what you said):

#+begin_quote
  Possibility 1: Consider the effects of magic on technology
#+end_quote

Instead of making magic interfere with technology, you can set the story in a time before widespread technology. I have a story on the backburner (one of the furthest back) which is set in 1983 and involves the wizarding government's reaction to the invention of the Betacam and the imminent arrival of home video recording. The Masquerade is much, much easier to deal with when people have to go get their film developed.

#+begin_quote
  Possibility 2: Magic must be rare.
#+end_quote

This assumes magic is randomly distributed. You can make magic much more plausible by having an induction process, or having magic pass on through genetics. This is pretty much standard; you don't see wizards, because wizards keep themselves isolated from the rest of the population. They have their own special schools where they won't interact with normies on a daily basis, they have their own houses, etc.

#+begin_quote
  Possibility 3: For those who have magic, the benefits of secrecy must outweigh the costs.
#+end_quote

Incentives can propagate. If there's a benefit to you in revealing your magic to the world, and a malus to me, I can coerce you in various ways, especially if I have more power. This is especially the case with certain sorts of magic, like a geas. This /doesn't/ necessarily mean that our society is suboptimal, it's just that no one person acts in a vacuum. A healthy society might have some people who would benefit from the removal of secrecy, but have them be stopped by those who would not benefit.

A suggested revision to number three would be that those who have /power/ must be motivated to maintain secrecy, and sufficient power to keep others from breaking it. But that wouldn't quite be a healthy society.

*** Certainly coercion is possible. That would be a suboptimal solution that the OP mentioned. The problem is that now the benefits must still outweigh the costs, but the costs include the people who do not want to lose their secrecy. It also includes the people who want to lose it.

Harry Potter is such a society in which the government requires secrecy and threatens those who want to remove it with jail. It also wipes memories. Yet such a society will still have people who will benefit from a loss of secrecy. Healing your relatives with magic is valuable enough (benefit) to outweigh the cost of jail at least for some people. Furthermore, the stronger the coercion, the greater the reason to destroy the government. If the government required me to give myself daily electroshocks, I would be very motivated to destroy them.

Finally, yes, there might be some healthy societies that would not benefit from a loss of secrecy. Such societies would be very different from Harry Potter and almost all masquerades I can think of.

** *Possibility 5: Magic does not work if it is witnessed by a human or recorded in any way.*

This would allow an incredibly powerful magic system that wouldn't be given away. I suppose one of the biggest plot points would be the increasing problem of a Big Brother society where everything is recorded or measured. Perhaps 50 years ago you could have done major feats, transformed whole landscapes, but now it wouldn't work because we have sensors everywhere and satellites watching everything.

*** The problem with this idea is that "measurement" is just another word for "effect"; whether humans count it as a measurement is arbitrary. If you heal twenty people while they're asleep, and they don't go to a doctor to verify that they couldn't have spontaneously healed, is that okay because it's not measured? What happens if someone does a statistical survey 15 years later showing that the expected rate of death from some disease has a blip 15 years in the past, is that now a measurement, and do the people retroactively die? Or does the magic only let you heal 10 people because it knows that if you heal 20, the change in death rate will be statistically significant when someone looks at historical death records in the future?

What happens if you cause a loud sound far enough away that the speed of sound becoms significant? Does the magic know whether someone's going to be coming out of his house five seconds in the future so it knows whether the sound will be witnessed by someone? For that matter, what happens if you use the magic to make a clearly anomalous thing and bury it and it gets found 500 years later?

Can you use magic to dig a hole? Engrave a message on a wall? Engrave a message on a piece of vinyl? Engrave it as a microscopic track and play it in a record player? Can you engrave it on a broken record or does the possibility that someone will invent a new computer scanning technology that lets you retrieve sounds from broken records means it still doesn't count? What if you precommit to burn the record so no future computer geeks can scan it? What if you precommit to burn the record with probability 90% based on a die roll?

** Good writeup. It's something I've thought about a lot, since it concerns the major project that I work on when I'm not writing Pokemon: a novel that approaches a modern masquerade in a rational way, and goes through how the masquerade eventually falls apart.

Currently the story is only focusing on supernatural monsters, such as vampires, but magic will show up eventually too, and the main thing that keeps it secret is that it's almost entirely a taught skill, not an innate one. So no one is "born" with magic, accidentally vanishing glass or leaping onto rooftops as an untrained youth.

Everyone who knows how to do magic also knows to keep it secret, and teaches those they pass the secrets down to to do the same, for fear of the consequences of the "muggles" finding out and hunting them down. The magic itself is much more subtle than HP or the Dresden Files: you /could/ theoretically throw a fireball at someone you want to kill, but there's very little reason to when you can just burst a few blood vessels in their brain.

Personally I've always disliked the "people are too rational to believe in real magic" spin that stories like the Dresden Files does. Much as I love the series, it always seemed really like a copout, a handwave to avoid having to deal with the realistic consequences of riding an undead T-Rex through a city. Ultimately, I hope there's some conspiracy that gets revealed to be going around keeping things hushed, because as you say, in the real world people /don't/ disbelieve in magic. By and large, more people believe in the supernatural than disbelieve, even without any evidence.

** There's an episode of Babylon 5 where a scientist invents an immortality potion, but it requires killing someone get it to work. At the end of the ep, the Vorlons destroy the invention because they predict the younger races will destroy their civilizations trying to murder each other to live forever.

This is the best masquerade I think: We cannot tell the muggles because attempting to generalize our lifestyle would induce social breakdown due to its infeasibility.

So vampires: a few million super predators feasting on 7 billion is sustainable, 7 billion predators and no prey is not.

Wizards: Every wizard has the power of a nuclear weapon in his wand. A few million running rogue is awful, 7 billion almost assures the extinction of humanity.

Werewolves: I don't even need to get into this one I think.

This is, incidentally, why I hate the modern trend of letting vampires drink animal blood. If they can do that, there's no reason to not turn everyone into a vampire and just have society conduct business during evening hours.

** Another set of possibilities involve making the masquerade explicitly magical. You can have a setting where non-magical people can't be affected by or see magic, one where they can be affected by it, but are cursed to immediately forget it, or only remember a non-magical explanation, or where they slip into a dream-like state when confronted by magic, unless they experience something strong enough to "wake them up".

This could be the result of a naturally double-sided reality, of a curse placed on humanity by a god of order or a cabal of idealistic pro-technology sorcerers, of a magical parasite that feeds on magic directed at it's hosts before it can affect them, or even of a slowly dissolving reality, where magic represents reality breaking down, and the masquerade is part of the universe's immune system.

An interesting consequence of that sort of setting is that the magic doesn't actually need to be small or hidden. In the most extreme case, you could have a modern world where magic is absolutely everywhere- where the U.S. President is a dragon, and Manhattan is a flying island running on Atlantien techno-magic, but where a few rare people (including, by implication, the reader) are magically cursed to be unaware of it.

*** That is very similar to the World of Darkness setting. The magic is very real, but human minds are too weak (with a few exceptions) to experience the reality of that magic. It is not that knowledge is impossible. Ordinary people can believe in magic just fine. The problem is that actually experiencing the magic causes direct psychological damage. Most people construct fantasies to avoid further damage. That is why you can have a war between vampires and werewolves covered up as a gang war.

As far as technology goes, the magic of that universe interferes with technology unless the technology is magically protected.

This prevents established authorities from confirming the existence of magic, but also means that many people will have anecdotal exposure to magical phenomena (and be labeled conspiracy theorists) There is no masquerade because everyone believes in magic: in love at first sight, in the zodiac, in the curse of black cats, and in bad karma.

Instead, real magicians blend into wiccans, goths, and occultists. They believe in the reality of their powers, but don't understand them well enough to pass empirical trials, though they attempt to (as they do in the real world)

This also has the innate benefit of being very difficult to falsify since it vanishes when you try to test for it. There's also an idea that everyone's beliefs have a certain power and they can cancel out and amplify one another. That's where certain ideas like slenderman arise from, where believing he exists means he gets you. Widely followed religions might create fuzzy semi-real deities comprised of human thought.

I'm pretty sure you can't really do that in rat fic. In a connected world, covering every single measurable axis of the aggregate effect would pretty much require it to have no measurable aggregate effect, wouldn't it? And if individual magic users know exactly what those effects are, and they still can't find any way to measure them? It boggles the mind to think that such a world could be self-consistent.

**** One hypothetical way of going about this (not the way I would do it, but one possibility) would be to have each magical event be identifiable by a magically educated person, but immediately dissipate after being interacted with, preventing replication or empirical verification of effects by society as a whole. Magical events might in turn only appear at random - magicians might guess at to what causes them, but only with about 50% accuracy. The inexplicability of magic might be explainable in a rational fiction as caused by the inability to gather a large enough data sample. At the same time, there would definitely be anecdotal and traditional accounts of magic for a protagonist to find and cautiously rely on.

Ruling out empirical verification does not mean netting zero aggregate effect. It might simply mean the lack of resources and application of appropriate expertise/mindsets/theories. Plus, a rat fic might be about figuring out why the effect had not been fully observable in the past, and making it so.
