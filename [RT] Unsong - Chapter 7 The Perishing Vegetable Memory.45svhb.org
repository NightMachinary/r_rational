** For reference: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guf][The Guf]]

Either there's only one computer soul available in the Guf, or we're running out of souls because the world is coming to an end.

** We can probably assume for narrative purposes that other obvious tests, like attempting to ensoul a pencil to see if it's an issue with Bill's computer, would fail. We can also probably assume that they didn't just forget the name. And we can rule out any action by Ana, as Aaron could telepathically tell if she was sabotaging them somehow.

So, it's probably some form of outside interference. Maybe Unsong is on to them already, or maybe Uriel or Thamiel keep an eye out for the Vital Name and take it offline if a human uses it. Either way, it's a bad sign.

*** Given the rationality (or lack thereof) of the main characters, I find it likely that it /is/ an issue with Bill's computer, which they didn't think to test. Furthermore, the likely narrative purpose of the detour to the error-correcting algorithm is to get the name stolen.

**** I'm surprised they didn't test the primary computer on the moon name again to see if all machines had lost their souls.

Also, due to it being a Mac, and hence Apple I imagine yeah it's going to be the computer. Odd of them not to think about it I would say

*** Agreed with [[/u/LiteralHeadCannon]] that we should /not/ assume other obvious tests would fail. Maybe what the Vital Name /does/ is create a new ensouled species, and once a certain kind of thing is ensouled, all other ensoulments of that kind of thing must be made by procreation.

+Or, uhhh, maybe casting the Vital Name on his Mac immediately ensouled /all/ Macs, maybe the one he borrowed /already/ has a soul.+

+This is about Adam. We do not read about whether Eve was ensouled with the Vital Name, or if the mere shaping of clay/his rib into a human form was sufficient thereafter.+

I~~ think this is my current preferred theory, just for the sheer magnitude to which it makes "Thinking through the implications of our discoveries was not exactly a family strong point" /even more/ the understatement of the millennium.~~

No, Llull does not work on Bob's computer, so it can't have a soul.

** Incredibly unlikely hypothesis time: It didn't work because Bill's Mac is already ensouled.

(Completely narratively unsatisfying, of course, and raises many many awful worldbuilding-breaking questions. I put this forth mostly because I don't think anybody else would possibly actually suggest this.)

*** If Bob's computer was already ensouled, then Llull would have worked on it, but it didn't. A shame because for a moment I was wondering if the Vital name gives a soul to all similar instances of the target, after all God does not appear to be speaking the Vital name every time someone is born, but everyone can still use names.
