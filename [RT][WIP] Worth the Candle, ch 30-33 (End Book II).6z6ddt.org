** If you haven't read it yet, /Worth the Candle/ is a self-insert litRPG portal fantasy, but probably not as bad as what you pictured when you read that. If you want to start from the beginning, [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][chapter 1 is here]] or [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249?view_full_work=true][read the whole thing in one page]] (but it's past 150K words, which is getting on the long side for a single sitting).

Apologies for the delay, I've been sick the last few days, but am (mostly) better now. In four days I will have been writing this story for two months without a break, with an average daily word count of 2,607 words. Go me! Thanks to everyone who has read this story, recommended it in other places, or clicked any of the buttons that make the metrics go up.

(I just counted out the planned arcs and it looks like there are about fifteen of them, but some will occupy a B-plot position, others will be only half a book, and some will inevitably get dropped when the story takes a turn, which will probably be balanced out by others coming into being.)

But.. mental/soc. Because most of the magic runs on them, and being smarter is victory. Seriously, people in gamer setups going for physical hurts. Min-maxing a physical combatant when you are sitting at a table and can use your real life mental faculties to reason out a plot your int-3 barb could never ever follow is fine.

While ideally mental/social stuff is the best, adding physical attributes makes you directly harder to kill*, and all Joon /really/ needs is to buy time to get exp - as long as you don't minmax physical entirely, I think it makes the most sense to focus on inherent (i.e. can't be undercut by betrayal, e.g. stealing magic items (cough Aumann cough)) defense. And as a bonus, revision magic looks /super/ useful as a defensive tool, so you'd be dumping points in MEN anyway.

*Specifically, harder to kill in an ambush - i.e. when you /don't/ predict everything. By the same logic, luck is also super-important.

It seems obvious to me that getting Bone magic up can only help for both problems, so dumping 3 points into Kno to get it to 20 might be wise. On the flip side, that's a big investment for something that might not work.

Dropping all four points into Luk and hoping it influences things to start breaking a bit easier for the party as a result might be the best bet for a quick resolution, or else investing 2 into Men and 2 into Soc to try and engineer a solution... Tricky.

Ugh, the Aumann +showdown+ letdown. It's official: gold mages suck. I thought there was no way Aumann would fall for their obvious scavenger-hunt bait, being the schemer that he is - having outmaneuvered two gold mages, presumably through knowing his profession's weaknesses. I mean, gold suddenly springing up at conveniently remote locations (then disappearing in their dry runs)? Here hold my +beer+ idiot ball.

If it can't be ignored despite one's best rational efforts, the call of gold seems like a severe Achilles' heel. I imagine the few gold mages stronger than Aumann are all rabid prospectors twitching at every granny's gold tooth passing by.

Warding is a surprisingly unreliable field. It's overpowered when you can set the field for an imminent confrontation against a non-warder, but amounts to a glorified delay tactic against a warder of equal or greater skill. At least this applies to Bessemer's temp wards. Not sure how Sheriot would have subverted the permanent wards at Caer Laga.

I'm still a little disappointed it wasn't Amaryllis kissing Fenn or something, as [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6vcsdh/rt_worth_the_candle_chapter_23_siege/dm0djad/][someone]] in a previous thread speculated. That would have been hilarious.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I would bet on subtle reality-warping/probability-manipulation instead. We've seen, apparently, how it manipulated Fenn's mental state, so that it corresponded to her loyalty level. If it was working on precognition, what we should expect is Fenn and Juniper never ending up in a situation that would lead to her loyalty going down, not the game rewriting her mind --- which is exactly what happened, since Juniper's game-assisted model of her personality (as well as Fenn's own model of her own personality) strongly disagreed with Fenn's actual behaviour.

That said, it /could/ still be precognition --- a situation just special enough that Fenn exhibits model-surprising behaviour --- but the evidence are more indicative of reality-warping than precognition. Remember also Juniper's speculations about DM retconning these two girls he left to die in the Risen Lands into not being Amaryllis.

We're choosing between reality-warping + precognition, and reality-warping. Occam's Razor suggests the latter.

**** No need for subtle reality-warping/precog. If the game is capable of tailoring Amaryllis looks to MC brain, it is definitely capable to create Fenn in such a way, that she will like MC naturally.

Plus, I think there were hints that Fenn likes MC. For example, Ch 19:

#+begin_quote
  I couldn't tell whether she had any actual interest in me or whether she was just having fun at my expense, or maybe both.

"Naturally liking Juniper" and "never starting to like Juniper less" are two different things. The latter is much harder to implement without reality-warping, and it would likely result in either a horribly twisted human mind, or not /human/ mind at all. Can you imagine someone who always likes you at the exact same level, no matter what you do?

** The way the elevator is handled is strange.

After the still mage is killed and the elevator boy presumably stabilized, the whole thing is effectively forgotten. This is very strange, as:

1) The elevator is full of arrows and blood. So the party would have to jam it on the 19th floor to avoid discovery. This is however still problematic, because somebody might come through the staircase to investigate the now non-functioning elevator. The staircase door to the floor is missing, a hallway full of blood is visible from there and the party does not have a line of sight to this location. This means that they can be discovered without them noticing that something is amiss. Neither the jamming of the elevator nor the staircase access is addressed in any way.

2) The elevator boy is apparently still there during the after-gold-mage-battle cleanup but neither his condition nor he himself is ever mentioned again.

So lax security protocols and understaffed security as [[/u/serge_cell]] mentioned.

Also when there's one elevator to the penthouse, the penthouse is expected to have priority and one of their head honchos did just go up.

2) I expected the time they spent on healing the boy to come back to bite them. Besides the possibility that he may yet have background significance as the only survivor and witness to the assailants, not every minor character can be expected to be plot relevant.

That also was looking suspiciously like Game Engine shenanigan. Plot needed innocent victim, but protagonist managed at least not kill boy completely. "Intended outcome" seems was death of the boy or boy left to die so that protagonist had pangs of conscience later. As it was it was natural for protagonist completely forget the boy.

**** That's when Juniper learnt about her condition in the first place. And Bormann said she wasn't familiar with it, so they opted not to try and heal it right away (because she couldn't promise any results).

The next step would have been to find out more about the "rat rot" and whether it was curable within the resources available to them. So I'm surprised it wasn't mentioned again during the week Joon spent training. Unless I'm missing something?

Nope.

I assume that Bormann is knowledgeable enough that casual efforts were futile, or they expected that and did not try anything else.

edit: From this line from Fenn to Bormann, the next step was to wait until they have to do something.

  And we'll deal with the rat rot later, if we have to.
