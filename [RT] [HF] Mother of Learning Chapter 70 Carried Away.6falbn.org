Quite.

It's all the more foolish since they are recently-diverged copies of himself, so we can reasonably suppose that the original would have done exactly what he is now berating the copy for. If he wants his copies to act differently, then he'd better look inward and make some changes to the template.

True portals would break conservation of energy as well as conservation of momentum anyways. You can't argue about them without A) assuming that the portal gun somehow compensates by providing that energy and absorbing the excess momentum or B) that the universe they have is so fundamentally easy to munchkin into Oblivion that it should have happened eons ago.

There's a good chance that portals (or in this case, dimensional gates) are merely unmovable because it increases the energy requirements or the gates themselves can't do the math required to make big changes to the relative position. There has to be a tolerance for small changes, as is obvious to anyone who knows about the true nature of sound and heat.

So wherever their bodies were in the real world when the Gate was activated, that's where they would be when they get out. Except that some time has passed in the real world. Probably not much, seconds, minutes, hours? If RR's soul was replaced sooner he could do something like walk away, or kill Zach. We know too little about the pre-loop situation though. Zorian would be in his bed but we don't know whether RR entered with Zach or found out about the loop when he was inside. We don't even know if Zach had to be present at the Gate to enter it. Maybe it's tied to Zach's bloodline and RR activated it. Since Zach wakes up in his bed each loop it implies that's where Zach was.

Just had a thought. There is a few hours between where Zorian wakes up and the loop starts, found when the Aranean were soul erased from the loop, that could be a buffer period for when the projected time estimate of when the loop starts and ends in the real world ... potentially.

Sacrificing people if they are already doomed to die is one thing, but actually setting up an assault in the real world would be a much more impactful undertaking.

And with Zorian's memory books of Xvim and knowledge of Alanic i'm sure he would be able to convince them again (without the cutting of the spiritual plain) and i'm sure they'd think 50 deaths is worth stopping a whole invasion...

In fact, knowing that all it takes is destroying the dimensional gate to stop the invasion, i'm pretty sure Zorian and Zach can spend a good few cycles finding out how to convince more officials of the threat, so that they could basically send an army to the base, or even a way to stealth destroy it?

What's the alternative use of their time? Zach tried to fight the invasion head-on for /decades/ without success, and that's without summoned demons being added to the mix. Sure, there are missing factors here, but it seems like repeated gate theft attempts have pretty good payoff. If they can identify all the priority targets, find good counters to the anti-aranea wards, etc, then even with further complications in the real world, they might have a chance to nip the invasion in the bud. And that's worth a whole lot of effort.

(And they want to steal the gate for research, anyway; if they can make that theft more efficient and take it with the portal still open, great!)

** So stealing the gate cancelled the invasion, but it wasn't /just/ stealing the gate. The way they stole the gate told the Ibasans a few things:

1. Plans of the invasion are likely leaked. No more surprise attack.
2. Someone had enough knowledge of their base to come in with a strike group and steal a portal. What more might this group know?
3. (Ibasans might not figure this out) The raiding group had enough knowledge of the Ibasans internal structure that they knew who to kill to prevent the calling of the Lich, and they knew the Lich was involved.
4. The Ibasans just lost a bunch of officers and trusted subordinates. Sure, they could probably still pull off the invasion, but losing a bunch of trusted and competent personel is going to set them back.
5. Finally, we don't know how the gates work. It might be that the Ibasans are now worried about a counter invasion if they continue to leave their gates open and active.

Overall I don't think it would have the same effect on the invasion, if Z&Z just snuck into the base and quietly sabotaged the portal.

  Before Zorian could finish speaking, Zach had already fired some kind of projectile at the building. It was seemingly tiny, more of a faint red pinprick of light than a proper-looking offensive spell, but its flight path was followed with a piercing scream so loud it made Zorian's ears hurt.

  The projectile slammed into the wall of the building and then burst into crescent spatial distortions that sliced through everything in the vicinity with no visible resistance. The whole heavily warded building fell apart like an apple thrown into an industrial blender machine, burying everyone in it under several tons of rubble.
#+end_quote

This is an impressive spell. It's small and quick to cast, but it ignores a heavy warding scheme and uses spacial distortion to destroy an entire building. I wonder why we haven't seen him cast this before? It would have been nice against that hydra or Quatach'Ichl.

I can't wait to find out why he has so much mana capacity. What does Zach say early on? That magnitude 60 is an exceptionally high capacity, but that Zach is 243? Yeah, something happened to give him that much power.

They talk about it again in the black box when Zach mentions that his shaping skills are much better than they should have been for someone with such high capacity.

***** Magnitude refers to innate capacity rather than acquired. A natural magnitude 20-30 is high, and a magnitude in the 60s(Zach) is downright inhuman and well above any mage ever recorded. The 243 number comes in through the innate 60 expanding through practice, but magnitude isn't a very good measurement at that point since there are other factors that improve the results like shaping skill and familiarity with the spell.
