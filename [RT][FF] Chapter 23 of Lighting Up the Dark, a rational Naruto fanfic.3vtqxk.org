Perhaps he could be lured into an area that has a layer of dirt over a bunch of explosive tags.

*** The premise is that the player character is a Genin in a group of ninja who have been forced to become missing-nin due to unfortunate circumstances. Their village of origin is after them because they're missing-nin, and everyone else either considers them a threat to be eliminated, a resource to be dominated and exploited, or a tasty source of foreign village secrets to be extracted through capture, interrogation and probably torture. The players must find a way to survive in the rational!Narutoverse, and ultimately elevate their faction to a position of power.

He had Jōnin-level ability, though. He was also implicitly a high-ranking Root member (Danzō sent him on very advanced infiltration missions). So if smart!Kabuto chose to become a Leaf Jōnin, there'd be nothing standing in his way.

I don't like it. The story feels empty, the characters feel empty and each chapter feels like a story in and by itself, with no real flow between them.

Sakura's chapter, this week was Sasuke's, next is Naruto's. Any other interesting characters that need to be shown, let them take the other half of Naruto's chapter. Any OTHER other characters that haven't been introduced, isn't there a month between stages 2 and 3? That's a whole month of time to introduce characters in. Have 5 chapters of that, if need be.
