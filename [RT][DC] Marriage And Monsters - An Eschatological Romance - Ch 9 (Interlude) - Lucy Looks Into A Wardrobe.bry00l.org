** We've hit over 2,000 views across RR and AO3 in the first couple weeks of release, I'm just floored by that. Thank you all so much for reading. Here we go with the beginning of Arc 2! Expect this one to draw out quite a bit longer.

First fan art! [[/u/CopperZirconium]] did this lovely portrait of a happy couple. Thank you! [[https://imgur.com/a/zYoqzn0]]

Also, Haley's next stat sheet, chapters 7 through... a chapter we haven't reached yet. These are going to stay pretty inconsistent just to dodge minor spoilers. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YizIZKFaiFo98-YAFfaOsf64BfuBIZeGC1fUCRyCH8Y/edit?usp=sharing]]

*** Personally I've never been that interested in character sheets, though they seem a staple of this kind of story. I'd rather the author was making decisions based on what works narratively rather than adhering to the rules of a system

** Boden was the one who let Aslan into the world, and yet this Aslan is not what I expect Boden would have imagined. More specifically, I think Boden wouldn't expect Aslan to kill his brother. Tying into Haley's earlier speculation on story logic, it seems more like Boden allowed the broader story of Aslan into reality, The Problem Of Susan and all, and now that story's got the remaining children in its grip.

** When they suddenly teleported to Israel, I honestly expected the entire place to be completely overrun with more Jesus expys. Given the short visit, maybe it actually is? Wonder what the Comedian's deal is.

Started reading this yesterday. Really looking forward to more!

** Haley's character sheet says she has a +114 Heal modifier... I don't know much about 3.5e, but I'm pretty sure that should be either +11 or +14.

EDIT: So, this actually is the rapture, and Jesus is indeed returned--or rather something Jesus-adjacent, yet significantly more bloodthirsty and child-soldier-having than the original.

Clearly reality is busting at the seams. It looks to me like there's some combination of "actual other dimensions are blurring into ours" and "human ideas/mythologies are leaking in through our brains." It may in fact be the Rapture, or whatever real-world event the biblical Rapture was foretelling (and Norse Ragnarok, and probably a lot of other End Times Stories too).

Current hypothesis: something intentionally threw open the floodgates in an attempt to seize control or resources from the Prime Material Plane.

Also, it seems like the Swap is relatively local to Sean and Haley's area--the super-bright flash when Boden was in the chest feels like the same thing that put Sheriff in Sean's head, but none of the kids and seemingly no one in Israel got swapped out.

*** This is the kind of thing I don't want to answer due to spoilers, but I'll take that hit because I've already caused some discomfort with other religious references and I should have seen it coming.

Yes, but only as a common thread of characterization, not part of the eschatology being deconstructed in this arc.

**** Well, I'm enjoying the story, but it's true that the depiction of, "I'm a Mormon, /so I'm going to order the mass slaughter of innocents on the slightest provocation/," does indeed cause me "discomfort" as you say.

***** Charles is a man in a prominent position making a bad choice, but it's not /because/ he's LDS. That's just the shading on a decision he'd have made, regardless. He's a man who is used to a mission and an enemy, and he is struggling in the face of the most critical disaster of his life without either of those things to hold onto.

#+end_quote

That's fair. The difficulty here is that /he/ attributes it to his religion, without anyone contradicting him, and the only other reference to it thus far comes from evil!Aslan. So even if individuals' actions don't prove anything about the religion, it is a rather negative portrayal.

But there's no reason you can't do that if you choose.

******* History has been full of men using their own religion to justify their evil actions to themselves. If that is enough to portray a religion as bad, well...

** If a quote is not the end of a sentence, then you don't normally end it with a full stop, nor do you have a capital letter next. Eg:

#+begin_quote
  you'll give them ideas," scolded his sister Piper
#+end_quote

rather than:

#+begin_quote
  you'll give them ideas." Scolded his sister Piper
#+end_quote

The exception is if the quote really is the end of the sentence, eg:

#+begin_quote
  if they'd left the liquor cabinet unlocked." He elbowed Hayden
#+end_quote

If the quote ends in a question or exclamation mark, then keep that, but still use a lowercase letter afterward, eg:

#+begin_quote
  "What if we all played hide and seek?" suggested Boden
#+end_quote

instead of:

#+begin_quote
  "What if we all played hide and seek?" Suggested Boden
#+end_quote
