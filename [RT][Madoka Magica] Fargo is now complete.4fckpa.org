** Fargo has been recommended here recently, but it's so rare for a lengthy fic to be completed (my own included) that I thought I might make another post anyway.

The story is well-written, albeit dark at times even by Madoka Magica standards. The summary is this: [Post-Rebellion] In the frostbitten American Midwest, ragged Magical Girls vie for territory to survive the unforgiving landscape. One such girl is Sloan Redfearn, who wastes away in Fargo, North Dakota, nursing a grudge and watching her hopes slowly die. But when Kyubey approaches with a unique opportunity, she becomes embroiled in a conspiracy that threatens to topple gods.

*** Recommended course of action for readers who saw Madoka Magica years ago and haven't engaged with the world since?

**** Its... mostly just understandable? Its well written, and you can really get it even if you aren't anywhere near as obsessive as I am.

If you go in paying attention you'll be fine; everything is explained. You'll miss out on some of the context with the Mitakihara characters, but they don't really appear until later.

**** It's post-Rebellion, so you could watch that movie first if you haven't yet and you feel like it.

** Just wanted to chime in and say that this is one of the finest examples of writing on a technical level that I've seen... characters are vividly written and complex... Author is a professional writer who wrote Fargo in his/her free time.

IMO, Arc 1 is great, Arc 2 is amazing, Arc 3 is great but a tad bit scattered.

*** Which professional writer though? I doubt that they are (despite the assertion in their profile), but if it's true I'd quite like to read more of their work.

**** I wouldn't be surprised if they are. The story reads very much like a novel. There are a lot of high-quality fanfics out there, but those tend to have a slightly different style from the literary writing that this story resembles.

*** There's quite a few errors and the writing so far gets pretty clunky. On a technical level, it's only okay. It pretty clearly hasn't been edited extensively.

** I just finished it and I'd definitely recommend it. It's a really solid story and does a lot of excellent world building. I'd still say it's second to [[/r/ToTheStars]] though.

** What a wild ride, the ending is happysad but yet satisfactory, the ride was great, it's the madoka fic I enjoyed most along with to the stars.

Sloan's narration was really something precious that the universe lost forever.

** Unusually competently written. I was particularly impressed by how distinct and colourful the characters were.

** Obligatory comment expressing disappointment in finding it's not /Fargo/ crossover. (I am liking it thought)

I was legitimately expecting that customer to turn out to be a charismatic hitman looking to awaken the magical wolf within Sloan and drag her into the seedy underbelly of the world of magical hitpeople.

*** I don't think so, but I'm not sure since I've never seen the movie. The main character, Sloan, is called Fargo by other magical girls because her territory is the city of Fargo, North Dakota and the North American magical girls apparently refer to each other by the cities they rule. But other characters who've never heard of it before do ask whether her name's a reference to the movie.

**** Okay, I read a few chapters and yeah, this is some novel quality content. The author's bio doesn't say much so I wonder who it could be. Definitely one of the best fanfics I've ever read.
