** I know it's short, but it's stuck in my mind.

Genre savvy characters are awesome, but so often they're still limited by narrative causality. This is a beautiful example of a genre savvy character utterly breaking the story, and the result is, she made a different story.

***** Not just savvy to a specific genre (shonen, magical girl, etc) but to anime in general. It's like the difference between a character on a standard cop show knowing the first guy they catch can't be the real murderer, or knowing that the title character can't die. One applies to cop shows, the other to (most) shows in general.

*** Well, this looks interesting. 4.5 years old, and it's still getting regular updates. If it's as much of a Rationality-esque decon fic as it looks from the start of the story, it deserves its own submission. And a place on the TVtropes fanfic recs page, if not its own entry.

*** Agreed. It would make a great spiritual sequel to TMOS Haruhi, with a dash of Lucky Star and Excel Saga.

I'd think it would work best if, instead of simply noping the premise of each anime genre, she went along with the premise for a bit before deconstructing it until the narrativium collapses.
