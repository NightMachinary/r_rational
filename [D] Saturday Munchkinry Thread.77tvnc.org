Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

*** This seems more like a problem of how to find trustworthy people, rather than a problem of how to munchkin a superpower.

That said, there are of course, ways to reduce the number of trustworthy people needed. You said the first power is Flight? That's relatively useless, just get on a damn plane. Discharge that, and all other relatively useless powers, on terminally ill patients and death row convicts that are about to be executed. That way, they can't backstab you, because they are dead. Then, when you get an actually useful power, you can give it to one of the few trustworthy people you have found.

And if you can't find any trustworthy people, there's always the option of kidnapping. You wouldn't be able to give the kidnapped victims any combat-related superpowers of course, since they would be able to use those powers to break free. Instead, give them oracle-like superpowers, superpowers that give them supernatural methods of gaining information, and then make them tell you the information.

***** Unless you stumble upon something like "Complete Invulnerability" or "Time Reversal", there usually will be ways to ensure whoever you bestow the power on dies before they can really use it.

For example, you could give the power to them while they are sleeping (humans still have cognitive function while sleeping, unlike brain-dead humans). Feed them an overdose of sleeping pills, which will kill them, and then gift them the power.

Or give them deadly poisons before giving them the power, that way even if they gain super combat powers, that doesn't stop the poison from killing them.

You could also chop off all their arms and legs and just give a superpower to a human brain without its body, that is being kept alive only by blood transfusions. Give it the superpower, and then stop the transfusion. If you do it this way, it won't matter if the superpower bestows super strength or super speed, since they don't have any muscle cells whatsoever.

** In a desperate attempt to promote equality, a mad scientist/alien/wizard/god/whatever has made it so that every day, at 12 pm GMT, all humans on Earth swap bodies randomly.

This swap does not allow people to gain memories/knowledge: for example, if a physicist is put into the body of a biologist, he still retains all of his knowledge of physics, and does not gain any of the biologist's knowledge.

This swap does not change the location of any physical mass: when the physicist wakes up in the biologist's body, that body is still where the biologist left it, not where the physicist's body originally was.

This swap is not instantaneous: all humans lose consciousness for 30 minutes at 12pm GMT, and wake up at 12:30pm in someone else's body. So there is no faster than light signaling.

If a body dies during the swap (before 12:30pm), the current owner dies. Any prospective owners find other bodies to swap with.

What does the resulting world look like? Is there anything that rational agents could do to mitigate negative effects?

*** Sorry for the long, rambling, stream of consciousness style post.

This world seems incredibly grimdark as far as I can tell. One day you can be a healthy 20 year old, and then next you could trapped in a 102 year old body that's due to fail while you're inhabiting it. Do infants get rerolled into adult bodies and vice versa? That would be a nightmare to deal with. I have no idea what effect this random swapping would have on childhood development, but the lack of stability seems incredibly bad.

How do you keep relationships when your geographical location switches every day? To see someone during a given day, you'd have to get lucky enough to have a consistent way to communicate and meet up. It's unlikely that you'll end up close enough and have the means, making relationships somewhat impossible.

It just seems like everything would fall apart immediately. Anything you do would have no consequence or promise of reward. It's impossible to hold people accountable for their actions in that situation, and anything they accomplish during a given day is essentially going to be reset. The only thing you can do is try to make each day as pleasant as possible with the resources you have, but good luck doing that after society falls apart. You can no longer get a team of experienced workers in the same physical location. You might be able to design things if the same group teleconferences together, but good luck getting them built. Also good luck keeping the internet maintained when your electrical engineers and such get scattered to the wind. On the other hand, good luck to your electrical engineers when they suddenly find themselves deep in the Amazon without the specialized survival skills that allow people to live there. I think we'd be forced to go back to hunting and gathering, except without the benefit of having stable tribes and social groups. It's also a huge problem that everyone's essentially anonymous now. If you're not tied to your body or physical location, you can do anything and just pretend to be another mind tomorrow. No one would know.

The only real plan I have is "learn to keep myself alive". I'd spend as much time as possible learning emergency medicine, survival skills, self-defense, enough geography and astronomy to locate myself when I wake up at 12:30. The unfortunate thing is that I can no longer keep permanent notes. Considering that I expect the electrical grid and internet to stop working, I wouldn't even be able to keep notes in a Google doc or anything.

Honestly though, the only thing that would keep me going is the idea that this swapping effect might be stopped some day. Otherwise it's just not an enjoyable way to live. Every day is a complete roll of the dice with a very considerable chance of death, and it's not very comforting that you can talk to the strangers around you when you can't build lasting relationships. Also while you probably will find several that speak your language, I'm assuming that the vast majority of everyone you'd meet wouldn't. It would be isolating no matter how many people were around you, and living conditions would degrade for everyone so fast that I can see the population plummeting rapidly.

That's not even delving into nightmare scenarios that I'm sure would happen. If killing the body between 12:00 and 12:30 kills the current occupant, you know there's going to be some asshole that sets their current body up to die at 12:31. Maybe you'll find yourself buried alive, or in any number of other PTSD inducing situations (assuming you manage to survive). Not that mental damage requires malice. I had a nightmare about being fully paralyzed once and that was bad enough, I don't think I'd ever truly get over spending a whole day like that and knowing it could happen again randomly.

So I guess tl;dr: this makes everything truly horrible, and there's nothing to be done except learn to keep yourself alive in the widest variety of situations possible. Once this goes into play, you've basically lost.

The problem isn't authentication, since I'm sure you can ask a friend about some shared experience to verify who they are. The problem is getting in touch at all.

Yes, in that case there's a lot humanity could do and things could be slightly less awful. The ideal to strive for is a situation where it doesn't matter what body you wake up in, and while it's not possible in 10 years it leads to some ideas. You'd want people clustered together as tightly as possible (while somehow avoiding the spread of disease that would probably cause), and you'd need to make sure there are enough resources for however many bodies are going to be in your cluster of people. I'm think of something like mega cities with skyscraper sized apartments, which again can't be done in 10 years but it would be the best way to ensure that everyone's geographically close to the things they need.

One of the most important things would be to set up the power grid and internet so that it can still function with infrequent maintenance / oversight. If you want any kind of coordination, that's your single best tool. It gives people a way to communicate things like "Hey I woke up in (mega city) today, is anyone I know here?".

Automation would need to happen very aggressively and without being bogged down by politics. The whole idea of getting a paycheque for labour is obviously out, so it's going to be hard to find skilled workers and incentivize them to do anything. Also, who's going to listen to someone that's in the same position as everyone else when they suddenly decide "I'm the boss now"? The less we have to rely on people getting things done, the better.

The more I think about it, the more it would still be fairly awful though due to the problems I mentioned in my first post. There are a lot of issues that you couldn't solve even with solid planning. The only thing we could do is try our best now to make sure everyone's basic needs are met once the swapping starts, but I'm not very optimistic that it's possible even in principle. There are a million things I know I'm not even considering, important but not urgent medicine is one that just hit me. There will be a lot of bodies that need some sort of medical attention, and far too many people who will go "Meh, if not taking this medicine won't kill me before 12:30 then it's someone else's problem".

****** If you had the infrastructure setup, you'd still be able to work and get paychecks. Everyone would have to memorize an ID number and password. When you go to work somewhere, you give them your ID number, letting them know where to deposit your paycheck. When you need to pay for something, you enter your ID number and password, similar to swiping a card and entering a PIN today.

I imagine pretty much all businesses would be chains. You'd have your Walmart, McDonalds, etc. in every city. Then, if you work at Walmart, when you wake up in a new body you check around for the nearest Walmart. You give them your ID number (or plug it into a computer), they/it will have a record of your employment there, and they/it assigns you a role (restocking, cashier, etc.) based on your experience and the experience of who else is working there.

Of course, this system would be extremely ripe for scams and identity theft. Currently, security is based on 3 things: what you know (passwords, security questions), what you have (key, badge, phone), and what you are (fingerprints, face recognition). By constantly switching bodies, you definitely can't base security on what you are, and you probably can't base security on what you have. If someone learns your ID number and password, they'll be able to fake being you for the rest of time.

Hmmm... actually, the right infrastructure could kind of solve the security issue. Have every person be required/heavily encouraged to end the day by a kiosk. When you wake up, you go to the kiosk and enter your ID/Password. It prints you an ID card, which you'll use instead of your ID number for shopping/work/etc and which expires by the next day. You /never/ use your ID number for anything else. If people steal your ID card, they still need your password to buy anything. If they peek over your shoulder at an ATM and steal your password and then mug you for your ID card, then at least they'll only be able to steal your identity for a day, since they won't have your ID number to make the next day's ID card.

There's definitely more issues and improvements to be made. Designing a secure ID system in this type of world is actually really interesting. I'm tempted to work everything out and then write a short story or something about it.

***** I'm assuming I know the exact date this will start. I would try to set up the following: a well-stocked, well-provisioned refuge area for 200000 people with maximally failproofed automation, greenhouses, etc. I start some sort of organization (probably a cult) and I need to get it to >200000 young, healthy members (order of square root of the global population to make it so that one of the cult members ends up in the area on each of the first several days). All the cult members go to the refuge the day of the transition.

In the area, there is some way for anyone who knows the layout and secret passwords to get to the control center, whence he can make announcements, view people on cameras, and perform selective automated executions to punish defectors. There is also an automatic announcement that plays at 12:30 in the 10 most common global languages with instructions to not panic, follow loudspeaker instructions, warns them they are being watched and can be punished, etc.

This can help guarantee survival of the bodies inside at a much higher rate than outside. After a short time, I expect world population to plummet, meaning that more and more of the people in the refuge have been there before, allowing them to form some sort of society.

Once a significant portion of the world population is in the refuge each day, we set up identifying passwords. We organize people to sleep in such a way that whoever wakes up in a certain bed is in charge, there are standard lines of communication, etc. in order to quickly organize each morning. I'll have the cult members be in on the plan so that there will be somebody who can organize all this.

This way, we can probably get a 100000 person strong surviving population and society, enough to serve as a nucleus for future humanity.

Edited: spellng

Further edit with new idea: Actually, the faster the world population declines, the faster we get people returning to the refuge regularly and the faster we can organize society inside (and have more people survive inside). Therefore the cult members will be ordered to kill people, damage infrastructure, etc. whenever they wake up outside to whatever extent they can without risk to themselves in order to speed up the process.

***** The immediate scenario will very quickly lead to a global collapse in population - mainly due to the fact that food production is going to almost completely vanish.

But with ten years to prepare for it, it becomes a lot more survivable. What needs to happen:

- Global literacy. Everyone needs to be able to read.
- Instructions. Everyone needs to wake up with a notebook, describing how to do basic maintenance tasks on whatever infrastructure that body is responsible for. (Advanced maintenance, or improvements, will have to wait on a mind that actually knows what it's doing).
- Interpersonal relationships will be mostly long-range, over email.
- At best, this will merely slow the decline of humanity. Children will /not/ benefit from the constant swapping, and education will be near impossible. For small (pre-literate) children, even interpersonal relations will be practically impossible. Humanity /will/ be able to adapt, but it will take generations and our social systems will come out completely altered in ways hard to predict.

*** If humanity is not warned in advance then we are seriously screwed. At 12PM in the first day everybody that's driving, flying a plane, participating on a surgery, etc., dies horribly. Maybe 5% to 30% of the people die. We probably lose 50% of working drivers/pilots and that's enough to break down our entire logistics system.

After that we have billions of people suddenly gaining conscience inside bodies they aren't familiar with, doing things they don't understand. We have a decent chance of a catastrophic failure in some system because the operator has no idea how to deal with emergencies. Software starts breaking down because any production system problem that doesn't have 100% automated failure recovery won't be fixed (even if the swapped person happens to have the particular skill set they probably won't be familiar with the system and won't know the passwords). As the systems die we increase the chances of a snowball effect as more and more systems that depend on then fail. After a few hours of downtime in core systems other systems suddenly fail because they're now handling a situation that never happened before and that part of the (never run before) code has some bugs. Not all systems die, but enough of them and many of the key systems die, it's probably sufficient to "shut down the internet".

If the swap is random chances are people can't talk to each other as they speak different languages. Age differences are a big deal too, much bigger than gender differences. Body sizes may be a big problem if you keep your original motor skills.

Maybe after a week most of the survivors adapted to the daily shuffle but now humanity is facing an extinction event. Cities have two weeks of food supplies and nobody is delivering more food.

Arguably selection effects kill everybody that isn't super competent and compassionate, It's very probable that at least one large (> 10k) population group will persist due to randomness, so we may keep a minimum viable population for breeding. From then on it's a survivable situation, human culture and values are changed beyond recognition but the civilization that emerges from our ashes will colonize the solar system in a few centuries, as their coordination skills will be godlike.

Horrible.

Any mind with major problems (or simply being a baby) would leave a chain of ruined bodies and situations in its wake, and any body with major problems (allergies, any sort of medication, etc.) would die very quickly. Any simply selfish person would leave sleepy, injured, and/or hungry bodies behind.

All farms, specialized infrastructure, and complex systems fail practically instantly, as everyone who runs them ends up on the far side of the world. They can't do their jobs, and nobody else even knows that they should be doing them.

The only possible way of punishing criminal (or civil) acts is to kill someone before the next swap.

Trade becomes almost impossible and useless. You can only use enough to get you through one day, and you can only gather resources that quickly as well. You also can't enter contracts with people that last longer than 23:30, and even if you could, you couldn't enforce them.

Communication is difficult, but not impossible. A unified world language would likely emerge almost instantly to deal with the random mishmash of languages that any group of people would speak.

Jetlag would suck, but it's possible people would synchronize to some consistent offset.

** You gain access to an inert, synthetic, humanoid body. It's made of a kind of metal for all tests humanity knows of, but it has weird properties.

If you chop off a hand from that body and attach to a person with a missing hand it will bond and act as a perfect prosthetic hand. The humanoid body will grow a new hand (say a gram per second out while it can draw carbon from the surrounding air).

The prosthetic will heal itself, a bit over 1g per hour. It also will replace the neighboring body cells in a Theseus' ship fashion, at the same rate, so in roughly seven years a person will be entirely replaced but preserve identity. From them on the person is functionally immortal, full body destruction still is possible and if you lose parts of your brain it'll grow back but the associated memories will be lost forever. The material is roughly as strong as some decent plastic. Besides the durability/health benefits your body/mind functions are unchanged.

Only the original synthetic body can produce attachable parts, once a part is attached to a person it can't be cut and bound to other people (it'll slowly form a clone of the person at the 1g per hourish rate, but the clone will develop as a new human, so it starts as a baby and needs to acquire it's own set of skills/memories and is biologically 21yo after seven years).

In the first case, I basically let an institution decide who gets minimally viable grafts, and in which order. It turns into a standard medical ethics problem.

The limit is that, if I make the technology public, I know that some doctor somewhere will take a biopsy. So I have to disclose the fact that you can clone people.

In the second case, I wouldn't share the technology. I'd use it only on myself and create a bunch of clones.

The downside is that a lot of people die of preventable illness. The upside is that (after 7 years) I look like an alien with extremely advanced tech.

Yeah, that's the starter scenario. There's a minimum graft, I would say a few grams, maybe a couple of dozen, in a single piece, and it must replace the part (e.g. not just placing on top of your skin). That gives you a person, maybe two, per day (as the synthetic body rebuilds the parts at the 1g/h rate).

Initially I thought about making it a property of the synthetic body's surface area, but I started having headache's about Torricelli's trumpet or Banach-Tarski paradox shenanigans, so I kept it simple. It wouldn't change the ratio if given more concentrated carbon in the fluid it's in but it stops if you cut the supply (e.g. keep it on pure nitrogen).

Given that it must come from the synthetic part of the individual and that part is plastic in most ways, it should shed too often (of course if you stick your new synthetic hand in a shredder or something you would end up with many small pieces.

I thought of a few fixes for this scenario:

1. There's a minimum viable piece size, just like the minimum viable graft, so we need a dozen or so grams.
2. As the pieces slowly grow they merge if they are from the same source, that also means they can be reabsorbed. Maybe they have a slow pull towards each other.
3. The clones grow at the usual rate, which is very slow, and they have some biological-like "cognitive rules", so they don't have actual brains until they are large/complex enough, similarly to the process from zygotes to fetuses. Same ethical arguments could be argued here.
4. The clones need the same sort of carbon supply, otherwise they go in stasis.

So if you have a shredder accident you can keep moving your hand near the bits and attract them back, maybe in a couple of days you find some parts you missed initially and either try to reabsorb them, put them in pure water for later use or just burn them up completely (the full body destruction clause).

OTOH you could intentionally try to build a clone army by removing pieces of yourself and keeping them apart, maybe some exponential growth as you try to divide them, but you eventually will be overwhelmed by the amount of space they need in order to not merge back again and they'll end up as baby clones anyway, so there's plenty of natural hurdles to prevent full exponential growth. Still you can end up with thousands of clones in a few years.

Because the point of the surface area idea is that it's absorbing carbon from the atmosphere, the relevant surface area should ignore nooks and crannies smaller than a carbon atom. Furthermore, if the synthetic hand is made from atoms, it shouldn't contain any features smaller than atoms. That would prevent shenanigans from using unusual mathematical figures with large surface areas.
