I remember reading on here a while back about a series of articles, and I can't find them anymore. They were about analyzing D&D/generic fantasy tropes, about the economic choices of the town near a dungeon, or the unsustainability of murderhobos. I remember it seemed to have a dedicated site, and they may have been accompanied by title-bar illustrations?

If anyone knew where to find them, I would appreciate it.


** It's part of the website [[http://www.critical-hits.com/features/dungeonomics-bibliography/][Critical Hits]] where the author loves to imagine how the economics of a DnD setting would work.

There's also the book, [[https://smile.amazon.com/Orconomics-Satire-Dark-Profit-Saga-ebook/dp/B00O2NDJ2M/][Orconomics]], which is about a similar topic.

Here's the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/56r15v/dcrtbook_orconomics/][review]] of the book that was posted to this subreddit.

*** I think it was the Critical Hits? I'll let you know in a while.

Edit: Yes it was, thanks.
