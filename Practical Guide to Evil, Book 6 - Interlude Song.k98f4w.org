** EE has been using lyrics very effectively in recent chapters. It's a marvel to read! I can't help but wonder, though, if this is the hand of the Wandering Bard. The fall of Keter would be incredible story fodder for both Above and Below. Catherine's nascent Name looks appropriately powerful - and may end up being a trap for her.

***** It doesn't seem to work, anyways. For me, at least; it gets stuck forever in:

=Bloxp is searching all the posts from . This process can take some minutes depending on the number of posts.=

=Please don't close this page or press any key, when the process finishes you will be automatically redirected.=

In any case, I find debatable what the power is, moral or otherwise, over the format in which the work of one is readed once the content has been uploaded in this way.

I will simply not read it if it is not in my Kindle, I just refuse to hurt my eyes. I don't feel that it is immoral to try to circumvent the author's will, since I believe that one cannot impose how to use the works that one has published.

As a published writer, I don't want people cleaning up their asses with my book, but readers have the right to do it if they wish, some may argue that they even have the moral duty to do it.

***** Perhaps it's a controversial opinion here, but I couldn't care less what ErraticErrata wants me to do. He has copyright over his story so I won't be publicly distributing it, but he makes it available for free to read online with no license or access restriction, so he has absolutely no right to tell me how I'm allowed to read it.

This isn't really a question of rights. Just because an action isn't legally punishable doesn't mean it's an ok thing to do. The author is providing a wonderful story for you to enjoy at no cost whatsoever; the very least a good person can do in thanks is respect his wishes regarding methods of consumption.

Somebody who sees a tray of free cupcakes and takes the whole tray might not be breaking any laws but nobody really wants to be friends with them either. Would you really want to live in a world where people just do anything they have a right to do with no regard for kindness or respect?

******* But that's not an apt analogy at all. To make it more accurate, let's say someone lays out that delicious tray of cupcakes, and says anyone can take one. I take a single cupcake, but cut off the bottom of the cupcake and make it into a weird sandwich and eat it that way. How does this hurt anything? How am I being disrespectful to him by consuming it in the way I find preferable? He handed me a cupcake and I modified its form in a way that affects no one but myself.

I am not reselling the cupcake, or distributing it in any way. I am simply taking what was given freely to anyone with no stipulations, and shifting it around to maximize my own enjoyment.

Genuine question: Are you also this vehemently against transcoding music? The artist sold it to you as a FLAC, so is it disrespectful to transcode it to opus to save space on your phone?

******** If the sign says "free cupcakes - please do not make a weird sandwich" then I'm not going to make a weird sandwich.

If I'm downloading the music for free and the producer has a statement on his site asking users not to transcode, then I'm not going to transcode it. It's not about whether the rule makes sense to me, it's about respecting the creator's explicit wishes as a matter of respect and gratitude.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯ then I'll make an azw3 or mobi. Is our disagreement solved now because it's not an "Epub, PDF files, audiobooks or translation"? Is it acceptable if, rather than making an epub, I copy it into Microsoft Word and save that as a docx file? It doesn't go against his /explicit/ wishes, so it's fine? I'm assuming not, so I'll continue but I guess you can just ignore the rest of this if it /is/ fine for me to convert it to a non-epub ebook format.

When a script is leaked for a film, do you refuse to look at it our of principle, because the filmmaker didn't want people looking at it? Do you refuse to use or look at reaction images, because they violate the copyright of the works in question? I'm trying not to be needlessly rude, but this policy of yours feels like the kind of empty PR talk that gets used, where it's designed to sound good at first but under further inspection you realize that nobody, not even the person saying it, actually follows the policy. Perhaps you are the paragon that your stated policy would require, but I'm far too cynical to assume this is the case.

********** It's really not as difficult as you're making it out to be, to engage with individual content creators as real human beings. If Reese and Wernick had come out with a statement asking people not to read the leaked Deadpool script as a favor to them, I'd absolutely have respected that. If Allie Brosh posts a note saying "hey guys I really hate the 'All The Things' meme" then a decent person would stop using it. When EE says he doesn't want people converting his books to other formats, honoring that is basic courtesy.

This isn't about copyright law or any kind of formalistic analysis of entitlement. This is about two simple questions: Would I treat a friend that way? And, isn't a person who gives me such enjoyment, asking so little in return, someone I should treat as a friend?

  This is about two simple questions: Would I treat a friend that way?
#+end_quote

I suppose we actually boil it down to the exact same thing, just from a different side. Would I treat a friend this way? No, absolutely not. Under no circumstances. Which is why it's so baffling that ErraticErrata is treating his audience this way. Respect cuts two ways, my dude. It would be completely unreasonable if I told you that you, under no circumstances, are allowed to highlight any of the text in my post; it shows a fundamental lack of respect towards you as a fellow human being, and as such I would never make such a request.

#+begin_quote
  When EE says he doesn't want people converting his books to other formats
#+end_quote

He doesn't say that, thought. He gives specific formats that the book should not be converted to. To use the previous metaphor, the artist on bandcamp says "do not transcoded to mp3." This does not mean "do not transcode at all." Specificity of language is generally important.

That isn't strictly relevant, though. I completely understand and approve of him forbidding /distribution/ of his content. Wildbow has this policy and you'd never find me arguing against it. However, it is completely unacceptable in my mind for him to demand what I do with it once it's on my machine. If I want to change the typeface or put it all in italics or randomize the word order or any other modification to the text, I feel it's in no circumstance reasonable for him to request that I do otherwise as long as it stays on my machine. He obviously doesn't have to give his blessing for me to do it, but explicitly disallowing modifications that are never distributed is too far.

******** I'm not going to engage in metaphor torture, but the actual reason for EE's request is that publishers are (apparently) weird and nonsensical, in that they'll be leery of you if there are epubs of your work floating around. Linking an epub generation tool in this sort of context definitely trips over the spirit of that request.

If you're an "information wants to be free and damn the consequence or lack of support network for artists" sort of person then there's not really much that this clarification will do, but if instead it seems nonsensical because of the missing context then I hope that having it helps.

I'm fine with that, which is why I stated that no distribution is happening. If someone is distributing it, that is a completely different story from me having it on my machine and only my machine. I understand the animosity towards anyone distributing someone else's intellectual property, but that's not what was presented here.

#+begin_quote
  information wants to be free and damn the consequence or lack of support network for artists
#+end_quote

I have opinions on the subject of copyright laws, mostly relating to them overwhelmingly favoring megacorps and screwing over the actual artists, but that's not really relevant here. ErraticErrata provides his novels for free to anyone who visits his website, with no access restriction. If I copy the contents of his website onto a word document then read the story from there, that doesn't put EE in a worse situation than if I read it from his website.

******* Is that a reasonable comparison? Where one reads it doesn't make any actual difference to the author but gives the reader possible a way nicer experience..

And it's not like he provides any alternatives (even pay-for epub for example)
