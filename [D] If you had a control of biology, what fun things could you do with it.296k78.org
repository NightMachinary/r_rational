I've been trying to hammer out the framework of a new story, to be loosely based around /Tarzan of the Apes/. Jane Porter is a budding young scientist who gets marooned in Africa while trying to find new crops with industrial applications - which is where she comes across Tarzan of the Apes, who has a seemingly supernatural ability to alter the biology of any living creature that he touches.

If you've read /Worm/, think Panacea's power but gimped to all hell.

So with that in mind, what are the first things that you would try if you discovered that you could change the biology of the living things around you? I'm trying to determine what the exact bounds of this power are - what it allows and doesn't allow - but to know for sure I need to know what the obvious exploits are.

Edit: Thanks for a lot of great responses. I have some thinking to do.


** /While the page loaded, I was thinking "Give spider-girl the power to save the world", but.../

--------------

I would be very, very cautious.

No inheritable changes. No mental self-editing, ever, and physical only after years of testing. Nothing infectious. Extreme caution in anything with an ecological impact. (incidentally, this should be standard for research on replicators or biomanipulation)

Things I would want to try:

- elimination of diseases - can I heal the sick? Create swarms of sterile mosquitoes? Vaccinate against everything with a touch?

- agriculture is an obvious route: if set before ~1950, replicate the work of Borglaug in the Green Revolution (primarily dwarfism for higher yield, some pest resistance). Pest resistance. Laugh at the idea that herbicide resistance is an optimal use of this power (ie Monsanto's monopoly-enabled strategy). More nutrition from staples. Mention concerns about crop diversity and resilience.

- creation of custom things: eg 1000kg tuna are absurdly valuable, can I touch a tree and grow a shelter, turn a cow into 100% prime steaks, etc. Something like a tropical rainforest or those clonal forests would become a /genius loci/ in this scenario.

Tarzan basically looks like Panacea-lite, limited by (head-pre-canon) a genuine desire to avoid any ecological harm and lack of education in arcane possibilities. He may also be offended by the basic concept of agricultural monocultures (character tension!).

Is the power somehow innate to his identity? Body? Lifestyle? Dependant on a code of conduct? Only usable for applications that fit some theme? It could also remain unexplained, with Tarzan not knowing if some actions could lead to losing the power and unwilling to take the risk (best limiter, IMO).

**** As I understand it: Sucrose is a asymmetric molecule. The mirror image version of sugar tastes sweet but can't be digested by our enzymes so it's basically perfect dieting sugar. However, there may be health effects from this sort of thing related to e.g. internal bacteria digesting it or not, so it may not be a perfect silver bullet. It's interesting to speculate about, anyways. Yes, this is related to chirality - as I understand it, the d variant of both glucose and fructose is required for the body to digest sucrose, and the presence of mirror-imaged l-variant of one, the other, or both makes it indigestible.

** Compress/optimize every system in the body, to start. This means:

- Your organs don't need to be in the same places
- Every organ is much less prone to failure
- Every organ is stronger (superhuman strength, vision, hearing, fortitude)
- There's room for redundancy organs, for increased survivability
- Immunity to every disease/poison

I would probably relocate my brain from an easy target to something like the middle of my chest surrounded by bone made of layered graphene. Without even changing the brain's structure, there are studies that intelligence is largely how fast you can think, and how fast you can think is largely determined by how fast electricity goes through your neurons, so if you compress everything to a much smaller size, chances are you just made yourself extremely intelligent without even needing to understand the neuron paths. This above anything else is the largest increase in the ability to get the things that you want.

Retractable wings - you can fly. Gills/webbed hands - you can live underwater. Removal of digestion system in place of chlorophyll in cells letting you survive (or even just help survive) via photosynthesis. Wallclimbing, rapid shape changing, color changing, and extreme tunneling are options too. With the extra room from compressing your organs you can hold all the changes without even looking different.

Removal of sleep, more production of energy/motivation chemicals. Healing and recovery factor off the charts, you could set your attention exactly as you need.

You'd have to be careful not to touch the pleasure center of my brain, because you'd quickly reduce yourself to a gibbering idiot where you did nothing but expand and stimulate it.

And this is just for day to day. When you go "sense-mode" there's also stuff like filia that are extremely tough and extend around you for miles, giving you an extreme sense of the world. More eyeballs would also help, to see behind you. You could make your skin more effective sandpaper than a sharks by a few orders of magnitude, making every rope or restraint worthless against you.

You could create clones, minions, or pets that you control directly and do exactly as you want. It would be biological warfare on a macro scale, something we've never seen. No existing tech could stand to it. You could make 'simple' animals for this, like bees that consider anything not wearing your clothing or your smell to be an enemy, fly at mach 2, sting with the poison of a blue ring octopus, and expire naturally after 10 minutes.

You could single handedly create the Zerg and everything good about them. Hives that produce more spawn for you, everything is 100% susceptible (and more than that, absolutely willing) to your command. World conquering is easy, you could /improve/ the world. Give everyone a pet that carries genes to manufacture antidotes to 99% of known diseases. Make it optimally cute and no one will resist getting one.

*** In terms of flying, you're going to have difficulties if you keep your human weight. Look up the size of say hang gliders or paragliders. You need wings that big to glide. If you add power by flapping say you could reduce it a bit, but then huge amounts of body mass has to go into flight muscles. Unless your power allows you to break physics you'll have a hard time. (not that it can't be done, a hang glider only weighs 20kg and a paraglider even less, but getting ready for launch would take a couple of minutes as you unpack your wings.)

As to supersonic bees, I doubt it can be done they are simply too small. You could create a biological gun/launcher by using vacuum and pressure (youtube supersonic pingpong ball) and the bullet could have basic control, but it'd be more like a smart bullet than an independent plane.

** So. Many. Exploits.\\
Here are a few I thought of.

- Resource mining plants\\
  Have plants that extract various elements from the ground. Rare earths especially. Could also grow balloons of various gasses. (Hindenburg plant anyone?)

- Carbon sequestration\\
  Make a plant that sequesters carbon from the atmosphere. Would help prevent, or solve climate change.

- Fuel generation\\
  Could combine this with the carbon plant. Generate various hydrocarbons.

- Biolumenescent trees\\
  Would replace streetlamps. Would also be useful in areas with no electricity.

- Retroviral engineering\\
  Modify viruses to produce large scale genetic modification such as nitrogen fixation, anti-aging, repair genetic diseases, modify immune systems to fight various cancers, etc. An encryption failsafe is a must to prevent unwanted mutations.

- Brain modification\\
  Increasing brain size would likely be the easiest. Harder, but far more powerful would be overclocking.

- Ambrosia/Soylent\\
  A tasty plant that that contains all a human needs to survive. Make it grow like a weed, and you've solved world hunger.

- Water plant\\
  Have it capture water from the air, but also have a root system that will pump from the watertable. You could also just have it make water from the hydrogen and oxygen in the air.

- Housing\\
  Grows into a living space with various amenities.

- Molecular manufacturing\\
  Now that you have control over the original nanotechnology, you should be able to bootstrap molecular manufacturing.

You'd make them mindless and to have a low upkeep (could run them off of soylent). You can further modify them for any specific tasks if needed. Growing them might be a bit of an issue. Best bet would be to create some sort of grow pods, and seed them with modified stem cells.

These are called "plants"; the problem is the sheer mass you need. Let's imagine that all you need to do is buy time, so merely cancelling all 21^{st} century emissions will do.

That's going to be (assuming business-as-usual, which we /really/ shouldn't do) about 3,000 GT, or... 3 Zetagrams, 3 x 10^{18} Kg. That's a lot. So much that I had to look up prefixes, which in an era trending toward peta/exa in computing is crazy.

I'm just going to note that the formal estimates say that Australia is unlikely to be able to sequester more than 100 MT per year, which is one three-hundred-millionth of what's required.

TL;DR, */way/ too much carbon*

I meant making one that would be more effective at it, a la [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosequestration#Enhanced_photosynthesis][this]]. I may have worded it poorly but by "helping prevent" it, I meat that it would at least decrease the concentration by a large amount. Also, at least in the Disney movie, the story takes place during the industrial revolution. There would be much less carbon in the air at that period of time. (Though I have no idea if they were aware of climate change at that period of time, so that may be a moot point.)

** Assuming from "any living creature that he /touches/" that each creature must be an individual (i.e., no bacteria or virus modding, because I can think of a bunch of ways to +break+ use that just off the top of my head), the first thing I would do is determine if I was included in that definition. This power gets broken if I'm allowed to, say, tie myself into an existing tree and exert influence on anything that tree is touching as well (possibly causing some cascading issues as I spread to everything that touches, and so on.). Also try to define "touch" - if I can make hairs grow and use contact through hair to alter something, I don't really need to move around - having flies carry strands of ever lengthening hair to spread my will across the jungle would work out well for me.

The next main focus is what process you can influence without actual knowledge of what they do. For instance, can you cause flies to develop the chemical system that would allow them to utilize bioluminescence without knowing how that system works? That could be a major limiter of his power - he only understands systems he has had contact with (and the understanding can be limited, as in the case of brains). So no "optimized" crops, just crops that can utilize strengths of different plant species when he modifies them.

That being said, random ideas: 1) I like the resource plants mentioned by a poster above. I was thinking something along the lines of plants that intake salt water and exhale fresh water and salt. Boom, easy water purification.

2) Population control of endangered species - depending on control over reproductive systems, can help raise the numbers of dying species, as well as fixing any ecological damage to their habitats

3) Speaking of repairing ecological damage, creating something that can process waste oil (both in water and on land) and either turn it into something useful or just transport it and excrete it somewhere it can be dealt with more appropriately.

4) Algae biofuel. It's already a thing, one good push and it can replace petroleum.

5) Species editing. The cattle population in Western civilization is facing increasing problems from artificial selection. They have been bred to be larger and larger, which causes many more deaths during childbirth as the calves are much larger than they should be. This is probably not the only species with these or similar problems, but it's the only one I can think of off the top of my head.

6) Landfill destroyers. Probably several different species to handle plastic, glass, metal, etc.

7) Worms that can improve soil quality, both for existing cropland and to convert useless soil into usable soil. Probably going to need specialized diets to excrete the proper chemicals, but that can be taken care of.

8) Insect control - bye bye killer bees and giant hornets.

** Not sure how direct the touch needs to be but:

1. It should be possible to create totipotent stem cells from adult somatic cells if you can directly modify genetics and cell structure with 100% accuracy.
2. Similarly, cloning humans or anything else would be easy since you could easily reset all the epigenetics and do the transfer of the nucleus to the zygote without causing cell damage.
3. Undo some of the better-understood symptoms of ageing such as DNA damage to slow your ageing.
4. Make yourself and others immune to diseases by producing the relevant antibodies within their bodies.
5. Destroy pathogens from the bodies of people you come in contact with.
6. Eliminate the well-understood genetic diseases from the people you come in contact with.
7. For combat purposes, modify insects to have extremely deadly poisons and switch their scent receptors so that they perceive the smell of your enemy, or the smell of a chemical that you will tag your enemy with as a threat. Make yourself immune to the poisons. Sterilize any animals you genetically modify so that they can't reproduce.
8. Obviously, healing yourself and others of injuries and reviving dead people before they've started to decompose should be possible depending on the cause of death and how much time and knowledge of anatomy, medicine, etc. you have.

** A few ideas from a book I read a while back (Copernick's Rebellion, Leo Frankowski - not a very good book in many ways, and one I can't really recommend, but it had some ideas about people exploiting a higher level of genetic understanding and technological modification)

- Tree houses: True-replicating trees of various sizes between small apartment to big multiperson family units that grow independently and can replace entire construction industry and possibly agricultural industry if they grow food (possessing room/furniture shaped internal structures)
- Improved efficiency in plants: Augment transpiration process with a heart pushing sap around for vast efficiency gains over basic transpiration.
- Insanely optimized fast-growing crops to feed world?
- Carrot for negotiating with Government (esp. US gov't) - majority of politicians are old people, offer to reset politicians internal biology to mid-twenties to ward off heart disease, cancers, etc for another 50 years. Can't fix brain stuff e.g. Alzheimers, apparantly, but fixing everything from arthritis to cancer to impotency is a pretty big negotiating carrot. currently 60 of US Senate is over 60, a majority, so it might be quite feasible to block legislation at the very least.
- Can you get something which can metabolize metals and extract from deep underground or filter metals out of ocean for initial wealth generation? Can you get an organism to shape carbon into diamond?
- Ludicrously scary negotiating stick (probably best not to even mention and hope they don't realize you could wipe out the human race on accident by tinkering with virii and/or bacteria - otherwise any sensible government will probably assassinate them).

There was a bunch of other stuff that seemed really implausible or outright fantasy of course, and a bunch of stuff involving creating sentients designed to be subservient which is super morally problematic and also extremely dangerous when they started messing around with sentients smarter than baseline humans.

*** (Author of Symbiote here) I had a great deal of fun writing Symbiote. There's surely a lot of stuff you can do with biology control! Symbiote went beyond body control into fundamental matter and even quantum control, but it started with biology control and there was a lot of conflict around it.

One suggestion. Tarzan's ability (or willingness) to control biology should be carefully matched with his his ability to understand the changes. This gives you an obvious point of non-physical conflict with Jane, where they can both demonstrate superior knowledge to the other. Hers scientific, his systemic / natural / mystical / experience / wisdom.

Bob (human) had Frank (symbiote) to control the molecular and eventually quantum construction that they were able to perform. Some of the ability bleeds over as Bob becomes more transhuman due to his and Frank's becoming more closely intertwined.

Tarzan might be doing it in a more mystical way (so I would assume anyway) and have less of an understanding of how the science part works. That being said, Jane might be able to teach him a great deal and help him learn to do more. Will Tarzan WANT to do more though? If he's happy healing bones, curing cancers, strengthening trees and improving fruit yields for his animal buddies, what is his reaction going to be to being asked to actually /change/ things?

Even better, what is his reaction going to be when his animal buddies start killing off all the rest of the apes and animals in the jungle because his activities allow them to breed far more prolifically due to increased food and health?

If he ever has experimented outside nature, one of the first experiments he might have tried beyond the obvious is to try to create primates that can communicate with speech and have more complex thoughts. This might be something that happens before he encounters Jane, and it might have been something that went terribly wrong, causing him to be extremely unwilling to "play creator" and do more than work with what is already there. This could allow for there to be some residual conflict between himself and other jungle primates too, even if they aren't quite so smart anymore. They might remember that they were once...

Tarzan might, in time, even show Jane the remnants of his past failures to play god. More juicy conflict.

Lots of different ways to go with this idea!

** Eh.. Starting with Tarzan makes.. limited.. sense If you want a character with control of biology, isn't this Poison Ivy's stichk?

That said, obvious uses : Step one: Personal Safety: In remote locations, have patches of super-photosynthetic wine send down roots. Way down. No, further. Have the roots start operating of geothermal heat gradients, spread out and grow networked redundant backups of your brain. Archival only. Not actively running. Also grow neural nodes that are basically a non-volitional computer system. Protocol: If not updated for a month, send up root vine to grow new you. Sub protocol. If you meet yourself, retreat to the depths, preform merge. (branching identity is a bad, bad, bad no-good idea)

Step 2: Optimized to heck and gone crops. Standard photosynthesis is not very good, a directed effort should be able to improve on them. Add in atmospheric nitrogen harvesting.. Dont make these seed-bearing, or you just hit reset on the entire ecosystem. Perennials that only reproduce via cuttings are the way to go -super banana's, basically. Step 3: Cook up a mod for human biology that stops senescence improves healing mechanisms in general and puts reproduction under positive volitional control for both genders. As a package deal. Make this into a fruit of a tree (see earlier comment about seedless and cuttings) Yes, I did pick a tree just to mess with people.

********** Lots of dying. And larger animals do have built in limiters to fertility- what do you think the point of "heat" periods or the fact that breastfeeding dramatically limits fertility was? Unrestricted fertility is a loosing evolutionary strategy. Animals that manage to outbreed capacity end up dead. Which is actually a fairly likely outcome for anyone taking up unrestricted brancing. "Everyone starts shooting you on sight, then pass a ban on self-copying" is a non-apocalyptic limiter. Its no fun for you, however. See original point about "no good bad idea".

*********** Aha - limits to fertility. There's what I'm looking for.

If it's so easy to predict the negative consequences of unlimited reproduction, then is it really so infeasible for a human-level mind to curtail their reproduction when it would be unprofitable to do so, while still retaining the capability to spam out new people when necessary?

************ Two cases: General availability. Do you dispute that some people are just crazy? No? Then you see the problem? A single individual: Identity isn't nearly as constant as we would like to believe. Given initial forking to an significant number of concurrent identities and any significant span of time (anything above a dozen or so) some of the forks absolutely will diverge from your present values. The ones that diverge in the direction of less restraint about further forking.. Rinse, repeat. As I said, for a single individual, disaster will probably take time. couple of centuries, even. It is extremely likely to happen, however. Self-reinforcing feedback loops are very dangerous, and usually only stop due to outside limits being imposed. See, earlier comments about lead population control.

** Your first literary challenge will be to make all of these munchkinings too hard. Two things I would try is the R-brain driving the changes. Panacea wasn't a gamebreaker because her issues prevented here from using here power optimally. If you are going to have a rationalist apply this power you should either gimp it, or make it a threat: what if the modified organisms are more prone to reversion because the DNA only affects some not all of the organism, or worse, they gain some amount of the power, and mutate optimally in single generations, mutate for their own reproduction a la potential grey goo scenarios.

** Recursive self-improvement. That's... probably not going to be allowed.

If making heritable changes is possible, I think an easy route to power is agribusiness. Become Monsanto but bigger. One business model is to create crop that has extreme disease resistance, yield, nutritional value, but then to make it sterile in only a few generations so farmers buy seed from me, grow it, sell the product, and buy more seed. Alternate business model is to create a "lock and key" system, where a special fertilizer, pesticide, herbicide, or food source is needed for good yields, which I then sell. This would be good for livestock, e.g. modern chickens but more hardy, docile, and disease-resistant.

For third-world markets, selling non-sterile but not-quite-as-good seed would be a good way to encourage the spread of a green revolution.

This would lead to me making approximately all of the money, I'd probably need an island fortress of living oak, guarded by ferocious yet adorable capybaras.

Also, the massive displacement of farmers and concentration of capital caused by less labor-intensive crops would cause workers revolts worldwide. I could probably take advantage of the chaos to, like, buy England.

** Oooh, I love these.

The key here is to make yourself as effectively smart as possible, obviously. Even if there's all sorts of limits, there are always more indirect ways. Cant change your brain? Duplicate it and wire many together. Cant do that? Grow/merge extra "slaved" brains from your spine. That not allowed either? You can still get huge mileage out of non-neural processing and storage, like stuff based of the immune system, or computer-like networks of reflexes. Reached the limit of that? Have huge amounts of sensory apparatus and limbs optimized for embodied cognition. Reached the limit of that? Optimize some for operating tools like writing or abacuses (or technological computers when they come around.

This, as well as some other stuff, will require tons of biomass, literally. It follows a similar progression. Covering the planet with a thick layer of flesh to ecologically impactful? Just put brains in all the trees and wire them together Avatar style. That out of reach? Make a transport network and have really HUGE trees bunched and merged together where there is range. Some weird must-be-like-real organism-rule? The biggest creatures around are fungi that can cover similar areas, or tree species that naturally form networks of the same individual connected by the roots. More bunching required? Fine, even single trees can get petty huge. The very bottom of making sense, having to be somewhat like a real animal? Take a cue from elephants, blue whales, and sauropods.

** Well, I suppose I would conquer the world with:

1. An army of mind slaved/trained/something(can I even do something like that?) creatures. Possibly get them from Australia.

2. Force people to obey me or I'll mess with them or something.

3. If the mind slaving portion of 1. is viable, I might not even bother with animals and just take over people.

After that, I would self modify myself and continue to do so throughout my life in order to make myself effectively immortal.

*** Direct mind control is probably one of the things that I'm going to have to nix in some way. /Indirect/ mind control is probably fine though; pheromones, changes to how various glands behave, partial lobotomy, etc. (It also goes without saying that you run into moral problems as soon as you start making modifications to people, especially without their consent. Even if it were possible to mind rape people and make a bunch of slaves, most people wouldn't, and the argument could be made that taking over the world in that manner is highly suboptimal, assuming that taking over the world actually satisfies values in the first place.)

**** True, I suppose. I would just have to go with modifying and controlling a bunch of stuff from Australia or something then, if I actually felt like taking over the world. This is simply the sort of method I would probably use if I intentionally wanted to abuse the power as much as possible.

Though if someone has control over biology, the only real way to prevent them messing with brains is to give them a mindset like Panacea's.

***** The limit on messing with brains will probably be a lack of knowledge. Brains are hella complex, and have a lot of variation. Even if you could theoretically alter how the neurons connect to each other, you wouldn't necessarily know what changing those connections would actually accomplish. If there's no ability to have a "save state" so that you can set things back to the way you found them, changing around a person's brain would be far more likely to leave them with brain damage than to accomplish anything useful.

At least, that's my first pass at limiting the power. I think as far as brains go, I'll limit myself to what can be done with modern medical science and technology (or maybe what's projected to be possible in the next twenty years or so). So you'd be able to replicate the effects of any drugs or surgery, plus a few other things we can't currently do because they're additive, but you wouldn't be able to just reach into someone's head and rearrange their mind.
