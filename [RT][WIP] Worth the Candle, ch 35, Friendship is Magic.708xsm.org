*** Yep, this is a chapter that is hard to get excited about reading by itself but is a necessary interlude for the plot and characters.

I envy the binge readers who will read this later on as they plow through these kinds of chapters without waiting as opposed to those of us reading one chapter at a time.

Still, sounds like the party got some cool new items which will have some tactical flexibility for them going forward. I am still just waiting on pins and needles with excitement in wondering how Juniper will invest his stat points. :)

**** I'm hopeful that the rapid update schedule makes these more sedate chapters a little more bearable, because if there's just some slice-of-lifeish stuff like this for a chapter you're not thinking "well I need to hibernate for a month while I wait for the next one", it'll just be another two or three days (probably more on the three days side this time, if not a bit longer).

***** I actually like the more sedate chapters a little more than the actiony ones; I'm interested in the overarching plot, but I'm /invested/ in the characters, Joon's old gaming group as well as his current adventuring party.

So you definitely shouldn't feel like the sedate, slice-of-life chapters are going unappreciated, because they aren't.

** Still a fan.

Two things though, first, the text was unclear. Was Juniper one of the things Amaryllis went out of the way to avoid mentioning or not ?

Second, the dwarf character. I can't put my finger on exactly what my issue is but he's acting way too confident and sure of his standing in the group. And, though I may have missed it, why did he get such a good deal when joining up with the group. I didn't miss the unenforceable part of the contract, but for the moment the group is acting like it's a binding contract.

I did think a third share of treasure (who doesn't get any?) and $2 million/yr was sizeable, but for all we know, master warders don't come cheap and their group desperately needed one yesterday. But his confidence seems like the business nature of dwarves. Once a deal is made, no reason to demur.

#+end_quote

It's not binding, but Juniper has loyalty numbers next to the guy's name that shows he /intends/ to follow through. Those numbers literally enforce /good faith/, which is almost as good as binding consequences for breakage of the agreement.

Dwarves have a stereotype for being blunt and cutting through the crap, and if Dwarf Guy had something he's unsure of, he doesn't really have a reason /not/ to raise it, unless it's something to hide. So there's not much to surprisingly wreck the arrangement barring unknown unknowns.

And finally, the relationship is mutually beneficial - it sounds like gold mages are a blight on society, and they're genuinely doing the world a favour by robbing the gold mages of their gold. More importantly, they're pocketing /half/ of said gold. Which to be fair, will make enemies, but enemies who were just massively (permanently!) depowered and should be fairly easily killed.

** #+begin_quote
  we had no way to permanently kill his revision mage besides Mary's sword
#+end_quote

So... just so we are clear on what happened there...

My understanding is that Mary's sword materializing inside the mage's head could not be undone because, as mentioned in chapter 11, "generally speaking, magic cannot be reversed [by revision magic]".

I wonder what would have happened had she killed him with a regular sword. Would the mage just keep auto-reversing time on death, further and further back, even against multiple assailants? Or is there some limit to it?

Also: I'm a fan, awesome story, please keep writing :)

***** He has no examples to work from. With Blood Magic he was taught directly, with Skin Magic he gained skill by actively trying to move a magical tattoo around (which is a core ability of the skill), with Bone Magic he got a crash course from a practitioner, and with Gem Magic he had the raw materials and a guide provided.

If he was going to try to learn Revision Magic, where would he have started, given his resources at the time?

****** I may be misremembering but didn't he pick up or walk by a book on revision magic earlier in the series?

Otherwise nothing would have stopped him from looking for a book on it while he was in a major city. Asking the box for the toolset of someone who "Teaches others revision magic" may have worked as well, instant instructor packet.

** Gotta say, I do hope Joon doesn't end up sleeping with either Fenn or Amaryllis, or at least that if he does, it's not glossed over as either relatively normal, or cause the usual intra-party drama that Grak is hinting at.

The point is already made that the Companion mechanic seems to affect these three's cognition regarding Joon. Maybe it's just putting a number on natural friendship and affection, but the part where it appears unlikely to go down, and Fenn's own observations on being unnaturally forgiving toward Joon mean there's probably something more to it.

It really does seem to me that Amaryllis, despite Joon's sudden insight into her potentially vulnerable side, is genuinely pretty emotionally detached from him and sees him primarily as a tool for her own ends. Maybe it's just wishful thinking on my part, but stories are so often told from the other side of the coin, that getting to see Joon deal with being led along and manipulated would be far more interesting than having him just defrost the Ice Queen over time.

Fenn's whole situation is pitiable - she appears to be developing feelings for Joon, beyond just playful flirting, but it's not clear to me whether it's a desire simply for companionship without fear of abandonment or a desire for a romantic relationship. And I imagine it's not clear to Fenn whether they're natural or not. There's a couple different ways this can go for her, and none of them seem unambiguously positive.

Hoping we get more depth out of Grak soon, though. For now he's blunt almost to the point of feeling like a tool for the author to inject plot-focused progression, rather than a character in his own right.

*** So what you're saying is you want a really exotic and angsty love triangle, yesss? The one thing it won't be is glossed over since there have been frequent hints that the characters are aware of their relationships shifting the party dynamic.

Joon only speculated that Loyalty can't go down. I'm interested in how the Companion mechanic seems to go both ways. The unnatural intensity of Joon's emotions toward Amaryllis (beyond just physical attraction), his increasing willingness to open up to Fenn as her loyalty grew, or even just jumping the gun once he saw Grak had a loyalty metric. He's essentially letting the game dictate who his companions are, but it feels like he can't help it. Part propinquity, bigger part [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(social_psychology)][reciprocity]]. Imagine knowing someone's loyalty to you is growing, your natural inclination is to trust them more. The system is pretty insidious.

I wouldn't mind seeing a defrosted Amaryllis, but her being this beautiful girl perfectly tailored to Joon does seem like an ideal setup for the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNotLoveInterest][not-love interest]]. There's only been evidence of her using Joon, but it doesn't seem like he'll just be led along and manipulated. He's been repeatedly annoyed at Amaryllis trying to own him, so the fuel's been cast for some fireworks later.

I think it's likely that Fenn is feeling both and Joon just (conveniently) happens to satisfy both. She's been living under the stigma of being a halfie where neither race is willing to open up. Then suddenly an extraterrestrial with no preconceptions appears with whom she's compatible. Natural or unnatural, it's like a divine neon sign: sign me up for this kharass.

I think Grak's fine. Bluntness is inherently proactive. His motivations are more clearly defined (and purely economic) than the others right now, so one day isn't enough for him to "fit in".
