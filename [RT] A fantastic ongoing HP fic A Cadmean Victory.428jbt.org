** Spoilers - General plot

Well, I'm reading this. It's certainly not rational - more of a dark story with some romance elements - but it's interesting enough to keep me reading. There is some serious suspension of disbelief needed in the relative speed at which harry learns things, but it's certainly not the worst fic I've ever read for unwarranted powerups.

The one thing I will say is that the casual and vaguely justified evil is starting to grate. It's like the author has an improperly calibrated moral compass - Harry is lambasting Dumbledore for (in his mind) being willing to sacrifice him for the Greater Good, and yet has justified some seriously warped actions of his own with almost the same justifications. While [[#s][]] is likely... understandable if not justifiable - already escaped once, plot related reason for a needed death, the casual way in which [[#s][]] for what seems to be no other reason than a /low score/ and being a general prick is alarming at best. Same with the [[#s][]]

There is a serious Protagonist Centered Morality problem here. In the latest chapter I've read he effectively [[#s][]] He doesn't even think twice about it.

If it wasn't for the romantic sections, I'd think he was a sociopath. The connections between Harry and Tom Riddle are often brought up but discounted, and Voldemort actually seems more sympathetic in this than normal, making the difference even less obvious.

Edit: Holy Shit! Just finished another chapter. What happens to Umbridge is Nightmare Fuel. Voldemort would be proud.

Edit 2: It gets worse. Is there a word for 'I am between apathetic and actively malicious to the lives of anyone outside my direct family ingroup' ? because this is it.

If Voldemort (who at least seems more rational here) doesn't randomly torture his followers, I'm not seeing much of a difference between the two.

*** You're not wrong, by any stretch. It suffers from serious pacing issues and there are some definite Gary-Stu moments in the beginning. On the other hand, dark!Harry fics almost always exceed my cringe-quota, and this one does a good job of showing a more realistic side to the Dark Arts.

I'd say the fic starts embracing its rational side around chapter 60, but if you don't like it by chapter 30 it's not worth your time.

**** Oof, that's a bit of at all order considering it's 90 chapters and 450,000 words. That's roughly the length of Harry Potter books 1 through 5 all together. Assuming fairly uniform chapter length, you want us to read 300k words waiting for it to start embracing its rational side? or 150k words (a little under Philosopher's Stone + Chamber of Secrets together) to see if it's worth our time?

It might actually be a great fic, and I'll check it out, but I certainly won't wait until I'm most of the way through the Harry Potter series in word count for a good part.

***** It does improve, but I only got through thanks to a camping trip and an off-line copy with little else to read (it rained for 11 days).

Never reaches rational fiction either imo, would not recommend given a the other stuff that's out there.

******* Most people have really unusual (read: awful) taste in fanfiction, so it would be good to consider suggestions from multiple people. I happen to tautologically like my own taste in FF, see if you enjoy it.

Here's what I like from HP Fanfiction:

*Drama*

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize][Cauterize]] by Lady Altair - Canon-compliant, post-DH. Prepare to feel emotion. /"Of course it's missing something vital. That's the point." Dennis Creevey takes up his brother's camera after the war./

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8461800/1/The-Twine-Bracelet][The Twine Bracelet]] by CheddarTrek - Post-DH, canon-compliant. Prepare to cry.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8369495/1/The_Cupboard][The Cupboard]] by FranticArmoire - Canon-Compliant. Prepare to be wowed. /What begins as a simple trip to retrieve extra cleaning supplies for his mother turns into something more for Dudley, something even he can't explain. He still hasn't forgotten what the Dementors showed him the previous summer, and he's beginning to think that maybe they were right after all. Oneshot./

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7069833/1/Geminio][Geminio]] by Portus - Possibly my favorite fic. Canon-compliant, but ALSO... well, I can't talk about it, cause spoilers. /Some things never change, no matter a past which no longer sleeps. This is a lesson Alastor Moody must learn first-hand./

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6199615/1/The_Fire_Omens][The Fire Omens]] by chase glasslace - Dark, rich, and full of meaning. /'Incendio is the first incantation that Tom ever learns.' Europe in the eye of the storm. oneshot/

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3612995/1/][Unholy]] by Lady Salazar - Probably the best portrayal of a "Dark" Harry that I've seen, but it's still a Dark Harry so don't read it if you don't like that. /There are some things the human race is not meant to know. Harry didn't care instead, he made it his life's purpose to learn them./

*Comedy*

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] by Emerald Ashes - One of the most hilarious comedies I've ever read. The writing is hilarious, but lacks some technical polish. My favorite comedy. Pokes fun at fanfiction in general, in addition to being great. /The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused./

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/][A Black Comedy]] by nonjon - One of the best-written fanfic comedies out there, a must-read for anyone interested in HP Fanfiction. /Two years after defeating Voldemort, Harry falls into an alternate dimension with his godfather. Together, they embark on a new life filled with drunken debauchery, thievery, and generally antagonizing all their old family, friends, and enemies./

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3124159/1/Just-a-Random-Tuesday][Just a Random Tuesday]] by Twisted Biscuit - Canon-compliant, almost. Slice of life. Not usually my thing, but it has its humorous moments. /A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is./

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11583668/1/I-ve-Always-Wanted-to-Use-that-Spell][I've Always Wanted to Use that Spell]] by White Squirrel - Pretty much canon-compliant, quite humorous, loses some strength partway through but still excellent. /McGonagall finally got to awaken the statues in the Battle of Hogwarts, but she wanted to do it for a long time. Given all the times she missed her chance, it was no wonder she was so eager when the time came./

*Adventure*

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3991385/1/Sherlock_Holmes_and_the_Ravenclaw_Codex][Sherlock Holmes and the Ravenclaw Codex]] by Pavonis Mons - Canon-Compliant, crossover with Sherlock Holmes. Entertaining and riveting. Set in the Victorian England. /A Sherlock Holmes mystery set in Victorian Hogwarts. A valuable artefact has been stolen from Hogwarts School, with a Muggle student the only suspect, and Headmaster Black summons Holmes to retrieve it. But the case is not as clear cut as it first appears/

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7108864/1/Memorium][Memorium]] by Aesop - A good exploration of memory charms and the statute of secrecy. /The use of memory altering spells is common in the HP books. Protecting their secrecy comes before everything else, and justifies any action. Or so they believe./

******** I know this is from a couple of months ago, but I only just stumbled across it, and as the author of The Cupboard, I wanted to thank you for the recommendation! I only just discovered this subreddit, and happening upon this comment was a surprise that really made my day.

********* Ah! I'm glad it made your day. The Cupboard is an excellent story, and one of the fics I recommend people who are just getting into fanfiction.

Like Cauterize and The Twine Bracelet, it's a mundane fic. Unlike them, it is a fully fleshed out short story with action and a conclusion. As a character study of Dudley and a raw, sharp attack on the Dursleys' parenting, it stands alone in fanfiction. Everything written about their parenting and its impact on Dudley is solid, from his own acceptance (at first) of their doting nature, to the aggressive response they have when he starts to think for himself. They still love him, though, and there's even a great father-son moment in there:

/"No thanks. I need to be up early tomorrow to exercise, and I'm not really used to alcohol and all-"/

/His father snorted. "Save it for your mother. Remember, I went to Smeltings too."/

It's good close-up 3rd person, too. Of course, Vernon is referred to as "his dad" or "his father" always, because that's who he is. And whatever flaws Vernon may have, in this moment you think, "oh, right, he's still a father" -- and what's more fatherly than sharing a drink with your teenaged son in the kitchen on the sly?

******* Harry Potter fanfic? /Nightmares of Futures Past/ and /Forging the Sword/ are both great.

In general? There's a couple of threads on [[/r/rational]] about the "rational canon", which contain some great reads. No link from mobile sorry.

I really disliked the characterization of Harry in this one, especially his clinginess to Ron's family. While I am not able to identify whether it's rational or not as I don't have enough knowledge of PTSD, it really felt out of place for a 30 years old man being bossed around like that and accepting it and even embracing it.
