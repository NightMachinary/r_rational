** I am so confused right now.

In positive new, the Marco/Rachel shipping intensifies.

#+begin_quote
  ‹Relax,› I said. ‹He doesn't look like it's bad news.›
#+end_quote

That... seems like a really, really dumb comment from her. The characters have been pretty good at questioning everything so far, and going "maybe everyone is secretly a robot / an alien / someone else morphed", and now seems like a pretty obvious time to apply it.

Stargate rule n°1: if they've missed a check-in and their team is missing, they're a Goa'uld.

#+begin_quote
  /Shut up. Focus. You have gold hair. You have strong arms, strong hands, long legs. Your smile---when you smile, it looks like you have too many teeth. Focus, think about it, see yourself in the mirror---/
#+end_quote

Okay, this is at least the second time that happens (don't remember when the first was). Is there some sort of emulated Marco in Rachel's brain? Because this is starting to sound like way more than an imaginary voice and like something with an actual personality.

****** It's kind of weird none of my internal imaginary voices are based on ANYONE but myself. Maybe it's because I don't trust anyone else enough to let them have a say in my own head. When I was a kid I had a lot of internal imaginary voices, and most of them from people who were very critical of me and didn't provide useful advice. Even my close friends don't get an imaginary voice representing them in my head.

My imaginary voices seem to fall along a continuum of left/right and forward/back, which seems to correspond somewhat to my intentional system and automatic system, but I don't know why it's split in two different axes. Furthermore wall I can tell when the interaction is going left/right and front/back, it's hard to tell in retrospect which thoughts are "left" and which are "right" and same for front/back.

**** #+begin_quote
  there's really - I claim - only one set of 'next things' that make sense.
#+end_quote

I... don't really see it? Anything could happen, depending on which characters survived this chapter and the previous one (which is a little unclear), which decisions they and V3 make, which resources V3 has access to, and what he's done in his free time so far.

More than that, this last encounter could have gone in any number of ways based on purely random (that is, non-chekov's-gun-ish) factors:

- The Visser-Bot could have opened with his Andalite blaster and basically sliced every protagonist into carpaccio in 10 seconds, before getting within stabbing distance of Rachel.

- The Visser-Bot could have opened with an antimatter paintball (seriously, how comes nobody ever uses that thing?) and blown every protagonist into meat soup in 3 seconds.

- Rachel could have decided to hang back, keep their ship invisibility on, and blown up the VB from above once he was identified.

- Rachel could have double-tapped the VB before trying to rescue the others.

- Rachel could have decided to set up Garett or Ax as a backup sniper just in case.

My point isn't that any character behaved really incompetently (although they kind of did) but that there's a million different ways things could have gone down and could still go down. Maybe the gods can anticipate all those things, but as a reader I object to the idea that the events are flowing logically from one to the next.

#+begin_quote
  If you think of this result as having been orchestrated, not by me but by /a character in the story/
#+end_quote

I... don't really like that idea? I'm probably not alone, there's like a billion different "Why Contessa and Shards and Jack's power suck in Worm" threads to be found; given that we don't understand the gods' motivations, that their intelligence is too vast for us to comprehend, and that their interventions are mostly off-screen, there's not much visible difference between "this was orchestrated by gods" and "this is railroading".

But when I sit in the shoes of the characters that are /clearly/ still alive, and I look at the resources they are /known/ to have, the next actions that will be written into the story feel, to me, like the things I would do myself in that situation (and it doesn't feel like there's a wide open space of possibility).

Edit: Actually, I have a better explanation for it: The thought scream heard at the end of the chapter is Garrett's "secret weapon", and only possible if he's in morph. Since it's being made, and assuming he's the only one who can make it (at least; he was the only one who succeeded in doing so on-screen), it means that maybe he was wearing morph armor, and still will have a chance to demorph back to being fine.

Please say he's fine.

A V3 /clone/ Yeerk (as opposed to a blank copy that he controls directly) controlling the body of David, and that clone V3 wasn't part of the Leeran hypersight conversation and thus doesn't know that morphing is dangerous (and V3 didn't tell it; just said "Go, kill").

Note that V3 is the type to cooperate with clones of himself, for the most part, even though he's often not kind to them in the end.

Also: Garrett has had a chance to hear Visser Three's spoken word inflection/cadences via the recordings of his landing and speech (in the prettylite body).

If there's a chance for this to come up in an interlude chapter, it'd be interesting the hear you write one of V3's clones that knows/ strongly suspects it is going to be sacrificed for the greater good. It's not obvious to me that the Visser's absolute drive to survive wouldn't be present in a mind-continuity sense in his clones, I'm surprised they aren't more interested in their own personal survival instead of the wider V3.

** Well. So the bracelet is paying off.

My prediction seems to have not come true: no time-stopping intervention happened in this chapter. On the other hand, could Tobias be alive? I thought he was dead at the end of last chapter, but now that I think about it, I don't recall him being part of the Leeran hypersight.

I don't get why Visser 3 doesn't just nuke everyone from space, or just come in shooting with the blade ship, since he knows exactly where they are.

They should use a hyperdrive to blow up Visser Three's Mars operation.

  I spun the knob, pressed the button, and---with the last of my strength---threw it toward the almost-invisible shape.

  TSEWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW---

  The shimmering crystal shape froze in place
#+end_quote

So this part was confusing. The word "shape" is used twice, but is it referring to the same thing in both cases? And what is it referring to? (I read back over this and couldn't figure it out). In general, the ending of this chapter was much harder to understand than the ending of the last chapter (perhaps that's by design).

#+begin_quote
  Oh, god. Ax.

  I shoved myself to my feet, my body still fluid and unstable. I looked down at the shape of---

  Dead.

  Definitely dead.
#+end_quote

This is also confusing, because it sounds like Ax is dead ... but then later, Ax is referred to as "unconscious." So was Rachel looking at someone else? Are we supposed to know who it was?

--------------

So I'm really sad that everyone seems to be dying, including /all my favorite goddamn characters/. Sure, having the good guys always win in stories is less realistic, but on the other hand, that's not necessarily a bad thing, as stories are specifically /for fun/ among other things. You've clearly been planning these events for a long time though, so I'm just going to ride this out.

*** Alphanos' interpretations below are the intended ones.

As to your other questions, V3 didn't strike from space because a) politics and b) he is now aware of Telor's mutinous wavering and doesn't trust them to carry out operations like that. He didn't go himself because he's /super/ prioritizing the Chee and can only /kind of/ be in two places at once.

As for using a hyperdrive to /blow up Mars/ ... that's ambitious, and I don't blame them for having not quite thought of it yet. Remember that despite my slow update schedule, the in-story timing of all of these events is RUSHRUSHRUSHRUSHRUSH, and hopefully they can be forgiven for small mistakes and an inability to completely think everything through.

Re: Tobias, no comment. The pieces are there; if it's too hard or not interesting to put them together, they'll be explained in later chapters. He was definitely part of the hypersight scene, though less prominent than Jake and Marco.
