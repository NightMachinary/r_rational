Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

My first thought is consistency: if your characters constantly change shape in ways that don't make sense, it becomes hard to recognize them, and they can even be off-putting (e.g. [[http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/poohadventures/images/a/a6/GTS6jrFy.jpeg/revision/latest?cb=20150519012658][DoodleBob]]).

Even when the entire point is a rather 'terrible' style such as doctor catz and home movies they play to their strengths and don't stretch the style. Bad animation is so terrible that people literally will not watch it unless they want to revel in how terrible it is and your better off using still images with voice over.

*** The audio and visual components are surprisingly separate, and should both be done as well as possible, but there are ways around this.

I saw this in a major way relatively recently. [[http://www.crunchyroll.com/konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world/episode-5-a-price-for-this-cursed-sword-692401][In Episode 5 of /God's Blessing on this Wonderful World/]] (warning: mediocre anime), the gang goes to purify a lake of monsters. The protagonist, trying to mitigate the general uselessness of his party members, concocts a plan which requires minimum risk and effort. The monsters in the lake start to attack, but there's no great increase in animation. Many of the shots are directly reused, or only have slight changes. The entire scene is carried on the performance of the goddess's voice actress, and its such a good performance you could probably change tabs and loose nothing.

Stellar voice acting is language independent, but for me I give bad voice acting a pass since I don't actually speak Japanese. If I knew the language well enough to judge its quality then bad voice acting could very well jar me out of any scene, no matter how good the animation was. They're just separate in that way, and can't quite cover for each other. A lavish animation budget could smooth over poor shot composition, but not so for sound and visuals.

Bad animation (or minimal animation) has to be used cleverly to keep the audience's interest, since they will eventually fall asleep if you only pan over static scenery. This means you need a nice [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dbi4N6NGn4][aesthetic]] or [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2v6iOVhw6mQ][style]] to get away with not a lot of drawing.

I can't think of many cases of both good animation but bad sound; usually the staff has corresponding competence. More likely is passable voice acting but sub-par environmental sound effects, and not just footsteps. Footsteps are important because they ground characters, but rich sound work goes a long way to immerse me into a story.

To use a terrible metaphor: People talk about the five senses: Sight, Hearing, Touch, Taste, and Smell. In an animated medium, you only get to use Sight and Hearing. So you have to make up for the others in some thoughtful fashion. Personally I think the /Visual/ part of the animation gets Sight and Smell (think: steam rising from a bubbling pot of stew) while the /Audio/ gets Hearing, Taste and Touch (think: your mouth waters when you hear bacon sizzle, not when you watch it in a vacuum). Very high quality animation can suggest tactile sensation, but the level of detail required, say perhaps "fingers sewing pieces of fabric together" is enough to make me want to the sounds of thread instead.

So, to answer your question: animation and voice acting both make characters come alive, but the directing is the most important.

(this is the immediate musings of a total novice and should be taken with your daily recommended dose of salt)

My point is that, in an animation with subtitles replacing voice actors, the characters' emotions would be communicated /entirely/ by the writers and the animators, rather than being supplemented by the voice-actors.

--------------

To address the original question: I think the voice-acting is much more important. In my opinion, bad animation is much less immersion-breaking than bad voice-acting--compare, e.g., /[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam][Mobile Suit Gundam]]/ (bad animation, bad English dub) with /[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpiderRiders][Spider Riders]]/ (good animation, terrible English dub).

** A scenario:

Let's say the worst possible outcome happens and fanfiction is made illegal. Fanfiction.net and every single story on its servers will be deleted at the end of the week. How feasible is it to save and archive everything before it goes up in flames?

I know [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download][Wikipedia distributes their complete archives]], but as I far as I know /only/ Wikipedia does this. I've seen a few .epub versions of stories or what-have-you but never a completely redundant version of a website.

I do feel a hint of genuine anxiety that, although the web is probably more robust and longer lasting than most other forms of media storage (these books won't suddenly get wet and rot) the threats they do face are far faster and more fatal. *rm -rf*. I know it's silly, but that little bit of paranoia wants me to have a complete copy of a number of large websites for my personal safekeeping.

*** It would be easy to build an automated scraper, the only question is whether you'd get hit with a rate limiter or whether it's too much data.

There are 12 million stories on ff.net. My somewhat pessimistic guess is 10,000 average words per story. Average length of a word is 5 characters, but we'll add two characters for punctuation and formatting. That's 840,000,000,000 characters. If we're encoding at 1 character per byte, that's 840GB. If you had Google Fiber, you could do that in about two hours. (But I'd really doubt that ff.net would allow you to hit their website in excess of 12 million times in two hours or that you'd get as good of speed on their end.) This also doesn't include reviews, but I don't know how worth saving those are.

Edit: Sending a request with Postman shows a response time that hovers around 170ms. If we're doing 12 million requests, that's 23.61 days, which won't work, but we're actually doing /more/ than that, because we need a request for every chapter, not for every story. You could save time by doing requests in parallel though.

So in that circumstance you'd be able to recover some of the best stories as well as a lot of the good non-rational fanfiction.

I have roughly 300 fanfiction stories saved, and since I don't usually like one-shots, almost all of the them are multi-chapter stories.

I wouldn't worry overly much about great fan-fictions going missing, because fans would save a lot of them and recompile them into a new website.

**** There are a bunch of different approaches, and they're all generally highly dependent on what javascript you're using.

If you were using react.js it would be easy, but that comes with a whole bunch of other stuff.

I don't think it's really feasible to make one that isn't coded for a specific website.

My general approach (using django and jquery, both pretty boring choices) is this.

--------------

Have two templates. One renders the entire page, another renders /just/ the content in the list.

Check for a querystring that says something like "justTheList=True" (or a better named variable).

If the request asks for just the list, return just the html for list with none of your other website stuff. No menu or anything.

When a user scrolls to near the end of a page, request the next page using jquery. But request just the list. Insert that list into the end of your list div.

--------------

Does that make sense? It's one approach out of many. I could give more specific advice if I knew more specifics, like what language you're using.

This one is "hacky" but it tends to be pretty cheap and quick to implement on top of your normal pagination.

** So if I, an individual, have an idea for a project, which will need help from some (reasonably small number of) friends, and this project will generate money, which I want to split with my friends in some prearranged way, do I need to start some form of for-profit corporation? If yes, that seems awfully oppressive given that all the money will be taxed twice for, AFAICT, no justifiable reason. If no, why do for-profit corporations even exist? Further, am I legally required to pay people for their contributions up-front, rather than as a share of relevant profits? If yes, that seems to discourage the organization of profitable projects by people with little starting capital.

If you just want a formalized arrangement with friends, you don't need any of that and it's likely too much burden to be worthwhile. Making a corporation would mostly be for your legal protection.

No, you're not required to pay people up front. You're not actually required to pay people /at all/, so long as you tell them that you're not going to pay them (and you're not running up against minimum wage laws, which probably don't apply).

How you want to structure your business really depends on how much you want to protect yourself from any potential legal issues and how much legal stuff your partners require to make sure they're not being screwed out of money. But while you might want to file as a business with your local authorities, there's almost certainly no point in doing much more than grabbing some boilerplate and filling in the blanks (depending on intended scale).
