A few weeks ago, [[/u/19283123]] posted a [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2w6lhw/qedu_should_we_start_community_readthrough_on/][suggestion]] to have a community read through with /Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid/ winning as the most popular request.

I plan on starting next Monday with the first post on discussing the first chapter of GEB, or the *Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering* as well as it's dialogue *Three-Part Invention*.

Unless there is significant disagreement, I will be posting every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 5:00 PM (Pacific Time) discussing the latest chapter of GEB with a two or three day grace period to give enough time to read the upcoming chapter.

EDIT #3: A few people who have previously read GEB have commented on [[/r/GEB]] that this schedule is a little aggressively quick and we will be likely to lose many readers as we approach the end of Part 1. I have taken this advice into consideration and adjusted the dates to reflect a switch to two chapters per week starting with *Chapter VII: The Propositional Calculus* on April 2nd. The two chapters week will be a Monday and Thursday schedule. Also, I removed the link to a .pdf download for the book when someone commented that it was very likely to be an illegal reproduction.

EDIT #2: I have decided to change the planned posting time from 5:00 PM (Pacific Time) to 1:00 PM (Pacific Time), because several people have requested an earlier time slot. In addition, since so many people had trouble accessing the Google Calendar (I probably screwed up somewhere), I made a list with a date for each chapter:

** You are linking to an illegal reproduction of this book (and one that you said on another thread said even has weird grammar errors, which to me makes it even worse to do that). The author once said this:

  Hello -- Sorry, there's no electronic version of GEB, nor will there be one. I don't like e-books! But I do hope you have a good time reading GEB. All the best to you and your co-readers. -- Douglas Hofstadter.

*** Whoops. I thought he deliberately littered the copy with multiple errors per page so that people who can't buy it can still read his book while keeping an incentive to actually the physical copy.

Sometimes I don't think overly much about when good things happen to me.

I removed it from the above post.

*** Strange Loop was written because Hofstadter thought that one of the core messages of GEB had been lost on the average reader. He decided to be more direct.

Strange Loop is half as long, has linear structure, doesn't play around as much, has much less math, and is written to persuade the reader of a single idea (that consciousness arises from self-referential patterns in the brain) rather than playfully weaving a tapestry of interrelated ideas and defying categorization like GEB.

** OK, I'll play, but I'll have to rely on my memory of the book because I don't have time to read it all again. I've read it a few times and kinda, sorta, almost felt like I understood most of it. I'm looking forward to reading other comments and contributing when I can.

I'd like to participate, but I live in the UK. This would be midnight or 1 in the morning for me, depending on whether this is on daylight saving time. Could it be done any earlier? Say 2:00 PM?

EDIT: There seem to be issues here; separating Prelude into it's own section instead of grouping it with Chapter 10 like all the other dialogues seems wrong.
