What do I mean by realistic? I want the author to treat their self insert not as an fun adventure but as a grimdark survival guide. Wish fulfillment, harems, and fix-it sues makes me want to gag. I want the author to treat their story as if they were actually reincarnated/transmigrated into a fictional universe treating their new life not as a game to explore in. It also ruins my immersion seeing the SI seek out canon characters to befriend them or use earth idioms and flaunt knowledge they should not have. Why even risk butterflying the future plot to nonexistance. You lose your only advantage doing so. Also fuck gamer and random omnipotent beings self inserts. Will read female self insert recommendations if they are realistic and not romance centric.

Sorry if I am being too specific.These type of self inserts exist though. Here is my list which I highly recommend.

I dropped this story partially because it was doing exactly what you list as unwanted traits of an SI story. Granted, I've only read it to chapter 10, but even in these starting 10 percents of the story, the protagonist does all this:

- instantly gets attached to Ino, who is her biological sister in this story, and develops absolute loyalty to her.

- potentially arouses Hokage's suspicions by making a dumb ominous remark for no reason

  #+begin_quote
    "... You begin the academy next year don't you?"

    "Yes Hokage-sama," she replied with an exaggerated nod.

    "See that you do well. I'll be expecting great things from you."

    Rei's smile turned sly. "Don't worry Hokage-sama. I promise I'll be like no one you've ever seen before."

    /That/ earned her a long look and suddenly the smile on his face didn't look quite so genuine.

    "Take care of yourself Rei-chan," he said before turning and walking away.

    The smile on Rei's face fell as soon as he was gone.

    /Damn it damn it damn it. I definitely went too far. Shit!/
  #+end_quote

- intentionally copies young Orochimaru's style of dressing --- again, for no reason than I assume to appease her mary sue / SI aesthetics and use it later on as an excuse for drama complications.

She also has a very shitty personality, and the other character behave out-of-character to enable her. [[https://np.reddit.com/r/NarutoFanfiction/comments/9p7vfo/ocsi_prodigy_fanfics/e8lck1v/?context=3][I've commented more on this here.]] I've tried looking for others' reviews on this story to determine whether maybe it gets better later on, but it seemed like drastic personality and goal changes keep happening almost from one chapter to the next, and her personality traits and behaviour only worsen in the later chapters.

Because by just existing the SI already influences things and thus changes the future. The stories also like to use the butterfly-effect excuse to explain their lack of originality and regurgitation of canon stations.

The main character is a 30-something woman who falls through a mirror at a garage sale into a Gringotts bank vault and realizes she is in her 11 year old self's body because... magic. Though it isn't finished yet, it's already got a 16 chapters and a good 98,000+ words for you to go through. It's also Gen which is pretty nice. I've been enjoying the heck out of it.

My intermittent writer's block tends to resolve into full blown inspiration irregularly. Pretty much every chapter was written in one draft in one sitting. I've occasionally gone back to redo certain word choices or alter flow, most notably at one point where a speech was a bit too stilted and unbelievable.

I want to be more regular, but I need to do some more research before the next chapter as it's a PoV I haven't done before.

** Well. If you're looking for sci-fi/anime SI, try Undocumented Features from Eyrie Productions. It's basically the largest one out there, so there's a good chance you'll find at least part of it to your tastes.

I'm rather surprised that it's seemingly never been mentioned here, actually. I know some of Eyrie Prod's works have sparked some... controversy (please don't start about DJ), but it's still a fanfiction landmark.

It's also collaborative, more than five millions words, and still growing since 1991; and the story itself is multi-generational, stretching over more than 400 years and many, many worlds. Not quite a crossover, but certainly the largest fusion I've ever read, in terms of sources, cast and world-building.

Due to its age and collaborative nature, its quality can vary (especially at the beginning), although I can't say I've been disappointed by anything in the last fifteen years or so, and even the beginning is a fun read (in an insane, wtf is happening way). The Symphony of the Sword books in particular are really great.

**** Yes and no. The recent issues are published in HTML/CSS and so are easily converted, and there is work done to retrofit the older ones. But most are still raw text, because for the longest time HTML just wasn't good enough for formatted text, and the authors didn't want to use such a non-standard (at the time) way of displaying text. Remember, we're talking about a work that began its life on a campus' usenet server in 1990...

So yeah, there's epub versions out there (like in my Calibre library) but it's not official and there's probably formatting bugs.

Would you say it's a particularly good SI later on, or a particularly good story? It'd be more impressive if it was also the latter, but I've always heard of it as a trivia piece, not something that's actually worth reading.

**** The very first "issues", the Core books, are undoubtedly an in-group project, with lots of in-jokes and crazy stuff. The kind of things 90's anime fans write about when thinking "what if the Dirty-- I mean Lovely Angels just dropped by Worcester, no wait, what if we accidentally summoned a version of the Lovely Angels using hypertech we stumbled upon"

That's only the first two Core books though, which these days would be considered short stories (barely 40k words each). From there they actually got serious about storytelling and worldbuilding, but still kept the early work as things that actually happened, and for which there were serious and lasting consequences. Like First Contact and uplifting.

I also suspect that some of the authors then went through a depression, and that gave birth to the Exile arc. Definitely not crazy fun stuff.

By Future Imperfect, which is the vast majority of UF, the quality is solid and the authors are committed in delivering a well-crafted, coherent universe. The in-world history has also advanced significantly, so the SIs take a step back and the storylines are mainly about their children. They do make appearances though.

Symphony of the Sword is already deep into Future Imperfect. It adds an Utena crossover/fusion to UF, and is third-person but from the POV of Utena, with one of an SI's daughter as a co-star (although it's really a full-cast work). Since the world is viewed through the eyes of a newcomer it doesn't really demand an in-depth knowledge of the rest of UF, and I'd tentatively recommend starting with that to get a feel of the work.

Note that by that time, there's already one or two dozen fandoms fused into that universe. Ah! My Goddess, Star Trek, Star Wars, Babylon 5... And of course Bubblegum Crisis, Macross and Dirty Pair from the early days. But as always, UF take them as fusions, not straight crossovers.

There's also lots of it available in audiobook, if that helps.

Disclaimer -- I'm a big fan of Eyrie. I've been following their works since about 1994 (my own high-school days), so I may be biased. But I tried not to be.

** I'm curious about this evolution of language. By your usage, I take it that Self-Insert in this case means the author is a human from our world that is transported into a fantasy or SF world? The classic example being Narnia?

(i'm curious both because I'm aware of an older term for this phenomenon, and because Self Insert is also an existing fiction term which has meant something rather different before)

*** Yes, that's basically correct. In this usage (most of this seems to come out of the spacebattles/sufficient velocity forum cluster), it's a version of the author being either transported or reincarnated into a fictional world. Generally told from a first person perspective.

The self insert generally has full knowledge about the fictional world they are in. (So if they're in Harry Potter, then they have read all the books before they arrived there.)

It's not the same as a Mary Sue, as it's not necessarily an idealized version of the author, though it often becomes a fix-fic. (Which means "fixing" bad outcomes that happened in the original canon by getting directly involved in the plot.)

**** Yeah, Self-Insert is being used here to refer to a trend in fanfiction, where the viewpoint character is a forked personality of the author introduced to a setting they are /already familiar with./

In contrast, Narnia is an example of the related but much broader Portal Fantasy, where a plausibly-from-real-life original character, enough for the reader to empathize with, is thrust into a setting they are /wildly unprepared for./

The main character is supposedly a former businesswoman but acts like a stereotypical magical girl teenager, and is otherwise a rather bland character with little to no growth. She have some cool powers and I'm a sucker for the rise to power stories, but at chapter 170 I still can't recall a single time she had taken initative to drive the story.

Any want she appears to have, beyond becomming more powerful so she can protect her friends against unspecified threats, are shortlived and quickly resolved. Either because she either overpowers her opponents or because she does one of her honestly uninspiring speeches in which she quotes a few earth philosophers and then swooes everyone.

There's squad exploration or contemplation of what happened to the original girl whose body the main character inhabits.

The currency is based on continually regrowing mana crystals and she has a background in business but have no ideas how to exploit their system.

A majority of the population is treated as second hand citizens because they can't do magic and she can't bring herself to care.

The story just passed chapter 200, and a fair amount of the most recent chapters are based entirely around what you're talking about in the spoiler. I think the problem is that the author takes a looooong time to move things forward - a bunch of words are, IMO, wasted on elaborate descriptions of food and fashion - but when you consider that the OP is seen as a 15-17 year old girl, it's not surprising that she can't easily skip out to some of the most dangerous areas on the planet on a whim, even if doing so might be one of the best ways to get powerful. Doing so in Australia wouldn't have been realistic, as she didn't fully realize the potential of doing so until she left (and she had the Kirin Pendant and didn't need to advance that way); and doing so in China would have been extremely difficult, as she is being closely watched by incredibly powerful individuals and governmental entities, and travel is tightly controlled by the Communist party.

To your other points:

#+begin_quote

I think you meant to use a different word than "squad" there (Scant? Squat?), but this is also a point brought up in recent chapters. Although I find the resolution to be unsatisfying. Granted, it does leave the door open for future conflict...

Agreed, this is a really disappointing part. HDM/LDMs are mostly taken for granted once the China arc progresses, because CC becomes what most characters care about, and those aren't can't be traded or (easily) manipulated economically.

I'm not sure what you mean here, as she continually shows caring for the NoMs. Her paper in her college classes, her behavior on the excursion, even early on with her first mission that leads her to a slaver's ring in a NoM neighborhood. If your comment was meant to say that she doesn't prioritize them over her personal concerns in general, then I'd agree... but that's not the same as not caring. Gwen does care, but she knows it's not a simple solution to fix, nor one of the main ones that occupies her attention ATM.

Anyway, I don't think Metaworld Chronicles is a masterpiece by any means, but I do think it's a pretty interesting read with an interesting alt-Earth setting, good power progression, an entertaining cast of characters, and a pretty interesting magic system. I read it for those details more than the technical writing skills.

***** Not to spoil much, but she goes hunting quite alot (read last chapters) and collects power base with allies since its what is most important for gaining strength in that world. She loses control quite often due to teenage hormones and her magical affinites but at the same time plays people quite well while gathering social power.

Anyways, its that kind of realism instead of "kill everything with how cool you are" stories that made me like Metaworld.

**** My favorite, next to MOL. I only mentioned How to avoid death because its a bit darker.

Its not Worm in its worldbuilding, but its pretty entertaining. I mentioned it because its litRpg like Worth the candle, and it doesn't have wish fullfilment or harem. Its not rational, main character is emotional but its well writen and updated often.

I read daily grind as well, but updates are rare.

**** Metaworld is pretty fun, I wouldn't go as far as to call it realistic or rational, but it's Hella fun. The world building and characters are it's strength, the plot being a bit iffy at moments.

Though I get to enjoy it as an Australian, as the MC is Australian and more than half the series so far is based in Australia it gave me some enjoyment to see my culture highlighted a bit. Not sure how well that would transfer.
