** Well, this is certainly a twist.

I mean, Ray was useful, but a Mama-in-training? She's likely to have extensive knowledge of the outside world. With this in mind, what good would William Minerva be? His first warnings pertained only to things that were already known, so any help from him was going to be outside intel. With Krone in the mix... It is 2045 after all. Maybe she doesn't know much about how the world got to where it is, leaving gaps that Minerva can still fill?

*** There's always the chance that Krone is just pretending to help them to lower their guard (so she can hatch whatever plot she has going on later). It's common for manga authors to end on cliffhangers, so it's possible this isn't an actual solicitation of an alliance?

**** That really wouldn't change anything. Even if she ultimately betrays them, she'll be expected to share intel in the meantime. Said intel would, I thought at a first glance, surely be more comprehensive than anything in Minerva's books.

***** What if she lies to them? It doesn't matter what she shares if it's not true.

****** Huh. I didn't think of that.

Now that you mention it, perhaps a discrepancy between Minerva's books and Krone's story could reveal her treacherous intent, creating a situation where, uh, let's see here...

Mama knows about the kids, but not about Ray. The kids know about themselves, Ray, and that mama knows about them, and that she doesn't know about Ray. Krone knows about the kids, and about Ray, and about Mama knowing about the kids, but not about Mama not knowing about Ray. The kids know that Krone knows about Ray, and that she doesn't know about Mama not knowing about ray. Krone intends to betray the kids, the kids know she intends to betray them, but Krone doesn't know the kids know.

These knowledge-maps get longer every chapter.

*** ...except that we don't know how good Krone is of a liar, and information gained from her could be actively detrimental. After all, if all she wants is goodwill of her bosses, it would be pretty great to make Mama seem incompetent and then /also/ deliver the "missing" children. As long as she's even fairly intelligent (and, given this manga, it's dangerous to assume the opposite) then she's much more of a liability than an asset.

**** That possibility didn't occur to me. Somehow. (More elaboration [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5hw429/rt_the_promised_neverland_019/db46xtk/][here]])

**** Re: her intelligence, we know she's at least smart enough to have consistently gotten perfect test scores during her own stint as a farm child. Granted, we don't know what kinds of intelligence those tests measure.

** Now they have a problem,and their ability to take advantage from this situation is impaired because they dont know krone's motives(at least Ray will ensure they dont become so crazy to trust her) .The good news is that she is probably going to give them some intel ,even if she is going to lie to them about the world outside she probably won't be carefully enough to avoid giving them at least some info accidentally or even some that she does't consider .She probably wants them to escape to catch them herself and become the new mama that way .
