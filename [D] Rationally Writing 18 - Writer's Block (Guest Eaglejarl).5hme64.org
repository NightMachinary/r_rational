** Special thanks to [[/u/Eaglejarl]] for joining us to discuss the dreaded writer's block, including ways to avoid and get through it!

We're planning other guest episodes in the future, so if you're a rational writer and I haven't reached out to you, send me a message if you're interested in joining us sometime!

** Somehow, I was unaware of this podcast's existence until now. (I think I might have accidentally conflated it with 'The Bayesian Conspiracy'.) But I've just added it to my subscription list, and downloaded the backlog to listen through in order.

I've finished at least one story I meant to be RatFic, am currently pushing forward on another, cancelled one, have another on temporary hiatus, and have yet another in the plotting stage... so I /think/ I could count as a 'rational writer'. Depending on one's definitions. That said, I tend to do poorly with live text-chats, let alone voice; but if you want to exchange some asynchronous text-based emails (I'm DataPacRat at gmail), or the equivalent, some portion of which would get read on your show, I wouldn't object.

*** I'm hoping to do a "questions/comments from the audience" episode at some point, or maybe just a "followup" section in each episode, so I definitely don't mind including some comments from you when the topic is appropriate :)

** I think one of the most common forms of "writer's block" comes about when a person has an idea for a story, but lacks the confidence to execute it. They become attached to an idea that they've built up in their mind, and they're afraid that once they begin writing, the story that manifests in their word processor won't be as good as the version of the story that existed in their head. So rather than actually writing the story and risk tainting hypothetical perfection, they continue to fantasize about it.

This is how you sometimes wind up with people who have been "working on" a novel for months or even years, but never even written a single page of prose. In the end, you just have to be willing to write that imperfect first draft.

*** Thanks for bringing this up! I think it's more of an issue for newer writers, but agree completely that pushing past one's fears and insecurities about how a story will come out is an important part of a lot of writer's journeys. I wish I'd remembered to at least mention it, but am glad someone did :)
