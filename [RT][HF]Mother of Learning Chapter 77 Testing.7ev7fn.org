** *Soap Bubbles*

I'm beginning to think that the "primordial prisons" aren't really pocket dimensions containing primordials, but rather the primordials themselves. The primordials that previously roamed the world were just physical projections of pocket dimensions--say, a soap bubble within a soap bubble. Banishing the primordials was the equivalent of pushing the interior soap bubble to the exterior--which is possible because the bubbles share a common film (i.e., the primordials are the spawn of the world dragon). This is what made the primordials impossible to defeat. Popping a sub-bubble risks popping the larger one; destroying a primordial could compromise the world dragon. Very interesting.

*Sovereign Gate Theory*

I would like to conjecture a little on the nature of the Sovereign Gate--namely, why it was inactive for all those years. I don't think that the SG is a single primordial, but rather a tool that taps into them. If the SG is near a primordial during the planetary alignment, it taps into that primordial to simulate the world for the controller. The SG functioned normally when it was located in the Xlotic--the former seat of the Ikosian empire--because it was kept near the Golden-Feathered Worm. It's been inactive for the past few cycles because the Ikosians /left/ the Xlotic, and the imperial family / Novedas were unaware that this would affect the SG's function. Luckily, before the current cycle, Zach's guardian donated the SG to the time magic research facility--which just so happens to be located next to Panaxeth's prison, triggering the time loop. To explain it in metaphor: rather than a full computer running the simulation, the SG is more like an OS for the simulation that runs from a USB drive. It was pulled out of one computer (the Xlotic primordial) when the Ikosians migrated. Zach's guardian accidentally plugged it into a new one (Panaxeth).

** Time to talk about my pet theory. I think red robes may have help optimize the assault on the primordial prisons because he needed them to succeed in breaking the primordial out so he could escape the loop.

It seems that red robes put a lot of resources for a ton of loops into making the invasion go down perfectly. Maybe he just really wanted to help them out or thought it was funny or something, but especially with what we learn this chapter and the reaction when they mentioned breaking one out. I think it's much more likely that he needed to.

*** The beneficial thing about that, if Z&Z can confirm it, is that RR will be immediately outside the prison door. The whole of the time loop only takes a short amount of time in the real world. Seconds, likely. So RR wouldn't have time to go anywhere, and he won't be expecting Z&Z. So when they exit the time loop, presuming Zorian is combat ready upon leaving, they can teleport to the Hole and take out RR. Or Zach could do it alone, because he's probably the best combat mage alive, and RR can't compensate.

The gate is built to keep things separate, and the only way it has to get people out is to shuffle souls. But if you can make an actual doorway through to the real world, then walking out means that you appear on the other side of that door. There are then two copies of you as well.

** Theory: QI, being as old as he is, is aware of the Sovereign Gate and upon approaching the period when the gate can be opened sets up the groundwork for an invasion. Upon discovering that he is in the loop (through similar techniques to Silverlake) he starts the invasion in order to use the primordial as a bridge and get to the real universe. Assuming this is true, it's plausible that, what with RR helping the invasion and ZZ being absent in various restarts, that QI has succeeded in this many times and that on the other side of the prison there is an army of QI/RR clones waiting.

Bonus theory: the primordial they are inside is the one imprisoned beneath the city. The prison door looks the same but from another perspective, perhaps this is because they're inside the prison looking at the other side of the door. Silverlake remarks that there are no guards, because the Sovereign Gate can't create them, or because the guards are on the other side of the door?

Actually, I would argue that his observed behavior suggests he /doesn't/ know about the loop, or he would have dealt with Zach differently (eg capturing and studying instead of simply assaulting his soul).
- If they were inside the primordial's prison, it would kill them all. And Zorian has seen the primordial breaking out of its prison into the loop world.

**** I was thinking that he would be setting up an invasion in anticipation of the gate being used because he had prior knowledge of the gate; only going through with the plan after confirming being in the loop.

After sleeping on it I have to admit this doesn't seem very likely, although i do think it's awfully convenient that the invasion coincides with the loop. Either the loop was started because of the invasion or the invasion is started because they are in the loop, which is plausible if QI can detect whether they are in a loop or not and if he can either mobilise the invasion within a month or if he was already preparing the invasion and just needs to say the word go.

Wild theory #3: QI is aware of the sovereign gate and assumes the loop will start a month later as it was supposed to. To this end he endeavours to release a primordial in order to end the loop on day one, sabotaging the loop and preventing people from gaining ridiculous amounts of power. If i remember correctly QI is the oldest named entity im the story barring gods and primordials, if anyone would have prior knowledge of the gate surely it'd be him

More likely, in my opinion, is that a bridge to every primordial but the one that holds them is created. The link to that primordial is possibly the Sovereign Gate, acting as a sort of entrance built into the primordial's mutilated body.

As for Silverlake, I suspect she would have to do something that mimics a primordial's prison, such that the loop mistakes her dimension for one as well and skips over destroying it. The problem is that won't be part of the original blueprint - so she'll either need to bridge the gap back herself, or more likely get Zach and Zorian to do it.

As you can see above, mind-shattering is paraphrasing the way the author described the primordial. It can induce madness and insanity upon individuals therefore it can shatter minds ergo mind-shattering. I never implied that the geometries the entity existed in were the cause of the madness or insanity.

Also, if you want to be pedantic, I never said it broke geometry. I just said it used non-conventional geometries. Nothing about it being non-conventional equates to it breaking geometry. Even within conventional geometries there are objects and surfaces that fold in on themselves (e.g. Klein bottles).

Secondly, you act as if using associations to other similar entities is a bad thing. It is both natural and normal for authors to use allusions to other constructs in literature to convey feeling and tone. This is an obvious allusion to Cthulhu and other cosmic entities. While not all of the cosmic entities are non-conventional, most of them do follow non-conventional geometries.

Also if you note what I wrote, I used the word expect, which implies using context and clues to extrapolate a data point which you might not know. In this case, I asked if you expected it to follow conventional geometries. So, using meta-knowledge of the author's allusion and information from the text ("[...] Golden-Feathered Worm was very dimensionally[sic] complex [...]"), it is normal to assume that it will not follow conventional geometries.

Also, we're referring to the primordial beneath Cyoria, not the Golden-Feathered Worm. If we're talking about allusions from the text, specifying dimensional complexity and the Golden-Feathered Worm makes it sound like a unique trait.

Add to that that Silverlake is quite right that the easiest and simplest thing would be just not to copy any of the prisons. So why did they?

So yeah I admit a hand broke out of the prison, but that didn't mean the whole body would be able to. Even if the you're right and a full summoning could be completed without waiting for the planar alignment, there are several things that wouldn't make sense and explanations that could shed light on the cult's actions.

Why wait for the day of the planar alignment if it wasn't important? There were literally centuries of other days a primordial could be summoned.

It is possible that the energy required to summon the primordial was lessened due to the fact that the time loop is taking place inside the primordial itself, therefore reducing the energy requirement below the estimated threshold.

It is also possible that the Cult of the Dragon Below has the best shot at controlling the primordial with their own magics at the height of the planar alignment when magic is at it's strongest.

Highly impractical without careful planning that the time loop makes impossible.

**** Silverlake is consistently shrewd, suspicious, greedy, and unfriendly. Only time she's been somewhat nice is when she says that she'd teach Kana. Even in the last chapter she attacked them, when she KNEW that they are powerful enough to have brought down a grey hunter. She seems to be in the mindset of attack now, ask questions later. Even after getting smacked down last chapter, she's still willing to spy on them overtly and get her contacts to spy on them when her own efforts failed.

They'll have to fight Silverlake eventually, if only to beat her down. She's too greedy to make a good capitalist. You know you gotta at least promise trickle down.

** Interesting info about familiars being able to shape shift. Possible RR is Zach's familiar gone rogue. RR was described as freakishly strong I think, which this could explain. Soul bond between them might help with marker transmission/alteration. Would need to be a smart creature, but surely lots of those about. Perhaps a dragon?

Also not clear how SG would deal with soul bonded controller; its not possible to preserve controller's soul but reset that of bonded soul.
