This has to have direct combat applications, no "improve hygeine", you have to be able to craft one of whatever you're demonstrating and sell a medieval lord on it's usefulness. Any answer other than gunpowder. He gives you a month's access to his resources.


** Stirrups, as previously mentioned, took a surprisingly long time to become commonplace. Trebuchets and catapults and other siege weaponry, if before their invention/introduction.

I know a bit about steelmaking, metallurgy, and materials; superior blades may be possible, but I doubt that I'd have time to get a significant enough improvement to a local blacksmith inside of a single month to impress significantly - lacking all scientific instruments and books about cooling curves and phase diagrams of steel and working solely from memory of martensite and pearlite and so forth, I doubt my skill would be sufficient to make something truly impressive with no modern tools or equipment and no books, in a single month. Modern metallurgy is significantly more advanced than medieval metallurgy, but getting it working in time seems unlikely.

If I happened to be lucky enough to have an alchemist or other guy who knew how to make to make aqua fortis (nitric acid), I could quite conceivably make nitrocellulose (guncotton) to work around the gunpowder restriction? This feels like cheating; also, not entirely sure how to make aqua fortis ab initio myself, so likely to be screwed by the starting conditions - and furthermore I'd like as not blow myself up.

If the medieval lord was allowing us to abandon whatever notions of chivalry, honor, etc. most concern him, a ghillie suit might be possible and a little useful for skirmishers and guerrilla warfare.

If in an era that prizes cavalry, perhaps invent the pike formation? If in one that prizes men at arms in pike formations, well, I don't think introducing and training in longbow use is practical in the time allotted, and probably wouldn't be a real new invention?

I could conceivably introduce improved armor - it took a long time to get to full plate armor in reality, and that stuff would be pretty useful. That said, as a non-blacksmith trying to teach blacksmiths how to make something I've never worn or had personal experience with this seems... unlikely to work out well.

/There's nothing really revolutionary left/. Let me go down the list of technologies that have /actually/ revolutionized military doctrine (that is, /actually/ let people win wars):

- Gunpowder: out.
- Longbow: irreducible crafting time >10 years (seasoned wood, training).
- General staff: no way in hell am I going to be able to convince a lord to give up direct control over his unit.
- Hygiene: out.
- Railroad: no direct combat applications.
- Radio: useless without general staff.
- Internal combustion engine: can't craft that in a month.
- Precision machining techniques: no direct combat applications.

If you're willing to let me cheat, then I'm going to skate by on a technicality: gunpowder already exists, I just need to make it practical!

- Built-up and wire-wrapped barrel constructions
- Rifling bench
- Shells, sabots
- Mortars
- Leadscrews
- Ballistics mathematics
- Surveying equipment/techniques
- Field and split carriages
- Powder bags
- Interrupted-screw breech blocks
- Time fuzes
- Minie ball, wadding
- Brass cartridges
- Bolt action
- Mercury fulminate percussion caps
- Use of ceramics or lead in powder mills so you can use ball mills or edge mills instead of mortar and pestle which in turn means your powder is way more consistent and reliable

Oh.

Well, in that case I have to cheat with Wikipedia (if I'm just using my native knowledge, I'm boned, since I couldn't do much more than teach math and logic). However, if I'm allowed to prepare some knowledge ahead of time:

- If it's early enough, the *stirrup* apparently allows a cavalry to hit a lot harder from horseback. *Horseshoes* allow travel over rocky terrain. The *horse collar* allows for the use of draught horses, which can travel faster than oxen, meaning better supply lines. These all fall under the general heading of "cavalry".

- I think I might be able to figure out how an *astrolabe* works, and maybe how to build one. This is general navigation, so maybe falls outside the bounds of "direct combat", but I have a hard time imagining that a medieval general wouldn't see the naval applications. Same with some ship-building techniques that I might be able to learn up on and present.

- In the sphere of *architecture* I might be able to offer some advice on better building techniques in order to improve castle defenses, or point out methods of siege assault. But that's not my area of expertise either.

But again, that's me cheating with Wikipedia, and I almost certainly wouldn't be able to even /instruct/ someone to craft any of those things without a week of study (ideally in the modern world). I'm hoping this answer is still better than just saying, "Nope, I'm fucked".

***** You know how armies have things like squads and battalions and lieutenants and captains and generals? That's the general staff. You have units, which are directly commanded by low-grade officers that are coordinated by higher-grade officers up to the Person In Charge. Every officer know what's going on at their level and the level above and - critically - has enough power and permission to make decisions that they can move their troops around to cover problem spots or take advantages when they see them. That's huge. That means that your Person In Charge doesn't have to worry about giving orders to 100-person blocks of soldiers and can concentrate on their strategy and ordering around tens of thousands of guys at a time. That means that decisions like "pincer now" can be made by a person closer to the action, which means those decisions will be more accurate and generally better. That means that individual soldiers have someone that they can trust to know what's going on and that can recover the situation when things start going badly, which is a huge morale boost.

Part of the reason the Romans were so dominant, militarily, is because they had this working. Centuries, Cohorts, Legions. They could delegate because they had a professional military and trained special-purpose officers and could trust each other.

Feudal lords couldn't delegate because there wasn't enough trust going around for it to work. Lords couldn't be trusted to handle maneuvers because they'd either screw them up or abandon the plan in a glorious charge or just plain backstab their king or the lord next door. Soldiers were conscripts or militia and couldn't be convinced to follow orders except from the single person on the field with the highest rank. As a result, the size of your army was basically limited by how loud your king could shout. Anything larger would dissolve into chaos because people weren't getting orders they could trust.

******* The Romans maintained a permanent, professional army. Roman legionaries enlisted for 25 years of service and were highly trained. Centurions were generally promoted from the ranks after several years of service and were required to be literate. Only the very highest ranks were political appointments; the rest were merit promotions up a hierarchy, commanding successively more important centuries and cohorts. Roman soldiers often spent decades fighting with the same comrades and officers. Furthermore, the permanent position meant that Roman soldiers could drill and practice and confer institutional knowledge, which meant they could actually do things like "produce and refine an infantry doctrine over the course of generations and practice it until every legionary knew it". [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_infantry_tactics][That infantry doctrine itself was /damn/ impressive]]. I can't really summarize it, but it depended heavily on the soldiers executing it trusting each other to cover weaknesses and to step in at the right time or switch out at the right time. Lots of well-ordered rotations, lots of shield-your-buddy-while-he-stabs, lots of "hold here and wait for the flank to pincer".

Long term: Crop rotation techniques. Even simple 4 field crop rotation techniques increase the per-acre yield about 100% over early medieval farming techniques. Peasants who produce twice as much grain can afford to pay twice as many taxes. A lord with twice as much money per-acre is going to have a very easy time raising an army to fight his wars. Coffers win wars, when it comes down to it, though there are exceptions to any rule.

***** Because pre-1900 wars were very long-drawn, with all the movement on foot and transport convoys to supply the army.

Because of the slow physical movement of the army, even information on horseback was quicker than the progression of the war. That led to early warning systems that allowed opposing kingdoms to prepare their own armies and counter the attack. If the attacked kingdom had an information advantage, and the attacker didn't know that they were prepared, they could even ambush back.

That meant that a large part of the war was always an information war. You could pretend to be an allied army and "agree" on an attack timing and location. You could pretend to be an enemy spy and send false messages, leading the enemy's army to prepare an ambush on your fake location, leaving it vulnerable to your real ambush. Without proper encryption, every message could have been forged by the enemy. That's why encryption was used at least as early as ancient Rome. But encryption in those days was more obfuscation and could be broken or detected easily. Asymmetric encryption as of today can be carried in plain sight and can still not be cracked.

The 'tank's shell will also protect its underbelly (one can only exit the tank when the door is unlocked by those within). Each 'tank' would fit 4-6 longbowmen (very cramped) and have a thousand arrows stockpiled (very very cramped). And yes, this would cost a /lot/ of metal.

Basically an invulnerable mobile tower at ground level, from which longbowmen could mow down enemy soldiers - even the most well-protected ones without putting themselves in any risk. Given how well protected they would be and the fact that longbowmen could fire shots extremely quickly, a line of such tanks along the front line could be both devastating and demoralizing.

Measure the distance between two of them, and the angles of the triangle, and you can determine the distance between the others even if the terrain is awful. Measure the corners of a triangle which has one side in common with the previous triangle, and you know the two new sides as well. Continue and you can map an entire subcontinent quite rapidly and accurately (inaccuracy builds up as you move further from the original triangle, so measure some of the other distances manually again to compensate).
