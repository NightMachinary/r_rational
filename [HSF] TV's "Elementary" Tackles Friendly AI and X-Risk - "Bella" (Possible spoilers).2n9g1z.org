** I've been meaning to get into that show. This might just be the push I needed. :) thanks!

*** I've been binge-watching it over the last few days - I'm about halfway through the first season now.

It suffers a lot from the same old Sherlock Holmes problem of clues being cobbled together in ways that the viewer couldn't possibly have predicted, but other than that it's pretty good, especially for a show that's putting out 20+ episodes a year. I wouldn't say that it's in the running for my favorite show ever, but I like it.

Edit: It's also got that annoying thing that /every/ procedural besides (sometimes) /Law & Order/ has where the criminal will confess and the case will be declared solved on sometimes very slim evidence. I saw an episode last night where all of the evidence was completely circumstantial and there was no way that they'd be able to get a conviction, but the show treated it like a slam dunk. But I get that they do this for the sake of narrative speed - real criminal convictions take a long time, and there are appeals, and battles over evidence.

**** Honestly, I think it would actually be sort of hilarious if they actually had a police procedural where they stuck to the actual facts and disappointed audiences with /not solving/ fully 1/3rd of the murders they are presented with, and having a big portion of the ones they do solve be of the 'person standing over the body with a bloody knife saying, "He shouldn't have said what he did!", with multiple witnesses and camera evidence' sort. Maybe even have a lot of witnesses in compromising circumstances refuse to talk to police and demand a lawyer. It would make horrific TV, possibly, but honestly might be more interesting than the formulaic stuff they seem to be producing currently...

** Oh man, I'm watching this episode tonight with friends and I'm really damn excited now!

In more general context: I've been saying since mid-season 2 that this is the best science fiction show on television today. With the possible exception of Orphan Black, which I haven't seen (yet).

** I watched this and thought they handled it really hamhanded/cringeworthy way. It was definitely just included for dramatic purposes.

*** What exactly did you not like about it? I just watched it and my feelings were a little different. I thought that:

- they stated the argument straightforwardly and without excessively ridicule...
- although they didn't supply the FOOM contingency, which makes the idea vastly less believable.
- There was, at least for a bit, the possibility [[#s][that]]
- They never explicitly talked about Sherlock's findings on Bella, but it's pretty clear from implication that he found her impossible to disprove. He made a point of saying that they had to call her "it", but then promptly slipped and called her "she." He remained engaged with her throughout the entire show; even at the very end, he was telling the company that he needed a couple more hours. The very last moment of the show was him asking her a question, getting an answer that is rather chilling by [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror][FridgeHorror]] and giving us a split-second reaction to it just as we fade to black.
