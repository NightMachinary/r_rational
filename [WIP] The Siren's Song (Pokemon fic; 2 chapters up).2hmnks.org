** So, I'm new here. I'm not entirely sure if this fic is considered rational of rationalist, but I read the sidebar, and my story definitely incorporates a lot of elements of rational fiction. The world-building, for example, is grounded in reality. Other aspects of the story are less rational to the point that they might not even be rational at all.

Anyway, let me know what you think. If the story doesn't fit this subreddit, tell me and I'll delete the post. Thanks for helping! Let me know what you think of it.
