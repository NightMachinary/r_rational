** What was that about with the AI translator glitching when retrieving search terms to do with AI?

*** It's too bad, because the translation AI seemed to be aware that it was translating to a dead language used exclusively by a dead species.

*** I think it was glitching when trying to translate a document about translation, rather than the issue being about AI itself.

From a computer programmer's perspective, the repeating sound is reminiscent of the contents of an audio ring buffer being replayed because the data source has failed to update the contents of the buffer in a timely manner.

Perhaps it got caught in a recursive loop trying to analyze the meaning of the content (in order to synthesize that meaning into the target language), which might have discussed the implementation of how the translator worked -- in particular, if it contained an example of a case that caused a lot of trouble for translators during development, perhaps it might even be trying to analyze something that could never reach a conclusion

**** Okay that's interesting to know, but why would the author have that little bit happen in the beginning? From a story telling perspective, there's no reason include it.

***** It's completely relevant -- consider that a search for information about artificial Beings came up with an article about translation. (For a definition: an earlier short in this series noted that humans are the only Beings that evolved on Earth.) In other words, the translation notes are the best documentation that the search engine can find to discuss the existence of artificial Beings. The implication here, which is left just barely unstated enough to make you think about it instead of just hitting you upside the head with it, is that the translator AI is potentially a Being in itself. And when that Being was asked to reason about itself, it got stuck.

Which, of course, could actually be the answer to the question -- why aren't there any artificial Beings? Because they blow up whenever they become self-aware. (EDIT: Or possibly, that they're murdered when they achieve it, as hinted at by the "rebooting" line.)

****** You're on the right track. I wrote a larger explanation, but I don't want to spoil anything.

****** Oooooh! Thanks so much for explaining that. I got that the AI was glitching on documents relating to translation and about AI, but I didn't quite understand why the glitch would occur. Thanks!
