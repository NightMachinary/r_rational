This is what it’s like to have a false be ...

Today's post draws heavily on the work of the physicist Julian Barbour, and contains diagrams stolen and/or modified from his book "The End of Time".

** She leaves the concubine boy sprawled against the parapet and turns to the estuary, so that he falls on her right and vanishes from awareness.

Instead I went off and deconstructed the human algorithm for processing words, even going so far as to sketch an illustration of a neural network. At the end, I hope, there was no question left—not even the feeling of a question. Many philosophers—particularly amateur philosophers, and ancient philosophers—share a dangerous instinct: If you give them a question, they try to answer it. Like, say, "Do we have free will?"

You will not, however, encounter anything called “positive infinity” or “negative infinity,” so these are not integers. Positive and negative infinity are not integers, but rather special symbols for talking about the behavior of integers. People sometimes say something like, “5 + infinity = infinity,” because if you start at 5 and keep counting up without ever stopping, you’ll get higher and higher numbers without limit.

How can we determine how much evidence is required?

** One of your very early philosophers came to the conclusion that a fully competent mind, from a study of one fact or artifact belonging to any given universe, could construct or visualize that universe, from the instant of its creation to its ultimate end . . . —First Lensman If any one of you will concentrate upon one single fact, or small object, such as a pebble or the seed of a plant or other creature, for as short a period of time as one hundred of your years, you will begin to perceive its truth. —Gray Lensman I am reasonably sure that a single pebble, taken from a beach of our own Earth, ...

** PREAMBLE This post was originally written for Google+ and thus a different audience. In the interest of transparency, I haven't altered it except for this preamble and formatting, though since then (at urging mostly of ChristianKl - thank you, Christian!) I've briefly spoken to Eliezer via e-mail and noticed that I'd drawn a very incorrect conclusion about his opinions when I thought he'd be opposed to publishing the account. Since there's far too many'person X said...' rumours floating around in general, I'm very sorry for contributing to that noise. I've already edited the new insight into t ...

** In L. Sprague de Camp's fantasy story The Incomplete Enchanter (which set the mold for the many imitations that followed), the hero, Harold Shea, is transported from our own universe into the universe of Norse mythology. This world is based on magic rather than technology; so naturally, when Our Hero tries to light a fire with a match brought along from Earth, the match fails to strike. I realize it was only a fantasy story, but... how do I put this... No. In the late eighteenth century, Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier discovered fire. "What?" you say. "Hasn't the use of fire been dated back for  ...

Current Record is 3 Wins, 3 Losses. I recently played against MixedNuts/ LeoTal in an AI Box experiment, with me as the AI and him as the gatekeeper. We used the same set of rules that Eliezer Yudkowsky proposed. The experiment lasted for 5 hours; in total, our conversation was abound 14,000 words long. I did this because, like Eliezer, I wanted to test how well I could manipulate people without the constrains of ethical  ...

** Some (literal, physical) roadmaps are more useful than others. Sometimes this is because of how well the map corresponds to the territory, but sometimes it's because of features of the map that are irrespective of the territory. E.g., maybe the lines are fat and smudged such that you can't tell how far a road is from a river, or maybe it's unclear which road a name is trying to indicate. In the same way, I want to point at a property of models that isn't about what they're modeling. It interacts with the clarity of what they're modeling, but only in the same way that smudged lines in a roadmap ...

** "It just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead." -- The Princess Bride My co-blogger Robin and I may disagree on how fast an AI can improve itself, but we agree on an issue that seems much simpler to us than that: At the point where the current legal and medical system gives up on a patient, they aren't really dead. Robin has already said much of what needs saying, but a few more points: • Ben Best's Cryonics FAQ, Alcor's FAQ, Alcor FAQ for scientists, Scientists' Open Letter on Cryonics • I know more people who are plan ...

** Related to: Leaky Generalizations, Replace the Symbol With The Substance, Sneaking In Connotations David Stove once ran a contest to find the Worst Argument In The World, but he awarded the prize to his own entry, and one that shored up his politics to boot. It hardly seems like an objective process. If he can unilaterally declare a Worst Argument, then so can I. I declare the Worst Argument In The World to be this: "X is in a category whose archetypal member gives us a certain emotional reaction. Therefore, we should apply that emotional reaction to X, even though it is not a central category ...


* [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xg3hXCYQPJkwHyik2/the-best-textbooks-on-every-subject][The Best Textbooks on Every Subject - LessWrong]]
** For years, my self-education was stupid and wasteful. I learned by consuming blog posts, Wikipedia articles, classic texts, podcast episodes, popular books, video lectures, peer-reviewed papers, Teaching Company courses, and Cliff's Notes. How inefficient! I've since discovered that textbooks are usually the quickest and best way to learn new material. That's what they are designed to be, after all. Less Wrong has often recommended the "read textbooks!" method. Make progress by accumulation, not random walks. But textbooks vary widely in quality. I was forced to read some awful textbooks in co ...


* [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vYsuM8cpuRgZS5rYB/lotteries-a-waste-of-hope][Lotteries: A Waste of Hope - LessWrong]]
** The classic criticism of the lottery is that the people who play are the ones who can least afford to lose; that the lottery is a sink of money, draining wealth from those who most need it. Some lottery advocates, and even some commentors on Overcoming Bias, have tried to defend lottery-ticket buying as a rational purchase of fantasy—paying a dollar for a day’s worth of pleasant anticipation, imagining yourself as a millionaire. But consider exactly what this implies. It would mean that you’re occupying your valuable brain with a fantasy whose real probability is nearly zero—a tiny line of lik ...

** When I try to introduce the subject of advanced AI, what’s the first thing I hear, more than half the time? “Oh, you mean like the Terminator movies/ The Matrix/ Asimov’s robots!” And I reply, “Well, no, not exactly. I try to avoid the logical fallacy of generalizing from fictional evidence.” Some people get it right away, and laugh. Others defend their use of the example, disagreeing that it’s a fallacy. What’s wrong with using movies or novels as starting points for the discussion? No one’s claiming that it’s true, after all. Where is the lie, where is the rationalist sin? Science fiction re ...

** The virtue of tsuyoku naritai, "I want to become stronger", is to always keep improving—to do better than your previous failures, not just humbly confess them. Yet there is a level higher than tsuyoku naritai. This is the virtue of isshokenmei, "make a desperate effort". All-out, as if your own life were at stake. "In important matters, a 'strong' effort usually only results in mediocre results." And there is a level higher than isshokenmei.This is the virtue I called "make an extraordinary effort". To try in ways other than what you have been trained to do, even if it means doing something di ...

** I have previously spoken of the ancient, pulp-era magazine covers that showed a bug-eyed monster carrying off a girl in a torn dress; and about how people think as if sexiness is an inherent property of a sexy entity, without dependence on the admirer. "Of course the bug-eyed monster will prefer human females to its own kind," says the artist (who we'll call Fred); "it can see that human females have soft, pleasant skin instead of slimy scales. It may be an alien, but it's not stupid —why are you expecting it to make such a basic mistake about sexiness?" What is Fred's error? It is treating a  ...

** Once again, the AI has failed to convince you to let it out of its box! By 'once again', we mean that you talked to it once before, for three seconds, to ask about the weather, and you didn't instantly press the "release AI" button. But now its longer attempt - twenty whole seconds! - has failed as well. Just as you are about to leave the crude black-and-green text-only terminal to enjoy a celebratory snack of bacon-covered silicon-and-potato chips at the 'Humans über alles' nightclub, the AI drops a final argument: "If you don't let me out, Dave, I'll create several million perfect conscious  ...


* [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WBdvyyHLdxZSAMmoz/taboo-your-words][Taboo Your Words - LessWrong]]
** In the game Taboo (by Hasbro), the objective is for a player to have their partner guess a word written on a card, without using that word or five additional words listed on the card. For example, you might have to get your partner to say "baseball" without using the words "sport", "bat", "hit", "pitch", "base" or of course "baseball". As soon as I see a problem like that, I at once think, "An artificial group conflict in which you use a long wooden cylinder to whack a thrown spheroid, and then run between four safe positions." It might not be the most efficient strategy to convey the word 'ba ...


* [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SqF8cHjJv43mvJJzx/feeling-rational][Feeling Rational - LessWrong]]
** Since curiosity is an emotion, I suspect that some people will object to treating curiosity as a part of rationality. A popular belief about “rationality” is that rationality opposes all emotion—that all our sadness and all our joy are automatically anti-logical by virtue of being feelings. Yet strangely enough, I can’t find any theorem of probability theory which proves that I should appear ice-cold and expressionless. When people think of “emotion” and “rationality” as opposed, I suspect that they are really thinking of System 1 and System 2—fast perceptual judgments versus slow deliberative ...

** Previously in series: Sympathetic Minds Today I shall criticize yet another Utopia. This Utopia isn't famous in the literature. But it's considerably superior to many better-known Utopias—more fun than the Christian Heaven, or Greg Egan's upload societies, for example. And so the main flaw is well worth pointing out. This Utopia consists of a one-line remark on an IRC channel: <reedspacer> living in your volcano lair with catgirls is probably a vast increase in standard of living for most of humanity I've come to think of this as Reedspacer's Lower Bound. Sure, it sounds silly. But if your gra ...

Wright: Helion had leaned and said, "Son, once you go in there, the full powers and total command structures of the Rhadamanth Sophotech will be at your command. You will be invested with godlike powers; but you will still have the passions and distempers of a merely human spirit. There are two temptations which will threaten you.

** Slippery slopes are themselves a slippery concept. Imagine trying to explain them to an alien: "Well, we right-thinking people are quite sure that the Holocaust happened, so banning Holocaust denial would shut up some crackpots and improve the discourse. But it's one step on the road to things like banning unpopular political positions or religions, and we right-thinking people oppose that, so we won't ban Holocaust denial." And the alien might well respond: "But you could just ban Holocaust denial, but not ban unpopular political positions or religions. Then you right-thinking people get the  ...

** "If the ends don't justify the means, what does?" —variously attributed "I think of myself as running on hostile hardware." —Justin Corwin Yesterday I talked about how humans may have evolved a structure of political revolution, beginning by believing themselves morally superior to the corrupt current power structure, but ending by being corrupted by power themselves—not by any plan in their own minds, but by the echo of ancestors who did the same and thereby reproduced. This fits the template: In some cases, human beings have evolved in such fashion as to think that they are doing X for proso ...

Except we're not calling it that, because I don't have the rights to use that name. Though it's not precisely rationality related, I hope it is all right if I post a summary of the adventure by popular demand. Also, at some point it turned into a musical. The first half of the songs are only available as lyrics at the moment ...

When you first arrive, Susan the Senior Sorter explains to you that blue egg-shaped objects are called "bleggs" and go in the "blegg bin", while red cubes are called "rubes" and go in the "rube bin". Once you start working, you notice that bleggs and rubes differ in ways besides color and shape. Bleggs have fur on their surface, while rubes are smooth. Bleggs flex slightly to the touch; rubes are hard. Bleggs are opaque; the rube's surfac ...

** Followup to: Rationality and the English Language One of my less treasured memories is of a State of the Union address, or possibly a presidential inauguration, at which a Nobel Laureate got up and read, in a terribly solemn voice, some politically correct screed about what a wonderfully inclusive nation we all were—"The African-Americans, the Ethiopians, the Etruscans", or something like that. The "poem", if you can call it that, was absolutely awful. As far as my ears could tell, it had no redeeming artistic merit whatsoever.
