Anyone up for beta reading a 2,000 word section of S.I.?

I've just finished putting together an initial draft of Bunny pontificating about the ideas discussed in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2g09xh/bstqrsthsf_factchecking_some_quantum_math/]] . I could really use some feedback to make sure I'm having her explain them in a way that's actually comprehensible to the reader. Anyone who'd like to help me with this, I've pasted the initial draft to a GoogleDoc at [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lOQAAM3fdnF2ew7CgBQqSLtk21_4Foa8n7IB3Ay0ze8/edit?usp=sharing]] , which is set to allow comments.


** Off topic, but are you just trying to use as many tags as possible in the title? Heh.

*** I'm not /trying/ to maximize my tag usage; I just figure I might as well make it as easy as possible for someone searching this subreddit a couple of years from now.

** My main problem with this is not anything with the way it's explained but that the entire argument is fragile, and dependent on dubious notions of quantum immortality and antropics. I'm added some suggestions how to help it a bit, but it needs more unless you already have some cause in mind.
