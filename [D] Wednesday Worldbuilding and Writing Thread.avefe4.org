Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** Humans all have a subsconcious psychic power that allows them to manipulate reality in a way that corresponds to the memetic strength of an belief. Any single human only have so much power but power can be consolidated by multiple people believing in similar ideas. As you can imagine that led to all sorts of chaos so you and a few other brave souls took up the mantle and formed a hidden conspiracy, largely successfully. You have put limiters on people's power, leaving them with only a small part of their usual power. Not enough that any individual could pose a threat but enough that you can harvest that power through memetic engineering.

Now a new wave of big baddies are threatening Earth and you can't handle it without removing many of the limiters put in place. History shows that it's a very bad idea just to remove the limiters without shaping the beliefs about what the unlimited can do with their power. All sorts of nasty surprises unfold - just have a look at ‘mythology'. So your merry cabal comes up with the brilliant idea to put people into superadvanced VR simulations(TM), with the goal of eventually removing the limiters and allow your subjects to use their class levels from the game in the real world.

The biggest challenge is to make people strongly believe subconsciously that the VR world is real and make the abilities from their class levels second nature. You also want to train them to complete the ‘quests' that you give them to in a roundabout way make them subservient to you. What systems would you implement to reach those goals? How would you shape the VR world to make it easier to accept it as real?

*** This is a brilliant justifcation for a lit RPG.

How are the limiters put in place? Dose our cabal train people to believe that the limit exist, is there a magic switch that we flip or something else?

I think kidnaping people who have never even heard of VR and have lower levels of educaion would be the best bet, as it reduses the risk it might occure to them the things they see aren't real.

Create a very simple game world to reduse the worldbuilding mistakes that can be noticed. Or at the very least make it so the players don't interact will anything two complex for long. I would do this by haveing them teliported to locations with a quest to do and then warping back to a hub world the moment they are done.

Spread clues in quest locations, that tell a narative about why they are there, so the curious will accept the fake story as real and be more firm about believing it thanks to the effore they put in to uncover it.

**** Glad that you like it. If I have the time I'll try a stab at making a story for it. It was something I used for rpg's two times but they never lasted long.

The limiters are live invisible non-material magical constructs that sustain themselves on the psychic energy of their host. A player learning how to see invisible creatures will be able to see them once they return to the real world. They can be destroyed and the cabal have limited ability to manipulate them but not a good way of doing it largescale.

I agree that making people unaware that they entered a VR would make it more real and perhaps removing the memory of entering a VR would be a good idea. I dislike that from a narrative perspective though and I wonder if we could make a tweak to the world that would change that?

I actually disagree on your point about people who have lower levels of educations. Higher levels of education allows people to perform more abstract thinking and to accept weirder premises.

I'm not sure that I am following the point about a simple in game world. Would you be interested in elaborating on that?

***** Haveing the players be aware of VR and questioning if what they are seeing is real would problely make for a more interesting story. I was imagining that the Cabal would have a huge amount of resorses so could kidnap people who were unfamiler with VR from less developed countries but If they are on a budget or have a tight deadline then it would explain why they had to chose people who were familer with the tech.

I was thinking that a lack of education would lead to people to not question their perception of the world. If you have never heard of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave][Platos Cave]] or anything that explorses similar themes then you would have to come up with that idea on your own. Now I think about it [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise)][The Matrix]] explorse those theams and is quite wide spread in pop culture so idk.

For the simple game world I was thinking makeing world less like skyrim and more like [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/461560/MANDAGON/][MANDAGON]]. I don't know how much game design has improved along side the VR tech, but asumeing it is still slightly comparble to today, makeing a truely believable gameworld with lots of NPC's and complex moveing parts would be almost imposible. So remove the NPC's and the complex moveing parts. Make it so the players spend their most of their time in a very simple eviroment that can be made as realistice as posible. Like the [[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/dragonball/images/0/0c/Hyperbolic_Time_Chamber_DBS_Ep_32_001.png/revision/latest?cb=20171106012206][Hyperbolic Time Chamber]] or [[https://previews.123rf.com/images/mikekiev/mikekiev1204/mikekiev120400014/13293901-private-house-on-green-planet.jpg][house on a tiny planet]]. If they can simulate a perfectly realistic world then this would proberbly not be needed.

In the VR world, every menu from your character options to your level-up bonuses to your quests are accessed through a cellphone app, which then has VR-world implications.

While your victims are in VR, you sneakily install the real version of the same app on their phones. Instead of letting them think the VR world is real, you're letting them think that their VR-world powers somehow escaped to the real world with them. (Also, you can manipulate the app to give them quests).

This would best be done by having the abilities incorporate a significant muscle-memory component, so that training the players to activate those powers in-game also trains them to activate those powers out of game, because the motions are the same

Alternately, mnemonics.

** I've been woolgathering on a story where the oceans turned suddenly intangible /only to humans/ (which is, admittedly, almost verbatim from an entry over on [[/r/WritingPrompts][r/WritingPrompts]]).

To paint a picture: You can see the oceans only by what is in them, not the water, so all the creatures of the sea are 'airborne' when you're 'under water'. Fishes swim past you and you only feel their movements as if they were 'swimming' through air. But grab one and suddenly its buoyancy in water is cancelled and it behaves as if it was in air at that atmospheric depth, which mostly translates to sudden cases asphyxiation and decompression injuries.

On the other side of the spectrum, swimming in the oceans is suddenly impossible, because they're intangible to you. Furthermore if you were at sea when the switch happened, the boat you might have been on also suddenly gained (temporary!) intangibility and the drop from sea surface to seabed injured or killed you. Everything else, like weather patterns, is unaffected by that intangibility, by the way, unless a result of human-ocean interaction impacted it (that means: the ships and stuff falling from the surface to the bottom would impact like they were falling through air until their human passengers were dead, then the water is suddenly tangible again to them; the effects of oil spill on wildlife would be there).

In the immediate aftermath of the switch there's wide scale destruction and upheaval on account of all manned swimming sea platforms (like oil rigs) dropping from great height to their destruction, with subsequent ongoing huge oil spills. All the oil tankers and cargo ships that were in any ocean at the time experience the same fate. About half of all sea men / women on ships died. So... yeah.

The why and how this happened are mostly fleshed out (but irrelevant for this story), the source of conflict is clear, the location is 'under the sea'.

The story takes place decades after that switch, I am still undecided on whether the main characters lived through it or had only heard stories, but disregarding that, *I fear I am missing some of the less obvious effects an intangible ocean would have on people living there.* I mean, I figured that undersea dwellers would wear breathing masks when venturing outside that filtered all the detritus, sand, microbes, etc in the 'air' that would otherwise clog up their lungs of might infect them, buildings would be constantly inhabited by someone all the time (sudden compression of your habitat just because no one's in the house would screw everyone over) or be built to withstand the pressures, vehicles would be bigger wheeled and all terrain, and some of the smarter shallow water predators (sharks?) might take bites out of people if they can survive the sudden decompression-recompression of a successful attack.

*** It becomes impossible to drown in the ocean.

How does this idea handle brackish water? At what point does the Chesapeake Bay or Potomac River become tangible?

Does the intangible water still block light in the same way as before? You may experience light-related illnesses on the sea bottom, which would lead to increased light usage on the sea bottom, which would lead to light pollution in the depths.

It is now monstrously cheaper to lay transoceanic cables for power and data transmission.

Some specialized jobs such as underwater welding become less specialized.

A perfectly spherical, highly buoyant vessel is docked at the bottom of the Marianas Trench. All humans within it exit the vehicle. The vehicle is now no longer occupied. How fast does it ascend to the surface, and how can that be used as a weapon?

The counter-operation is obvious: Float a massive object over someone's seafloor military base, then drop a human onto it from a helicopter to cause the vessel to smash into the seafloor base. The person riding the impactor pops a parachute, flies away, lands on the seafloor, and walks away, but the post-human-departure impactor is still traveling very quickly, and will likely hit the base with some force. It'll also just settle onto the base, as an area denial weapon until someone can get it buoyant enough to be floated off its target.

You'd also be violating the Benthic Treaties.

Yes and no. Light emitted from your inhabited facility still travels like through air for a set distance, but a random light outside would behave as if it was at that depth and heavily attenuated the more distant it is.

Good point with the light-related illnesses (Vitamin D deficiency, depression, increased alcoholism, ...).

There's limits due to water resistance. Highest speed possible would be with density of 0 and negligible drag. I'd have to calculate that. Regardless, all the airpockets inside the vessel would suddenly be filled with sea water, so that would also put a limiter on its ascent speed.

As above, I'd have to calculate the maximum descent speed such an object could have, and how much it would slow inbetween the operator's departure and the object's impact.

So, that was a reference to a set of treaties between Humans and the Lovecraftian [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_One][Deep Ones]] in Charles Stross' [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Laundry_Files][Laundry Files series]], building upon Lovecraft's stories about Innsmouth. "Benthic" derives from the term [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benthos][benthos]] for organisms living on, in, or near the seabed.

The real-life equivalent would be the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabed_Arms_Control_Treaty][Seabed Arms Control Treaty]] and the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea][UN Convention on the Law of the Sea]].

*** Are humans breathing the intangible water? (I'm curious).

The rock and sand at the bottom of the ocean is under immense pressure. I imagine a human walking along is going to struggle with the ground beneath their feet exploding constantly... but I'm not confident that would be the result. My reasoning is that even though the rock won't deform a lot, a small deformation causes it to violently shatter. Also, any dissolved gasses that are escaping will definitely explode. Watch out for porous things.

You can generate power by filling a room with a compressible gas and leaving it. The gas is crushed into a tank at the top of the room after you leave. Close the tank remotely, return to the room: instant ultra-pressurized gas, which can be fed to generators.

Bonus: expect explosive surprises when you visit any structure that has been abandoned. Air pockets will abound.

What happens to water that humans take with them? Does it turn intangible immediately, or only when it leaves their presence? The ocean area is a giant desert that gets no rain, from the human perspective.

Imagine leaving a glass of water alone outside. It would start flowing up out of the cup (it's buoyant in sea water) and vanishing as it mixed into the ocean.

Maybe you can install a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semipermeable_membrane#Reverse_osmosis][semipermeable membrane]] in your power generation structure to have it double as a water generation structure. Free pressure is useful.

Human-made sounds don't travel very far. Radio also doesn't work. That might be a problem, considering the land area on earth just quadrupled and people are going to want to start claiming it. How do you send commands to your armies? Communication cables and sonar stations, perhaps? What's the bandwidth and range on sonar?

Nuclear bunkers at the sea bottom will be popular; only manned missiles can get to you, and if they miss by a few feet the immense ambient pressure will protect the bunker. Also, missiles will be hard to aim, because...

Planes will work in this place, but they'd be /terrifying/ to fly in. No light, no sound, no comms, no way of gauging distance to the 'ground'. Maybe sonar on a stick is an option, but good luck dragging it through the water while flying. Maybe you'd need single-use sonar bundles attached to wires.

The former ocean is going to be a dangerous place.

Yes. H2O, (and a set of therein dissolved minerals like Na, Cl, Au, ...) are replaced by an atmospheric mixture comparable to air. The hard delineation of replacement for breathing purposes is outside one's reach. The /other/ stuff floating in sea water, be that sand, microbes, fish, etc /aren't/ replaced, which is why the breathing masks would be necessary.

Hm... reminds me of the Walking on Pluto scenario. My initial idea was that you'd sink into 'mud' if you just walked on the sea floor, since the sand is mixed with sea water, but you interacting with it replaces the sea water with air, which makes it lose it's cohesion. Basically like these [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My4RA5I0FKs][liquid sand / fluidised air things]]. I'll definitely have to think on that. Explosions under your feet would be fun, but might detract.

If you're talking fresh water, that turns intangible if you pour it out and leave the premises. You can have a (fresh) water tank in the inhabited facility w/o worrying about it turning suddenly intangible, at least until you leave the premises. If you replace the opening space of the emptying water tank in use with a distinctly not air gas mixture (pure N2 for instance) that would be able to withstand the sudden pressure change of abandoning the facilities, then you can leave your home and come back and still have fresh water.

Your carpets might be ruined though.

Bandwidth and range on sonar depend on a lot of things (you can have layers in the oceans where sonar can reach thousands of kilometres, see how submarine sonar screw with whales at that distance), and near shoreline seasteads would probably have had cables laid to them, but deep ocean seasteads would use buoys, anchored to the seabed outside their premises, that would trail cables down.

You're right. In particular the upper couple hundred meters will be terrifying to cross, since that's where the lion's share of bigger aquatic life takes place, and if you go deeper the sun will notable dim (not because of the water, but because of all the detritus in the 'air' above); you'll fly either in darkness or a very dimm place with no shadows. I suspect there will be planes flying sub-oceanic, but these will be limited to research (and military) applications, and they'll fly much slower to deal with the bad conditions. As a rough approximation it will be like flying through ash-laden air (I'll have to look up numbers how ash-laden).

How about: a tank full of N2 at 'ambient' (from the human perspective) pressure. When a human leaves, the gas in the tank is compressed by the change to deep-ocean pressure. If you put a membrane over the opening of the tank, the volume that used to be filled with gas will be filled with freshwater.

Of course, good luck making a membrane that can handle such a sudden change--but I suppose you could put a valve in the neck of the tank that controls how fast the membrane experiences it.

Without going into too much detail, it's either a 'special sun' for humans below the sea (where the 'sunlight' behaves as if water didn't exist, without affecting any processes of things shone upon the 'sunlight'), which would be the convenient excuse why everyone can see as if through increasing layers of fog/ash. I prefer this, since it aligns with my initial ideas about the setting.

Alternatively there's no virtual sun and until sunlight hits the transition it will be attenuated by the regular sea before it suddenly starts to pass through 'air'. This has its own implications, like littoral and human-inhabited sea floors suddenly becoming much more light soaked, with the subsequent secondary effects like increased sea plant growth around humans, shifts in species distribution (algae specialised to metabolise long wavelength light will suffer from light stress, short wavelength users will migrate (very quickly) into the human habitation bubbles. Light-sensitive animal species will tend to avoid the (relatively) shining human settlements.

Regardless, deeper seasteads would try bring their own light sources, but these might attract their own share of deep sea flora and fauna, depending on setting (and on if I think it makes sense).

Yes. Though you could also just touch a shark and let decompression do the rest. Though you might want to avoid having the shark touch you, and this doesn't cancel momentum, so you might be hit by a couple hundred pounds of meat at appreciable speed regardless of who does the touching.

#+end_quote

Whoa, whoa, whoa. So, if you /stop/ touching something, it remains unaffected by seawater? Is this based on time since touching it, or distance? (What happens if I throw a paper plane?)

If I touch a think with another thing (e.g. I'm holding a stick, and I use that stick to poke a shark) then what happens? (If it's a /long/ stick, this might help prevent me from being splattered with exploding shark).

****** Yep, it's tied into the unmentioned background, and it's not exactly 100 meters but in that range. It's very much tied to distance, not time, though I might rework that.

You would turn the shark via the stick; the stick doesn't transmit the intangibility property. (No, suspending yourself on a wire inside a nested room doesn't suddenly fill the outer room with water, but sufficiently large buildings (with sufficiently concentrated inhabitants) can have their outer reaches be tangible to seawater again. Underwater warehouses are... difficult.)

******* [[/twilistread][]] Hmmmm. A few thought experiments, then.

[[/sp][]] My friend, John, touches a piece of paper and then walks 50m away from me. I fold the paper into a paper plane and throw it at John. Since I am an expert paper-plane-folder and -thrower, the plane travels in a perfectly straight line exactly where I aim. As it approaches John, he backs away rapidly, such that the paper is never more than 50m away from him. When it gets 100m away from me, does it turn into mush or keep flying?

- The second one is similar, but with a difference - before I throw the plane, I tell John to "go long", so he backs off to 150m away from me before I throw the plane. Does the plane turn to mush at any point in this case?

******** Case 1: Keep flying. As you and John are ~200m apart, your overlapping bubbles of intangibility ...uncouple(?) and the paper place keeps flying in John's bubble.

Case 2: It turns to mush as it has fully left your intangibility bubble.

Illustrative case 3: You throw a spear at John, who's 300 meters distant. As the spear's trailing end has passed the 'intangibility border' of you it slows and stops in 'midair' just as if you had thrown it into sea water and slowly sinks to the bottom of the sea situated between you and John.

Illustrative case 3.1: Suppose ri is the intangibility radius, and d is the length of the spear, and you throw in perfectly straight line. For s(You, John) > 2 * ri + d there's a time when the spear interacts with sea water, however briefly, and it will behave as if the rest of its travel is through sea water. A target near John's intangibility border may be hit with the remaining speed the spear travel at through sea water, but John will very likely not be.

********* Hmmm.

I have a bathysphere; a strong metal sphere, filled with air. (There are no passengers inside it). It can survive in the ocean's depths, but is lighter than water and floats. It has a cable attached.

I roll it, all the way from outside the ocean, to the ocean's floor. I loop the cable around something I want to get rid of (a building, perhaps, or an enemy who's in no condition to fight back - in the second case, the cable should be at least 150m long). I stroll away. I imagine the bathysphere shoots out out of sight, dragging whatever's attached roughly away with it?

--------------

If I have a boat designed such that it can be piloted from the crow's nest and needs no crew other than the pilot (and the mast is 200m long), then surely this ship can sail the seas as ships once did? (Though the pilot will need a parachute instead of a lifeboat).

As I walk along barefoot, I touch the ground. 100m ahead of me, does the rock and sand burst into the air at the sudden lack of pressure?

No. It's all still submerged until you bodily interact with it. As you walk the ground, I imagine you would rather sink than the sand and rock bursting, but I honestly don't know how rocks behave when they're suddenly released from dozens to hundreds of atmospheres of pressure differential. They'd crack, I suspect? More compressible things, like fish's air bladder, would burst/explode though.

************ Sea trading being possible doesn't mean it's economic. You'd have to have the lifting body aspect of your ship 100+ meters below all the crew accommodations and workplaces.

...now I'm imagining an unmanned submarine with a tower on top from where the submarine is being piloted. It is a supremely weird image.

Though, thinking on it, if floatation aspect + cargo is on the ocean surface and the crew is suspended 150m below on a gondola, this might be doable. All manned shipping would come to a halt when they get too close to classical harbours; there would be really weird wharves built. Countries with naturally deep harbours (fjords come to mind) have an advantage in shipping.

These kinds of oceangoing vessels would also look like the weirdest Zeppelins I've ever heard off.

While inside your intangibility bubble, yes. You could use a pistol to hunt critters that swim too close. (I feel like contradicting myself with something I already said elsewhere...)

** I'm thinking about The Hunger Games after mentioning a (non-rational) fanfic of it in the Monday thread.

So, the hunger games: discuss?

The premise, for those that don't know, is that we're in a dystopian future where every year 24 children (1 boy and 1 girl from ages 12 to 18 chosen via lottery from the 12 districts) compete in a fight to the death, only one survives. There's 12 districts who live in relative poverty (the main character comes from a district where people regularly starve to death) and a Capitol full of people living their best post-scarcity utopia life (including things like surgically transforming themselves into cat people) - it's these people that watch the Games each year like their favourite reality show.

The Games happen as "penance" for the districts previously rising up against the Capitol, it's apparently used to "keep them down" and to make them mad at each other instead of at the Capitol which gives them all the problems. (Because if the little girl that used to sell lemonade in District 5 is killed by a teenage girl from District 8, this wouldn't make District 8 popular for District 5. Multiply that by two children every year for 75 years...).

I've glossed over a BUNCH, it's obviously a very detailed world. One other thing I should mention is that in exchange for more entries in the lottery, a child can get a supply of bread and oil (about one year supply for one person per entry). As well as that, some districts "train" most of their children for the Games, and then those Careers will actually compete for the "honour" of competing - which means that everyone can get the extra bread and oil with impunity.

Anyway, I guess my thoughts are:

- How rational is this system? It is pretty well thought out as dystopian futures go, and the events of the books cause the dystopia to fail after 75 years, which seems like a bit too long to me?

- Presumably in this dystopian future there are unwanted pregnancies. Why not raise these children in dorms, brainwash them as best you can to think dying in the Games are an honour, and then everyone can get the bread and oil and not starve? Basically a more extreme version of the Careers. I mean, yeah, it's unconscionable, but so is everything about the system. (Actually that would be an interesting fanfic, to write about the point of view of one of the Careers, but the situation is more like this than the outward perception of what a Career district is...)

*** To start with, you need more diversity to the districts, which is pretty easily done by saying "no, districts aren't entirely themed along a single career/resource, but that /is/ a method of culturally segregating them, in the way that people from Wisconsin take pride in their cheese, and Appalachia takes pride in their coal miners, despite the number of jobs that are actually in those industries being not actually that high". Simple enough.

The real question is how this all works (or fails to work) on a sociological level, which is probably a question of 1) demographics and 2) technology. The hunger games are put on because the Capitol are exercising control over the less technologically sophisticated districts, and whether this works or not doesn't actually matter, so long as people have cause to /think/ that it does.

(There's actually an interesting theory/headcanon that the hunger games are more about keeping the Capitol in line than the districts themselves, which I think is a better explanation, given that routinely killing children in a highly publicized way is /probably/ only going to inspire immediate and violent revolt, especially when those children are picked/groomed to be exemplars of that culture.)

***** I don't think that there's a proper thesis for it, but the premise is essentially that the Capitol will have better internal cohesion if they have a hated enemy, and given their utter dominance, they need to create their own enemy. The Hunger Games then aren't /really/ about suppressing revolt within the Districts or punishing them, they're the Capitol's yearly [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Minutes_Hate][Two Minutes Hate]]. Of course, the people in the Capitol don't really seem to "hate" the people from the Districts, instead seeing them more as caste inferiors or something, but the Hunger Games could still be a deliberate way of reinforcing the ingroup/outgroup pressures that would already be in place in order to ensure homogeneity.

(Whether this would actually /work/ is beside the point, so long as someone in power thinks that it does, or possibly just through inertia from the original creator(s) of the games.)

It'd be interesting to see what other stuff happens in the Capitol to help keep the class divide: they obviously have fashion norms (green skin is in, for example...), so there's probably at least quarterly fashion shows so that way people have to spend a lot of time and energy changing their appearance / wardrobes to keep up.

** In Harry Potter canon, Harry was born on 31 July 1980 and Hermione was born on 19 September 1979: Hermione is 10 months, 12 days older than Harry. What are the effects of reversing their relative ages, so that Harry is older than Hermione?

I'm wondering about Watsonian and Doylist effects. For example:

- As a Watsonian effect, Hermione might look at Harry as an older brother rather than as a younger brother.
- As a Doylist effect, someone might accuse the author of perpetuating a sexist standard of men only pursuing younger women.
