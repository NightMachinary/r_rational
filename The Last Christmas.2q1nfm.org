** I've read this before and will have to check for updates, but I am reminded of the [mis?]quote from /Three worlds collide/ "incompatible values".

Edit: Also an upvote for [[/u/traverseda]] 's flair which I have not yet had an opportunity to recognize as the correct approach to the singularity.

*** Yeah, it was written by [[/u/alexanderwales]]. It was finished before christmas last year, I think. Don't think it's going to be new for too many people here.

Thanks. Took forever to decide on a good culture name.

***** Not really, no. Let me know if you find any.

The only one that I've really read it "Culture vs 40k", and it wasn't particularly good.

****** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10570176/1/Charon]]

/The Culture/ meets /The Matrix/. I won't say more than "go read this".

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3983128/1/Culture-Shock]]

Long-dead HP/Culture cross, never really got off the ground. Nowhere near as good as the above.

I'd also be interested in more /Culture/ fics.

******* Whoever wrote /Charon/ is actually better at writing the /Culture/ universe as a living, emotional place than Ian Banks himself. /Player of Games/ has been a plod of wanting to scream, "Show, don't tell!" at my Kindle and a deceased man's memory.

*** I am working on a rewrite - it's half again as long right now, and though I'd hoped to have it done for Christmas, I don't think that's going to happen, especially since I'm trying not to rush it this time (and I think in the last year I've learned the secret to roping people into editing for me, if nothing else). Anyway, here's all the stuff that I'm hoping to add/fix:

- Give better characterization to the three principle characters
- Clever exploits/consequences of the panopticon (naughty/nice) viewers
- Smoothed out progression of the elves
- Background on the bad Santa (origins/motivations/plans)
- Filled in some background stuff on the elves
- Close any plot holes that remain once all that's done

Anyway, I don't think that the story is truly terrible as it is right now, just below what I'd consider to be my quality waterline. And if I'm going to miss the Christmas 2014 deadline, I'll probably just blow right past that deadline and save the rewrite for the Christmas after this one and put it out at a more preferable time.

If anyone has any questions/complaints about this story, I'd be happy to hear them.

** Is there a trope name for "Muggle gets summoned with magic with the explicit intent of being put into into the leadership position of some fantastical realm"?

Because so far "Two Year Emperor" "Erfworld" and this story here all share it. (This isn't spoilers, as it's pretty much mentioned in the very beginning of all these stories)

Second: Because it's a year later, and once again seasonally relevant, and awesome, and most of us will either have not read it, want to read it again, want to participate in renewed discussion about it, or not mind ignoring it.

Yes, plural. For example Demon was posted thrice in 2 months, most recently 6 days ago..

**** That still doesn't explain the motivation behind it. You can easily see all the fairly well-accepted stuff by going to top posts/all time, and the reposts just clutter that.

Why incentivize people to farm karma by reposting easily-accessible stuff?

***** As a relatively new browser to the subreddit, I've never seen this. Nor, in fact, have I seen a lot of the stuff that is reposted. Reposting allows new viewers of the subreddit to view and engage in discussion about older stuff, and can quite possibly bring new viewpoints to the subject matter.

As to Top Posts/All Time, that's fairly useless. It's heavily "Chapter x" of various rational fics, with one-shot gems like this few and far between. This particular story, for instance, doesn't make the top 100, nor does any post about Demon. It's less accessible than you think.

***** If you browse by [[/r/rational/top]], if you were to reply or comment on a thread, hardly anyone would see it to reply. This way, more discussion can be prompted.

As to that bit about karma - this is [[/r/rational]]. I'd hope that the most of us have grown above obsessing over imaginary internet points, whether they're on our account or someone else's.

****** I don't post links here often, but once every few months I re-post the Ted Chiang thread, even though there's rarely any discussion. I post it as a self post instead of a link post, which I think does not grant Karma, and I tag it as a [Repost]. These two things in conjunction make people pretty OK with resposts since it's explicitly labelled and clearly not a play for more points.

Also, Ted Chiang deserves a repost from time to time since he's super amazing.
