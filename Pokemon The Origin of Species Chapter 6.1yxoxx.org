** I don't like Laura. It's sad her husband died, but that keeps interrupting her other thoughts, to the point where I'd recommend therapy. She worries about him more than she worries about Red, and she doesn't even seem have have any good thoughts about the guy!

I could understand "The house hadn't felt this empty since Tom's death."

I could understand "Red had been so excited about becoming a professor - some of his father's zeal coming through."

What you've got is "Red had been so excited about becoming a professor. It reminded Laura of losing her husband. She'd worked as a reporter once. It reminded her of her husband, who she lost. Sam had always been a good friend to the family. Like when Laura lost her husband. The death of Sam's daughter had been so sad. Maybe Laura could have avoided losing her husband. She thought about how her only living child is doing out in the wilderness - it made her miss her lost husband."

Christ, girl. Worse, this is /the only thing I know about her/. It's the only notable character trait I've seen. She talks about other things, but missing her husband is the only thing she /does/.

Daisy is worse. She doesn't do anything. She just provides pages and pages of meaningless small talk. She steers the conversation through school and taxes and she has so much screen time, and it feels like none of that is going to pay off. As soon as something interesting happens - Koga's deflecting allegations that he might be what? It's common knowledge that a storm might signal an attack? What's that about? - the plot drops that significant exposition in favor of taking us back to Daisy's small talk! Daisy is a /vampire/.

This is kind of a problem throughout. The key things I took away from this chapter: Containers exist. Laura misses her husband (more than she misses her son). Daisy prattles on for an eternity. Laura will be traveling as a reporter. Foreboding storm all the characters know about but I don't. Something is going on with a mysterious Dr. Fuji. Those last three points are actually interesting, but they have next to no screen time compared to the character development that makes me hate everyone.

I'm also not really feeling the worldbuilding in this chapter. The Container is fair enough. But I'm expected to think that a million million megajoules of mass is the easy part, but ten megajoules of thermal energy is supposed to give me pause? Either their mass-energy conversion factor is different from ours (possible, but not shown), or that actually makes the world make /less/ sense.

There's talk of Pokemon on the news, which makes sense. Pokemon are immensely important. So much so that it should be really difficult to write a chapter where the only Pokemon that actually appears is a cooked bird! Is there a compelling reason Laura didn't wait at an intersection for a passing /rhyhorn/? Or why Oak doesn't have a tangela around trained to grab the dishes? Laura stops to chat with neighbors on her way - is there no friendly neighborhood raticate? (Why no, there's nothing unusual about a friendly giant rat that can rip out the sidewalk, why would there be?) A news report about tentacool can't support the universe by itself.

As others have mentioned, there's some problem with the flow. I think a large part of that is that every little thing makes Laura think of Tom for no obvious reason, but there's lots of little things too. I think you need to take care to spell out exactly how characters' thoughts lead to one another, in general, on a moment-to-moment basis. It's also good form to isolate most related exposition into distinct chunks, unless you want me to think their mind keeps going back to it. So this chapter is... kinda weak all around.

The perspective I had on it was that, if you have the ability to transmit matter to energy/data and reconstruct it into matter afterward, that the "million million megajoules of mass" is a "given." I can't really mess with that without removing one of the most singular aspects of the pokemon world.

But it still struck me as odd that, even if you have that data to reconstruct the molecules and cells and synapses, that the matter would come out containing exactly the same heat/energy as it did when it was copied. Body heat, after all, is the result of our metabolism, the chemical processes by which we burn our "fuel" like sugars. Why would those processes also be frozen and resumed exactly as they had before? Wouldn't they come out inert, which would be dangerously cold for most living things?

So yeah. It struck me as weird, so I put it in incase anyone else wondered about it: it could be that by mentioning it I'm just drawing attention to an issue most people wouldn't even have thought of, and maybe it's unnecessary either way :)

Yes, this was basically something I tried to do intentionally that in retrospect might have been a mistake: while obviously pokemon are going to be the subject of news and conversation, they don't have to be a part of every single social interaction, the way they are in the games and anime. I'll probably roll this change in with the changes I make to Daisy.

That wouldn't happen. It wouldn't come out inert, it would come out and not exist in the way we know, because if you can't make the atoms move then you can't make the electrons (or anything else) move.

But if you can make electrons move, and thereby not destroying the structure of the atom and making it collapse, then where would the difficulty arrive in moving the whole atom?

******** Generation of body heat is certainly different from heat, in that you are correct that it requires molecular processes and the such.

However, that's not my point.

My point is that dealing with molecular processes is the least of your worries if you understand me. When Oak says that they managed to do it before but couldn't retain the heat that doesn't really make sense.

Because if they couldn't retain the heat it was because they couldn't retain the movement of atoms (since if they could all the molecular processes would still be going and generating heat, never mind ambient heat).

But if they couldn't retain the movement of atoms then how would they be able to retain the movement of electrons (and all the other things that happen in an atom)? (and when we get down to it this issue happens with molecules and atoms too when they stop moving because even solids vibrate)

And if they couldn't retain the movement of electrons then the atomic structure is going to collapse, and instead of getting something that is cold, you get something that no longer resembles anything coherent (I'm not actually sure what would happen if an electron lost all movement, a quick google gets this [[http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080826080342AAiT67G]]).

On the principle of the thing, why can't they retain the heat? Why do the processes stop?

I hope I did that well enough

And yes, I completely get the present-tense aversion :) It's one of those things that many people just aren't used to, so it takes some acclimating.

Personally I've read so many books in both present and past tense that I barely notice switching between them when reading... but when writing, it's a /huge/ stumbling block to switch back and forth, as I would be doing if I didn't write this in present tense (the novel I'm editing for publication is in present tense). I actually wrote the first chapter of this in past tense originally, but both it and my novel became so riddled with tense typos that it swiftly became easier to just rewrite the first chapter in present tense and continue in present.

In any case, I hope it doesn't spoil the enjoyment too much, and hopefully the next time you encounter a story in present tense it won't be so jarring :)

For example lines like "She doesn't want...", "She misses him.", and "["I hope everyone is hungry"], They are.". Also, there are a few weird spots with "she'd" or "she had" where really is should probably be "she has" to fit with the present tense. I admit that the sentences sound weird either way though. Some of what I perceived as boringness can be forgiven as it's clearly a foreshadowing chapter, but I think it's still worth knowing I got that impression.

** Thank you DaystarEld, like the previous installments, I really enjoyed this chapter.

I think the interlude is valuable if only for highlighting that the world does not revolve around the protagonists and that Red's mom has a life of her own. I found the characters sympathetic and enjoyed their conversation and the glimpses into the functioning of the pokemon world it offered.

I find the story about the rationalist trainer and his scientific exploration of the world of pokemon far more interesting than the more conventional crime and mystery stories that are being hinted at. So I hope the story's focus will remain on the former (I think it is interesting enough not to be made subservient to the Team Rocket storyline and also that it is far more unique).

They're usually either totally irrelevant to the overall plot and slow down the action, or, even worse, they reveal important information in a way that would be much less effective that how an author would do it if there was a strict or semi-strict limit on the word count (while still slowing down the action).

I think it's a temptation that should be resisted unless you have a wholly contained story to tell that would actually be interesting in its own right, like the standalone stories in the /Sandman/ series. As it is, web fiction authors tend to use these "interludes" to...fill space? Provide "bonus" content?

*** Hooray, the voice of dissent!

Okay, so I can understand this perspective, but it's one I personally don't agree with at all :) More of something I love is more of something I love, and while obviously I'll have preferences of some parts of a story or characters over others, the whole is made stronger by all of its parts. I don't think extra characterization or world building are ever unnecessary, as long as the writing and story and world are compelling.

Of course, there's the crux of the matter: I'm no Stephen King or GRRM, so maybe I just wasted everyone's time with a badly written interlude that most people will find boring. But that's more my failing than the nature of interludes as a concept.

I do feel these interludes are integral to the story though, which means if I've got readers who find them boring and unnecessary, then I'm doing something wrong, and I need to figure out what it is.

#+begin_quote
  As it is, web fiction authors tend to use these "interludes" to...fill space? Provide "bonus" content?
#+end_quote

Maybe the latter, but not at all the former. Writing is /hard./ I've never met a writer that wanted to spend hours of their life just "filling space." If they write something, it's because they think it's important, even if they get it terribly wrong.

But it's not always just "bonus content" either. Stories written from only one perspective inevitably suffer, I feel, from bias and limited scope.

The whole point of writing from more than one character's perspective is to provide another view on the events and world that the first character wouldn't notice or care about, which should, when done well, make the story feel more "real."

One of the many reasons HPMOR feels so much more "real" than the canon Harry Potter series is that it jumps to other perspectives. And not consistently either: EY doesn't use the word "interlude," but there are clear instances where we are basically getting a one-shot perspective from a character who may be important, but not important enough to be a "main character."

Even stories from one perspective that I love, like the Dresden Files, I feel are improved by added perspectives. My favorite Dresden File short stories are the ones from Thomas and Murphy and Marcone's perspectives, because no matter how much you love Harry, the wise-cracking wizard's voice can get old after awhile. Staying in only his head can start to feel repetitive: you begin to already anticipate what he's going to think for a given situation, how he'll react to a bit of information. New characters can refresh the whole world by giving you new eyes to look at it through, and while these examples are "complete stories" as you mentioned, the could have been just as effective in the main Dresden File books as lone chapter shifts if it didn't happen to be written from a first-person perspective.

So all that said, in my case specifically, I wrote this interlude because there's just too much about the world and story to tell from Red's perspective. If I don't occasionally jump to others' perspectives, getting some of this information would require incredibly convenient happenstances or drastic shifts in narrative tone.

Furthermore, it's hard to foreshadow from one character's perspective when you intend that character to be intelligent: there's just no way I can imagine Rational!Red would hear about certain things during the normal course of his adventure, and even if he did, the rational response would be to immediately begin investigating them until he figured them out, which means I would have to put artificial barriers in his way to make him give up and go back to moving the story at a decent and coherent pace.

Instead, this way there's the main story arc of Red's adventures, but I can flesh out the world he lives in and its various layers while also introducing some of the other major characters that won't necessarily be with Red throughout his journey, because they're part of the wider story arc.

Does any of that make sense?

**** Switching perspectives is fine. That's different from...whatever these interludes are, exactly.

First of all, there's the problem that many of these interludes (I'm thinking /Worm/ and this) simply don't work as self-contained stories. But they're also not part of the ongoing narrative. As a result, they tend to lack any kind of real emotional impact (and the effect they have on the plot is even worse, but I'll get to that).

If you compare it to the interludes in Gaiman's /Sandman/, the interludes are all /really cool and interesting stories/. They work as standalone tales totally separate from what's going on in the main storyline, which isn't to say that they don't contain interesting and important information that is relevant to the main plot. The interludes in /Worm/, however, and apparently here as well, are more like unnecessary conversations between minor characters. It's...neat, in a DVD extras sort of way, but if you had to turn these web fictions into books, imposing a word and page limit, those interludes would get cut and cut fast, and the story wouldn't suffer in the slightest. /Sandman/, on the other hand, would be much poorer without the standalone stories.

Then there's the unfortunate effect the interludes have on the main plot, which is, they tend to /steal the main story's thunder/. I'm thinking specifically of the Slaughterhouse 9 interludes, which for the most part were totally unnecessary and /reduced the impact of the real introduction of the Slaughterhouse 9/. The author's choice to reveal the Nine's goals and powers in a way that was cut off from anything resembling tension or emotional engagement made it more or less impossible to /feel/ the Nine's arrival. Between that and Skitter's pwning of Mannequin, the Nine quickly lost the feel of being a particularly special or dangerous threat.

Two other problematic interludes have been the interlude from Alexandria's perspective in arc 15 (I think), and the interlude introducing Armsmaster reborn as Defiant from Triumph's perspective (also 15?). The former sets up a future plot point (presumably), but in a way that tells me most of the plot /before the actual plot has gotten to that point/. I am sure that when whatever Alexandria and the Doctor are up to becomes relevant, it will have much less impact than if the author himself hadn't gone out of his way to /spoil the plot/ for no benefit. The Triumph interlude, similarly, basically just spoils the arrival of Dragon and the impending battle between Coil's team and the local heroes + Dragon.

Then there's simply the issue of reducing the average quality of your work. I'm having trouble with this myself--by my estimate, I get to about 300-400 pages of writing in my [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-legend-of-korra-book-4-a-matter.286353/][LoK fic]] /before/ the first arc really even begins. This isn't because my world is that huge or my characters that complex. It's because nothing I've written is /so/ bad that it /demands/ to be cut. And since I'm not /compelled/ to cut by physical limitations, the result is a work that goes on for far too long, with character and plot development occurring very inefficiently and a low average quality even if there are good moments here and there. But at least I'll know to avoid the temptation of interludes. The format of web fiction makes it too easy to dilute one's own work.

***** To give an example, the best interlude hands down in /Worm/ (up through arc 15), is the one from Canary's perspective. There are two reasons for this:

1. It has Lung and Bakuda in it, two of the best characters in /Worm/, Lung for his tension-enhancing power and Bakuda for her clear, vibrant tone in a story that is too grey and flat.

2. It has an actual self-contained story and isn't just minor characters spoiling the plot because the author has too much freedom. Bakuda is trying to bust out of the prison. That's the plot. It's an actual story. A character is trying to do something --> There are obstacles --> The character tries to get around the obstacles --> The character loses (in this case). As a result, it's an actual interesting read and one that doesn't even need to spoil the plot to hook the audience's attention.

This is purely subjective: I liked Lung, but Bakuda was nowhere near what I'd consider one of the "best characters in Worm." She was bland and stereotypical and predictable, and I much preferred interludes with Armsmaster/Defiant and Dragon, whose character arcs I think were beautifully written even through just a few interludes spread out over the story.

I think you're confusing "spoiling the plot" and "setting up the plot in a way people might be able to predict." Without any set up at all, many of these plot points, when they arrive, would seem completely out of nowhere and arbitrary, like a fired Chekhov's gun that appeared nowhere earlier in the script. There's a careful balance between surprising your audience with a plot twist and pulling a scooby-doo plot twist that there's absolutely no way they could have seen coming. I don't know about you, but the latter angers me as a reader :P

Without a common reference pool it's hard to draw good examples, but we could use my own story, as it would be a good learning experience for me: what do you believe I've spoiled from my story from this chapter?

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I'm not denying that interludes as self-contained short stories aren't engaging, I'm saying limiting oneself to only those types of interludes is like leaving a tool in your toolbox. I'm not quite sure how you're distinguishing between an "interlude" and just having perspective shifts every few chapters, like many books do. Those shifted chapters are often part of their own character arcs and are still related to the main plot, but you seem to be saying that any deviation from the main character that isn't a self-contained plot is unnecessary. I couldn't disagree more.

I know you've said that publishing authors would be forced to cut more than web-serial authors, and in many respects that's true, but I'd argue whether that's always necessarily better. If you've read The Stand by Stephen King, you might be aware that there are two version, the originally published, and the uncut version released years later with a lot of extra content King couldn't originally include due to publisher limits.

The original is about 800 pages I believe. The uncut is over 1100. Some people like the cut version better: perhaps you would be one of them. To most though, reading the cut version is like watching the non-Extended Lord of the Rings movies : a streamlined bit of entertainment that's missing the details and character development that fills out the heart and soul of the story.

I'm sorry, but you're just wrong there. As I mentioned, Stepehen King is one of the most successful authors in the world, and he regularly switches perspectives from main characters during most of his stories. And Goerge RR Martin does this as well, devoting whole chapters to characters we've never seen before and sometimes never see again, just to give us an added bit of worldbuilding, a new perspective, or foreshadow something from the plot.

Many authors do this. I understand that you personally dislike it, but implying that all authors "know better" or that it's a universally, objectively bad thing is just not supportable.

Contradiction. If it's obvious that he would die, then it would be irrational to investigate them.

The obvious solution is for him to learn this, carefully try to investigate them without exposing himself, and see someone else who tried to investigate them get brutally murdered by pokemon, and then back off.

People generally have an aversion to murder, kidnapping, and criminals, and so when someone says "This person is a psycopath" members of polite society tend to avoid them.

With phones and such, people tend to stay in contact with their family members. They inform them of the location where they are going. If you try to kill anyone who goes to your area you're likely to have several screw ups.

1. People are going to escape, due to strong pokemon or fast pokemon or luck or minions who don't have a killing instinct.

2. A basic autopsy is going to reveal that the person didn't die from pokemon local to the area, and probably that they have brain damage from being put in a ball.

3. Having minions sufficiently murderous to quickly kill anyone who comes close means having impulsive psychopaths likely with a criminal history on your pay, which is risky.

  This is reading a lot like a mary sue character. They twist the world to make no one discover their evil ways, are perfect, and are apparently the real protagonist of the story.

Seriously? I said this mostly in jest to shake up your perspective of "the way things have to be." If I'd known you'd immediately jump to "Mary Sue," I'd have been more careful about deconstructing your argument without humor.

You just called something a Mary Sue without a single character representing it appearing "on screen," as it were, because you disagree with it. Do you think that helps make your argument?

#+begin_quote
  And perfect characters aren't very fun. It would be a lot more fun to see a rational character interact with them and display some basic competency (which may mean not doing more than the most surface of investigations) than to hear about how their crimes are perfect and undetectable.

The only reason you're hearing about it in this hypothetical regard is that you continue to insist that the story you haven't read yet is illogical or irrational for not playing out exactly as you think it should... for no particularly logical or realistic reasons, I might add, despite your insistence of realistic representation. I'm sorry to say that even with our modern technology and forensics, there hae still existed highly successful secretive criminal organizations and conspiracies that were not discovered for years later.

I can't really respond to what would be a "lot more fun" to read or write when I haven't even gotten a chance to write the story as I envision it yet. Simply put, your judgements seem premature.

Once again, in your hypothetical scenario where a person knows they're soon to be in danger and is carrying their phone in their hand ready to dial the police, you fail to recognize the context being anything different than you imagine, like them a) not even knowing that they've caught the attention of dangerous people yet and/or b) being ambushed while doing something otherwise innocuous.

This has been an entertaining and interesting debate up until this last post, where I feel you were no longer engaging in "good spirit." To me this argument has been a fun hypothetical discussion of the way things might be, but it seems you are taking it as license to not just jump to conclusions based on bad evidence, but to insist that any deviation from these conclusions is objectively bad.

I'm less interested in a discussion like that, so please try to draw back a bit on the strawmen and ad hominem.

Suppose Red investigated after his mother or someone told him about the situation.

A basic investigation technique- call the victim's mother.

They could then pull his phone records, see he called a few scientist's assistants, talk to them. It wouldn't be that hard to unravel the conspiracy.

#+end_quote

There's a limited amount you can do, rationally, to cover up murder, kidnapping, and mass surveillance of anyone who investigates you. Those are incredibly overt and obvious actions. What you are describing is a very overt and non secretive organization being secret through competency and the police being stupid.

My preferred change would be that you either bring the organization out into the open or have them display actual competency rather than just having the world twist around them to hide their actions.

Actual stealth does require some effort to make things stealthy. If you have people do overtly obvious things like mass kidnapping or murder it stretches credulity. It stretches credulity further when you say that they are such masters at crimes that autopsies reveal nothing. It stretches credulity beyond even that when the police make no effort to investigate this beyond assuming it is all an isolated incident.

It is very possible to do actual things to make it seem more secret- say have there be some sort of front organization that these scientists supposedly join, so they don't seem to have just vanished. They could even be made to call their friends at gun point and leave a message saying they're fine. You're just not doing that.

So, by your logic, I am exaggerating the benefits of technology, as similar organizations have existed in our world.

Sure. Could you name an organization that killed people who investigated it and kidnapped some sort of middle class person en masse without being discovered? Or some similar level of crime.

They might manage it once or twice, but if it's their go to response then someone is likely to survive the first attack (perhaps with fatal injuries) and get their pokemon out to defend them for a while, or the shot might miss, or a passerby might help them.

*************** This entire conversation has spiraled completely away from what it originally was, which was "why isn't Red finding out about these people and investigating them."

Once again, the answers are:

1) That's not the story I have in mind: I intend a couple years to pass at least before Team Rocket's activities are forced into the public consciousness.

2) I don't think it would be realistic for Red to find out, investigate, and not die against an organization as powerful and well run as my conception of Team Rocket.

You've provided no alternatives beyond simply asserting again and again that such an organization couldn't exist. I hate to use the "agree to disagree" line, but at this point it seems the only thing I can do, as this is the best you can bring forth for "Evidence" of your perspective:

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Incorrect: A limited group of scientists and engineers faded from public life about a decade ago, as implied in the story.

#+begin_quote
  There is apparently no plausible reason for them vanishing.

"Apparently" being the key word. This organization has been hinted at by one person in the story, at the end of one chapter: jumping to the conclusions you have from that is entirely premature.

#+begin_quote
  People who investigate this are murdered.
#+end_quote

People who /would/ investigate /could/ be murdered, as I've said. Which is why Red investigating them and surviving would be a pretty poor story for a realistic fiction, and your points of "well he could get away by enemy incompetence" or "it's hard for people to feel a killer instinct" are just not compelling arguments that this wouldn't be making the enemies needlessly incompetent, for no other reason than to force Red into a part of the story he has no reason to be involved in yet.

That his death by a professional hitman might result in Team Rocket being investigated and revealed is irrelevant: he'd still be dead. It's not about the police force being incompetent either: that's like saying the Aurors or the Order of the Phoenix is just incompetent because they didn't stop Voldemorte. The whole point of having a threatening over-arching antagonist is that the status quo isn't able to handle them, however competent.

And while I could jump him into the Team Rocket plot early and just bend the universe to ensure that Red's safe by any number of artificial means (any way you try to slice it, a criminal organization that can't effectively kill a child without revealing itself is utterly incompetent), I don't want to do that, and see no reason to when I could tell the story in what I view as a better way over a longer time line.

Sure, but that scary stuff wouldn't necessarily lead to "there's a secret organization of criminals up to no good," which is what an investigation into Team Rocket would require. Even if he encounters criminals up to no good, that doesn't automatically mean conspiracy. And Red IS going to run into their plots and the symptoms/results of those plots, but he's not going to know from the beginning what's really behind them, and not just because there won't be people wearing black shirts with a big red R on them running around.

#+end_quote

I do remember that: I also remember that Quirrelmort told Harry he had intended to push the man out of the way if he didn't dodge on time, reasonably pointing out that if he'd really wanted to kill him, the would have done so immediately.

Of course maybe he was lying, but KNOWING how much he needed Harry's trust, there's no particular reason to think he was: it wasn't a mistake on Quirrelmort's part, it was a lack of trust on Harry's. Which of course still translates to a mistake on Quirrelmort's part for overestimating how much Harry would trust him and underestimating what, if anything, Harry could do about it if he suddenly didn't.

But it's still not a mistake the way you're painting it to be.

And again, for the third time at least: I'm not saying Team Rocket doesn't make mistakes. I'm saying I see no reason for your insistence that these mistakes be immediately crippling to their secrecy. Clearly they've already made one mistake we're aware of, one that took years to be recognized: if Dr. Fuji hadn't told Oak that he was working on a new project, it would be harder for Oak to conclude that he had been recruited to something, rather than dropping out of his work altogether.

#+begin_quote
  I note how, despite my requests, you didn't reveal any real life criminal organizations that murdered people and abducted people without being discovered. Could you name some, proving your point?
#+end_quote

Even putting aside what relatively few CIA and other national intelligence agency operations have come to public light, since we're talking about criminals: The American Mafia?

With our modern hindsight, it seems like people have always known about the Mafia, and its major loss of power seems obvious. but the Mafia existed in some form for decades, and wasn't even recognized as such as massive criminal conspiracy until the late 1950s.

Obviously police knew that organized crime as a concept existed, but the extent and influence of their crimes took years to even become aware of, let alone investigate and prove. Until then, any time some operation was uncovered or criminal was arrested, they would simply be considered lone actor or at most part of a small crew.

And that's exactly what I mean by "Team Rocket makes mistakes, but those mistakes don't automatically mean their secrecy is blown." Say one of the engineers that they tried to coerce or kidnap (or whatever they did) fought back and was successful: do they necessarily know everything they need to to suspect a massive criminal conspiracy? Of course not: at most they might just be aware that someone had tried to kidnap or blackmail them. Even if the criminals were caught, a basic lie about their motivations and it's a closed case: not a giant red flag that there's a region-wide criminal organization behind the curtain.

So what's the cutoff point for you for Team Rocket getting away with hypothetical murder/kidnapping? 3 times is okay? 5 times? 10 times stretches credulity? How long do you think a secret can be kept? 3 years? 6? Because the Mafia got away with estimated hundreds over fifty years before a bunch of their leaders were found in a room together in 1957ish (Apalachin Meeting I think), which tipped police off of just how big an organization they were, and utterly changed the way law enforcement investigated and approached organized crime.

Providing any such concrete numbers would make your argument a bit more interesting, but without it you are simply asserting an extreme that's not only fairly easy to dismiss, but making assumptions about how long Team Rocket has existed and how many people, if any, it's killed or disappeared, AND its methods for disposing bodies without drawing suspicion.

******************* #+begin_quote
  discovery upon murder, investigation by police or private investigators, autopsies of killed people, the use of phones. Could you describe to me how any of these need gross stupidity?
#+end_quote

All of which require foreknowledge of conspiracy, which means the criminals did nothing to hide the conspiracy's existence. And you keep mentioning cell phones. I don't know why, presumably your cell phone has a nigh-magical auto-dial-on-event-of-life-endangerment, but as I've explained multiple times, having a cell phone is meaningless if you're killed before you can use it, which is why most people who are murdered do not call the police mid-murder.

#+begin_quote
  Because it has never happened.
#+end_quote

What has "never happened?" Killing people and not getting caught? An organization killing people and not being revealed? Seriously?

#+begin_quote
  1/6 , perhaps less, of gun injuries lead to death. Humans are tough to kill. The majority of people who are shot survive to tell their tale-a phone isn't even needed. Murdering people is hard.
#+end_quote

Gun injuries that we know of. Gun injuries where they receive medical attention, including gun accidents. Not gun injuries by hitmen, a far smaller sample with far higher mortality.

Furthermore, all of that is irrelevant, as I said before: no guns. There are a number of pokemon that are particularly good at killing people, and those are the kinds of pokemon competent criminals would use to kill someone.

#+begin_quote
  It would be higher for a rural area like pallet.
#+end_quote

What in God's green earth gives you the confidence to say "a rural area like pallet?" Why would they have killed someone from Pallet?

#+begin_quote
  So yes, it does stretch belief using murder and people not investigating much. There is a 9/10 chance they'll be found out by statistics.
#+end_quote

You just abused statistical interpretation so badly that I'm swiftly losing any interest in this conversation: you're not only twisting facts to suit your argument, you're not even doing it particularly well. Take the most forgiving statistics without controlling for variables and context, and use them to generalize against an entire slew of situations whose details you either make up or ignore?

#+begin_quote
  I never said anything like that. Please don't make things up.
#+end_quote

I really don't want to get into a "he said she said": I'm sorry if I've misunderstood or am mischaracterizing your argument, but it seems very much to me that you have indeed been saying something "like that" by implying numerous times that Red could investigate such a thing without getting killed, as it would be stupid of criminal organizations to kill children, even assuming they could muster up the killing instinct to do so.

#+begin_quote
  See earlier, statistics.
#+end_quote

Sorry, you spinning them in the most favorable way for your argument doesn't work against people who have actually studied the statistics even a little bit.

#+begin_quote
  I am not implying anything- people care where others are. If nothing else, they want to divide up their possessions. Once these people did vanish they would still make an effort to find them for money purposes, for friendship. If someone is missing you can't get their stuff easily.
#+end_quote

Once again, ignoring or forgetting the selective targeting of people who have no remaining social ties.

#+begin_quote
  That moment is generally just before they hear about the crime, which provides evidence to their existence.
#+end_quote

...what? They learn about a conspiracy before they hear about a crime? Do you actually think this way, that conspiracies are unearthed, not from the connection of crimes and information, but by thinking up a conspiracy first, and then fitting crimes to a preconceived theory? Where do you think that they hear about the conspiracy in the first place? Who tells them? Someone has to hypothesize it first.

You need to look into how actual police work is done, my friend.

#+begin_quote
  I might think that initially, but the centaur incident made me distrust him- it looked a lot like he killed him and made him into a blank eyed inferius. He could lie because he wanted harry to trust him. Either way, there would be evidence of his crime, a dead or unconscious auror. That is what crimes produce. Evidence.
#+end_quote

Crimes produce evidence, but not evidence that can be easily found, and not evidence that always points to clear answers.

#+begin_quote
  Unless he is a body double, that is his mistake. If he is a double, I mean with the high risk murders that fail most of the time and are cleared 90%+ of the time.
#+end_quote

You can't actually think that all murders are cleared 90% of the time. You just quoted statistics that say otherwise: not the ones in rural ares, where the vast minority of people live, but cities, where the majority of murders take place. You do know the difference between per-capita and flat statistics, yes? 90% of 100 is less than 40% of 3,000.

#+begin_quote
  Such as?
#+end_quote

MK Ultra, Iran Contra, dozens of WWII and gulf war activities... look it up :P

#+begin_quote
  That is exactly the sort of thing I would like to see in there that would sound rational. I suggested it earlier on how to do crimes and get away with it. The central organisation uses local criminals who are expendable. Everyone knew the black hand ( I think that was what they used to be called) was doing crimes, but they didn't connect them to the larger organisation.
#+end_quote

Yes! I know! Which is why, for the fourth time /at least,/ I have said that Team Rocket members making mistakes =/= Team Rocket being revealed as an organization!

/sighs/ Now we're getting somewhere, I hope :P

#+begin_quote
  You are talking of separate issues. People were aware someone was killing and abducting people. They weren't aware some people were having meetings or phoning each other. Murder is more open than friendly conversations. It has an over 50% solve rate.
#+end_quote

In our world and our technology it may be 50%, but not necessarily in the pokemon world.

******************** #+begin_quote
  All of which require foreknowledge of conspiracy, which means the criminals did nothing to hide the conspiracy's existence.
#+end_quote

I was talking more of, discovering the murder. You were initially arguing that they could kill a person perfectly with no risk- autopsies would reveal nothing, the person wouldn't escape, they wouldn't be leave any messages. We were talking about Red investigating the and getting killed.

If they have left no hints of their crimes, then him trying to investigate them would do little, and he would likely only get small hints that wouldn't lead to death. That would also be fine. You were initially implying that he could investigate them, just that the result would be death.

#+begin_quote
  which is why most people who are murdered do not call the police mid-murder.
#+end_quote

People don't die instantly when someone attacks you. It takes a while to bleed out, and most gun shot wounds don't kill. Your assumption, that most murderers kill somewhat instantly, is false per the statistics I gave you.

#+begin_quote
  What has "never happened?" Killing people and not getting caught? An organization killing people and not being revealed? Seriously?
#+end_quote

What you were previously describing- an organization kidnapping people en masse and murdering anyone who investigates them without people knowing that there are kidnappings and murders.

What you are now describing, an organization that does the above and is discovered but the true crime bosses of it aren't discovered, that is possible.

#+begin_quote
  Gun injuries that we know of. Gun injuries where they receive medical attention, including gun accidents. Not gun injuries by hitmen, a far smaller sample with far higher mortality.
#+end_quote

Whether they receive medical attention is immaterial. If they can limp to a hospital, they can spill their guts out to the police. My point was, people often survive seemingly fatal injuries for a while, which would give them enough time to phone someone.

#+begin_quote
  Furthermore, all of that is irrelevant, as I said before: no guns. There are a number of pokemon that are particularly good at killing people, and those are the kinds of pokemon competent criminals would use to kill someone.
#+end_quote

Using these pokemon would make it obvious in an autopsy. If their body has been blasted by a hyper beam from a gyrados, people will notice.

If they hide the body you have the issue of missing people. Search parties would likely go out, attracting more attention.

Again, with both cases, even assuming their pokemon hits perfectly (and missing is common in pokemon) they are causing more issues that make it likely that a reasonably competent police force would think something was up.

#+begin_quote
  What in God's green earth gives you the confidence to say "a rural area like pallet?" Why would they have killed someone from Pallet?

#+end_quote

I'm not abusing statistics, I am using them as intended.

They raise a very good point. The police are good at discovering who murdered people. It's not incredibly hard. As such, you shouldn't generally expect murder to go undiscovered, as a matter of course. Especially if it happens a lot. In our world it is very abnormal for murders to go unsolved.

#+end_quote

It would be stupid of them to murder him.

Their first impulse, likely, would be to threaten him. Then to beat him up. Then, if he refused to shut up, kill him. They could kill him, but they likely wouldn't open with it, since murder tends to draw unwanted attention. That is the normal way to overcome your aversion to murder. Escalate until you're in the mood.

#+begin_quote
  Once again, ignoring or forgetting the selective targeting of people who have no remaining social ties.

No, but when people talk about it they might say "I do not know what really happened, but I fear Voldemort's mark." or "I do not know what really happened, but I fear these dangerous criminals." not I wonder why all these people have vanished and died for no discernible reason. They know that a dangerous criminal did it.

  MK Ultra
#+end_quote

They used universities as fronts, they were pretty open about testing on humans, just not about being run by the CIA.

To extend the analogy- it would be clear that someone, or some groups, were abducting scientists, though it wouldn't be clear if they were working together.

#+end_quote

One of these days you're going to learn the difference between generalized statistics and specific circumstances, but someone who has the intent to kill you is not going to shoot you once, then sit back and watch you slowly bleed out and perhaps call the police while you're at it.

Even less likely would someone with a deadly pokemon merely have them take a bite out of you then call them off, especially when they need to dispose of your body afterward.

It's really, really not "immaterial," and I can't even begin to understand what makes you think this. The entire medical infrastructure and emergency response vehicle system, with trained EMTs capable of helping someone survive an injury until they reach the ER, exists exactly because it helps people survive things like gunshot wounds.

[[http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324712504578131360684277812]]

And, again, as should have been obvious from the beginning, criminal hitmen who have the explicit intent to kill someone do not merely injure them then walk away and hope they don't 1) go to a hospital or 2) call the police.

Please just admit you were drawing incorrect conclusions from logic and data that do not apply to the specific situations referred to by this conversation, because at this point you're just sounding silly. I won't think less of you if you say "Yeah, I guess that is a different situation than I had in mind," but this rigid clinging to your overgeneralized conception of mortality rates in the face of deliberate hitmen is making me suspect that you simply enjoy arguing more than you do having an intellectually honest discussion.

...What? "(and missing is common in pokemon)?" Seriously, now? You're using a game conceit to justify your absurd premise and dogged insistence on your version of hypotheticals?

No, missing isn ot commong in pokemon. The vast majority of pokemon moves are 90-100% accuracy, and only the most powerful moves miss often, and there's no reason whatsoever to use a Hydro Pump to kill a human when you can just bite their head off.

This isn't remotely interesting anymore: your arguments are becoming weaker and weaker.

#+begin_quote

Holy Raptor Jesus, you're really still using this argument. You're really still insisting that when someone is told they need to kill someone, and they study their schedule and movements with the intent to quickly kll them and then hide the evidence, they need to "work up" to it on the scene, maybe "beat them up" a little.

I can't tell if your perspective is that warped by literature and movies meant for children, or if you just don't want to admit that you're wrong that badly. I really don't care which it is anymore: you're wasting my time with strawmen.

No, see, you keep conflating the two: I'm the one that has been telling you *from the beginning* (go back and check if you'd like) that making mistakes in one does not automatically imply the other.

But you keep insisting that you can't get away with murder, that police are supermen and humans are made of adamantium steel, and that as long as you can come up with a hypothetical situation where murderers have to beat up their targets first and then just walk away and hope they die, perhaps making a call to the police or getting to a hospital along the way, then clearly everything's smooth sailing for the Forces of Good.

I'm exaggerating your argument now, by the way, because it's rather ridiculous, and I'm tired of debunking it again and again and having you insist that the law of averages will always side in the favor of your hypotheticals.

So let's just agree to disagree, because if you have such a naive and simpistic view of how crimes work, and are so bad at applying new information to generalizations that you honestly believe a hitman with specific purpose wouldn't stick around and ensure a swift kill of their target, we have nothing further to discuss: we're just living on two different planets for how logic and reasonable hypotheticals work.

And yet he's not there now. So you think he's going to go back for some reason before being murdered? You think "being from a small town" is some kind of magic aura that surrounds a person their whole life, so that if they're murdered their homicide is that much easier to solve?

Quick answer: that's not how statistics work. Or magic auras, for that matter.

And someone who is shot once isn't going to stick around to be shot again. They're going to run away, bring out pokemon. That was my original issue with your argument. You were assuming only the criminals could be competent. The people they attack couldn't be competent and try to dodge the attacks.

[[http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/PressRelease/pressReleaseId-110177.html]]

That isn't what research on hitmen says happens. A lot of them bungle it or fail to do it (as I said, killing people is hard) and those that do it often do it in public. The best generally come in from another region and do it, and have few ties to the region. If you stay in one area to scope someone out you're more likely to get caught.

#+end_quote

You don't really have any special intellectual credit over me- you are just saying "Hitmen are always or mostly successful" without actually referring to the research on them.

Likely because the research also shows a reasonable failure rate for hitmen too.

#+begin_quote
  Sounds like a stupid criminal to me.
#+end_quote

The issue is that the pokemon that are especially good at killing don't necessarily frequent the locations you are suggesting. For example, you seem to be getting very annoyed at me for saying that the solve rate for rural murders in high when most people live in cities, but at the same time you're saying that these hitmen are going to kill their victims in the wild where pokemon live, aka a rural area. Wild pokemon don't tend to exist much in the cities. Most wild pokemon are often not great at killing anyway (otherwise people would avoid that region) and so if a hitman wants to kill someone in the wild they would have to use a more effective pokemon from another region, which would show up on the autopsy.

#+begin_quote
  Right, and they'd find the body killed by pokemon.
#+end_quote

Killed by pokemon that are very good at killing, and probably aren't native to that region.

#+begin_quote
  "Most of the world" =/= "where most people live," and again you are jumping to conclusions to fit your hypothesis.
#+end_quote

You're suggesting they kill them in a city (where most people live), and then take their body to a rural area where wild pokemon attack and dump it?

That sounds quite high risk. A lot of camera around, and people would know that the person was in the city. It would look incredibly unnatural.

#+begin_quote
  Huge oversimplifications that you just made aside: in our world being the key difference that you insist on ignoring when convenient for your argument :)
#+end_quote

And in your world, the mary sue organization is much more successful :)

And improved technology only works for them, no one else can benefit.

Hence why I am challenging you. I'd prefer to see hyper competent police and criminals, not just hyper competent criminals. It's annoying seeing people hold the idiot ball.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Have you actually read up on any accounts of real life criminals, or hitmen, or murderers?

Hitmen do have a high failure rate, so working up to it is easier.

It's also good to avoid killing, because killing has a high failure rate, and is often discovered.

#+begin_quote
  Children and partner folks! Unconnected scientists who have children and partners! Yep! That's what that word means!
#+end_quote

Do you remember what you wrote in your chapter? He lost his daughter, and his wife divorced him. So they can have children and he has an ex wife, who may well want his home if he dies. He could easily have had other children, or children that abandoned him. If not, he could have siblings who didn't talk to him much.

#+end_quote

Debunking it would require you actually making some arguments against it that were coherent- e.g. the solve rate for crimes is much lower in the cities, so they could kill people in the cities more easily.

But then you forget other parts of your argument, like that they have to be killed by wild pokemon who live in the wild.

They might get away with it some number of times, I just wouldn't describe them as competent if murder was their go to tool for solving problems. Their competency is an implied attribute rather than something we see in the story.

As I've said, I have no issue with the conspiracy remaining hidden, just with people vanishing and no one realizing, or people being murdered without being discovered.

#+begin_quote
  You surely did make that connection in your multiple disparate threads of argument a number of times.
#+end_quote

No, I just said that people would discover that scientists were vanishing, likely due to criminal activity.

#+begin_quote
  Pokemon are more lethal than guns, and the technology to hide evidence is far more powerful.

And medical tech is better (e.g. magic healing sprays), and the technology to discover evidence is far more powerful too. It is an arms race, and both sides have new advantages.

  That isn't what research on hitmen says happens. A lot of them bungle it or fail to do it (as I said, killing people is hard) and those that do it often do it in public. The best generally come in from another region and do it, and have few ties to the region. If you stay in one area to scope someone out you're more likely to get caught.
#+end_quote

Once again, taking specific information and generalizing it in a way that most benefits you. The article you linked to specifically mentions the "class" of hitman, and your arguments might apply if we weren't specifically talking about career criminals with specialized training in murder.

See: competent criminal. But you look at the 200 dollar novice and say "Well, hitmen just suck, so of course Team Rocket couldn't get away with it."

#+begin_quote
  but at the same time you're saying that these hitmen are going to kill their victims in the wild where pokemon live, aka a rural area.
#+end_quote

Wrong: I said they would relocate their bodies to places where it's feasible that a pokemon would commit the act.

And again, sixth time now: evidence of murder =/= solved murder =/= blown conspiracy. I think we've established that last part, at least, but you're still insisting that any imperfection in the method of the murder or coverup should result in a solved crime. It's simply not the case.

#+begin_quote

  Hence why I am challenging you. I'd prefer to see hyper competent police and criminals, not just hyper competent criminals. It's annoying seeing people hold the idiot ball.
#+end_quote

I would be more inclined to believe this if you weren't so quick to use bad evidence and twist statistics to back your arguments, because you continue to do this, as evidenced by the "the data doesn't back up competent hitmen" generalization.

#+begin_quote
  Have you actually read up on any accounts of real life criminals, or hitmen, or murderers?
#+end_quote

I spent a year and a half studying forensic psychology, so yeah, it's kind of one of my major interests, which is part of why I find your insistence on your misuse of data to back your assertions so frustrating. Especially when you say things like this:

#+begin_quote
  I really think you should read up on actual hitmen. It would help a lot.
#+end_quote

When your arguments are all based on badly applied overgeneralizations of data, and special pleading to ignore any contexts or factors that make your proposed scenarios less likely.

#+begin_quote
  Do you remember what you wrote in your chapter? He lost his daughter, and his wife divorced him. So they can have children and he has an ex wife, who may well want his home if he dies. He could easily have had other children, or children that abandoned him. If not, he could have siblings who didn't talk to him much.
#+end_quote

And in your continued insistence on ignoring the concept of a competent criminal, you, a usual, ignore the idea that if any of that were the case, they wouldn't have targeted him.

#+begin_quote
  But then you forget other parts of your argument, like that they have to be killed by wild pokemon who live in the wild.
#+end_quote

As I explained above, this was your mistake, not mine, because you keep assuming things, sometimes due to misreading what I say.

For the record, incase this isn't clear: "wild pokemon" are indistinguishable from "captured pokemon." You keep bringing it up like there's no overlap, and jumping to the most extreme, absurd examples like "Gyarados hyperbeam" to support your argument.

#+begin_quote
  They might get away with it some number of times, I just wouldn't describe them as competent if murder was their go to tool for solving problems. Their competency is an implied attribute rather than something we see in the story.
#+end_quote

You haven't even seen them in the story. That's part of what makes your arguments so easy to dismiss: you are literally shooting in the dark and hoping you hit the right answer based on your preconceptions of how the world and story work.

#+end_quote

...Yes... They're paying the utility bill...

Obviously that's the only rational path a competent hitman can take on the problem of "how do I not arouse suspicion."

Wait, no, there aren't any of those, I forgot. /sighs/

#+begin_quote
  Other people would likely also be competent and realize what had happened, and other scientists and engineers, being afraid for their lives due to the obvious evidence of people vanishing, would beef up their security measures.

#+end_quote

Even competent hitmen are often caught.

[[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hojo.12063/full]]

The vast majority of those convicted had just one kill, giving evidence to my claim that murders often get solved.

The sort of killer who they note isn't captured is described as such- geographically mobile, killing their victim from a distance, and having no connections to the victims.

That would be a big issue for your sorts of killers. You want them to kill the person with pokemon (which lack the range of sniper rifles) and to hide the evidence (meaning they contaminate the crime scene) and move the body and not be seen which means following the routine of the person.

You're adding a lot of variables to the kill which make it less likely for them to not be caught. It's a lot easier to just kill someone and run. That is what good hitmen do. You're describing hitmen who tend to get caught by their behavior.

#+begin_quote
  but you're still insisting that any imperfection in the method of the murder or coverup should result in a solved crime. It's simply not the case.
#+end_quote

I'm pushing forward a more limited case- people should be able to tell what happened in the world. If someone is killed, they can tell by what pokemon, they can tell who was killed, they can tell what the job of the person killed was and talk about it with their companions.

If they do overt things like kill everyone investigating them, that is somewhat risky- a reasonably competent police force could investigate the people who were killed and work out what they were doing before death. They do all the basic stuff a reasonably competent cop would do- do an autopsy, ask what the person killed was doing before they died, talk with colleagues.

If people were stalking them for a while, especially in a city, there's a good chance they could discover that.

It would be good to not leave that evidence, hence why killing everyone who investigates them is risky. And like with the mafia, there likely would be evidence of their crimes and the police would be aware of their actions. They just wouldn't be aware they were working for some common purpose, I agree with you on that.

#+begin_quote
  Again, drawing assumptions out of lack of knowledge: what there are pokemon very good at killing in just about every region.
#+end_quote

You need pokemon that can effectively kill people from a distance, or those people are likely to dodge or draw out weapons or call someone. There aren't effective long ranged pokemon in every region. That means you have to get close and personal, that means you have to get the crime scene dirty.

#+begin_quote
  as evidenced by the "the data doesn't back up competent hitmen" generalization.
#+end_quote

I can see why from your perspective I would have flawed judgement, but since I never said "The data doesn't back up competent hitmen" your perspective is inaccurate. You are making up arguments for me, strawmen. This is why I regularly quote you- if you have some disagreement with me it's a lot easier if you express that when I say something, rather than making something up later.

#+begin_quote
  When your arguments are all based on badly applied overgeneralizations of data, and special pleading to ignore any contexts or factors that make your proposed scenarios less likely.
#+end_quote

This statement would be a lot better with concrete evidence. You generally just make vague statements like 'the hitmen wouldn't be discovered if they killed someone as the autopsy would just reveal it was a wild pokemon.' you're giving me somewhat incomplete contexts and factors that don't really follow through fully.

Let's take a hypothetical scenario. Someone goes to Cerulean City, and talks to Bill, he gives them some information on a lost colleague. They then investigate an abandoned house, searching for evidence of a crime done. This house is abandoned because a scientist was taken from in by the crime team, so they want to kill him.

How do they kill him. Do they attack him in a back alley? Do they follow him around for a while to find a good time? How do they avoid cameras? What do they do if he has a pokemon out to protect him? What if he has a companion? Where do they transport him to in the wild when they kill them? Do they fly there or walk, what if one route is monitored? How do they avoid being discovered in the wild? What if he is expecting to meet someone?

There's a lot of variables to that problem. You're not showing me any clear way to accomplish that, you're just saying it happens because competency.

Because of all those variables, that is why master hitmen don't try to conceal their kills. Or if they do, they pick vulnerable people who come to a location of their choosing like an abandoned factory. Too many variables means killing is likely to fail.

#+begin_quote
  And in your continued insistence on ignoring the concept of a competent criminal, you, a usual, ignore the idea that if any of that were the case, they wouldn't have targeted him.
#+end_quote

It is an established part of canon that he has an ex wife, so that ship is sailed. If he died, she would likely want all his stuff so she could have money. That is what relatives do- they try to suck money from you. You being an antisocial person won't stop them doing that.

#+begin_quote

They have instant healing technology, and the ability to upload people into data. They at several times modify these bits of data, with polygon say.

At this point we're assuming someone is investigating, not just a murder/disappearance, but a criminal investigation. There's no particular reason for them to do so in most cases, as we've agreed that even if someone suspects murder/kidnapping, that doesn't mean there's a conspiracy.

But let's say they do think it's a conspiracy: the only reason to kill them is if they actually unearth information. Having a lone conspiracy theorist out there isn't a big deal: clearly there are a number, for Oak to have heard of some of them. Most are probably completely off, but some might be right.

So how to murder someone in the pokemon world? Depends: do they live alone? If they do, sneak into their house while they're not home, wait for them in their bedroom with your Hitmonlee, and the second they walk through the door, order a kick strong enough to shatter stone. Chances of survival upon contact are negligible, and even if you survive, you're a broken mess, ready for a finishing blow.

Now you put their body in a commonly used box for Containers, absorb the body, and clean up whatever evidence there might be. If you want them to "disappear," drop the Container into the ocean. If you want their murder to be known, go to a secure, private location (where you can easily clean up any mess) and have your Nidorino (or Arcanine, or Graveler, or whatever) savage the body a bit: crush or bite their head off, trample/chew on their body a bit. Now bring the body to some nearby area where Nidorino/Arcanine/Graveler/etc are found and release the body.

Is it foolproof? No. Maybe someone notices inconsistency in the marks. Maybe someone notices less blood than there should be. But "I think this person might have been murdered" is a whole new hurdle to jump: I'm just presenting one possibility of countless.

The idea of uploading a corpse into data and analyzing the code is interesting, actually, and not something I considered before, but it still requires a) suspicion of foul play (going back to the "we don't autopsy every corpse" idea, not all deaths are treated like homicides without apparent reason first) and b) is still something that can be accounted for: my Hitmonlee hit his chest and head with the killing kicks? Better make sure my Nidorino particularly savages those parts, so there's all the original damage is overriden by the new one (or the flesh removed altogehter).

Assumptions.

They are the first person to come in, not a friend or family member or a pokemon.

They don't hear the person inside the house. This is a very unreliable thing- they may have ultra sensitive hearing or smell, or have a pokemon with ultra sensitive hearing or smell. They may even have a zubat, which sees with ultrasound.

They are the first one in their room. If their pokemon goes in first there will be problems.

Their security systems don't warn them, neighbors don't see them enter.

Their pokemon doesn't leave any marks when they kill the person and are silent. If they smash up the person's house or leave it splattered with blood or make a massive noise they are likely to draw attention. This is why I was assuming you would use a less physical pokemon. This would be a bloody, noisy attack, and very reliant on luck. I wouldn't expect it to have a high success rate.

Those are a lot of ifs that you can't really control for easily.

If they are really unlucky and did that to Red, they might meet Oak.

[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcayQInka-c]]

Fine, except for the smashed/ indented wall in their house, which the hitmonlee kicked them into, the large amount of blood sprayed everywhere which their forensics turns up despite scrubbing, and the decaying corpses of the mother and prof oak who wandered into that room along with the explosions and damage of the home from his fight with them, and his missing friends (see-canon) who died along with him when they came home with him.

I don't need to prove a 100% efficiency rate, just like you don't need to prove a 100% inefficiency rate: I'm just arguing that it's probable, with a lot of effort and competency, to get away with murder, and as the unsolved murder rate that you love to throw around so often (no matter how little it actually applies to the pokemon world) happens to agree with me, I don't really see why you're continuing this argument.

  I'm not sure this would be something you'd need to do. Nidorino can learn tackle and double kick, which would look like this. My main issue with this plan is the high level of luck it requires, and the blood stains coating the cracked wall of their house.
#+end_quote

Point taken on them knowing kicking. But luck can be mitigated against by planning (which is why there are actually things like highly coordinated capers and heists that can go off without a hitch), and I already said that they could clean up whatever blood there might be. Furthermore, you're assuming that he would kick the wall: why not just kick the person and cave their chest in? See how easy it is to play "what if?" from both sides?

But all I'm saying is "this is realistically probable," and you're saying "no it's not."

Which is a far harder burden of proof to meet in something as basic as "can competent people commit pre-planned crimes without getting caught?" Especially when you keep bringing up irrelevant "proof" like "X% of all murders, varying by region, including all the people who get drunk and shoot someone, or people who confess, or people who have absolutely no experience committing crimes and simply act on impulsive anger or jealousy, get caught, therefor it's improbable that your competent preplanned murders can do it without getting caught."

Special pleading, to the nth degree.

#+end_quote

There are other ways. For example, you mentioned that the solve rate was lower in drug filled/ gang areas. The evidence for the crime could lead to one of those, and he could rationally decide, perhaps after a bad experience, that it was too dangerous for him to go into and investigate further.

It's not really that, it's that your crime idea is one of the riskiest crimes he could possibly do, and is incredibly different from what real world competent hitmen do. In story it is incredibly likely that it would go wrong- if his mother walked into his room or one of his friends walked up or if one of his pokemon got cold feet it would go very badly for everyone.

It is about as stealthy as leaving a mine on a sidewalk and hoping it kills him, except less so since the owner is there.

When people do that they normally pick people with no reputable contacts in the world, like prostitutes and homeless people, or runaway kids. The sort who no one cares about People who are moderately wealthy inherently have contacts to the world which aren't easily removed even by being antisocial.

You can't just extend the "Serial killers can easily kill prostitutes" meme to middle class scientists with them just being antisocial.

[[http://boston.com/community/blogs/crime_punishment/2011/04/why_killers_target_prostitutes.html]]

?For a number of reasons, prostitutes are the most frequent victims targeted by serial murderers. Foremost is their easy accessibility to these predators. A sexual sadist can hunt the streets of the city or browse the ads on Craigslist, seeking out an available woman (and sometimes the man), looking selectively for the one who he finds most appealing, the one who can best satisfy his violent fantasies. And for money or drugs, the unfortunate prostitute will willingly participate in making his dream a reality, until it becomes too late to escape.

#+begin_quote
  From the killer's perspective, it is also psychologically easier to prey upon those he devalues. Seeing them as "sex machines," programmed to please, he feels little hesitancy or remorse. By dehumanizing his victims, he is killing someone that he views as beneath humanity.

  Most important, however, is that the killer who victimizes prostitutes can count on a slow response from law enforcement and minimal attention from the general public. Were he to abduct and kill some middle-class co-ed, the police response would be intense and immediate. But the disappearance of a known prostitute is not necessarily considered foul play, at least not until the remains of several victims are discovered in a remote dump site.
#+end_quote

Prostitutes have unique characteristics, like homeless people, that make them harder to investigate- a social stigma, high mobility, a lack of a home, the willingness to come to a particular location to be abducted- you can't emulate those characteristics just by making the scientist antisocial. He will still be a relatively respectable member of middle class Kanto who isn't normally mobile and isn't going to go to a crime filled area to be abducted, and who likely will have people being financially dependent on him.

A drunk impulsive person wouldn't fall foul to all the risks you listed above, like "what if someone else comes in?" If you don't have the competency to mitigate something like that by shifting observers on a household to get a sense of the person's schedule and habits, you don't really deserve to be called a "competent criminal organization."

I appreciate that you're probably just trying to get me to think of and include more specifics of how such a crime would work, but if that were the case you should probably stop bringing up ridiculously obvious problems as "handwaved competence." Anything that takes less than 10 seconds to think of a solution to is not a "handwave" to call competence, which is what makes it a catchall term for the thousands of possible scenarios and factors that might go into any given crime.

Also, you bring up bizarre things like this:

#+end_quote

Now you're just being ridiculous. "Several walls?" How about none. Reality isn't like cartoons or movies, where a body is going to smash into a wall and just keep going. Most of the force of the kick is absorbed by the body (otherwise it wouldn't do much damage), and the remainder is what sends them flying back. A kick to break a wall might be possible because of how concentrated the force is in a specific area, but unless the wall is made of cardboard, a body is far softer than the wall, and has enough surface area that it's just going to bounce. Maybe there'll be a crack where the head or pelvis hits, but nothing noticeably "human body shaped." Maybe someone looks at it and says "Foul play!" but far more likely is the understanding that sometimes, walls have cracks.

Also, Force = Mass x Acceleration. Smaller body = less force.

To be precise, none of them are a perfect fit. All of them were public crimes where it was clear what the motive was- steal something and sell it for money or notoriety.

That is what I am saying people in pokemon land could do. Observe the result crimes and deduce what had happened.

It would be best to avoid doing crimes that might expose the conspiracy by their results as such. For example, if Red was investigating them in a bad part of town, it might be better to kill him and make it look like a mugging than try to go to his house and kill him there. Make a clear and unambiguous motive.

Having a large number of people watching a person's house isn't very stealthy. It also increases the risk that someone will mess up, by involving more people.

There's no real easy to avoid the prongs of this issue. The more you watch someone, the more risk your watchers will be found out. The less you watch someone, the more risk your kill will have. You can try to find a good compromise but it's always going to be risky, and have a substantial risk of something going wrong and exposing you.

I was thinking of one of a modern Japanese wall. They often just have a fairly thin wooden wall, which breaks pretty easily.

#+begin_quote
  Also, Force = Mass x Acceleration. Smaller body = less force.

Actually, mass1*acceleration

So the hitmonlee has a certain mass and acceleration. They will impart this acceleration to whatever they hit, which will have the same force. The greater the mass of the object it hits, the less it will accelerate.

Emotionally, your team rocket is annoying because they make everyone around them hold idiot balls.

People being smart is a big thing of what makes rational stories fun. You see very intelligent evil people do bad things. Then you see very intelligent good people try to counteract those bad things. You see moderately intelligent people in both sides make the best of the options available to them to survive.

Now, your case for your Team Rocket being able to do those crimes isn't very good. For example, you were not able to name any crimes similar to yours where the people weren't immediately discovered. But let's assume it is. Let's suppose they hacked government surveillance cameras, and they can see everything. They can produce convincing doubles with ditto, teleport people out with kadabra.

Kidnapping a person is simply a matter of finding them on the cameras, teleporting in, replacing them with doubles, and telling those doubles to take a train to a faraway land.

If your team rocket was far enough above our world to do something like that then your story would be pretty dull without similarly powerful people on the opposite side. You have given team rocket a death star without giving frodo a lightsaber.

And that doesn't make for a very fun story. It's boring seeing Oak not know what is happening and not try to do much to find out.

I can't even argue most of your points, because I'm intent on keeping it all hypothetical to avoid spoilers, and you're intent on using each and every possible hint of uncertainty as proof positive that your perspective is the only possible one.

But it's not the majority of the feedback I've gotten, at all.

According to [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder#Incidence][Wikipedia]] in 2007 the unsolved murder rate in the United States was 39%.

That rate is biased by high crime urban areas.

Rural areas have a much higher solve rate.

*** Semi-agreed. An interlude would normally be "short and sweet", but if it's sweet enough to justify including in the first place, it's sweet enough that this aspect of your story/world should be fully developed and included in the primary, secondary or tertiary storyline. Doing so does require more work on developing characters, locations, devices, etc and giving them full-blown plots of their own, but it's more rewarding for the reader.

*** Rewrite complete! Looking forward to any new feedback you might have on it :) I know I probably won't win you over to the idea of non-self-contained chapters of alternate perspectives, but hopefully you find this one far less "space filly."
