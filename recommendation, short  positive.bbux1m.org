** Removed this as being low effort and (in the second half) off-topic. Go [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bauwc6/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/][use the Monday thread]] if you have a request. Also, do more work to make your posts readable if you're going to be posting here in the future.

*** Its the shortest complete rational fiction book that I'm aware of. And by short, i mean that it took me 4-6 hours to read.
