**** /Worm/ tackles many different issues. One of them is at least rational-adjacent: how do you create a universe with standard superhero conventions -- which were originally developed for children -- and make them work for an older audience? After all, secret identities, masks and costumes, non-lethal confrontations, "deranged supervillains", mad scientists and other elements common in classic superhero comics are not something that you would expect to arise even if some humans suddenly obtained superpowers in real life. /Worm/ goes out of its way to create a universe where comics conventions sort of make sense.

Recommendations:

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-bad-name-worm-oc-the-gamer.500626/][A Bad Name]] is a gamer-fic done well. The game layer is actually explored as the protagonist progresses, and it actually shows character growth when it's linked to an improving intelligence stat.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal][Friendship is Optimal]] is a look at an almost-perfectly programmed A.I. and the resulting singularity, with added ponies.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/91933/friendship-is-optimal-always-say-no][Friendship is Optimal: Always Say No]] follows someone who has refused to upload when most of the world already has. The A.I. always wins in Optimalverse stories, but they're about the journey more than the destination.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/69770/friendship-is-optimal-caelum-est-conterrens][Friendship Is Optimal: Caelum Est Conterrens]] another Optimalverse story, this one endorsed by Yudkowsky himself. The title translates to “Heaven is Terrifying,” and that really says it all, doesn't it?

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/95424/mortal][Mortal]] is a more traditionally “rational” story. When you have a way to defeat death, /why not/? Contains ponies.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/196256/the-moons-apprentice][The Moon's Apprentice]] is basically [[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/1][HPMOR]] but ponies.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/368986/message-in-a-bottle][Message in a Bottle]] is a sci-fi story where a probe from Earth hits an alien ring world which is also a superintelligence. But with ponies.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/260906/a-white-mare][A White Mare]] is something that seems almost made for this subreddit. An alicorn from another world with the talent of ruling a nation pulls out all the stops to return home, and also keep the friend she made on Earth while deprived of her powers. Contains ponies and memetic doomsday weapons.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/429190/the-longest-day][The Longest Day]] is literally HPMOR but with ponies. It's a crossover, and a well-written one. The author is also something of an artist, and made a comic strip to supplement the story.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/232796/binary-suns][Binary Suns]] is only one chapter in length, but it rationally explores what happens when an immortal ruler wakes up to find there are two of her.

**** I've been on a bit of a binge lately. When looking for fan fiction, I'll go from one fandom to another, consuming everything in sight before heading to the next. My last few fandoms were Starcraft, HTTYD, Worm, RWBY, Star Wars, Harry Potter, and now ponies. There seems to be a significant overlap of people who write rational stories and those who write pony stories, so they've earned a few spots on my favorites list.
