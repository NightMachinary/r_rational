I've been thinking about writing a rational rocketpunk story. Anything I ought to watch out for while doing so? What about other punk subgeneres like Steam, Cyber, or Clock?


** The principal factor in -punk is radical politics and aesthetics.

You need to push an agenda with your entire world:

- Cyberpunk has the archetypical establishment/anarchist angle of the free market neo-liberal Corporations and the anonymous hacker collective underdogs.
- Steampunk has a lot of plots you can lift directly from pre-WWI era politics, such as communism (the haves vs the have-nots), secularism (progressives vs conservatives), and good old us vs them intrigue.

Rocket/Atompunk is inspired by Cold-War era, so you need to investigate the conflict of US-style liberalism and USSR communism.

Plots to consider:

- US union busting b/c red scare.
- Disestablishment of the corrupt communist state from within leading to the fall of the USSR.
- Destruction of social trust within USSR.
- Propaganda.
- Espionage.
- Nuclear arms race, balancing the world on a knife's-edge of destruction every day.

Ideas to consider:

- Don't base your story in US or USSR. Base it in a sattelite state of either --- less power â‡’ more restriction. Sandersonian! The best Cold-War era spy thrillers take place in Europe.
- The space race was a show of force: if we can put a rocket on the moon, we can put a rocket in Moscow.
- The US is not the good guys. The USSR is not the bad guys. This is two extremist ideologies clashing because humans are dumb.

Aesthetic-wise, you should really focus on all the little things that make then different from now. Slowness of computation comes to mind; bulkiness of technological equipment. Criticise society, but not to draw parallels to the real world; the reader will draw their own parallels.

That's about it.

*** Some other potential Cold War stories to take inspiration form:

- [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra][MK Ultra]]: It started with /"hey LSD is active in really small dosages, I bet we can dose people very clandestinely; let's see if we can find a use for it"/. It ended up creating the Unibomber, abusing the mentally ill, and kidnapping people from Brothels to interrogate them with LSD. This could be a great way to show the cruelty and irrationality on both sides, perhaps as an antagonistic force?

- [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Azorian][Project Azorian]], the time the CIA stole a sunken submarine with help from Howard Hughes. This really shows how crazy the CIA got with their planning and engineering capability. The USSR was more old school spycraft, where as the CIA was the new kid on the block.

- [[http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2554/1][Salyut 7]], the time the CIA almost invaded a Societ Satellite except for some bad weather. This one is especially relevant because of space!

** Could you please give more details about your story? I can provide more concrete advice that way. Also, I am interested :)

In my opinion, -punk stories should give focus to the following points:

*Point(s) of divergence*

Why civilization in your world developed in a significantly different way? Is it because humanity had a different set of resources at its disposal? For example, [[http://mythcreants.com/blog/looking-under-your-worlds-skin/][this article]] details a world where Stone Age was followed by Helium and Uranium Ages.

*Technological progress*

Static -punk world, in my opinion, is even more strange than static medieval world. People start new projects, search for new applications of discovered technology. Your heroes might read the news and imagine how the world will change in 5-10 years (and give completely wrong predictions about that, possibly!).

*Revolutions*

Oppression is featured prominently in steampunk and cyberpunk (I am not so sure about clockpunk and rocketpunk). Just remember that there are more ways to change the corrupt system than assasination and reformation.

  Violence is the most common method of advancing a cause in most fantasy books. It need not be the only one. Teaching someone to read can be a revolutionary activity <...> So can sheltering refugees, providing people space to practice their religion, copying down or passing along information, remembering what someone else wants you to forget, making speeches, drawing cartoons, writing articles...
