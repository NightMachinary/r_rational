Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/
- Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is /also/ the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** I'm continuing to do worldbuilding and magic system work on /Shadows of the Limelight 2: Electric Boogaloo/. You can read the two appendices [[https://alexanderwales.com/shadows24/][here]] and [[http://alexanderwales.com/shadows25/][here]], but the short version is that fame gives you powers, and those powers all relate to a domain in one way or another.

One of the big things that I'd want to do in a years-later sequel is expand upon the domain system. As it stood in /Shadows/, it was ~60 domains, each of them a single-word noun that referenced a specific animal, material, or phenomena.

For the expansion (which either works in-universe as an upset in the alternate dimension meme-beast ecosystem, or as its own thing in an unrelated universe), this means many more nouns, and some verbs as well, meaning that people (in-universe) don't have a memorized domain list along with best practices, established strategies, etc., they have to tailor themselves more closely to individuals. I'm still working through the implications of this though, because it inevitably weakens the system somewhat, while also opening up the possibility for some really "out there" domains. But this brings it back to the "if there are lots of different powers, we need to do some math on power distribution, who's disrupting what, what systems arise from those power distributions, and the powerful corner cases, along with rules for it all" problem (the ITALODP,WNTOSMOPD,WDW,WSAFTPD,ATPCC,AWRFIA problem, for short). That's always thorny.

*So,* if you've read [[http://alexanderwales.com/shadows/][/Shadows of the Limelight/]], or at least the appendicies, then what domains are cool or powerful as implied by either the text, the appendicies, or your imagination?

(I've been sick with norovirus the last few days and I'm on the tail end of it. Hopefully this (and the other writing I've been doing) is coherent.)

*** From the appendices, it sounds like it might be possible for there to be a domain of something that is part of the popular consciousness but is nonetheless false. For example, domains of miasma (as in the miasma theory of disease) or of phlogiston. If so, how would these manifest?

Alternatively, what happens if a domain suddenly becomes broader in scope? For example, if sound and heat become popularly understood to be based on the same principles, would an Illustrati with a single one of those domains gain the abilities of the other?

Have you read Jayne's "The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind"? (EDIT: not endorsing its accuracy) This seems like the kind of memetic shift that might be relevant, and could produce a domain of Thought or similar.

I like the idea of a domain of Self, which would allow great control over one's own body and mind only. Maybe they could use the domain kinesis to fling themselves about or fly?

Also, a lot of the domains deal with substances or processes. What about other abstract categories, such as shapes? Could you have a domain of Wheels? That would presumably be substance-agnostic (inasmuch as the substance could serve as a wheel) but would depend instead on how much the substance counts as being a wheel.

*** What about other cultures, say on a distant continent, with poor communication between them?

Being part of the same world, they would run on the same fame-based magic system; but being really, really separated for a long time, they'll be working with different cultures (and the difference in cultures would affect the magic available to their respective heros).

Thus, if (as an example) Light is seen in the other continent as mainly searing, blinding, burning and Dark is seen as cooling, comforting, calming, then perhaps a Dark user from the other continent can use his powers in a healing/restorative way unavailable to Dark users from the main continent. (Sure, there'll be a lot of overlap in what Dark users can do, but the differences can still make an interesting contrast).

At the same time, the new (and presumably recently contacted) culture is a /resource/ - magic users already famed on one continent who move over to the other continent and become famous there as well will have rather significantly more power than those who stick to just one continent.

*** Oh hey, I loved Shadows of the Limelight, though it's been a while.

​

I wonder if you could have a Domain of Mystery? In other words, the more rumored the person is, the more powerful they become, but the cost is they can't allow anyone to survive that they appear before, because truth is antithematic. They can only leave behind calling cards that identify any particular deed as having been committed by them. And of course, they need to exterminate people who might leave behind false calling cards.

​

Even if you have a lot of nouns, I imagine a fair number of them will be able to be grouped. Elemental, archetypal, spiritual, of or related to the human condition, that sort of thing. Good luck with it!

**** I put a fair amount of importance on the ability of any such system to easily distill a power down into something that can be easily grasped just from hearing the one word it's associated with, which 'Mystery' is a bad candidate for, or at least one that needs to fit within a greater class. Basically, if I were coding this, and I had to make a special case for a word, then I'd probably just nix that word, because there are tens of thousands of words, which means hundreds of corner cases.

I think you can break them out into different /groups/ fairly easily, e.g. "Emotions", "Materials", "Physical Verbs", "Intellectual Verbs", and it might just be a matter of creating enough "special" cases that there's enough coverage ... but it's kind of hard to say for certain without actually breaking it down.

(/Shadows/ always had a little bit of superhero in its DNA, but I'm trying to resist my temptation to just go full-blown Worm, where everyone has some power that's unique to them, whether or not they fall into a classification system, in part because that means that everyone needs at least a little bit of an introduction to their power on top of their introduction as a person.)

*** What about space, time, electrons/lightning, gravity, and magnetism. I don't quite remember how advanced civilization was in Shadows but time, lightning, and gravity would probably be well-known concepts, if not particularly well understood. I'm not going to pretend like I have a strong enough grasp on the physics of time and space to extrapolate what generating, moving, or altering them would do though ( perhaps something like Vista from Worm in the case of space). Electricity and magnetism have some potential to mimic each other as well, kind of like heat and sound, although they're not quite as similar. I've always liked the idea of being able to pretend like you have access to a certain kind of magic by manipulating the properties of another. So you could generate strong currents in mental rings to produce a magnetic field strong enough to propel a piece of metal or fluctuate a magnetic field to produce an electric current (if I'm recalling the physics correctly).

​

On a weirder level what about Domains based on the metaphorical usage of terms like life and death. You could breathe life into an idea or movement, kind of like soothing/rioting in Mistborn but targeting memes (or emotions attached to memes) instead of emotions. Not sure how this would fit in with genesis, alteration, and movement though, unless killing an idea generated apathy towards it and breathing life into it generated whatever concoction of emotions lead to intrigue and excitement. Could also be used to make people more lively or feel like death, I'm sure there are more metaphors to work with.

​

As a side note, if the intensity or frequency of thoughts about someone influences their fame, a small cult of extremely (psychotically) devoted followers could be an interesting plot device.

​

Oxygen? It's very relevant to human life, well-known, works as a "material" Domain, and it would probably have a fair amount of creative possibilities and synergy with other domains.

*** Memories (and other things) seem to be stored in the brain as linked nodes. For this reason, it's often the case that certain stimuli get associated with certain memories, for reasons that really aren't that objectively great. The smell of a rose can trigger a memory from childhood, which is a human pleasure, but the functionality of that is kind of bad, since it seems like it's "designed" for a small use case and then applied all over the place.

If you could take a look at those nodes, you could reconfigure the whole graph so that, say, doing diagnostic work as a doctor wouldn't tend to bring up irrelevant memories. It would also pretty effectively allow us to remove a lot of the triggers for various mental maladies, like PTSD.

I think that would probably be enough for a relatively small and tightly constrained mental magic system, though the biggest impact would probably be the ability to remove memories by unlinking them.

***** I don't think the brain has a garbage collector so I'm guessing they would remain in "storage". Although, I read a paper a while back about some experiment where neurons were injected into an animal brain and the preexisting neurons started forming connections with the injected ones. So maybe the brain would try to form connections with with the cluster of neurons with no references/pointers/synapses, resulting in some sort of upkeep requirements.

****** The brain does actually have a garbage collector in a manner of speaking. If neurons aren't used they will rewire themselves so that they are used. This is evident in the brains of people that get struck blind or deaf. Over time the neurons in the areas that used to process information from the absent sense change to start assisting in the processing of other information instead.

**** I didn't even think about how it could effect mental trauma, that would be a huge plus. Another large benefit over changing stored memory is that you could change the method that it's stored, get rid of duplicate memories and move everything around to preserve spatial locality within memories when possible. Not sure how much of a difference it would make, but it theoretically should make you think a little bit faster.

If you could link memories by yourself you could do a lot of mental fuckery. Make it so that you can't remember specific things without certain stimuli, prime yourself to have certain memories and knowledge in certain scenarios.
