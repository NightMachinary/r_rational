** I love this SO MUCH.

e: By the way, hold on, is that meant to be "marital arts" or "martial arts"? Because in context it could be either.

Why?! I mean, yes, I get the reason why she'd be useful, but you've already had her in much the same position, with her daughter as a hostage, and she attempted to murder you. Yes, you have her imprisoned, but that has never done more than briefly inconvenience her before. Why wouldn't she escape and do it again, now that you're in a significantly worse position?!

This violates a whole bunch of Evil Overlord rules, most especially #16.

Also, handwaving away the part where she gets recaptured seems both like a wasted opportunity for something badass, as well as a real challenge to maintain suspension of disbelief. The idea of Bill not dying due to a technicality is one thing; the idea of a bunch of mooks standing any chance against the force of nature that the Bride showed herself to be in the movies just renders the whole thing nonsensical without some sort of explanation.

**** As I said, /I get why she's useful/, but honestly, this feels like about two scenes in the movie, /maybe/ three if there's a flashback explaining how she acquired the skill to do it, before she murders him. Again. More painfully, this time.

He has a /very/ long time, presumably a lot of money, lots of loyal followers, and the memory of what was done to him, to use to figure out how to replicate the technique himself. It's a stupid, unnecessary risk to keep the person who knows his weakness, has shown an ability to overcome any obstacles between herself and revenge, and /has every reason in the world to want to murder him/, including /keeping her daughter from her/ */again/*, in an easily-escapable trap near where he sleeps.

Congratulations, Bill. You had the chance to become functionally immortal, and instead, added a half hour (at most) to the movie's run time and gave it back its original title.

****** Even so, she has punched and dug her way out of her own grave, which is [[https://mythresults.com/coffin-punch][physically impossible]], and Bill knows that she has been taught techniques that he has not by their mutual mentor, to whom Bill attributes supernatural abilities. Movie or not, he has, in the most literal sense, /no idea what she could possibly be capable of./ If you don't like Rule #16 from the Evil Overlord List, how about Rule #1 from Quirrell's? *"I will not go around provoking strong, vicious enemies."* That one is wise, no matter if you're in a movie or not.

What he did is just a bad idea. And trying to kill her hasn't worked out much better for him, so that's off the table, too. His best option would have been to change his name and then go on with his plan, with the intention that she never learns he's alive, and then work more openly once she's died of old age.

******* If I was in his place I'd recognize the risk of her overcoming the obstacles but he has done a lot more this time around to minimize the risk. However, it's easy to believe that at this point the risk of him dying from taking an accidental step from potentially not finding the technique on his own can be just as high or higher. On top of that, it must suck so much to be confined in that situation.

And he is not simply provoking her, he is minimizing the risk by enforcing the Snake technique

I'm sorry, I'm not seeing anything he's done to minimize the risk other than throwing her in a pit and recruiting some more mooks to guard her, which, I admit, should mildly inconvenience her for the ten minutes (screen-time, maybe one night in real-time) it'll take for her to overcome those obstacles. Am I missing something?

Seriously, it's a pit. Since nothing is specified otherwise, I'm assuming the walls are made of the default thing that pits are dug into, which is earth.

I'm not any expert in prison design, but I'm pretty sure that the professionals don't segregate a maximum security prisoner by putting them in an earthen pit with a grate at the top. And, again, not an expert, but I suspect there's a good reason for that.

#+end_quote

By enforcing the Snake technique that she's overcome enough to attempt to kill him once already? And holding hostage her daughter, when his theory of how she was able to overcome that technique in the first place was that "parental love overrode my charm"?! Come on.
