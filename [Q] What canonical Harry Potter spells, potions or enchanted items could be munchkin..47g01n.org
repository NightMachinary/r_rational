I am looking for those items that a person of average intelligence without any special education would think of. Furthermore, I want effects that either result in the effective nullification of a canonical magical law or in a society that appears much different than the one found in the books.

These items must be the sort that could be obtained by an average magical person. So NO time turners.

** There aren't many magical laws in canon. Of those there are:

- Cannot create food from nothing - ok, just /engorgio/ a dust-speck and transfigure that into food. Or a thousand other ways.
- Can't raise the dead - I know you said no time-turners, but canonically, they're a more stable (read: can travel back further) container for the Hour-Reversal Charm, which can be learned.
- OK, OK, going back and replacing your friend with a convincing fake isn't /technically/ raising the dead. Neither is creating a portrait and teaching it to convincingly mimic you. Horcruxes aren't exactly commonplace ... consciousness in Harry Potter does exist in the brain, since transfiguring someone into an animal gives them the animal's brain; and spell research is possible; so I'd suggest this as a possible avenue to Transfigured clones. (Or if you just need a quick conversation, it's worth noting that Avada Kedavera stores a semi-tangible "echo" of the target in the caster's wand forever.)
- Incidentally, Horcruxes are created by the evil-ness of killing someone, and un-created by remorse; so you've just got to drive someone to murder in a convincing simulation, make a Horcrux, and then tell them it was fake so they don't feel bad about it. May or may not have harmful side-effects.
- In terms of social collapse: mind-modification is easy, so getting away with crimes is also pretty easy. Also, it's not that hard to control someone and put them in power. Both of these happened in canon, though.
- Since magical labour is basically the only scarce good in the wizarding world, and they have mind control, anyone who enslaves people is going to have an insurmountable economic advantage. I'm pretty sure Rowling didn't think of this.

** Harry Potter magic is full of exploitable loopholes that could basically make you an overpowered munchkin.

Transfiguration is probably one of the most powerful disciplines that we see in canon yet the main cast barely uses it to its full potential.

HP magic is incredibly versatile (especially since it appears to be conceptaul instead of anything reductionist) so if you have some skill and can think creatively you will go far.

For example think about the Confundus charm which basically makes the target believe almost anything temporarily. Not only is this a great mind control spell it could also be used in other novel ways. What if you perform a Confundus charm on a computer to trick it into giving you administrative privileges, you could basically hack into computers whenever you want.

And that's just off the top of my head, there are lots of possible uses for even the simplest of charms.

At what point can you be far enough outside of the range of the exceptions to Gamp's Law to be able to create food? Can proteins and vitamins be created if, for example, they were created as parts of rocks?

******* It's from one of the works of H.P. Lovecraft, who is recognised as having essentially invented the cosmic horror genre just under a century ago in the 20's. His works have had a bit of a resurgence in popularity, becoming the go-to inspiration for people who want a crazed, indifferent or otherwise horrifying greater power in their universe. D&D, LoL and countless books and stories use his ideas, really they pop up all over the place once you know what you're looking for, and his writing still holds up well today.

That line in particular is from The Call of Cthulu. It's all public domain by now you so you can [[http://www.dagonbytes.com/thelibrary/lovecraft/thecallofcthulhu.htm][freely read it online]] if you like.

Endless rows of lobotomized brains in jars churning out spells or simply gathering/channeling magic power, anyone?

As for muggles, it depends on what they can and cannot use. If you can create a spell (or spell framework) which artificially churns out artifacts that muggles can use, there are an /awful lot/ of muggles compared to wizards. 100,000 artificial stunner spells could do a lot in a wizard/muggle battle.
