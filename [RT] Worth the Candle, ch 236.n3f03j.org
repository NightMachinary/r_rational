** This is my headcanon; Toad-son, abandoned by his deadbeat dad, did not slip into hatred and resentment the way an unenlightened being would have. Rather, he only felt love for his father. Knowing about the impending fight he snuck into the FSEZ, waited for the perfect moment, and used all his power to do one thing; slow Fel Seed down enough that he could not dodge the sword. He didn't even need to tell anyone that he was the real hero, being with his dad after the fight was reward enough.

** It's very interesting how Joon has begun referring to Arthur as Uther even in internal narration; the DM corrected him to "Arthur" in Hellfall, and here he thinks to himself "Somewhere in there, Uther lay ahead of us.".

Speaking of Arthur, he's spent something like 500 years inside Long Stairs. That's a lot of time to spend reflecting on American jingoism in the middle east, and I eagerly await his conclusions.

** So what caused the antimemetic effect on FS?

- Was it a side-effect of the Mome Rath bone's use?

- Is it a standard power of the Vorpal Blade that its full strength destroys things even at the memetic level (which may be what Joon describes when he feels it cutting through more than the physical)?

- Was Fel Seed a meme, (hence allowing to return in the Library timelines and this one just like Figaro Finch, and also giving a bridge between Joon's creation of Fel Seed on earth and Fel Seed's origins on Aerb), and thus any true destruction of Fel Seed would necessarily occur at the memetic level?

*** I took it as "overdamage". Which is to say, that normally the most you could possibly drain yourself for the Vorpal Blade was 100%, but the sheer weight of the Mome Rath bones let him pour 10,000% of his strength in instead (and crucially, not all of it sourced from him himself).

So if 10% of Joon's own formidable life force was enough to smear an avatar of Fel Seed, and (say) 1000% of himself was enough to actually kill Fel Seed the person, then 10,000% of himself was so much overkill it spilled over into erasing the very idea of Fel Seed.

Either that or something something mixing in the antimemetic effects of the Mome Rath life force into the Vorpal Blade altered its effects. Perhaps burning Unicorn bones while killing a lesser being would retroactively remove it from history.

*** I feel like the narrative answer is "DM Fiat to metaphorically excise what Fel Seed represented from Joon's psyche". It's telling that he specifically couldn't avoid the vorpal strike; I'm not sure if it's the only thing that could ever have worked on him, but it feels like ending the fight with it was what "needed to happen"

As for the in-story explanation, it honestly might be all three. The idea of Fel Seed being unbeatable might need to be slain in order to beat him, and the vorpal blade might allow the Mome Rath antimemetic properties to propagate into where they needed to be in order to handle that.

As I speculated below, I don't think he is the biomanipulation exclusion. Rather, his exclusion is about fear and drawing power from people's fear - all your inner dark shit. Body horror was just how he did that.

Joon created Fel Seed in the real world to deal with his grief. Fel Seed was a manifestation of that grief.

This Fel Seed is the same. As long as people remember him he can regenerate form the fear and despair and depression he germinates in their hearts.

Someone, likely Amaryllis, realised this and set up the antimeme. Defeat Fel Seed and then wipe away all knowledge of him and he can't come back.

The line between this and being a meme is narrow but I think the difference is there is/was a real Fel Seed and the magic was about drawing power from people's fear rather than being it.

  So what caused the antimemetic effect on FS?
#+end_quote

My head canon is that Mome Rath and this antimemetic effect of the Vorpal Sword are part of the same magical phenomenon which is related to the briefly mentioned magic of Carrollism. Carrollism is one of the possible magics that Juniper thinks of when trapped in the illusion exclusion at Speculation and Scrutiny, and antimemetic magic could certainly cause some of the same effects. Mome Rath and the vorpal sword are obviously connected to the Jabberwocky poem, as is Fel Seed (A Manxome Foe). I think it's also tied in to Juniper's comments during the Mome Rath chapter about finding an idea that unified and tied together the idea of the vorpal sword in his Jabberwocky Cinematic Universe - he said that the idea of "cutting off the head" is scarier than it seems, and this kind of fate where all memory of you is destroyed, seems thematically appropriate.

This was my theory. We saw Figaro Finch return from death, and to me it seemed that this was suspiciously similar to how Fel Seed was described as returning from death. IMO the reason why Joon was able to kill him was because of drawing from Mome Rath (who?) bones, with their antimemetic effect.

**** Yeah, that was a thought I had as well.

Joon assumes that he's cheating, but early on he has a glimpse at Fel Seed's true nature, as a Death-Star-like giant organic factory and weapons platform.

Given that fact, and the huge number of entads Fel Seed would have at its disposal, /and/ the fact they're explicitly never harming it as much as blowing up the puppets it sends at them while hoping it humors them for long enough...

Saying that it cheats might be a bad assessment. Rather, it's like a larger-scale version of Bethel, where it has so many tools and super-powerful techniques accumulated over the centuries (maybe even something like in the DFEZ, where it breeds generation of mages of various categories to unlock new powers) that anybody taking its superficial form at face value would interpret what it's /actually/ able to do as diabolus ex machina bullshit.

(eg we see in an alternate timeline that the Fifth Empire tried to raze the zone to the bedrock, and nuke Thousand Brides... but it's possible FS just had backup "facilities" under the bedrock, or in other dimensions, etc)

** So... Is Fel Seed actually dead then? If so, that felt really wrong. I like how they won, it meshes, but it felt so much less dangerous than before. In the last fight it felt like every second spent fighting was a second spent in imminent death; he was one shotting invincible wards faster than people could perceive. He was killing people during the loops constantly but this time, he slashes at Raven and she survives? I mean he punches Pallida in the head, and she lives. This is the same guy who squeezed real hard and started breaking something inviolable. Iunno, it was almost like the GM turned down the difficulty.

#+begin_quote
  Heirloom entads were inextricably tied to the people who had inherited them, and they couldn't be divested of them by anything short of death. This had all the obvious knock-on effects you would expect, like incentive to kill someone with a lot of heirlooms if you were the next in line, and a concentration of power in the hands of the few, and all kinds of other things like that. Worse, there was a grace period between when entads were created and when they became bound to a person or a line, which meant that entads concentrated in the hands of people with power and money, helping to create solid dynasties like the one that Amaryllis was a part of. In his lifetime, Uther Penndraig had amassed a huge quantity of them, one which the Lost King's Court had been the beneficiaries of. *Strangely, and as one of the grand and impossible things that Uther had made his stock and trade, he had untethered himself from his stockpile before his long trip, leaving everyone ever after wondering whether he had ever truly died, or whether he would return to Anglecynn in its time of need.*

That said, thinking of the whole shebang as essentially a convenient display device for something much more abstract is honestly something I hadn't considered before now and makes a lot of sense. I suppose in that case even the "other entities" might not really be a thing so much as representations that will pop in and out when a specific manner of interface is required.

The only quibble I have is the DM at one point stating that he leaves some things to the Architect; this does imply a certain level of mental coherence/separation on their part, although if we consider the extrapolation thing above to have formed "a mind" that is managing Aerb, the DM could just be (or represent) the conscious, directing part of it.

FS in Aerb operated the same way. The DM could just retroactively give FS abilitys and preparations to beat anything they would bring against him.

When Joon died, the DM left the game. so FS would get no new abilities when needed and there was no more DM cheating than previously established. That way, they could beat FS by using a new approach. I'm quite sure the "clone Vorpal Blade" strategy wouldn't have worked on their first try.

I mean, Fel Seed is here literally not as the big bad, despite how much he was built up over the series, but as a stepping stone because that's not the level that Joon and co are operating at any more. So from a "reader looking at the narrative" rather than the events perspective, to mirror the shift in focus the characters have had, Joon getting rid of the person he once was and being better than he used to be (as was bought up in the chat with Fenn just last chapter), signified by wiping away the incarnation of his worst moment that he was frequently reminded of and constantly regretted throughout his time on Aerb, this scene works at that level.

I think the sidequest montage from earlier reinforces this too, as the lack of focus on having scenes that flowed together like earlier parts of the series is because the story as an adventure has taken a backseat to the story as focused on characters, drawn more from their overarching motivations than from their individual actions moment to moment. After like 1.5 million words, we've reached the point of getting an understanding of the characters, as readers, that skipping over the finer details for a larger scale perspective is doable, and fits with the plans of the characters themselves being concerned with the larger scale of their world/s too.

***** I think the fact that it wasn't so special this time around is the 'fair second chance' they were banking on. For similar reasons, I think that a Bethel-copied Vorpal Sword would not have worked last time, for one of a variety of reasons.

The narrative kept mentioning the hope of a fair fight or no cheating the second time around, and that's what this was. What made Fel Seed special was the unstoppable 'you lose' built into his definition, and once the DM stripped that away he was reduced to 'merely' an overwhelming puzzle boss.

The disappointment you feel is sorta intentional. The emotional set-up for a transcendental victory over Fel Seed could only happen if they won according to the original rules, but instead they were handed a different, nerfed, Fel Seed, and even if AW tried for a transcendental emotional victory it would have rang hollow, so he just didn't.

WtC Fel Seed works on a similar method. He's not the biomanipulation exclusion. That's just a lie, an easy manifestation, He's the 'all your dark inner shit made manifest' exclusion, with body horror just a way for him to tap into that.

This means that as long as people remember and fear him, as long as he can exist in peoples mind as an aspect of fear and desperation and grief, he can keep coming back. Per the Infinite Library even from a god confirmed total exclusion wipe.
