"Rationality" is a specific quality of any fictional work, independent of genres and settings. It describes the extent to which the work explores thoughtful behaviour of people [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_rationality][in honest pursuit of their goals]], as well as consequences of their behaviour on the fictional world or the story's plot. In highly-rational fiction, realistic intellectual agency is put above established literary tropes, and all other aspects of the narrative.

Highly-rational fiction could include one or more of the following features:

- Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.

- Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.

- Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.

- Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of *rationalist fiction*, a subcategory of rational fiction.

- Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.

Presence of these /particular/ features is not necessary: overall impression of the work is more important.

*Adjacent tropes:* Rational stories tend to include certain narrative elements. Though their presence /doesn't/ make a story more rational, this community highly enjoys them. Most important ones include:

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairPlayWhodunnit][Fair-Play Whodunnit]]: story's mysteries could be solved by attentive readers ahead of time.

- Absence of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina][Deus Ex Machina]]: established story rules are never broken.

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction][Deconstruction]]: genre tropes are re-imagined in a more realistic manner.

- Munchkinry: characters attempt to exploit their world's rules in creative, non-intuitive ways.

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy][Genre Savviness]]: characters are familiar with common genre tropes and try to avoid or exploit them.

‘Rationality' is a specific quality of fictional works - it does not simply mean ‘good', nor is all good writing necessarily rational.

A work of fiction is rational to the extent that it focuses on competent characters with consistent motivations proactively pursuing their goals in settings whose premises are rigorously thought-out and consistently applied.

In particular, characters in rational fiction often follow unorthodox or genre-defying courses of action which require clever planning, careful analysis, and the creative application of resources or knowledge.

Settings in rational fiction may or may not include fantastical elements, so long as the consequences of their underlying rules are carefully considered and taken seriously in crafting the story's world.

*Common Elements*

Though the presence of any particular feature below is not a requirement, the following characteristics and tropes appear often enough in rational fiction to help point to the cluster.

- Careful Worldbuilding: The "rules" a setting runs on remain consistent, as do their effects and implications. In preexisting settings (e.g. fanfiction), the author may seek to remove or justify incongruities, or to explore their implications.
- Fair-Play Whodunnit: A story's mysteries or problems could, in theory, be solved by attentive readers ahead of time, and the reader should be able to see at least in retrospect how the characters came up with their ideas.
- Munchkinry: Characters strive to exploit their world's rules and solve their problems by leveraging their available resources in creative ways.
- Cerebral Values: The story demonstrates the usefulness of deliberation, preparation, deduction, etc.
- Aspiring Rationalism: The story focuses on revealing characters' thinking, motives, decision-making, and/or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is often a particular feature of the rationalist fiction subgenre of rational fiction, particularly if the reader is meant to be able to take practical lessons from the work.

*In rational fiction:*

- The author displays respect for the value of intelligence, reason, forethought, and preparation.
- The author seeks to explore the moral and material implications of the elements in the story, as well as alternate solutions to presented problems, even if they violate the usual conventions of the genre.

Pursuant to the above, rational fiction *usually contains*:

- Consistent worldbuilding. In pre-established settings (like fanfiction) the author makes an effort to remove or justify seeming incongruities.
- Intelligent characters, who seek to understand the world, and to competently pursue their goals in accordance with their values.
- A focus on the thought-processes of the characters as they pursue said goals.
- Themes and topics that relate to the extensive exploration of solution-space, e.g. metaethics, effective altruism, munchkinism, transhumanism.

*In rational/ist/ fiction:*\\
In addition to the above,

- The author describes rationalist and scientific principles and techniques which can be applied by readers in real life.

** Sidebar definition
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: sidebar-definition
   :END:
*Rational fiction* is fiction which specifically emphasizes themes related to *rationality*, where "rationality" loosely refers to a set of ideals such as reason, science, thoughtfulness, learning, excellence, self-improvement, goal-directed behavior, optimal strategy, understanding how things work, and similar ideas. A defining feature of rational fiction is that it strives to stand up to careful reader scrutiny by proceeding /realistically/ given the setting, rather than according to standard literary forms or tropes (if these are used, they must be justified independently). Rational works should possess at least one, and preferably both, of the following attributes:

*Competent* characters: Characters possess at least [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent][Level 1 intelligence]]; that is, they act as intelligent agents optimizing to the best of their ability towards their goals. Characters do not ignore obvious opportunities and weaknesses for the sake of the plot.

*Consistent* settings: Settings obey rigorously applied rules. Every aspect of the plot and setting is a plausible consequence of the underlying rules and the initial setup, and conversely, logical consequences of the rules are not ignored for the sake of the plot.

These qualities apply to many works of fiction to some degree, but rational fiction respects them with an extra /thoroughness/. Other genres may relax the rules in order to establish a certain payoff: action that sacrifices physics for fun, thrillers that ignore probability for the sake of twists, literary fiction whose oddities are designed to be metaphorical rather than literal. In rational fiction, competence, consistency, and rationality are /themselves/ part of the payoff, and are not sacrificed for other considerations.

*Rationalist* fiction is a subgenre of rational fiction in which reasoning techniques are shown in a way that is realistic and /emulatable/ by the reader. Such works explicitly demonstrate techniques from science, logic, probability, game theory, decision theory, or other fields. The story is often structured like a puzzle that the reader can solve by applying such techniques.

Rational fiction has developed a set of common tropes which convey its aesthetics and ideals, including Munchkinry, Genre-savviness, Deconstruction, Worldbuilding, and others. For a more in-depth list with explanations, please read [the bullet points on the wiki](Link to the following bullet points on wiki). Also check out the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic][TvTropes definition]] of rational fiction and [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing][Yudkowsky's guide to writing intelligent characters]] to gain a better understanding of the genre.

- Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.

- Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".

- The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.

- The fictional world has consistent rules, and sticks to them.

As well as the above,

- Rationalist and scientific methods are used to demystify mysterious phenomena.

- The story shows rationalist techniques, which can be applied by readers.

- The story is like a puzzle; readers can reach the same solution as the characters by using the information provided earlier in the story.

*Characteristics of Rational Fiction:*

- All characters are [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent][Level 1 Intelligent]] or higher, meaning their thought-processes and behavioral patterns are consistent and realistic (i.e., they act and react /rationally/ - as if they were actual persons with agency - rather than simply acting to facilitate the plot).

  - If this were the only criterion, well-written works from every genre would qualify as rational fiction. Therefore, a work must also have a non world-building related rationalist-adjacent trope as its main thematic focus in order to qualify as rational fiction.

*Characteristics of Rationalist Fiction:*

- The main viewpoint character is [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level3intelligent][Level 3 Intelligent]].

- The thought-processes of the main viewpoint character are written in such a way that readers can absorb some of the character's techniques of good thinking (aka "Rationality").

  - This is the defining trait of rationalist fiction; showcasing a character's intelligence and thoughts and actions isn't the goal, it's a tool in service of the goal - to subtly teach the reader how to think and act more intelligently.

- The antagonist and most of the main supporting cast are often [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level2intelligent][Level 2 Intelligent]] or higher.

- All characters are [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent][Level 1 Intelligent]] or higher.

*Rationalist-Adjacent Tropes:*

- Achieving goals and resolving conflicts by applying techniques of good thinking (aka "Rationality")

- Self-awarness / genre-savviness

- Opposing positions pass the Ideological Turing Test

- Realistic villains who see themselves as the hero of their own story

- Consistent world-building

- Munchkinism

- Deconstruction

- Transhumanism

- Real-world application of the scientific method

- Grey and gray morality

- Blue and orange morality

Works not meeting the standard of either rational or rationalist fiction but which have extensive focus on two or more rationalist-adjacent tropes are classified as "rational-adjacent."

Rational fiction is fiction that is psychologically and socially realistic given the premise. In other words, characters, organizations and societies in works of rational fiction think and act in ways that are plausible given the rules of the setting.

This doesn't mean the setting itself has to be 100% realistic overall. Works of rational fiction can contain many fantastical elements, as long as their in-universe characters, organizations and societies think and act in ways that are plausible in such a setting.

This means that highly intelligent and sane characters must also think and act in ways that are plausible given the rules of the setting. So when highly intelligent and sane characters are portrayed in a work of rational fiction their intelligence and sanity is portrayed realistically. However, a work need not include highly intelligent and sane characters to be considered rational fiction.

*Rationalist Fiction* attempts to make the reader more rational. Here, "more rational" means more like a "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_agent][rational agent]]", a being that acts to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem][/maximize/ a coherent set of /preferences/]] according to a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomonoff%27s_theory_of_inductive_inference][/logically/ consistent, /empirically/ sound, /parsimonious/ worldview]].

Generally, rational fiction encourages us to try to come up with logical explanations for things, and to seek evidence for our beliefs, encouraging the reader towards a scientific, reductionist worldview. It also encourages us to view "simpler" hypotheses about the universe as more plausible - with a notion of "simplicity" that loosely alludes to more mathematically rigorous notions of simplicity in that it not include things that are merely "simple" for humans to think about, such as magical and supernatural explanations.

Additionally, it encourages us to build more coherent frameworks concerning our preferences, values, and what we want for the universe. Humanist and transhumanist frameworks are common, and the rejection of death and the notion that acceptance of death as good and natural represents a cognitive bias is a staple of this genre.

Finally, it encourages us to be more effective in pursuit of those goals. Explicit discussion of cognitive biases and techniques for identifying and reducing them are discussed, as well as useful heuristics for improving practical behavior.

*Rational fiction* generally invokes the same worldview as described above, but does not necessarily attempt to teach the reader in as explicit a manner. The criteria for rational fiction are loose and there is no single necessary nor sufficient criteria.

- the use of "common sense" to subvert common narrative tropes is a frequent theme, especially in fanfiction where the original characters did not do so. Sometimes, one character is at an advantage over other characters because they alone are able to use this common sense. Other times, all characters make good use of common sense. This can lead to the characters behaving very differently from what readers generally expect from fictional characters in the genre.

- Often, characters seek instrumental knowledge or power, or exploits a unique situation that they find themselves in to pursue an ambitious goal. This sometimes involves humanist or transhumanist themes, or plays with consequentialist/utilitarian takes on morality.

- Particularly in magical fantasy settings, rational and rationalist fiction often gives the sense that someone, whether the author, the narrator, or a character, cares about attempting to come up with logically consistent explanations of the world as presented...even when the world seems to resist such logical explanations. For instance, if magic exists, the characters may note that this means that the universe seems to have special rules which respect human minds, and furthermore they may note that this strange and resists reductionist explanations.

- It's common for an interplay of conflict and cooperation to revolve around different characters which each have unique set of coherent goals that they are trying to maximize. Some characters may even have completely alien goals, orthogonal to any human values, which they nevertheless pursue rationally. Concepts from game theory are sometimes implicitly or explicitly invoked.

- Sometimes, none of the characters are especially rational, but it is clear that the underlying world has been constructed by the author with an eye to logical consistency and a careful thinking through of implications.

- Sometimes the story itself explores some tangentially relevant philosophical or practical question.

...and so on. Generally, "you know it when you see it" applies.

/Rational/ fiction must meet the first two listed criteria. /Rationalist/ fiction must meet all three criteria.

*Concept* Conceptually, /rational/ fiction must include a clearly defined set of rules that the reader can analyze.

*Characters* At least one major character's arc must involve interacting with, analyzing, and understanding a ruleset in /rational/ fiction.
