Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** Battle school worldbuilding, pt. 3. ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7vwof7/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/dtw306v/][pt. 1]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7xim6q/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/du8n1im/][pt. 2]])

There are magical arenas whose primary purpose in the narrative is to provide a way for participants to fight to the death over and over without actually having them suffer the consequences of those deaths. (This in turn allows some variety and spice, because some fights within the narrative can take place /outside/ the arena, where that safety is not guaranteed.) When the fight is done, an adjudicator outside the arena will hit a switch (or do some magic) that will put all of the atoms back where they were when the fight began and repair any bonds that were broken.

Arenas come in four standard sizes. D-class arenas are 60 feet across, suitable mostly for quick, personal matches, and cost (the local equivalent of) $200,000. C-class arenas are 200 feet across, suitable for 2v2, or more protracted personal battles, and cost $600,000. B-class arenas are 500 feet across, nearly a football field, suitable for battle royales or a sprawling 5v5, usually with environmental complications, and cost $1,000,000. A-class arenas are 1000 feet across, suitable for the largest types of engagements, where positioning or environment matter a lot, and cost $2,000,000. Commoners usually pay for the privilege of using a community arena (owned by one of the elites); the wealth disparity is large enough that the elites mostly have their own, or part ownership in one of the larger ones (like a golf course). Arenas have no upkeep costs associated with them and do not take any energy to run. Time to expand the sphere depends on size - a minute for the small ones, fifteen minutes for the big ones. Time to snap back is roughly the same.

Arenas are always spherical, built to exacting standards, with a “ring” set into the ground that must be activated from the outside, and can only be deactivated from the outside. Once the arena is active, nothing goes in or out, which means that bouts (especially in smaller arenas) might be limited by available oxygen -- D-class would be 113K cubic feet, halved because it's a half-sphere, which seems like a lot of breathing room (har har), so maybe it's a non-issue unless it's a really long fight.

Once the arena is activated, you cannot leave -- nothing can. Arenas therefore perfectly resist weather, which might have some applications (especially for the large one) and provide some manner of defenses, except that the operator (or mechanism) is a weak point.

There are a number of consequences to the "atoms being put back where they are" mechanic. Namely, if energy is unaffected, then people can still see and hear what's going on in the arena (with sound being a bit muted). In addition, transmutation from one element to another (via e.g. radioactive decay) might mean that the atoms needed to put things back together don't exist, or that very minor errors are necessarily introduced in reconstruction. "Free" energy is a given, but I don't consider that too much of an issue -- probably patch to not completely break physics is that the "arena" does use energy, but that energy comes from random individual atoms being "eaten" by the magic in ways that are really hard to figure out.

(The loss of memories for the participants can probably be handled by one of the other magic systems - if you have your chakras filled, you resist the arena's attempts to undo your memories.)

More generally, this might be an outgrowth of some kind of magic system that can alter physical laws within really large spheres, which would have other applications in industry. Also might make for neat arena battles? Lowered gravity, changed speed of light (a nightmare to write), things like that?

This kind of magic system might tie into the central themes because:

- It's capital intensive, only the realm of the very rich, there are community arenas, but there you're always limited by money and time, which are already limits for commoners
- It's labor intensive, and gives more of a reason for the elites to suppress or devalue the non-elites
- Perhaps some comparison to be made between rich/poor sports like basketball/golf, in terms of entry?

*tl;dr: You can pay a large sum of money for a magical ring of stones that can project a sphere which will snap atoms (but not energy) back to their initial configuration. Atoms cannot pass through while the configuration is set. How do you use this to immediately fuck things up or become super wealthy, using no technology from after 1800?*

Edit: [[http://rerowland.com/bodyactivity.htm][This page]] is probably a useful starting point for "how bad would it be if all your atoms got snapped back to how they were a few minutes ago, but none of the radioactive decay was fixed". I'm not a physicist, nor is physics one of my areas of interest, so if someone could give an answer on a scale from "it would cause an explosion that would annihilate the surrounding mile of countryside" to "you could keep doing to forever without having to worry about cancer" I would appreciate it.

- Science. I can discover the properties of an object/material without destroying it or consuming any reagents, and without the risk of explosions, etc.

- Storage of perishable goods, especially food and ice.

- A pause-chamber for people with acute health problems when there's no doctor nearby.

- Delaying aging. If my memories persist in it, I study at the same time. If not, I /Worthing Saga/ my way into the future.

- Build six in a hexagon with an open space (holding the controls and your house) in the middle. This acts as unbreakable walls that can be dropped or raised at a moment's notice.

**** I feel kind of dumb for not thinking about perishable foods. Given the costs involved, your stasis units would be massive walk-ins, and given that the "snap back" doesn't deal with energy I don't think storing ice would actually do much (things would still heat up, I think?), but the thing that causes perishable food to spoil is mostly bacteria, and obviously bacterial (and other biological) processes get snapped back just like everything else. So food would only spoil when the bubble is down, which would only happen when someone wanted to retrieve something from within.

**** Not explicitly laid out in the rules above, I'm now realizing, but one variant of the magic (that I think I'm probably going to use) would be one in which you can elect to drop the arena shell /without/ resetting to the previous configuration.

The reason that I bring this up is in the context of medical procedures; if you had a risky one, you could put the doctor, nurses, and patient into the bubble, then do the procedure as many times as necessary until either your doctor burnt out, or you had achieved a good outcome. From a world-building perspective, I really like this, because A) it gives the elites another reason to have the arena in their house, and B) it adds a bit more to the rich/poor divide, given that the bubbles are expensive.

I'm /really/ going to have to figure out the side effects though, even if that just means making up a rule.

*** If you could make a sufficiently portable arena or teleport people into an arena and immediately raise the shield, you could use them to take political or other enemies prisoner. You wouldn't be able to kill them, obviously, but given that you know where they will be when the arena resets, you could set up some kind of trap to obliterate them the moment the shield falls.

I would expect societies with this technology to have remarkably little war. Interhouse rivalries can be settled "peacefully," using (magically?) binding contracts to ensure compliance with the results. As a result, none of the small scuffles which balloon into huge conflicts would get very far. Kingdoms could even agree to such terms on the logic that, if no conflict really occurs on the land they are fighting over, the winner gets it in pristine condition rather than as a pockmarked wasteland. Some kind of known-neutral arbiter would probably be necessary to write up war contracts, and there could be some intrigue if the arbiters aren't actually neutral.

From a mechanical perspective, the easiest way for the reset button to work is for the arena to just be simulating everything happening inside it, then only make changes to the memories of the people leaving them. No complex reassembly of humans and reconstruction of shattered brains, just lots of thinking followed by minor reality alterations. Doing this would also remove the possibility of using arenas as infinite energy sources.

From a narrative standpoint, I think simulation leaves a bit to be desired. /Ideally/, the magic ties into the themes, characterization, etc. of a work, and "reverting things to how they were before" has the benefit of being strongly thematic -- if the story is about how hard it is to change things, having one of the primary magics revert things to how they were meshes nicely. Simulation /narratively/ implies something totally different; it's about the nature of reality itself, or about levels of abstraction, or something like that.

The "infinite energy sources" thing isn't necessarily a bug, so long as the social/societal effects produced by the infinite energy sources are in line with the outcomes that I'm looking for. Given a 1700s level of technology, I'm actually not sure what infinite energy actually /does/ for them. Giant, expensive siege weapons? Heating in the winter? Extra light from a continually resetting bonfire? There are a few industrial processes that would be helped, especially in the realm of metallurgy, but I'll have to think about how much. (I'm actually not sure what the most effective form of heat/light generation would be, given that no air can come in or out, which would seem to rule out the old standby of just setting things on fire.)

I /somewhat/ disagree. I think having an outlet for monkeybrain stuff would probably be good, especially if it can be done in front of a whole host of people from both sides intently watching. However, this only works if people can agree to settle things with a match, which they won't necessarily do, especially if they know that they're not favored. You'd need a fairly strong "settling things in the arena" culture, with lots of social/cultural/legal penalties for not consenting to the arena.

** At 00:00 UST tomorrow morning, the world gets the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3dnmuj/d_bst_ff_munchkin_the_inheritance_magic_system/][Inheritance Cycle (eragon)]] magic system "patched in." About 1 in 100 people are mages, with another 7 in 100 being mindbreakers (capable of mindreading/telepathy/mental attacks, but not magic.) Everyone else gains the ability to sense and defend against mental attacks, but only with practice.

Mages and mindbreakers don't have an instinctive grasp of their abilities, although they will notice their senses are behaving differently, and be able to discover what they can do on their own eventually. We won't realize it's the Inheritance Cycle system immediately, but after a while, some Eragon fan is going to try really hard to cast "Brisingr" and in all likelihood kill themselves and people will start catching on.

Assuming you're a mage or a mindbreaker, how would you try to munchkin the worldstate for personal benefit? (assuming you're not, obviously the answer is "get good at defending your thoughts.)

To make things interesting, Christopher Paolini is also a mage, and can "discover" new words at a rate of about once a week, although these words are discovered more or less at random. Also, the probability of a person being a mindbreaker or a mage is weakly correlated with their general intelligence. People with 150 IQ might have a closer to 2/100 chance of being a mage or 14/100 chance of being a mindbreaker, while people with 60 IQ might have a 1/200 chance of being a mage, and 7/200 chance of being a mindbreaker. The chance doesn't increase linearly with IQ, though-- there's more to it than that.

What larger scale consequences are there?

--------------

Some thoughts:

- There's going to be a massive mortality rate in the first few weeks among mages, since as described in Eragon, even the most basic spells are incredibly difficult for new mages
- The ancient language violates simultaneity, but it takes frankly absurd amounts of energy to do so
- Cubic zirconia is going to be incredibly useful, since diamonds (IIRC) are one of the best gems for energy storage, and Cubic Zirconia can be manufactured on demand. I'd probably buy some stock of whichever company manufactures it.
- In the brief period before unsolicited mindreading gets outlawed, /so many/ secrets are going to leak.

** Help! I've been working on a story that involves a protagonist who is a high school student being targeted by an unknown antagonist by being trapped in a parallel dimension. The part I am having trouble with is why go to the trouble in the first place? I mean if you have the ability to put someone in a different reality, but it's a costly power where just killing the person is usually easier.

Why?

- Because it's funny (to the antagonist)
- Because the antagonist is a dick (see above)
- Because their ability to control the reality warping isn't particularly fine-grained (they /tried/ to kill the protagonist by pushing them halfway through a portal then closing it, but instead they just fell through, or somesuch)
- Maybe the antagonist needs to swap places with someone to change dimensions, and the protagonist drew the short straw?
- The antagonist wants the protagonist to suffer, but doesn't have the time to actually torture them, so instead they automate the process by placing the protagonist in to the nightmare realm.
- It's just a social experiment bro

** The kingdom of Colo is a country of snakes, where the king has absolute power and can do anything he wants without giving a damn about what the other snakes think. Yet because the king rarely decides to intervene in the affairs of the country, most citizens have led fairly peaceful lives.

But one day, the king summoned all his heirs, even his illegitimate children, and publicly announced that he would soon abdicate the throne, giving all of his powers to one of his children. Which child inherited the throne would be a partially democratic process: every citizen in the kingdom would be able to non-anonymously vote for which heir they wanted to be the next king, but some votes would be weighted more than others, in a manner only known to the king.

Furthermore, the king publicly declared that his legitimate heirs had to pass a test to show they were worthy of the throne: if they did not receive significantly more weighted votes than the illegitimate heirs, the throne would be given to the illegitimate heir with the most weight in votes. Then, without giving any of his heirs a chance to protest or do anything, the king turned his petrifying gaze upon them, freezing them into a state of suspended animation where they could only think, but not move or communicate in any way to meddle with the election process. Only the winning heir would be unpetrified in the end, with the rest left to the new king to do as he pleased. Then, with his announcements complete, the king disappeared, promising to return at a later date to determine the winner.

The king had two legitimate heirs, and it was well-known that while they were both highly intelligent and rational, they had diametrically opposed desires, and diametrically opposed visions for the future of the kingdom. Whoever won would definitely have the other killed and everything the other cared about ruined. Then there were the illegitimate heirs, that were a dime a dozen, but all with horribly warped personalities from their shoddy upbringing. The two princes had a small group of supporters, but these illegitimate heirs were supported by no one, and no one in their right mind would vote for them unless coerced to do so.

It is at this point in time that a thought occurs. Although the princes have been petrified to prevent their meddling in the election, they could still act in one way: they could pre-commit to find and torture any citizen who did not vote for them once they become king. The citizens shuddered at the thought. They were all cowards by nature, and would definitely vote for a prince if threatened with torture. But, they wondered, would the princes really pre-commit to do so? Was such a pre-commitment rational? I want to take this story in the direction where the citizens decide that the pre-commitment is irrational, using the following argument:

Suppose that it was. Then if it was rational for one prince to do so, it would also be rational for the other prince, and both princes would pre-commit to find and torture any citizen who did not vote for them once they become king. Then to avoid being tortured, the citizens of Colo would bend over backwards to obey. However, which prince should they obey then? If they obeyed one prince, and it turned out the other prince won, wouldn't they be horribly tortured by the new king?

Effectively, the optimal way for a citizen to avoid being tortured would be to desperately do everything in its power to vote for an heir and ensure that that heir wins. But then, given the king's test to his legitimate heirs, it would be far, far easier to make an illegitimate heir win. Thus if the princes were to pre-commit, would their plans not backfire and cause an illegitimate heir to win instead?

*** If you have intelligent, rational citizens, there's an alternative option. To pre-emptively negate the potential torture plans, conduct an anonymous primary election to determine which prince or illegitimate heir most deserves the throne and persuade everyone to openly vote only for the winner of the primary. This way, you don't have half of the citizens getting tortured, and you most likely exclude the illegitimate heirs with warped personalities, but you leave open the door for an illegitimate heir with a decent personality.

*** How fantastical?

One of my favorite historical examples of cause and effect is that the War of Spanish Succession lasted from 1701-1714, and then one of the Golden Ages of Piracy lasted from 1716-1726. The war had been cause to train a whole generation of skilled sailors with skill in combat, and the end of the war left them all unemployed, which led them to turn to piracy, which was uniquely suited to their skills.

So I guess the first thing that I would like out of a pirate setting is some explanation for why there are pirates. Historically, pirates are often nationalist and quasi-legitimized by one government as a tool of sabotaging trade, but if not that, then you need some reason that the goverments and navies of the world aren't doing something about the piracy problem, or why they're ineffective at combating it. I'd consider this an absolute must.

Other than that, I think the genre has a lot of staples that I really love; pirate havens, pirate codes, buried treasure, visiting with indigenous natives, norm-breaking by the outlaw pirates, etc. Some of this is just the Disney version of piracy as it actually existed, I'll admit, but there's at least some amount of historical truth to pieces of it.

Thanks for showing that importance the piracy age is a short transient history period. It can't last 100 years, measures will be taken.

The basic idea is that the setting must look like a now magic one starts familiar with it, and then slowly uncover magic and secrets. Not human races hiding among humans, krkaens taking the role of dragons in the sea etc.

I also need a god reason for why pirates keep hiding their treasure. IRL it happened only once. Most crews spent the money as soon as they earned it.
