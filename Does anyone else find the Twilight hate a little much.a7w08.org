** - What is meant by 'hate' in this context? (I have not spoken of Twilight with anyone, or overheard anything that I can recall.)

- Do in fact a significant number of people actually hate Twilight?

- Are there any common themes to the revulsion they express?

- What assertions does the story of Twilight make about the world?

**** Oh, so in the books they fuck whenever they can and sometimes argue and wonder about what they're doing with the other person and whether they're just settling and act like dickhats until it's pointed out to them in a tearful screaming argument from which they stomp out and then later apologize and feel incredibly trapped while wondering how on earth they could go on living if they other person left them?

*** I'll answer your bullet points in bullet point form! Since that would be easiest to read as a reply.

- I might just see the worst of it, but in most cases, where Twilight COULD conceivably be brought up, someone brings it up in a very negative context. One example is [[http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/a6zie/reddit_what_do_you_want_but_cant_have/c0g51h2][this comment tree]].

- Hatred of Twilight seems to be an internet-wide phenomenon. But again, it might just be that I see most of the internet through the eyes of sites like Reddit. I'll admit that elsewhere (The forums at Penny-Arcade, for example), I don't see it as much.

- I think the common themes are that the books are badly written, that they propose ideas which would be unhealthy for young girls to accept as reality, and that the films are badly made. There's also a lot of non-specific hatred, and I think these people are just following along, since there are a lot of people who haven't read the books or seen the films but still express hatred.

- Twilight is about a romance where a woman becomes dependent on a man, who is much stronger than her, and can't live without him. Visa versa, as well. Other people have stated other assertions, but it is my opinion that a lot of those assertions are disproven if you read more than one of the books.

Some of what you've said is true, and some of it isn't. Were you attempting to make a specific point? It seems that way, but I'm not sure what point it is you're trying to make.

Would you care to explain?

Edit: I deleted the comment that you had replied to, because I posted it twice. Probably should had deleted the one you DIDN'T reply to, huh?

[[http://www.reddit.com/user/sleepy_commentator][*sleepy_commentator*]]:

Yes, you should have. And I shouldn't have posted an oblique (non-rational) comment like that.

My point was that perhaps the books presents a model of romance that many people find to be unrealistic, unhealthy, or offensive in some way.

***** I absolutely agree! I'm not in any way denying that the model of romance presented by the books and film is realistic or healthy, and I can see why that's a good reason to dislike the series.

I guess the only thing I'm really complaining about is that people feel some need to be very outspoken about that dislike. I don't hear anyone mentioning their dislike for other things they dislike.

I guess the act of complaining about other people complaining too much is a little silly of me. I just wanted a discussion with which to kick off /rational.

****** I would guess that the three basic components are: firstly, a genuine umbrage provoked by the notion of romance presented in Twilight; secondly, the knowledge that the expression of this will actually meet with widespread agreement and social approval; and thirdly, the nominal widespread popularity of Twilight, which is of course not actually all that popular in those environments where such opinions tend to be expressed.

However, to be honest, my understanding of group social dynamics may be a little naive, or jaded, or naively jaded. Did you ever see the ending of /Prince of Darkness/? That was actually me emerging from my parent's basement to see what was going on with all the film crews.

*** I don't really understand what you're saying. Care to explain further?

Edit: I should probably point out that my position focuses on the fact that the hatred seems much more vocal than that for similar things.
