** Oh boy. Didn't expect all this Discourse.

I'm a fairly big believer in death of the author, but still think it's worth being informed of an author's biases when reading something and know that other people here probably /aren't/ believers in death of the author. If I were to recommend The Fountainhead to someone, I'd mention the author is a hardcore libertarian, or if I recommended something by a tankie I'd mention that too. But I'd still recommend and read the work.

Having a wrongthink bot, especially by someone who isn't a moderator of the subreddit, makes me a bit uncomfortable. Things like With This Ring being on it also feel over the top, where the objectionable topic was something like a single throwaway sentence 1million+ words into a great piece of fiction that is now being blacklisted due to Forum Drama. And I think Lightwaver is arguing in exceedingly bad faith in all of their comments about the topic of the bot.

And while /you/ might be fine offending everyone who doesn't share your political beliefs, /I/ don't want this community to turn into a vessel for your activism, and would ask the mods to enforce the rules against politics against you.

That's a weird way of putting it. There's one person who's tagged with that flag for political leanings, and I'd be comfortable calling him a Nazi just based on the fact that he tweets a substance indistinguishable from Nazi propaganda.

The other two people are tagged for problematic treatment of trans issues in their works, which again is reasonable (though it's also a super common attitude in China, so most Chinese web novels that cover trans issues will get tagged like that)

*** I had a discussion with lightwavers regarding Lord of Mysteries when they initially tagged it. You can see the discussion in the link (be sure to look at posting times). It's worth pointing out that they added the Objectionable Author Politics tag based solely on one reader mentioning that some of the characters exhibited an attitude that might imply transphobia, without any quotes or evidence. Lightwavers hadn't read it or obtained any evidence other than that hearsay (and initially pretended there were quotes provided). This is an incredibly low standard for putting a bot accusing someone of transphobia everytime their story is mentioned. I actually reread the chapters in question after someone else went to the effort of finding them, and found them pretty mundane, with only a couple of instances that could be uncharitably interpreted as implying a character was against trans people (specifically referring to magical sequences that secretly turn you into a man or a woman as a "trap." Maybe that refers to the derogatory english slang for a man that looks like a pretty woman, but it really takes a stretch considering the author is chinese, the work is translated, and the word is referring to the magical potions, not the person).

Moreover you shouldn't mistake the opinions of a character for the opinion of the author.

I will say that I also don't like the idea of policing author politics, even if they actually are evil. We shouldn't avoid a work just because we don't agree with the author, that way leads to small minded conformatism.

Lightwavers responded to this by saying that they are just providing a tag so if the reader doesn't want to support authors with "objectionable politics" they can read the linked post themselves. Certainly readers can choose which works to read however they want, but I find encouraging this very fraught.

Regardless there is still a big difference between mentioning this in a comment, and having a bot post said "objectionable author politics" tag on any mention of the work.

I'm not excited about it, but perhaps if lightwavers just puts a (?) link on all their posts (not just the ones that they think are objectionable), where prospective readers can check out author politics should that be important to them. Or they can just maintain a objectionable author list that people can check if they desire.

Proposed compromise: The tags already link to context, so maybe they could just be changed to say "Author Politics," or "Controversial Author Politics."

****** So you defended the Nazi without actually looking at the evidence presented that they were a Nazi. I mean ... that's fair, I guess, but perhaps don't act persecuted when you're called out on supporting said Nazi?

******** I'm having a hard time believing you wouldn't take three seconds to look at the links and actually ensure you're not supporting a Nazi. If you want to look at this positively, another way to phrase that is /I don't think you're stupid/.

********** Do you not agree that parroting actual Nazi propaganda makes someone a Nazi? Does someone have to be actually putting Jews in concentration camps before you can say they're a Nazi? And when someone actively supports someone is a Nazi, what what you call them? I have /never/ called you a Nazi sympathizer. All I said is that I believe you're acting in bad faith.

************ I mean, if I can't provide evidence, that kind of precludes me from supporting the cause, doesn't it? As I've said earlier, you supported an actual Nazi. I don't believe you're stupid enough to do so when you /know/ other people have called the person a Nazi and the evidence is right in front of you and then /not look at that evidence/.

************** The benefit of the doubt is when you wait for evidence to come out for or against something, and then act according to the evidence. You had the evidence in front of and didn't look at it, providing the Nazi with excuses when the evidence was right there that yes, they are a Nazi. That is not the benefit of the doubt. That is active support.
