** Poor Nessie, losing his cool toys. The Forever King only had one son, it's not like the Dead King can get a new one.

*** It seems like the Dead King is intentionally using the Revenants that were encountered before. The comments on the story page made it sound like he was basically throwing them away on a side venture so that they don't come back to narratively bite him later. But I bet he wouldn't have been put out if they won, either, since they may retain enough of their Role's weight to be able to establish patterns of three, etc. that he can manipulate, regardless of outcome (since of course, if you're stuck in a pattern with a Revenant you can't be in one with Neshamah at the same time).

**** This is the last they saw of him:

  She shaped Winter, but it was too little and too late. The Skein fell down from above, shattering the wheels with a massive paw.

  “You lose,” the Revenant crowed.

  The ground broke beneath our feet, and after that there was only the fall.

In the chapter after that:

  The Skein and the Spellblade should no longer be a part of this, at least. The Revenants would remain stuck in their little kingdoms.

**** Killing the Skein will be difficult, and it's *such* as useful defensive asset its unlikely the Dead King will send it out on such a stupid mission as a land grab. As long as its near his capital, he's pretty much unassailable by Heros and Villains alike unless he wants them along.

** I love Practical Guide, but Cat really needs to have a sit-down with Crow-mena and An-crow-nike and talk about religion.

It's good seeing our main character go from Rogue to Cleric and her usual on-the-spot improvisation, but she's the child of Black and really needs to figure out how some of this works.

Can *she* harvest Night like the Drow do? They claimed they could pull it from other living beings, and she's got two Revenants to harvest.

Can creatures /other/ than Drow worship the goddesses and gain the gifts of Night? She's a Human High Priestess, so it seems rather odd they'd exclude other beings who wish to worship them, but maybe even if they do they can't use the abilities.

If she can take all the Night away from a Drow, can she give it to someone (or something) else? Can she pick and choose abilities, memories, and skills? There's bound to be a lot of overlap in abilities, and plenty of abilities that can't be used (like that stonemason's skills, for instance), that can be 'moved' away from combat minions and given to utility minions to use. I'm sure the Drow wouldn't mind giving up some otherwise pointless-to-them skills like glassblowing or leatherworking that were passed down from their ancestors to non-Drow instead, and she could take the skills of veteran non-Drow soldiers who are too old or too wounded to fight and graft them onto a more bloodthirsty-but-inexperience Drow warrior to use.

[[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/09/07/chapter-53-gloom/][Ivah didn't even say as much]], it just got too terrified to answer Cat's questions. Eight silvers says the claiming ritual requires time/concerted effort/huge-ass ritual pyramid, and the breathing room for that is far enough away that she didn't expect to try before she goes north.

Why, though? The only nation that could theoretically be even remotely receptive to the "gain power in strife and forfeit everything gained to your future murderer in exchange" kind of deal is Levant, and every Levantine present (and the vast majority of potential recipients, for that matter) are Good enough to sign up for a crusade. Not to mention the narrative dead end of "the dark priestess offers the temptation of power" that would result from any kind of initiative on Catherine's part.

Worship in the Guideverse is a matter of genuine faith - the kind that Cat offered Sve Noc together with her crown. Nobody else had enough exposure to them for us to tell how common that's gonna be (and no, Hakram weebing out doesn't count). What form the general worship of the sisters will or will not take is a matter that will only barely start taking shape depending on how Cat's alliance shakes out, though it would be fun to see them having to cooperate with Augur.

You're overly focusing on the EXP gain system, which, aside from being Below-granted (and therefore compromised as far as Above's symmetrical response and its own reliability goes), was a half-sorcerous feature of the old Night. Aside from [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2019/04/29/chapter-33-concord/][speculating how it could change]], Cat's using the new, fully divine version, the effectiveness of which ([[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/05/18/chapter-15-bravura/][like pretty much every miracle so far]]) seems to at least partially depend on the intent behind it.

Look again at the fight in this chapter. Cat mostly casts debuffs, goes for the takedowns when she's sure she can make them work, but the one time she tries to shield Saint from the revenant's purification Aspect, she fails. She doesn't even try to touch Saint, but if I had to guess, any kind of buff would be similarly unstable. The credo goes "you are what you take", not "you are what you give freely".
