** For the first time, I am actually considering the possibility that not all of the children might actually make it out alive. I was confident that this manga would follow other shounen manga by having an "everyone lives!" ending. While I know that good stories are supposed to make me doubt this idea while reading, this chapter has succesfully shaken my belief in a guaranteed happy ending.

Props to the author for creating such an engaging story.

** Suddenly, I'm all the more curious how, exactly, William Minerva's pen is going to get them out of this.
