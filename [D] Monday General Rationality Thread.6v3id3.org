Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** I just stumbled on this community, and it's basically something I didn't know I was looking for. I'm creating a game in my spare time with several aspects of rationalist fiction.

First, a magic system that runs on an internal logic of the easy-to-learn difficult-to-master sort that the protagonists learn the 'rules' to as they progress.

Second, no objective good or evil. I will not be making the character's moral decisions for them, and conflict is driven by the same things it is in the real world, with every faction seeing themselves as the 'good guy'.

Third, I'm trying to create internally-consistent but blue and orange moral codes for several NPC factions, so resources are available to those who are willing to take the time to 'crack the code'.

It sounds like the most appropriate time to discuss my issues is only on Worldbuilding Wednesdays, and not the rest of the week. Do I have that correct? Thanks!

Making a conflict-driven story with several (I'm supposing you want more than two) factions that are compelling to the player and delivering it through gameplay is... um, actually pretty hard.

So, um, I'm not going to give you advice you didn't ask on a project you didn't explain, but... generally speaking, try to read up on narrative-driven games ? (Extra Credits probably has more than a few videos that would interest you)

** I just want to express my appreciation for what /My Hero Academia/ did with Froppy two weeks ago. I know [[/r/anime]] says she's just some rando writer's favorite, but she actually /is/ an excellent budding hero. What's her Quirk? "Does whatever a frog can". Why's she even here? Because she's serious, studious, ethical, and works well with others.

Or in other words, instead of having some easily exploitable superpower, she's there because she has the personal qualities necessary to make /any/ superpower useful.

Meanwhile, they've also made the Captain Marvel/America-style brick-of-muscle hero into a compelling character on his own, who struggles to maintain the masquerade that superheroes really can maintain peace in a world where villains have superpowers too. He's still trying his hardest to be the invincible man who saves the day with a smile, the Symbol of Peace, even while he's slowly dying.

I stopped watching after the tournament arc so I could binge the rest of the season when it ends, so I'm happy to hear that she gets more development. All-Might has been my favorite character from the beginning since I personally relate to his struggle to live up to his own standards.

I feel like building up a hero as Superman and then revealing its a facade has become a cliche in its own right, but HeroAca pulled it off for me by showing he really is trying to be the most morally righteous person he can be in the hope that it will inspire others to do the same. He wants to help others more than anything and will risk his life to do so even if it's not always the "smart" decision.

HeroAca is a show that deeply understands the fundamental themes of the American superhero genre, reinterpreted with the story structure and style of shonen anime, and delivers on the emotional appeal of those stories. I love that the show has become as popular as it has among kids since it teaches great lessons using the superhero school as a metaphor for the questions kids face when approaching adulthood.

We see examples of kids who were never given the chance to prove their abilities because of flawed social institutions and prejudices, families pressuring their children and kids pressuring themselves into professional success, the toxic masculinity that pervades the culture of success and competition, and Deku's arc is all about showing how hard his goals really are to achieve so he needs to work smarter than everyone else only to still face setbacks.

Even in that state, knowing all the reasons he had not to do something and having basically no plan or, he ran towards the danger in an attempt to help someone who hated him because he had to do /something/. Seeing him do that, in a world where many heroes value their status as celebrities or fighters more than helping people, pulled All-Might out of his depression to take action despite how much it would risk to him. That his speech to Deku afterward cemented their relationship as my favorite part of the series.

Now, the scene isn't flawless. Deku did act rashly and took unnecessary risks without a proper plan, which the show kind of glosses over in favor. However, it makes up for it later by focusing on Deku's cleverness in every other dangerous situation, and it doesn't matter that much anyway because the emotions of the moment are incredibly built up to and paid off. That's HeroAca in a nutshell, it delivers on the emotional satisfaction of its story so well that I only notice the wrinkles in the writing because I'm paying really close attention and thinking about the story so much.

** I am an Omnivore, leaning towards the carnivorous side of things. I probably consume some form of dairy or meat product 2-3 times a day.

Burgers which aren't actually from cows burgers have recently made it out the doors, and the responses are positive!

There are at least two such companies which are producing such products in large degrees.

There's the Impossible Burger: [[https://www.impossiblefoods.com/faq/]]

Then, there's Beyond Meat: [[http://beyondmeat.com/]]

Their various approaches are admirable, and interesting. Impossible Burgers license their meats to relatively-high-end restaurants, while Beyond Meat is selling to retailers like Walmart, Albertsons, etc.

I am thoroughly excited for these products, and I firmly believe they are a key ingredient to a post-scarcity world. According to impossible foods, using the life cycle assessment method, their burger, when said and done, takes up

#+begin_quote
  1/20th the land, 1/4th the water, and produces 1/8th the greenhouse gas emissions.
#+end_quote

Even if those numbers are off, and the impossible burger actually uses 1/10th the land and 1/2th water, I firmly believe that human QoL will be impacted positively if they can take a good chunk of actual meat producers.

#+begin_quote
  According to livestock researchers, animal agriculture uses 30% of all land, over 25% of all freshwater on Earth, and creates as much greenhouse gas emissions as all of the world's cars, trucks, trains, ships, and airplanes combined.
#+end_quote

This statistic set is misleading because they just say 'animal agriculture', while I'm referring specifically to cows, so take that stat with a grain of salt. Soy farming and their heme mfg processes may not be so impressive if lined up with the chicken industry.

Beyond Meat's Patties: [[http://beyondmeat.com/products/view/beyond-burger]]

Scroll down to bottom for Nutrition Facts. Not directly comparable, but note the lack of cholesterol.

Compare with a Quarter Pounder Deluxe: [[https://g.co/kgs/ipFCMD]]

Or even a McDouble: [[https://g.co/kgs/qAPGVG]]

Sadly, these Beef Alternative companies are paying lip servise to the Anti-GMO crowd, which honestly, they really shouldn't. I believe they should be doing everything they possibly can to scale up their production, and dumping the Anti-GMO, 110% Organic crowds like rocks.

I believe that the Beef industry is one of, if not the largest factor in America's health epidemics, additionally, I believe that Beef is a product which actively hinders our ability to move post-scarcity: it consumes way too much land, it is a huge vector for disease, cows are immensely destructive to the (public) lands they graze on, and Cattle requires active redirection of mass amounts of water to places where it /shouldn't/ be.

We can produce Soy in such larger quantites per acre than cows per acre, and have so much less waste overall, I will actively advocate for the death of Big Moo.

Impossible Foods currently produces 8,000 tons of their burgers per month, and received funding to build a factory that can do >1 million tons of meat every month. I hope to see the Impossible Burger beginning to appear on menus all across the country.

I believe that they (Impossible Foods at least) are not attacking these industries in an optimal fashion.

Impossible Foods is branching into Chicken, Dairy, and other animal meat-based products. Instead of that, I would like to see them move to replacing the entire Beef Cow industry, then move toward other animals. I also believe that Dairy is a slightly less destructive industry on Human QoL than Beef. Chicken is going to be a massively difficult industry to disrupt until we can get lab-grown Egg White and Egg yolk to become things.

I would like to see a larger focus on beef's more difficult items to replicate like various types of Steaks and Ribs instead.

If you see any other groups with products that pretend to be beef/dairy/poultry/other items, let me know. I'm down for the animal replacements to come.

The strongest point in favor of these replacements, is the sheer amount of cholesterol in the modern first world human diet. By creating a Burger replacement, I believe that reducing Cholesterol will help humans across the board.

As for disease vectors: Cattle that graze often require artificial water sources. Every time I've passed a water source for cattle in the wild, it was a massive breeding ground for mosquitos.

Other health benefits of getting rid of beef cattle would come with the freeing of land for more public use, and less waste as well as less methane/greenhouse gases in the air.

I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic here or not... No species of animal should ever be actively exterminated. Deer aren't even a blip on the radar when it comes to methane production. What's the point of mass exterminating an animal while trying to save the environment? (rhetorical question)

Deer + Car accidents is something which can be solved with responsible engineering. (Presumably, Self-Driving cars + current road solutions being implemented will solve the problem, re: humans)

Just a quick note: egg-laying and meat-producing chickens are practically unrelated industries, the same as beef cows and dairy cows. The animals have a common ancestor decades in the past, and that's about it for links between the industries.

Completely supplanting the meat-chicken industry would have minimal effects on the egg industry (same with dairy/beef).

It's helpful for you as a writer (confirms you have a solid concept, gives you a sense of how long each chapter will take to write and thus what kind of posting schedule you can keep, etc), but also for readers (generally leads to a more solid intro, because you can edit those chapters as a group).

** TL;DR: House reapportionment as political panacea, discuss.

A question that's been largely forgotten as his actual presidency proceeds is how Trump got elected. He lost the popular vote by a large margin, but won the electoral vote, the vote that matters, on the strength of mostly rural states. Now, at first glance this looks like a problem with the electoral college, favoring rural states. But why does it favor rural states?

Each state gets electoral votes equal to their number of senators and representatives. So what varies the number of electoral votes is the number of house seats each state has. The number of house seats for each state is prescribed by the constitution to be not less than 30,000 people per representative, as counted by the census every ten years. They specified a minimum population under the premise that each state would want to maximize their number of representatives, and would try to do so at each census.

But the last House reapportionment was in 1911. Not only has the population grown somewhat since then, the population distribution has shifted. Cities are bigger and denser, farming takes fewer people for greater output.

So, I say, let's be constitutional originalists. Let's have a House reapportionment that reflects the actual population of these United States. What would this look like?

First, with a population of more than 300 million, the new House has over ten thousand seats. Let's build them a grand new hall designed primarily to invoke the overview effect astronauts and cosmonauts experience. What would it mean to have so many representatives? It would mean smaller districts, which have several benefits: your representative is both more reliant on each individual constituent and less worthwhile to buy. Each one would have less personal power, and niche or even protest candidates would be more viable.

Second, smaller districts are harder to gerrymander. You can't have a district that snakes all around a city and gets all the poor, mostly black or hispanic areas if those areas are several dozen districts worth of people, and slices that group rural areas in with cities would have to get really thin and obvious. This massive redistricting effort would also be a good opportunity to try algorithmic redistricting and other anti gerrymandering districting schemes.

Third, to bring it back to the opening question, if representatives were proportional to population, electoral votes would be too, and the electoral vote would naturally more closely match the popular vote.

By this one, admittedly radical and complicated change, we fix several apparently unrelated problems.

**** I know about that case. The court ruled that it was basically the House's job to figure out apportionment, and that they hadn't technically violated the constitution in fixing the size of their own body. However, that's because of something I already mentioned, that the constitution only set a minimum district size, not a maximum.

This is problematical because the founders were relying on the states competing among themselves for more and more seats as the country grew. However, the members' own personal power shrinks when the size of the house grows, and with the House in charge of setting its own size and apportionment, the states' incentive to get more representatives is overwhelmed by the representatives' incentive to maintain their personal power.

Reapportionment without changing the size of the house misses almost all of the benefits of a true reapportionment. Wyoming's single representative represents all 585 thousand Wyomingites, but each of California's 53 representatives represents about 754 thousand Californians, assuming roughly equal district size within the state. Following the 30 thousand rule, Wyoming should have 19 Representatives, and California should have 1308.

Call it =enlargement= rather than =reapportionment=, instead of confusing people by misappropriating a word that already has a different meaning. (See also my flair.)

******* My point isn't that singular =they= is /new/, and therefore bad regardless of its merit. My point is that singular =they= is /ambiguous/, and therefore bad regardless of its age.

I have the same problem with =you=, =sheep=, =deer=, etc. I differentiate between =you= (with the identity of the singular target implied by the quoting system of the website that I'm using) and =you (plural)= with some regularity. [[http://i.imgur.com/q1RFB6A.png][Here]] are some examples from [[https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?forums/][the Paradox forums]], in which =you (plural)= indicates the team of modders to which belongs the person to whom I'm replying.

*** I'm very much in favor of enlarging the house and allowing proportional representation.

That said, I don't think it will do much to fix the presidential election. The fact that elections are always so close is structural. Expanding the house wouldn't make much change in the long-term.

Look at presidential elections as a multi-player "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimatum_game][Split the Dollar]]" game.

Candidates go a group of constituents and say, "If elected, I'll have power. And I'll spend 30% of my time and energy on stuff you want. Vote for me!" Then, each constituency either accepts the deal (and shows up to vote) or they reject it (and stay home).

The incentive is to offer each group the smallest amount that will get them to show up. This lets you preserve points to spend on other groups, or to use on your personal agenda.

This, in my view, is what happened in the Trump election. Hillary gave groups (eg. Union Workers in Wisconsin) as much attention as her team thought it would take to win them. Once believed they were winning, Hillary's campaign directed their excess energy to a personal project. In this case, campaigning in Californian cities to help run up the popular vote count.

They miscalculated, and left too little margin for error. But, had they have gotten things right, the strategy would have looked brilliant. Hillary would come in with a clear mandate (read: big lead in the popular vote) and also not have over-promised her attention to any one group.

Changing the exact distribution of the house would make candidates re-distribute their energies a bit. But it wouldn't change the underlying situation where about half of people end up unhappy with the president.

So long as we have districts with one representative, an excessively large victory is just a signal that the candidate spent too much political energy getting people to vote for them. They'll pull back until just enough people are unhappy.

**** This discrepancy between popular and electoral votes is caused by a plain outdated population distribution and is not isolated to this last election.

"Running up" the popular vote in an election where the popular vote doesn't matter is just plain dumb. But I don't actually think that's what Hillary did. I think she won the popular vote in California by a huge margin because more people there preferred the liberal status quo to a race-baiting wannabe fascist.

None of the issues in the campaign were local, even that one factory Trump made a fuss about. It was, in many ways, a referendum on globalism. The majority of Americans see the benefits from bananas to smartphones and find it at least acceptable, but there are areas that see the costs in closed factories and dying towns.

These people have been left behind by global capitalism at the same time that they have been given a gradually more and more outsized share of both the House and the Electoral college. They needed something, and Trump told them what they wanted to hear. (And then there are the straight up racists, but he didn't win solely on racism)

If Hillary made a strategic mistake, it was in not taking the demsoc platform Bernie proved appealed to those same left-behind-by-capitalism people and running with it.

Multimember districts are another good idea that will be a lot easier to do when most states have dozens to hundreds of Representatives.

***** Population distributions have very little to do with it. Make states perfectly even, and a candidate could still win with 26% of the vote.

The problem is that Electoral College slates are assigned on a winner take all basis. This creates massively distorted incentives to focus on swing states.

Effort anywhere else is wasted (unless it brings in money to spend on swing states).

This is reflected in campaign spending/capita. Politicians pour money into swing states. High EC / capita states get basically no extra attention.

[[http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2012/11/01/163632378/a-campaign-map-morphed-by-money]]

So, an EC vote redistribution might swing an election or two, until the system adjusts. But it won't make everyone equally important to a politician.

For that, use the state compact that assigns EC votes to the winner of the popular election.

** This is a well written political essay. It starts by looking at the rationale behind political conservatism based on failures in "rational design of social order", the history behind the move to neoliberlism and why most western countries are moving away from it. Then it transitions into reviewing a universal basic income in light of machine intelligence and compares that system with "social investment".

#+begin_quote
  Some people in National [the centre-right party of NZ] gloat about the prospect of social investment rendering their adversaries on the traditional left obsolete.'If we can deliver a more effective welfare system for less money, why would anyone vote for them?' A fair question, but here's another one: what does it even mean to be a right-wing party or a conservative politician in a society in which the state can make better decisions about price or resource allocation than the individual or the market? What kind of economy do we end up with once the state no longer needs to simplify its model of the world, and its maps can be as complex as the territory?

This sounds to me like a world in which the government has perfect knowledge of the economic apparatus. This is not the case right now, and if it were we would be living in a society two steps away from being a horrifying dystopia.

**** Yeah I agree that its not the case. That point in the essay comes relatively soon after discussing how the universal basic income might work in an era where machine intelligence has taken over the "white collar" jobs but that we aren't at that point yet.

So it seems a little inconsistent that the social investment section doesn't make that same point - we don't have those maps yet. Though there is probably a lot more market-related data than welfare data.

***** Exactly! And, forgive me if I'm being a little reductionist, but Mclauchlan seems to be saying that if we didn't need Conservative policy, we wouldn't need Conservative politicians. It's almost tautologically true. Having said that, I liked this essay; very interesting.
