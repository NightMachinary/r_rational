** Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri was a turn-based strategy game from the end of the 90s which was much-beloved for its worldbuilding and characterization. It created seven strange future ideologies and pit them against one another against the backdrop of a very alien world. I learned no small amount of science from reading the technical appendices in the user manual where they talked about the astrophysics and xenobiology of the planet they worked out.

I found a blog today that dug deep into this game and analyzed its themes, especially how they were delivered through the incidental text players get when they finish techs/buildings/secret projects. It's one of those frustrating infinite-scroll setups, so you have to go all the way to the bottom to get to the beginning (as opposed to proper pagination like a civilized person would have), but I've found it to be worth the effort.

** /Alpha/ /Centauri/ was my gateway drug to futurism. When [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKcEwUcVBHs][this]] is your first exposure to nanotechnology, you can't help but be a bit hyped.
