I don't have much to say about this one, as I think will be the case if we do more of these "explicit scenario" challenges in the future. If you have any examples of this being done in fiction, let me know; the closest I can think of is The Bag Wars Saga from Knights of the Dinner Table.

Otherwise, feel free to use this space for brainstorming or discussion. Because the exact properties and rules are left to your discretion, it might be best to clarify what you think would work well for a story, or what's most heavily implied by the prompt.


** Well have to say it reminds me of the Room of Requirement from Harry Potter where wizards summoned a plane to store all sort of stuff they wanted to hide from others and ended with a wasteland of magical artifacts of dubious origins and potentially lethal.

** There are plenty of works where the earth has become a de facto plane of garbage. Deponia... Wall-e...

** I like the idea of stranding a civilization or a colony on a junkyard plane, in which you are practically buried in technological and magical detritus from across realities.

Consequently, it's also a death world as mechas and killerbots are buried right next to giant starships, ready to be activated.

So yeah, scavenging is an awesome cool job, but you're never know what you're going to find.

*** You reminded me of 'The Doctor's Wife', one of my favourite Dr Who episodes ever.

** There's a humorous example in a game /Quantum Conundrum/ where 'pocket' in 'pocket dimension' turns out to be literal, and the dimension is filled with stuff usually found in pockets.

*** Does it have the little gnomes that twist your earphones into an Unholy Mess if you leave them there?

** A friend of mine frequents a roleplaying site called Mizahar. The plane of garbage is called the Void, and there's a school of magic called Voiding built around putting things there (sometimes unwillingly), storing things there (convenient but risky), and even travelling there (neat loot, but the convenience of magic that lets you drop powerful occasionally undead enemies into an endless void of discarded magical waste means that it has a high incidence of /powerful undead enemies floating though an endless void of discarded magical waste/. And that portal you just opened is a good way back to the land of the living.
