***** Wild speculation time -\\
My theory is that Juniper is dead and this is a test for him.

Not in a metaphysical sense, but like a unit-test for a recovered personality. My guess is that he died (possibly killed himself) but was preserved via cryonics. The real world is post-singularity, and his personality is being emulated before it's put back into a body (or maybe wherever it is that ems live), and this place is running error checking on his personality. Everything being pulled from his subconscious because that's the easiest way to run it as well as giving insight into the personality by seeing what it dredges up.

His mental state is kinda shitty as proven by the state of the world (and again, I think he likely killed himself). So this place is designed to fix him. The entire leveling up mechanic and adventure serves to give him a "hero's journey" so at the end up it he'll be a well adjusted human being.

** Just wanted to say that I've really enjoyed your story thus far. The recent author reveal made me like it even more, because you managed to instill an entirely different tone than all your other works, which to me speaks to your skill as a writer.

Normally I'd make a paranoid post about how how trusting Val the social AI to self restrict the use of her abilities and not manipulate the party is asking for trouble, but instead I'll just comment on how heartwarming it is to see how Jun internalized some the values that Tiff tried to instill in him and is doing his best to apply them despite his damage (avoiding the whole "infantilized girl needs a white knight" trope in favor of treating her as a person with agency, etc.).

These interludes of his past DnD group prior to his breakdown have implied how much of an effect they've had on Jun the person. It's great to see how even though Jun's circle of friends may be dead and gone, and even though he's saddled with a ton of baggage from that time, he's still carrying forward their teachings and that memory of better times.

** I'm still wondering about the devils. Are they not communicating? It's implied they are immortal beings, since quite a few of them have millennia of experience. Older ones shouldn't be expected to die very often, especially not on outings to Aerb, yet Valencia consumes them with unnerving regularity --- more than that, she seems to be able to reach into the hells and grab herself a devil whenever she desires. Wouldn't they notice that, eventually? Amaryllis mentioned that they're bad at coordination, but are they /that/ bad? I would think that it's actually the main danger here: Valencia attracting the attention of a powerful devil after eating one hell denizen too many. Would be a fun quest.

One possibility here is that devils don't control when they possess non-animas at all, they just randomly find themselves in their bodies from time to time. It explains, partially, their poor coordination, makes what Val does a little less irregular, and is also rather amusing.

Alternatively, there's extremely many devils, and they don't have distinct identities and/or don't form connections of any kind with each other, so it's entirely possible for one or a few dozens of them to disappear without anyone noticing. Hm, if they're perfect actors who could fool even each other, it would indeed be hard to keep track of them...

*** Devils have a concept of personhood that doesn't apply to non-anima so it's not far fetched that it doesn't apply to other devils. Otherwise it's plausible they'd be stuck in a perpetual loop of trying to frustrate one another.

Coordinate relies on them being able to predict each others actions and reactions and if the only tool they have for doing that to humans is one that immediately drives them to sabotage said actor it's plausible that they deliberately nerf their own ability to understand each other to avoid it. That or trying to analyse schemes ala you-know-I-know-you-know is too frustrating to deal with so they use dumb brutes when they have to and sidestep each other when they can.

It's /useful/, I'd say. If all devils are constantly at war with all other devils, it's nearly a certainty that they would be /very/ interested in this new way to kill their competitors, once they learn of it. Or, looking at it from another perspective, they would be very /worried/ about this new unknown threat.

I suppose it's still better than if they were coordinating, but not positive either.

Regarding knowledge about which non-anima is eating them: fair point. They wouldn't be necessarily even aware that it's a non-anima's doing. But perhaps they could somehow investigate it.

If it's the latter, recursion doesn't occur since such an answer would be useless -> not something utility-maximizing. If former, we're likely dealing with a literal genie, which isn't something we should do at all.

Grak is repeating Fenn's phrasing as a form of deadpan humor. Fenn gets the expression wrong there, and in ch 31 (when the same issue is being discussed), either through a deliberate attempt at tweaking people who care about the correctness of their expressions, to feign cluelessness, or because she doesn't have enough cultural exposure to have all the idioms down pat (kind of a character interpretation thing, so your choice).

** A question that may be dumb, please forgive me since I've never actually played tabletop RPGs (I know enough from cultural osmosis to get most of the references), but I didn't really understand the last part of the Monkish Warrior virtue, about re-rolling injuries. Can anyone explain, please?

*** In some systems, you roll for injuries on an injury chart, e.g. like so (assuming 1d100):

| Number | Outcome                |
|--------+------------------------|
| 91-100 | Actually, you're fine. |
| 70-90  | Cuts and scrapes       |
| 50-69  | Major bruising         |
| 30-49  | Broken bone            |
| 10-29  | Multiple broken bones  |
| 5-9    | Life-long injury       |
| 2-4    | Amputation             |
| 1      | Death                  |

So if you have an injury in the lowest 5% of outcomes, you would get a re-roll on that chart that might make things come out better for you. (The "you keep any lower rolls" clause is a fairly typical clause for rerolling mechanics that means if you reroll a 4 and get a 1, you keep the 1, not the higher of the two.)

*** My understanding was that, assuming damage rolls are using a d20, Joon gets to reroll any critical injury (5% chance of a natural 1). Or if it's a d100, anything 95 and higher gets rerolled.

The wording is a bit confusing. Maybe it was meant as "if they are in the +lowest+ *highest* five percent of outcomes (you keep any lower rolls)". [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]]?

** Which one of you crashed the site? :s I just read 77 and tried to change chapters and boom.

edit: worked after a while and I got the 78 read. Was pretty nice.
