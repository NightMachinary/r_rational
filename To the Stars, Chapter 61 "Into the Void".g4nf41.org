** Ch. 60 refresher summary:

Ryouko, Asami, and Simona practice in simulation for their upcoming mission: using Project Armstrong's wormhole apparatus to launch an attack on the Ceph's pulsar mines. The simulation ends in their deaths---not an uncommon occurrence, a fact which weighs on them, especially Asami. But Ryouko works hard to support her girlfriend, even genetically engineering an exotic plant for Asami to wear in her hair as a gift.

Yuma's investigation into the AIs involved in Ryouko's life turns up no TCF corruption, but indicates that the conspiracy she faces may have simply covered their tracks. Her investigation into the mysterious deep space coordinates yields more: a hidden asteroid base. Yuma plans to personally lead a field mission, using experimental anti-IIC technology to prevent any occupants from revealing Yuma's conspiracy to their own. Excluded from Yuma's planning, Kyouko unknowingly organizes a Cult-sponsored expedition to the same exact coordinates.

On Adept Blue, Clarisse van Rossum hears the Goddess's voice telling her not to go to the pulsar.

** Getting into fanfiction through Code Geass has left me with a crippling fear of reading anything unfinished. Is there an end in sight for this story? It looks really good but I just can't start until it's done.

*** The last estimate I heard was that the author expected to finish it in 3 or 4 years. I have high confidence the story will in fact be finished, but if you're not okay waiting for new chapters, now is not the time to start.

Edit: The story has a planned outline and ending, if that's a specific concern.

*** I was thinking the same thing. First I was excited that it's gone as far as 60 chapters and three quarters of a million words, but then I realised it was first published in 2013. Could be years more for all I know, or never - the longer the timescale of publishing the more things are dropped.

**** /To The Stars/ is on volume three out of six. I'd say we're nearing the climax of Volume III, in three or four chapters. Each of the volumes is easy to consider as their own book. I don't know what the pace is like; I know that it's drastically slowed down recently (read: the last two years) but there's a chance things might pick back up.

***** Pace slowed down because the author got their PhD and started working fulltime. I would expect the pace of the last ~3 years to be instructive: between 3-6 chapters a year. However, it's plausible the rate will speed up as the story starts getting tied up - this might be expected as part of the 3/4 years completion estimate, but that's just speculation on my part.

(Also: AO3 thinks the publishing date is 2013, but it's actually late 2011, since it was first only on fanfiction.net.)

(I think Volume III probably only has 1 or 2 chapters left personally, but it's hard to say.)

***** On the flipside to some other commenters I'm /thrilled/ that there's so much of it left to go. I love this universe.

** Welcome new tidbits! This makes my hopes more subjectively likely that the underlying truth of this conflict is Homura versus the Incubator/s.

** I was planning into reading this story eventually, but not sure where I should place my expectation. How good is the story so far and where does it stand with respect to other popular fics on this sub ?

*** I enjoy it, but it's more of a character-driven worldbuilding piece mixed with space opera rather than what we usually consider rational fiction. The worldbuilding is top-notch though IMO.

Familiarity with the Madoka anime is recommended but not required, taking place hundreds of years later. Side content from canon is sometimes incorporated but is thoroughly explained.

**** hm really? I probably would have just called it rational fiction unqualified (in addition, of course, to those other things). I mean the whole premise is the MSY is powerful today in part because the Mitakihara four were acting rationally with long-term strategy. The modern integration of magical girls with the military is pretty rational given the circumstances, and you get the impression magical girls really explored the limitations of their powers, they really utilize the properties of their soul gems... I mean, I really can't think of a reason to /not/ just call it rational.

***** The /backstory/ is pretty explicitly rational. In terms of events happening in the story's present though, it's hard to say. There's very little of the "rationally consider options" thinking/arguing that I consider a major part of the genre, particularly for the main character who reacts more than acts (for very justified in-story reasons, but still). The characters aren't finding tricky/clever solutions to the problems presented to them, they're methodically doing what needs to be done with all of the fancy trickery being provided to the main characters rather than figured out by them.

*** I third the incredible world-building. I'd call it hard sci-fi rather than explicitly rational. I'm enjoying it a lot, and I don't usually have much tolerance for long gaps between updates.

If you've not started yet then maybe make a calendar event for three years time to check if its complete yet!

*** Agree with user notgreat, incredible worldbuilding and great prose. The pacing is however pretty slow in terms of plot advancement, I dropped it because of that. Great depiction of nanotech posthumans and post-scarcity society in the first couple chapters, that alone is worth an hour or two.
