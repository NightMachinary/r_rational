[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4fq36r/biweekly_challenge_cat_and_mouse/?sort=confidence][Last time,]] the prompt was "Cat and Mouse". The winner was [[/u/ZeroNihilist]] with their story, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4fq36r/biweekly_challenge_cat_and_mouse/d2orgkj][Trapped]]. Go read it now! Congratulations to [[/u/ZeroNihilist]]! Because this is your fifth win, you're getting special five-time-winner flair, and you're entitled to pick the prompt for an upcoming challenge (just PM me).

** This Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: this-time
   :END:
This time the prompt will be "Romance", one of the most consistently irrational genres out there. This was originally going to be the prompt for Valentine's Day, but I then I forgot all about it until after the fact. Here "Romance" should be understood as a shorthand for "Romantic Relationships", since you're free to travel outside the traditional genre boundaries. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, May 18th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Rules
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rules
   :END:

- 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. *This is mandatory.*

- No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

- Think before you downvote.

- Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

- Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

- All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

- Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

- In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

- No idea what rational fiction is? [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][Read the wiki!]]

Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-time
   :END:
Next time we're going to do something a little bit different (because who doesn't like doing things different?). The challenge is this:

There exists magic which can create objects /ex nihilo/. Over time, this has led to a build up of garbage, as wizards create a set of chairs for a dinner party then never use them again, or discard their leftover magically-created food. A counterpart spell was created which vanishes unwanted things. Your story should involve the discovery, exploration, or exploitation of the Plane of Garbage some centuries later. (The nature of magic and specifics of the plane are left as an exercise to the reader; remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.)

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 5/18.* Please private message me with any questions or comments, as the beloved meta thread is now archived. The companion thread [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4hybac/challenge_companion_romance/][is available here]].

There is a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn57zw4--D0&list=PLgtRIWtmHefNSmhLGzm87bM6AKzWvD-ls&index=2][series]] on Youtube, called "Nothing Much To Do," which is a modernized vlog-based version of Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing. It's really well done, but I couldn't help but wonder how the main confrontation between Hero and Claudio would have gone if someone with rationalist skills was present.

A bit of background: This is a future scene in a fanfiction I have started to write. I haven't gotten very far into it yet, and I'm trying to avoid too many spoilers, so the characters are only identified by pronouns here. Two of the main themes of the story are alienation and relationships, and so I thought I'd cut a slice of two of the main character's future as I see it and put it down as an example of how I see them acting.

*** Intriguing. (Reincarnation seems to be implied; the association with madness/breakdowns reminds me both of Fantastic Children (which I've watched barely anything of) and Air (which I watched all of). Something to accomplish to break out of a cycle into an able state, the cycle itself made harder due to not being an able state, and the underlying question of 'how did the cycle get started in the first place'... the indication of it as a fanfiction makes me curious in that I don't clearly recall any fictions I've encountered that directly fit the indicated context.)

*** Wait, is this a real life confession? Because if so, then 1. you've got guts 2. it's really well-written. And 3. also kind of off topic, since this thread is for fiction, but I don't think anyone is going to care about that because if you had put it in the off topic thread perhaps a lot of people might have missed it. And seriously, you just did the equivalent of standing on a stage in front of an audience of maybe hundreds of people who you might or might not have even met in real life and pouring your heart out to them. Even if you're standing on that stage with a mask on, it still must have been pretty nerve-wracking for you. It probably would have been nerve wracking for most people in your shoes. If you think that's cowardly, then what do you consider brave?

If it is fictional, then I am very impressed. You really brought the character to life with that monologue, to the point where it's hard to tell that they're not a real person. IF it's not a real person, anyways.

*** Since this is an account on which you can be yourself, feel free to engage with the community. If you'd like help or advice for managing and improving your self-esteem (if fictional, you have the tone and diction of someone suffering from low self-esteem down pat), link to this and share what methods you've already tried in overmorrow's off-topic thread. Many here would be happy to talk with you about personal topics that are hard to air elsewhere, and perhaps direct you to or directly become a resource for the recovery, maintenance, and/or furtherance of your positive mental health.

You've already taken the step into the communal pool. If you need guidance on swimming technique, just splash.
