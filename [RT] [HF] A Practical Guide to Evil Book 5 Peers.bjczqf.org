***** Jack Slash is the one who branded him into eventually losing his name in the first place. Not sure if we have a stand-in from Worm who would have the same combination of military MO, opinions abouth the so-called"balance" being unfair and rigged, and ability to express it to his opponents.

  “Indeed,” he casually agreed, unwilling to pursue the debate that if any of the things the Pilgrim had named were inherent instead of ascribed, they became utterly meaningless.

I wonder whether this dialogue is a story setup and Amadeus just framed himself as the amoral nihilistic monster.

** I love how ill-fitting Black is to the world he's in. He takes to it like fish to water, but it's just a delight to see him sneer at what the Pilgrim has devoted his life to. The monologue Black gave to Cat way back when he was talking about his motivations is still probably my favorite moment in the entire series.

**** Doesn't mean he isn't a psychopath though. Psychopaths can care about things, though those things are usually self-centered and egocentric. In fact common treatment of psychopathy to curb criminal and anti-social behaviour is by focussing on the egocentric parts and how following social custom and pro-social behaviour is beneficial for the person in question.

It's entirely possible Arnaud is a psychopath, just one who thinks Procer's benefit is to his own and is therefore willing to do anything to achieve this.

****** Well to start with perhaps the most obvious is his eyes, one rimmed red and one rimmed a verdant green that I think Black is the only character actually described has having. Cat notes he's remarkably short, though still taller than her. An uncommon trait for humans, yet one Black also has.

Cat describes his Lower Miezian as smooth and accentless, which she also interprets Black's as. This is especially incongruent as a Named from a foreign land would almost surely have some sort of regional accent Cat would find unfamiliar.

Most glaringly though, is this line which seems exactly something Black would say, even calling back to his famous speech at the Field of Streges. (emphasis here mine)

#+begin_quote
  “I would not swear truce with her beyond the Dead King's end,” the Rogue Sorcerer replied, tone touched with strained patience, *“but to refuse an arrangement right now would be worse than a sin, it would be a mistake.”*

******* Ok, now that would be an interesting twist. The rogue sorcerer had so much less weight in his character compared to the other ones in the party that I was just considering him a redshirt. That would die at some point to mark danger, to the surprise of no one. Probably to be replaced by some other wizardlike character, like Masego or Akua.
