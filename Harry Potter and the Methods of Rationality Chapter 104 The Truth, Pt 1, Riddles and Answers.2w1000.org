You won't even get to 15 coin flips before "timelines where weird stuff happens" outweigh "timelines where authentication succeeds", assuming the factoring problem is representative of how much optimization power you can exert. (Finding a 15-bit hash collision requires on the order of a 100 tries, similar to the number of primes less than 1000.)

******* but an /in/competent attack dictionary would only have "password"- that's the point: given the choice between shitty security, and no security, shitty security wins.

remember hadran's wall? if you've seen it, it's really only knee-high. but having enemy troops forced to step over even such a small obstacle is a tactical advantage.

I'd hazard that your understanding of security is flawed- security isn't there to protect against an attack, it's there to buy you time to respond to an attack. no matter how tight your security is, it can be bypassed, given infinite time.

imagine harry did use a password. imagine quirrel knew he used a password. quirrel now has to delay to find out what it is. if that delay pushes him back, say, a week he instantly loses, as by that time, harry's on the train back home. if he tries without it, he loses, as harry knows it's not future!harry communicating with him. even if he knows the original potato code, if he uses that, he runs the risk of losing due to harry changing it after learning occulomancy, so to be safe, he'd have to delay to verify that he didn't.

*** Certain magical actions in Hogwarts, which are beyond a certain level of harm, trigger the Hogwarts wards to alert the Headmaster to the time and place of their use. Professors however are whitelisted in the wards, and will not trigger them, presumably because the headmaster would otherwise have alarms going off during regular classes.

As such, if we accept that a student was Memory Charmed - presumably a prohibited action - then the caster must have been a professor.

So, to memory charm a student without alarm, Imperius a professor.

  "And how would Lucius even Memory-Charm Hermione in the first place, without setting off the wards? He's not a Professor - oh, right, you think it's Professor Snape."

  "Wrong," said the Defense Professor. "Lucius Malfoy would trust no servant with that mission. But suppose some Hogwarts Professor, intelligent enough to cast a well-formed Memory Charm but of no great fighting ability, is visiting Hogsmeade. From a dark alley the black-clad form of Malfoy steps forth - he would go in person, for this - and speaks to her a single word."

  "Imperio."

  "Legilimens, rather," said Professor Quirrell. "I do not know if the Hogwarts wards would trigger for a returning Professor under the Imperius Curse. And if I do not know, Malfoy probably does not know either. But Malfoy is a perfect Occlumens at least; he might be able to use Legilimency. And for the target...perhaps Aurora Sinistra; none would question the Astronomy Professor moving about at night."

  "Or even more obviously, Professor Sprout," said Harry. "Since she's the last person anyone would suspect."

  The Defense Professor hesitated minutely. "Perhaps."

It's better to use other students as the unwitting minion. Of course they could fail and Harry would be more likely to succeed, but it doesn't feel right to me.

I think Quirrel is going for a confrontation with Harry for something relating to the Horcruxes. Remember that all of Harry's information on the Horcruxes came from Quirrel and there could be an unknown benefit such as Quirrel is capable of moving his brain-state from his current body into Harry's or something like that.
