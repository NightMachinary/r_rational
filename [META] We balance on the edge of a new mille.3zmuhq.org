Not all that long ago we celebrated our 3000th subscriber. My understanding is that it took the sub several years to get to that point; it was a moderate-sized deal at the time.

I've been watching the subscriber numbers for the last week or so, and they been teetering around 3990 +/- 3; as I write this we're at 3991. Quick, someone go out and recruit 9 friends!

In more seriousness, this kind of growth always fascinates me. Network effects, exponential growth, tipping points, meme vectors...cool and very useful stuff if one can understand it.

I'm curious as to what is bringing people in; for anyone who cares to chime in, how did you find out about this sub and what made you subscribe?


** As a matter of historical record-keeping, this sub was taken over (from the very charitable [[/u/centipeed]]) on 12/3/2013 following [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1rz3k5/ripe_for_abuse/][this post]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1rkkam/in_light_of_the_recent_slew_of_recommendations/][this post]] in [[/r/HPMOR]], the latter of which is where our sidebar rules originated (thanks [[/u/vivificient]]), now with some minor refinements. The original mod in the early days was [[#s][]], whose spirit is said to haunt our subreddit to this very day.

As a friendly reminder, the (bi)weekly challenge is now a little over six months old, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][and is cataloged here]] if you missed any of them.

** Whenever I got a noticeable spike in my fiction blog traffic, I'd do a search to see if I could find what caused it. Going back more than a year, there were periodic posts on here and a few other subreddits linking to my stories. I stayed away for a long time, because I wasn't sure about the boundaries for self promotion, and didn't want to offend, but after some nice feedback, I decided to make an account so I could answer questions and thank people. I'd never really thought of my fiction as 'rational fiction' so much as stories where smart people actually acted reasonably intelligently, instead of being driven by the whims of plot and limits of the author.

*** That's what 'rational fiction' has come to mean. This sub was created as an aggregator for 'fiction that's like /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/', but as the community grew we've figured out what we specifically liked in that and what sort of story appeals to us (and what things we'd created tags for turned out to be superfluous). It's a fascinating process to watch.

I love your story, by the way. It and the weekly discussion threads are what keep me coming back here.

I tried to portray DASI as not 'just happening' to care about Doc--it was a natural consequence of the way he set her priorities, thus Stella's "of course" at the time. The unexpected event was full anthropomorphic intelligence before he had adjusted those priorities for it, though perhaps that could have been made a little clearer. Glad you liked Fall.

I remember when it was just an empty forum with a vague promise about "cool-headed discussion" or some shit like that ... a diamond in the rough. Super thanks to the dude who was really nice by willingly surrendering such prime domainspace in response to a short PM. By the time I even accepted the request to mod it, he'd already unmodded himself. Fun stuff.

Anyway, looking forward to seeing the new thousand.

And I figured, hey, HP fanfiction with a pretentious name that is popular enough to get its own podcast, might as well give it a shot. It cut out just after Hermione's little incident. So you know, that made me kinda motivated to go look for the rest of HPMOR. There wasn't much more written, but it did let me find the subreddit. Which links here all the time. I stayed because there's good content and good people.
