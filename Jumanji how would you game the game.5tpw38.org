** Is there actually any choice in the game? If it's just rolling dice then you have no real choice.

I suppose if the first roll wasn't too bad (but still let you know that the game was for real) then you could just live your life normally. Study a bunch of current tech as the decades progress, then finish the game and come back with knowledge decades ahead of your time.\\
Sort of like a time loop except extremely dangerous.

*** That was my idea a well. The threats in the movie really were not that bad if we were properly prepared.

Have you seen the movie? It makes answering questions easier if I know.

**** I suppose I was assuming that the movie wouldn't exist in universe (though in hindsight that makes no sense because then how would you know that time reverts when you finish the game?).\\
If you were able to prepare then you could probably exploit the time loop a bunch of times, allowing you to rapidly advance technological and scientific advancement.
