I have completed around 25 chapters in the book, I initially liked the premise of first contact and humans response to it, but in the later chapters the aliens started behaving more human like and somehow the feeling of exploration has been replaced by drama, action .

What do you guys say


** Minus a couple of small arcs in other stories and the Sanctuary/Misift plot, the series has never been about exploration. The early chapters have a lot of worldbuilding but the main plot has always been about stepping onto the galactic stage and surviving/defeating Big Hotel.

*** Hmm, I don't dislike that part , but my problem is that aliens also are becoming too human like , yes the author points out the physiological differences a lot, but the thinking process is starting to feel human like, I guess this could be the effect of reading Blindsight by Peter Watts recently, it has introduced me to the alien nature of well ... aliens and I expect it.to pop up everywhere

**** I believe Hambone acknowledged this at some point with a line that talked about how Deathworlders affected how the rest of the galaxy thought about things. Plus you're seeing the cream of the crop as far as ET's are concerned so it's not surprising that their competency has risen. It's also been established that the Human mindset is less of a Human mindset and more of a Deathworlder mindset.

** I haven't read it but if its the story i'm thinking of, prominently listed in [[/r/HFY][r/HFY]] I've thought about getting around to it more than once, and for one am thankful to see a review and hope to see a discussion.

*** It's worth picking up. It's well written, keeps itself (mostly) rational and makes some excellent points about psychological and physiological mindsets whilst still retaining the whole hfy premise.

You have to start from the original green text snips.

Also consider the other canon branches: humans don't make good pets, salvage and The Xi√∫ Chang Saga.

They all tie into each other at some moments, help to set up the plot and work with the other authors to prevent fatalistic issues forming or holes in the plot line.

Humans don't make good pets was the result of a standalone author and hfy fan coming across hambones works on 4chan, deciding to continue in the same universe while providing him credit. Few years down the track and hambone himself discovered that his work had not suffered the slow death as assumed, then took it upon himself to contribute.

**** Caution: I'm pretty drunk, and ESL.

Quarantine is pretty HFY, but it's also a bit unrealistic. The human biology parts are often wrong, human bodies and thermodynamics just don't work that way.

You can't have a ton of muscles and be good in cardio and endurance. Calories and oxygen consumption don't work like that.

Apart from that the alien psychology explanations are pretty good, and the whole series is a good read
