Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** [[/r/CircleofTrust]]

Reddit's April Fool's prank this year involves creating 'circles' which are threads in that subreddit, in which you can give people a password and invite them in. It appears that getting more people is 'good' in a similar way to how 'karma' is good.

You can get betrayed however. Every person who enters the code has a choice to join or betray, so be careful who you trust. You do not know who betrays your circle.

It appears to have something to do with game theory and the prisoner's dilemma. People in the subreddit have flairs in the format like 0,0 or 7,5.

*** But it isnt a prisioner dilema. Not all game theoretic things whith the words trust and betray have anything to do whith prisioners dilema. You can set up a prisioners dilema whith it , by interchanging keys or something like that .

***** It also drastically reduces the possible size of your circle. The best strategy to me seems to find a trustworthy and relatively obscure community to post the password in.

****** You still have to do it by PMs or else malicious people find their way in. The two most successful groups I've seen so far are [[/r/neoliberal]] with 52 members before betrayal that was advertised through comments and password sent through PM. The owner got careless however and accidently gave the password to an hostile commie.

The other group is [[/r/hellointernet]] (a subreddit for a podcast)which got betrayed at 59 members but started up again and is now at 53, unbetrayed. They are doing really extensive checking now, I had to go through a voice interview to get in and they're not allowing the password to be even communicated through text or image, only voice.

******** You see if they are real members of the community. It's not fool proof, but [[/r/neoliberal]] can see your comment history if you posted in the discussion thread and lot, and [[/r/hellointernet]] did a verbal quiz on podcast history like names of the host's dogs, and different topics the podcast covers.
