** Startups are going to love this. Also hate this. It allows them to trade effort that large companies won't be able to spare (because most employees won't sit in a box for a year) for time-to-market, and helps devoted newcomers displace incumbents.

I expect automated manufacturing will be all over this. Some expensive processes should become a lot more effective, since it makes small-scale production much faster. It requires a lot of space, though.

The major targets might be mostly related to ramp-up time. It's much easier to make one machine, or train one person, and then speed them up 365x, than to make 365 machines or train 365 people.

Still thinking, though. I suspect this would change a lot, but it's not clear where the lowest hanging fruit is.

If a device could be made to perform a high efficiency, low speed Haber process without human intervention, fertilizer and other nitrogen dependent products could be cheaper. I don't know how it would be powered, but I'm sure something could be arranged. It doesn't really matter if the machine can't run for the full year; it just needs to make enough to justify the cost of the machine regardless of wasted time.

You could probably grow some really cool crystals that would take impractically long times IRL, but I doubt this would be particularly valuable.

Maybe you could bioengineer microorganisms to eat plastics if you put a bunch of plastic in there as a potential source of food. Kind of doubt it though.

***** As far as I know, this is not necessarily true for Bitcoin. In current practice, yes, miners need an active internet connection, because the guy next to them might solve for a block and it would normally be in their best interest to solve on top of that new block instead of 'continuing' on their own. (And they only know about that solved block from their internet connection.)

The solving part doesn't require an internet connection, just an up to date blockchain and some pending transactions. The propagating part is the internet part. Since we can safely assume that the time chamber solves first, there's no issue as long as they can pop open the door every couple of minutes to communicate with the rest of the world.

Blocks take an average of 10 minutes (real world time?) independent of total computational power in the mining pool. So for starters that 'real-world time?' bit is going to have to be addressed. Also whether or not there are multiple time chambers... Honestly, at this point in a rational world, someone smarter than me would probably come along with an Altcoin to account for these problems. But Bitcoin's system, as is, could function inside a time chamber; it could functionally be the same as a massive increase in hash rate... that involves opening a door every couple of minutes.

EDIT: Was it a DBZ rule that the chamber only opens once a day real world time? If the door can't be opened as frequently as the avaerage block publication rate, then it's useless for Bitcoin. And thank god for that, a hash rate arms race is not a good use of the world's resources.

I don't remember anything like that. When Goten and Trunks go in to train before fighting Majin Bu, the door is re-opened one hour later. The rule was that a single human can't spend more than 48 real time hours inside. It was violated later anyway, so we can probably just ignore it.

Dump in there all the world's supercomputing clusters, we get a 365 times speed-up factor on everything we do, we can finally crack really hard problems that are currently unfeasible. Putting humans in it is a double edged sword (who wants to take one year off their lives like that? Also, the 10x G doesn't help).

Lots of other processes that have a natural speed could benefit from the acceleration, like organ and tissue growing, in theory. Though again, the 10x G must be factored in there. If you can grow food in it, you've just solved every food problem for a very long time. And you /should/ be able to grow food in it - at worst, you can run cloned meat labs and mycoprotein reactors.

It seems very vast, it's not inhabited, and time flows quickly - perfect place to just dump your nuclear waste! What would have taken 300 years to decay now takes one. And anyway it's stocked in a separate dimension. Problem solved forever.

I keep trying to think of energy applications, like a perpetual motion machine, but I'm afraid that can't be hacked out of it. It could perhaps if you could keep the door open and operate something within the time speed differential, but you can't, or you'd die just stepping in, while your body's half in half out - the time differential activates when you close the door.
