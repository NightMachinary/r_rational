I just read book one of The Steerswoman (if you haven't read it: It's a good story about characters trying to figure out things. I liked the characters quite a lot. And while many of the answers actually become clear to the reader early on, but it's quite interesting to see the characters figuring them out).

I couldn't quite follow everything, however, and was hoping someone else who read the book could explain:

[[#s][book 1 ending spoiler]]


** It's been a very long time, but I think that was explained? Something about [[#s][]]? And the fact that the angles were all wrong for [[#s][]]?

Okay now I have to reread this series.

** Oh man, you're in for a treat with book 2. Er, 3? Whichever one the Lost Steersman is, it's the high point for me.

Anyhow, [[#s][]]
