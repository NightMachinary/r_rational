** Right. I think the site ate my comment so I'll just put it here.

--------------

Dammit. These chapters feel way too short.

So I assume that whenever the Woe got too close to Malicia or the Skein, the ratling would just Spool and send them back to square one? I wonder what the limitations are. Why couldn't he just Spool them back to the palace when they started fighting? Or is the aspect usable like that only in this particular part of Keter? Regardless, I'm sure you can chalk this all up to 'stupid seer bullshit.'

The narrative hasn't yet abandoned the Woe (they're far too entertaining), and we see yet another example of the self-balancing scales: the Skein pulls out some nonsense, and Masego produces a brand-spanking-new Aspect out of Namespace to fight back. Nothing so blatant as a perfect counter to Spool, of course, because that fuckery is the provenance of Heroes only, but a weapon nonetheless.

And, while having Akua as a sort of 'magical collar Adjutant' is nice, I can't help but feel that Catherine is damning herself more and more with every inch of leeway she offers Diabolist - and in this chapter she gave her a goddamned country mile. (Cat deciding to take Akua's hand last chapter - even in spite of the circumstances - was definitely alarming.) She's setting a dangerous prescedent by allowing Akua to draw on Winter like she is in this chapter, and as we all know, Catherine is Winter and Winter is Catherine. Though, I suppose she really should have seen it coming when Cat made the decision to bind instead of destroying her. At the very least, if she was really keen on keeping Akua around, she should have blackboxed her /a la/ Voldy in Significant Digits.

Regardless, when it finally comes time for Cat to kill Akua as per her binding agreement with Viv - signed in spit, which is better than blood or ink - I'd be lying if I didn't say I would feel bad.

Per Diabolist: "The aspect was bastardized, made contingent to this place.” It seems that Skein can only use Spool within the confines of its creepy bone lair.

**** Yeah, I thought as much. That makes sense. I'm not sure where I was getting the time loop/Groundhog Day idea, now that I think of it.

And it really makes you think: if this is a lesser version of Spool, limited only to one area and presumably neutered to some degree, what was it like when the Skein still lived? What kind of buttfuckery did the Heavens/the Dead King have to pull out to kill a seer on this level?

***** I expect that paring it down also removed limitations. We've seen a few good heroes with some nasty limits. Though it likely wasn't all that limited in the first place - Names seem to alter a bit with the relative power of whatever bears them. A little. Hell, the Pilgrim has some real bullshit aspects and he's an old man. A Horned Lord Named? Yeech.

Though capture would probably involve something like the foundling gambit crossed with the DK's way to avoid the bard. Enough ordinance that there are no options but death.

#+end_quote

Between the choice of words, Skein's time resets being linked to his room and Aspect's triggering influencing its shape, I suspect Ruin breaks Creation in shards similar to what Masego saw in Arcadia, with Witness giving him the advantage in choosing who's interacting with what part. Whether or not the alternate realities are a consequence of each shard's course of events proceeding independently, Skein's Spool or Masego's covering of real Catherine's trajectory is to be determined.

*** I dunno. I could see an argument being made for it actually being his style. Even Catherine had to take a mental moment to note that *Ruin* says worrisome things about Masego and where he's headed. He's always stated that he intends to vivisect Creation itself so that he can build a home that can't be taken away from him (or prevent the Gods fron dismissing Creation). I could see him leaving Creation ruined as he squeezes it for every secret he can, and then discard the tattered remains to make room for his own.

** This work has enough similarities to Worm (the original, not the silly sequel) that, when it comes to powersets, I think it's fairly safe to say:

/Skein/ == /Coil/

It seems like that the creature's power has a similar limitation: He can only *Spool* back to the point where he started its use. He may be able to do it multiple times, or run multiple 'timelines' concurrently, /but/ his reset can only go back so far.

In other words, the trick to beating him is to put him in a situation where he *thinks* he has won and lets the power 'reset' over time instead of actively using it to backtrack... and then murder him in such a way that even if he tries to Spool it back he's in the same position each time with no way out.

I think this little cliffhangar is him making that mistake.

*** I think that's bullshit - they have main characters with a similar approach to violence and morality, who go through a similar arc of losing themselves to power and reacting to that change in themselves. And that's pretty much where the similarities end. No other character's powerset maps to anything from Worm, except insofar as they draw on similar sources. I guess you could say that Warlock's power is similar to Labyrinth, if you squint? And I can't think of any more, beyond stuff like "Black Kaze and the Saint of Swords are both crazy old women with anime sword powers". Or "Nilbog and the Dead King are both megalomaniacal rulers of their constructed kingdoms populated with creatures and cultures they have crafted to focus obsessively on them." I can't really think of anything else. Even the major setting elements are nothing alike. The Gods map vaguely to the Entities, I guess? There are no Endbringer analogues.

#+end_quote

What, that's not enough for you? I said /similarities/, not "It's an exact copy with the serial numbers filed off". What you listed is the /key/ similarity, but OK, sure, you want more?

Sufficiently powerful people, whether evil or "good", both flagrantly violate the rules but the latter expect everyone else to play by them, and get full off self-righteous fury when they don't. Especially at the main character, who is treated as some sort of madwoman or monster for daring to violate the oppressive status quo.

The main character starts with an objectively weak powerset, leveraging it through creativity and determination to defeat foes far above her 'power level' repeatedly and thus gaining more confidence, power, and prestige. Over time, she becomes something both far more and far less than human, accepting an increase in power at the sacrifice of her /self/ out of necessity in order to protect what she cares about.

Both struggle against a narrative imposed on them from godlike beings (literally Gods, in the case of Cat), seeking to escape an endless cycle that has consumed worlds, and in so doing have to find some way to break the cycle permanently or be destroyed in the process?

***** These sound less like PG copying from Worm and more like both works containing normal narrative structure and tropes. What makes PG specifically a copy of Worm as opposed to simply being a normal maturation story with a normal fantasy setting?

Worm gets credited and referenced a lot, probably in part because it's so long that there's very likely to be /something/ in there that can be seen as similar to whatever you want to compare it to. That doesn't mean that Worm was the source, or even the inspiration, for the similarity you are seeing.

  “Interesting,” Hierophant said. “You did not break the march of time so much as sever causality. Prune away events from a sequence that still theoretically exists.”
#+end_quote

*Spool* messes with causality. It removes the consequences of actions that harmed the Skein.

Since the ice skeleton dragon it has destroyed still remained so, it's clear that he doesn't reset everything. Cat and co. still having their memories further proves this. I don't see how you could achieve this effect with timeline manipulation.
