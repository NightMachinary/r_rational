Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

[[/r/rational]] is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar). It /is/ pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

- Plan out a new story
- Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
- Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
- Test your idea of how to rational-ify /Alice in Wonderland/

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^{Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality}


** Random world-building exercise! What would happen to society, if some arbitrarily chosen animal species developed human-level intelligence and can "magically" speak the human language?

You can decide how the species got their intelligence, but communication has to be easy to perform so it's not very easy to deny evidence of intelligent animals.

For coolness: octopi, horses, and dogs

For horror: cows and chicken

For the creep factor: plants and bacteria

Let's say, five years from now, we get machine learning down well enough to apply it efficiently to translation algorithms. Pretty soon, we have excellent translations from even languages as disparate as chinese and english, or portuguese and hindu, or whatever.

Then, some bright researcher decides to apply this to elephants/dolphins.

It turns out that it actually works reasonably well, and bam-- it turns out humans aren't so alone after all.

** So I'm in the middle of brainstorming the mechanics of turning [[/u/DaystarEld]] 's rational pokemon into a video game. I might toy around with making at least a small slice of such a game if I can convince myself that it works well enough, but I probably won't. How would you rational-ize a game in general? Specifically, how would one do it for pokemon?

*** The mechanics of the world, or of the battles?

Not that one is particularly easier than the other, but the battles in the fanfic work well as explanations of the abstraction of the game's battle system, while the way the world works is the more complex emergent system IMO.

**** A little of column A, a lot of column B. I'm definitely more concerned with game mechanics; how the world operates is 80% a story matter and is thus solved by getting a competent rational writer. Building a "rational" game system is more tricky in it needing to be fun and usable while at the same time not being irrational. Though since I'm not even sure what it /means/ to have a "rational game", that makes it all the trickier.

***** Right, "rational" game systems to me are more proof of concept of how bad reality actually is than the contrary, they are not the best abstraction in gameplay terms and more importantly I think an implementation like you explained above would be completely different from Pokemon and best explored like such, don't constrain yourself with it.

My other point though, is that the portrait of the world expands on certain abstractions which go much further and can be implemented to have consequences on gameplay.

Injuries have a certain permanence and weight, even potions take time to recover the health and serve as more temporary aids than 100% recovery items. Travels are long and resources more scarce, each player character should only be able to walk certain distances daily. Money is far tighter and grinding is not really such an available solution, bringing with it a greater risk while also a lesser reward.

You can avoid or pursue Pokemon so you see them on the overworld, you can use environment means to capture above your level and you have situations where you can do nothing other than run. Damage is also persistent on wild Pokemon and interacting with one can give way to other getting near.

There are a lot of additions made to the fic which help ground it and which can have certainly a lot of impact on the end game result, the most direct method of interaction(in other words, the battles) need not necessarily be it.

Although now I have ideas of doing a small game to explore that, shame.

****** Some good points, especially re:world impacting gameplay. I suppose I instinctively restricted myself to something that I could feasibly implement; a deeper, more rational battle system is potentially very satisying while still actually being achievable. I love the idea of tracking individual pokemon, attracting local fauna, tracking injuries, environmental traps, and arduous journeys, but by the time I would have such a system, I'd have made the Witchermon, and that's just not realistically achievable. Though now I reeeeeeally want to play such a thing.

*** First thing I noticed is that, physical moves are nerfed to hell. They cost more Endurance and require more tactical concessions than special moves. Would there be anything to compensate for this, or would you just let metagame swing in favor of special attack focused teams?

**** First off, the move "cooldown" resets faster, so repeated karate chops hit harder than repeated flamethrowers, making special much more risk-reward at close range...miss that hit and your opponent's gonna trade a lot better. Also since the moves recharge faster, the depleted endurance hit from the physical moves themselves won't be as much a factor in the formula, so I would tweak it to balance out. I imagine both physical and special as having the same dps (and endurance drain) on average, with special having powerful single strikes and physical being a lot of weaker quick ones (with outliers, of course). Physical wins the short-term endurance trade by ending the match, special wins the long-term one of they can line something up. Though physical would also encourage repeated move usage, pushing their max endurance higher faster in the long run.

Not to mention that this would follow gen iv's concept of phys/spec being intrinsic to the move itself, so no reason to not have both. Softening the 4 move restriction helps too. I really don't want hyperspecialized two or three move combos, one or two hit KOs would be all but nonexistant (i hope) and type advantage wouldn't be quite the catch-all it is now.

Also, in my head, special moves mostly have to be aimed, whereas physical operate more on an automated sentry mode. Vine whip will just hit if the opponent enters the sphere of influence (modified by accuracy) making agility the real trick, but hydro pump will need to be directed at the spot you /hope/ your opponent will be at, making positioning the emphasis. (Maybe that's too gamey? No /fundamental/ reason that you have to tell your retarded Kadabra how to land a mental AoE attack but your Snorlax just /knows/ how to flail his body across the battlefield with impunity. At the same time, good luck coming up with an interface to aim punches that's not just as gimmicky.)

A few things I didn't mention at all (but underlines most of this, I just realized): I would experiment with both sides taking turns simultaneously, in a pseudo-turn-based style. I expect the hit percentages to be similar to XCOM. /Landing/ the hit is almost more important than which hit was used, with different moves enabling different ranges, AoE, positioning, or whatnot. Tell your blastoise to charge, tackle, sidestep, headbutt, then hydro pump at the spot you hope the other guy's sitting stunned in, and then start running again towards the hex you just knocked him in to body slam. I imagine the throwaway early moves like tackle, quick attack, gust, etc, having very important utility in combining movement with attacking, with higher level stuff being more damage focused, including mostly special moves. Switching would be nerfed significantly, needing the same time delay as Origin of Species, giving up X ticks in the process.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I expect someone with 4-6 trained special moves is going to get shrekked by someone with a more flexible kit and a finisher or so.

Sorry for the wall of text, you gave me a lot to think about. It's definitely shaky right now, it's the sort of thing that would just need to be playtested ruthlessly.

**** Some of the special moves need resources that are unlimited in the pokemon video game, but would be more limited in a rational game. All the water based attacks, for example, depend either on available water sources external to the pokemon, or the pokemon having a large internal supply of water. Flame attacks actually need something that burns, so the pokemon is limited by some internal supply of oil or gas. Etc.

So in general, the physical moves are easier to use multiple times in a single battle.

****** So Psycho Cut is actually a move I feel like was poorly designed: its intention, flavor-wise, appears to be a move that shoulder operate by the same rules as Psyshock, a Special attack that deals Physical damage (uses the opponent's Defense instead of Special Defense).

But I agree that only certain special moves would need a more limiting resource, and that psychic attacks in general wouldn't be as limited as water attacks. The way to make this more balanced might be to allow resource-dependent pokemon to use significantly less Endurance for their special attacks, since they're using their "Resource" as well. Alternatively, when in an environment that allows them to recharge their limiting resource, they can recharge Endurance as well.

As an example, in the recent chapter Misty's starmie using the nearby water to use a Surf attack on the alakazam. Normally such an attack of that power might use, say, 30 Endurance. With mechanics (A) the attack only uses 15 Endurance, because it requires Starmie to also use her interior water supply *or* have water nearby to use, while with mechanics (B) it only used a net of 5 Endurance instead of the usual 30 because Starmie gained 25 Endurance by dipping into the water and sucking a bunch of it up.

*Pros and Cons of (A):*

*Pro* - More flexibility, realism, and ability to fine-tune balance and allow player ingenuity.

*Cons* - Requires a separate resource to be tracked for a multitude of pokemon. Blastoise might have water reserves of 100, while Squirtle has 20 and Starmie has 40. This can be annoying to keep track of, and the recharge rate should also be different.

*Pros and Cons of (B):*

*Pro* - Much more streamlined and mechanics-light.

*Cons* - Not quite as realistic, has some weird alternative interactions where a pokemon can now do more physical attacks after drinking in water, or even use other non-water special attacks since they all use Endurance.

As a final note, [[/u/ketura]], just wanted to say this is a really neat idea, and let me know if there's anything I can do to help with it :) I've designed a couple games myself, so I know how daunting some of the fine-tuning can be. In my head I see this working more easily as a tabletop RPG than a video game, but no reason it can't work as both with enough time and effort in coding.

******* You're right that A is the more realistic, but the line gets a bit hard to identify for some types. What's the "resource" for plant pokemon? One surely exists; one runs out of leech seeds eventually. Is it soil? Sun? It seems easiest to abstract it away into the Endurance stat as a combined "physical energy" and "physical resources" sort of stat, with perhaps just a few exceptions for easily designed terrain such as water pools or lava flows or whatnot.

A good compromise would then be to do something like B but internally tracking the gained endurance as "temporary water" or "temporary fire" or whatever. It would only be used if the pokemon utilized the correct type of move in lieu of normal Endurance usage, and maybe at the end of battle any excess is dumped into the base Endurance pool, to avoid the weird physical bit you pointed out but still representing a rejuvenation.

For this very sort of compromise I prefer these kind of systems to be moderated by a computer; tracking that sort of thing would get very annoying very quickly in a tabletop, and crunching all the numbers starts to wear on you.

Thanks for your feedback, and I'm glad you liked it! I'll no doubt be in touch with you if anything ends up getting made. I reinstalled Unity last night, so we'll see if I'm up for it, but don't hold your breath.

****** That could be handwaved, something something mental exertion blah blah. But you're right, and it doesn't help that any type move can be Special. What does it mean to have a Special Fighting move? Hmm, maybe like a chi move, I guess, could be draining. Special Rock? Tearing bits of yourself off, and so more demanding? I don't know if one could go down the list and justify why all 18 special types require more immediate exertion than their Physical counterparts, but I'd rather not go that route anyway.

It feels inherently un-rational to try and force them all to fit into two moulds of fast, automated, long-term-demanding moves on the one hand and slow, manual, short-term-demanding moves on the other. I don't particularly know how to solve it without handwaving and making it gamey. An obvious step is to make automated and aimed attacks not directly tied to the phys-spec spectrum. Another step would be to label something as "resource-intensive" vs "cantrip", with water gun in the former and karate chop in the latter. With Special-Physical as a third axis, plus type, that's essentially four separate axes that all moves would have to be divided into.

But then we get into DF-style complexity, and then do we have a game or a simulation? The line's a fine one.

And I wonder how needed the spearhead really is if metal is too rare to make full armor. Plus there are other things you could stick at the end, such as obsidian or even just stone. Or maybe glass or harder woods such as ironwood. Or just sharpen and burn the end.

Horseshoes are one thing I don't think you could replace, though Wikipedia says that there were straight alternatives sort of like sandals made of rawhide that the Romans used anyway.

Gold is obviously worthless for anything that needs to be hard. Silver was used for lots of things, and I wonder if it couldn't replace bronze in a pinch, albeit at a much steeper rarity. Iron only came after bronze, with its primary advantage that it only needs a single ore and not two to forge. Speaking of which, remove copper and you lose bronze, and tin was rare as it was, making up like 15% of the bronze blend.

So to answer your question, I think iron could disappear with the least amount of impact to a Roman-era civilization, assuming you just coped with bronze. Assuming you went with zero metals, gold would probably be missed the least, what with it just being a currency and all. Clubs would never come into it, with spears being so much easier to wield and impacted less than swords.

** I got a story in my head sketched out for the first arc of my multiverse story I wanted to do. I scoped it all the way down to one other world and to a single arc in the story.

The first arc explore about what would you do if you encounter your own mother in another reality, especially one that is alive?

The setting is WW2 era analogue planet named Gaia, a world that is very much like ours, except with different countries, geography, and world history. It nonetheless still managed to resonate with us, as there are many analogue in their world history to ours.

Anyway, the traveler found himself in a country on the verge of war. A nation had already capitulated, and there's already a flood of people trying to flee or emigrate. He encountered a doppelganger of his deceased mother, complete with a son who looked very much like him. The complication is that she's a member of a persecuted religious minority, a religion that proclaimed a belief in one god, unlike others that were still very much polytheistic. He became convinced that his mother were in grave danger.

Of course, the traveler arrived in a fantastical machine from a fantastical world with knowledge of a world war and an equally unbelievable holocaust. How could he convince her to flee with him in a strange machine?

Anyway, below is a summary of the plot so to speak. I wrote it out in one sitting so it's going to be absolute crap, but I find it really helpful to get all out so that I can improve upon it.

*pre-alpha plot below*

Our trans-dimensional traveler managed to invent a machine to travel between one universe to another. Unfortunately, it costs a gobble of money and expertise to make and had numerous limitations that boiled down to him being able to make only one journey in a span of twenty four hours. How he got this money? A hard drive full of cash, essentially.

He was certain that it's baloney of an idea(due to physicists rejecting it out of hand as crackpottery and his own skepticalism), but he tried it anyway.

Lo and behold. He jumped to a different dimension, but not without some preparation, such as gold jewelries and a concealed weapon.

He waltzed into town, casually sold his jewelries to whatever pawnshop nearby, and acquired clothing to blend in.

Then he meet what looked like his mom. His mother passed away years ago. Immediately, he got hugged by this woman.

It turned out that she think he's her son, and that she was really relieved to see him back.

Along the way, he seen hint of the trouble to come. People are leaving, newspapers talking about an invasion and capitulation of a country, a people being exiled or rounded up.

Confused, our intrepid traveler journeyed home to this woman's abode.

The woman wanted to know why our protagonist went away to fight in a civil war halfway around for Republican Amerika(I haven't much details on this world other than it's in an equivalent of WW2).

Drama ensues. The traveler realized that this woman is a droppleganger. How should he proceed? Do he take the place of his son? Can he convince her that he's like his son?

He couldn't answer the question about why he's fighting in a country so far away. Instead, he tried to tell the truth.

The mother did not take this as truth as it's obviously fantastical. So he tried a different tack, telling her that he isn't who she think he is. She's unconvinced, especially after doing rapid fire questioning that only her son would know.

Feeling guilty about taking somebody's place, he ran out, find a hotel room so he can think about things some more. It is this time around that he overheard a conversation about people leaving. He decided to join in, ask questions, some of which were very basic, but which were answered(in condescending ways).

It is this conversation when he realized that this person he met earlier could be in danger.

He went to bed, then woke up to the sounds of buzzing planes. People were shouting about an invasion.

Our traveler immediately realized that his mother could be in danger once again. So he made pace for his mother's abode.

Once there, he tried to convince his mother leaving, but she was in denial, reasoning that there were no way to go. Frustrated, he forcefully grabbed her hand and made way for the machine.

Along the way, she tried to protest and argued against leaving, but elected not to put up any resistance. He tried to answer her questions as best he could, but all that was making the mother thinking he's deluded.

Finally, they arrived at the machine, but she was arguing with him as to if she should enter the machine.

A plane screeched by, crashing into the ground, momentarily distracting his mother.

He lead his mother once again into the machine, and then jumped just as another plane was about to crash into the ground.

*End*

Once the arc concluded, we could explore the implication of someone who is very much like your mother staying with you, but is from another place altogether in a time period not so dissimilar to world war two.

*** Critiquing from a rational perspective (I'd give different advice if I saw this post in [[/r/writing]] or [[/r/scifiwriting]]).

How do dopplegängers work? Do parallel universes have a single point of divergence where their history splits off from ours, or were they always different? In either case, how come the protagonist's mother fell in love with the same man and conceived an apparently identical child, and the same question for all their ancestors going back to the point of divergence, when there's otherwise significant differences in their lives (people who died in one world and lived in the other)?

Tell me more about the protagonist's personality. He spent a fortune on a transporter that he didn't think would work. He worries about the fate of his mother's alternate, but not of his own alternate or any of his mother's friends. When going into unexplored territory, he takes a gun, not a camera. All these choices are building up a picture of his personality, but your summary doesn't have a lot of details. Can you just tell me the sort of personality you're trying to give him?

There's a war on. A man shows up out of the blue with no local currency, no papers, a concealed weapon, and very strange behaviour. The correct conclusion from this evidence is that /he is an enemy spy/. How does he make it 24 hours without attracting the police's attention?

An enemy spy? That would not be the conclusion I make. A spy blend in with his surrounding. He does not. He's suspicious in all the wrong way.

Anyway, he made 24 hours because he stopped wearing strange clothes when he sold jewelries to a pawn shop and brought himself clothes to blend in a little better. The pawn shop might report him, but they might not. They're probably a disreputable operation. He probably got ripped off too.

Also, while there's a war going on, people are not necessarily assuming an invasion or is all that prepared to resist, because they didn't think they'll be a target. They're a 'neutral' country.

Is that sufficient rationalization? How could I even start when the world in question is not even some alternate version of Earth?

That works, I suppose. It redirects those questions to the dimensional travel machine, which is already granted suspension of disbelief. But it's not ideal. It still leaves too many questions about how the machine works and why it was designed that way.

At this point the dimensional travel machine /being a machine/ is raising more questions than it answers. Machines have to be researched, designed, built, etc. and that's getting in the way of the story you want to tell, which is about the protagonist's relationship with his mother. Have you considered making the dimensional travel not come from a machine?

The simplest possibility is just leaving it unexplained and inexplicable. First line of the story: /One day, Jacques Moyen found an interdimensional portal in his living room./

And then you get straight to the main plot. You don't have to explain where it came from or how it works, unless it contributes to the story you want to tell. If you do explain it, there are other explanations than "a machine the protagonist invented" that you should also look at.

You're right and I'm wrong about the spy thing. He'll probably be fine for a while.

Sorry if it wasn't clear, but it's more about him than the machine. Only he can do the kind of navigation that he's doing to reach distant dimension. Anyone can use the machine, but then they have no idea of where they're jumping in.

He doesn't know either, but there's some kind of power guiding him in constructing a theory of trans-dimensional travel, the machine thereafter, and navigation.

/The simplest possibility is just leaving it unexplained and inexplicable. First line of the story: One day, Jacques Moyen found an interdimensional portal in his living room./

No, that wouldn't be an option at all. I am starting with this story since it's the simplest and most limited that I can think of. I want to keep scope creep to a minimal so I can focus on writing a good story.

However, as soon we move beyond that, it is always my intention to build on the implication of multi-dimensional travel. It must involves government, researchers, and people.

/You're right and I'm wrong about the spy thing. He'll probably be fine for a while./

I agreed that he will probably be fine. Still, it's a good idea to examine why he might be fine.

Anyway, in the larger society, people meet very strange customers all the time. The question is whether or not it arouse suspicion by shopkeepers. Pawn shop do not want to buy stolen merchandise unless they are a fence.

Even if they're a fence, they're not going to take stolen property from someone they don't know.

So, they might not accept gold jewelries from a stranger if they cannot somehow validate a person's story. He might not get arrested, but he won't have local currencies to spend, either.

Our intrepid traveler have no form of identification that is acceptable to pawnshops. The only thing he can rely on is the credibility of his story.

The current solution I have in mind is a lie detector. Our pawnshop keeper is very good is detecting thieves and people on the run from the law, and that's all he care about.

If you have better solution, feel free to offer one.
