** Oh my god, this chapter was goddamn amazing. The wait was worth it. It was funny at the right moments and intense in equal measure. An appropriate for chapter for my most favorite piece of fiction of all time.

  He nervously fingered the cube given to him by the angel he summoned, wondering if he should--

  No. No, this wasn't the right time. Using it now would be a mistake. Something in the back of his mind insisted that this was true.

From my reread a few weeks back, don't psychics sometimes have some amount of precognitive power? Because that's what this looks like. And it also looks like Zorian before he learned about his empathy but trusted his instincts in reading people anyways.

--------------

Question, since I don't remember it being specified. I presume a normal soul is seated in the physical body. Where is it when you have many simulcrums like Zorian does? I think his simulcrums are vulnerable to some soul attacks, right? This whole area isn't entirely clear in my head.

*** With simulacrums the soul is still located inside Zorian but they can still access it because it has been shown that Zorian can contact his simulacrums using telepathy through the soul. It is unknown if soul attacks on simulacrums affect the original because no such case has happened in the story so far.

**** I think it's more like stretching out the soul to encompass the simulacrum at creation, through the connection that constantly feeding them mana to maintain their form provides. As long as you keep feeding them mana, the connection is maintained and they're still a part of your soul, so soul attacks would work and technically your soul is in all of them. Your mind, however, is always in your original body.

Unless you're Zorian.

**** I also didn't feel very invested in the chapter, and reading your comment made me realize why. Yeah, I feel the same way. There has been an incredible amount of build-up to get to this point, and yet so far it hasn't felt too different compared to most of the latest time-loop battles. I know there should be a sense of finality coming from the lack of time loop, but I'm just so used to Zorian stomping through all opposition without any real set-backs by now that I'm not really feeling it.

There's a time and place to have your characters face the terrible choice of whether or not to go into a burning, structurally unsound building in an effort to save people trapped inside.

But he goes toe to toe with Zorian / Zach? I guess being tutored by our favourite Lich helps a lot?

A lot happened this chapter but no real progress was made on Zach/Zorian's end. Nobody really died except for goons. I guess we're in for a long battle sequence which is good.

Zorian going ultra hive mind with multiple bodies was cool. But yeah he is becoming less human each day. Dr Manhattan style. He will be in a lot of 3somes with himselves and his future wife lol. Just hope he doesn't use a golem body when that time comes.

It is not mentioned that Zorian is using a disguise. Now a looot of people saw his face and there is no way as hell he will be able to protect his identity from interested parties. Secret is out amigos. Just set up the Avengers and be done with it.

Where is the aranea?

*** The Zorian replicas are using golem bodies, both because it's more mana-efficient and more durable than using ectoplasmic bodies. Presumably all those human volunteers are seeing is a blank golem face, not Zorian's?

On the other hand, I wonder if the reason Red Robe is staying cloaked is that he's hoping to keep his identity secret from the authorities. He didn't replace his non-time-loop form, he's in a fresh body. Whether he succeeds or fails, that second form that's just a down-on-his-luck lawyer is still out there, and RR might prefer his alternate staying free of government persecution. If RR loses, Zorian and Zach would probably show mercy and not report him, since, you know, he hasn't technically done anything wrong.

On the other hand, we also know that the red robe itself is covered in high-level wards and stuff. Maybe my speculation is wrong and he's just taking advantage of that so he didn't have to spend time the month making new ones.

*** Red Robe spent much longer in the time loop than Zorian, and he had help from Quatach-ichl, who is, in addition to being really skilled, is also an actually good teacher. He should be a really good mage, but he still isn't a match for Zach or Zorian.

We never see him go toe-to-toe with Zach, but we're told Zach has beaten him before.

We do see Zorian and Red Robe fight (several times), and Zorian wins. Zorian is clearly an archmage at this point, but direct combat is one of his weakest skills. He definitely shouldn't be able to dominate Red Robe, the fact that he's winning at all implies that he was much more effective at taking advantage of the time loop.

Zorian was also doing other things besides self-improvement. He spent a lot of time investigating the invasion and finding the imperial artifacts (each of which people have spent years searching for).

***** QI's bodies are black skeletons that are incredibly hard to damage, regenerate themselves (Zach cuts his arm off and all QI does is touch it to his shoulder and it heals), and he has several of them. I think that is a function of the bodies themselves and a result of the necromancy QI used to construct them. I think it's most similar to Zorian's simulacrums having the strength of their golem bodies.

That wouldn't work for RR. My best for his physical strength is that it's because his body was created by Panaxeth. The cultists originally wanted to summon him to reform their bodies, and he remade Silverlake as a young woman. There's no reason he couldn't give RR a body that is perfected beyond what's humanly possible. (And he has the incentive to do so, since it would make his escape more likely)

It could also be that he doesn't have enhanced strength, he just has a way to make his simulacrum stronger than his real body. He is a soul mage, and we've seen Damien create a giant body around himself, so making a physically enhanced simulacrum should be possible.

And Red Robe spent some of that time experimenting with political situations and getting intel on world governments.

Red Robe left timeloop not long after that and Zach and Zorian spent years (including time chamber and army of experts) furthering their magic. And when they leave the timeloop he is still their equal. I think he should still be powerful but not like this.

Cast even more, your mana pool get exhausted. If the caster has no more mana to maintain a simulacrum, then the simulacrum will fizzle out of existence.

The simulacrums /can/ use his meditation techniques to maximize ambient mana assimilation rate, and that boost is greater than the cost of a single simulacrum. However, the bottleneck is the soul's ability to accept it, so putting multiple simulacrums on the job gives no additional benefit; one is enough. And it's boring, so even one simulacrum might not be keen (though he has mental focus techniques now).

****** Mana is produced by a soul. But there is also environmental mana welling up from the dungeons. (And from what we learned recently, may be produced by the World Core artifact in the center of the world.)

One of the first things beginning mages learn is how to filter ambient mana into personal mana in their mana pool. This effectively increases their pools mana regeneration, but the increase is dependent on the concentration of ambient mana in their immediate area. (Higher level mana well = better regeneration, but there is a cap. A Level 3 Mana Well can let you use the techniques at full efficiency, and stronger wells just let more mage refill at once.)

And seems to be passive most of the time, and could be done while walking around and doing other things. But Xvim also taught Zorian an active version that is more like meditation and takes concentration and effort but is even more effective.

Simulacrums have a link to the original soul, so they can feed ambient mana at their location into the souls mana storage. One Simulacrum concentrating on filtering mana into the pool would give all the other simulacrums (and original) more mana to work with.

But multiple simulacrums (past the first one) doing the same thing wouldn't help because the soul can only filter so much ambien mana at a time, and they are all sharing the same soul.

** Erm. So Zorian spent a long time putting runes all over the city, the leading theory being that they would help fool Zach into believing everyone died and thus fulfilled the contract. But now there's a large hole in his network due to the mansion teleport. I wonder how that will play out.

Dragon battles yay! I wonder why there was so much focus on the bee attack, chances are it will be important later. Ironbeaks are super unreliable. I figure the mansion got teleported near the rift and the summoning ritual is already set up and ready to be cast as soon as it can. Having all the prep work and defenses done beforehand is the only guess I have as to why they teleported it. I wonder if the dragon mage will care that one of his students died, or if it will piss him off. I was expecting him to be more offended by the skeletal dragon but I guess they aren't very social creatures.

I think the point of that section was basically to help show the "Zorian is fighting a war on multiple battlefronts at once".

Zorian cares because that's where his family is, but its overall irrelevant to the Panaxeth summoning, which is why it's a short section. The mention that they are trying to capture the gate is relevant though, and could solve Damien's issues. If the Taramatala capture it and use it to branch into intercontinental trade, that solves his Mother's concern.

*** Nope. Current best guess is that either Quatach-ichl or Panaxeth modified the temporary marker.

Zach could have used the crown on RR, who then went to Quatach-ichl, who modified it. Jornak had connections to the cult, so if Zach stole the crown (likely by brute-forcing strategies over many restarts like he did vs Oganj), the RR could have gotten in contact with Quatach and offered the crown back if he would adjust the marker.

The MOST likely possibility would be that Zach and RR originally found the Sovereign Gate and entered it together. They might not have even needed the keys to do so (the gate was barred because RR left, if might have been unbarred originally). If Panaxeth made the offer to RR to release him in exchange for modifying the marker and a way out, RR would have taken it. The reason we dont see Panaxeth make the offer to modify anyone's marker later is that there was no reason to. RR had already optimized the invasion, leaving Silverlake inside the loop would just create the risk of Zach preventing her from ever leaving or of Zorian mind wiping her. Modifying Zorian's marker (when Panaxeth makes the second offer) would be even worse, since they're so close to being able to leave on their own. Giving Zorian extra time would just take away the only leverage Panaxeth had.

Speaking of, that offer to let Zorian with no strings attached in exchange for mind wiping Zach was a terrible deal. Panaxeth would be much better off with only Zach escaping than only Zorian escaping.

Even if he had no intention of trying to escape, with six restarts he could definitely find a way to cause Zach problems, and if he was added permanently his success would be guaranteed.

The spell that added Zorian did significant damage to Zach's soul, and based on QI's suicide attack the loop doesn't take him out to heal, he was just being hidden by his gaurdian. Just repeating the soul merge spell six restarts in a row would cripple Zach for years, and with time to prepare he could probably do something stronger. The voidsoul deer permanent enhancement worked on Zach, so clearly the marker's protection doesn't prevent permanent changes.
