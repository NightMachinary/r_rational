** SIEGE OF HOGWARTS

VOLDEMORT THRESHOLD CROSSED

GET HYPE

Okay I /love/ that Hogwarts is where the climactic siege against the Concept will occur. Magic has so many interesting avenues of offense and defense-- Sean had a brilliant thought with his sensory modification, but of course Mad-Eye can just false memory charm you to stick the image directly into your head.

Dumbledore was able to ward against the meme because Hogwarts is impregnable by longstanding narrative convention. But the Concept is evolving at the speed of thought here because it's all but melded with magic.

Pensieves are a smart solution, scaling it up is gonna be tough. I enjoy the challenge set out here (for Sean, Haley, and FormerlySarsaparilla) and look forward to seeing this ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny.

Also SEAN AND HALEY ARE BACK TOGETHER

I still love the Concept a lot. It's got Mad-Eye, Merlin and Holmes, and I can't wait to see how those three navigate this siege.

** #+begin_quote
  Don't tell me you're thinking about taking a trip to the SCP universe or something.
#+end_quote

That's... actually not a terrible idea, mainly because the SCP universe is explicitly designed for many narrators and continuities. All they have to do is find someone to write a Tale about Site-1000, where all the most useful anomalies and none of the dangerous ones are stored.

*** They've got a bunch of antimemetic stuff...because there's memes worse than the Concept.

**** On the one hand, the [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/unforgettable-that-s-what-you-are][unthinkable bomb]] is basically designed specifically to take out something like the Concept.

​

On the other hand, [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3125][SCP-3125]]is explicitly stated to be a sort of conceptual prionic infection, capable of subsuming other ideas into itself, and is much, much more dangerous than the Concept (for example, 3125 instantly kills and takes over almost anyone who even knows about it, can create other SCPs, and can't be cured by memory removal). If 3125 subsumes the Concept, then you've gone from being fucked, to being super, extra fucked.

​

On the third hand, it would be interesting to see the fallout from SCP-3125 and the Concept duking it out in idea space, or however a fight between them would work.

***** I feel like 3125 and the Concept would get along like two black holes colliding.

The Concept would be drawn into the 3125 memeplex, and that'd be it for the known pataphysical universe.
