Howdy all. New chapter of Pokemon: the Origin of Species is on schedule and will probably be published this week. I have something I'd like to discuss in the meantime though:

Fairy Types.

So for those not in the know, Fairy is a new type introduced in Generation VI, the latest games. They did not exist for the fifteen years since pokemon started, and definitely didn't exist in the timeline of the original Kanto stories (Red and Blue, later retconned in FireRed and LeafGreen).

There is absolutely no explanation given in the games, and as far as I'm aware in the comics or anime, as to why Fairy types didn't exist before and do now. They are not just newly discovered species: pokemon that already existed before Gen VI had Fairy type added to them, or changed one of their types to Fairy (usually Normal).

So as usual when Pokemon fails to explain something in their mythos, it's up to fans to come up with many ideas as to why a jigglypuff could be obliterated by a Dragonbreath one game, and then be completely immune to it in the next.

I actually have an explanation in mind, and I think it's a sufficiently logical one:

So in Pokemon X and Y, the latest games, there were two new Legendaries released that had the theme of granting Eternal Life (one by sucking the life out of others, the other by giving its own energy and going into hibernation for 1000 years).

Xerneas is the give-its-own-energy pokemon, and it's the first Legendary Fairy type introduced. My idea is that Xerneas is actually the source of all Fairy type energy, and when it comes out of hibernation is when the latent Fairy genes/energy become active in pokemon like Clefairy and Togepi.

Here's the problem: that means according to the timeline, there will be no Fairy types around in my story.

So I have two options:

1) Pretend Fairy types have always existed, and ignore them being a "new discovery" so that they can have a presence in the story.

2) Go with my explanation as to why Fairy types don't exist yet. I might hint at them and present it as a mystery, but the type itself will not be present.

I'm curious to know what you guys think, and what you'd prefer.


** I don't know which one would work better with your story, but I have to say the explanation you came up with is fun and clever.

My impression is that your fictional civilization doesn't quite understand typing yet (like that confusion between poison and grass types between blue and red), but if your civilization contains people constantly battling pokemon for sport and practical purposes, it seems like even if no one was doing science a sudden change would be a pretty significant event, and people would know and wonder about it.

Do you see pokemon types as being physics-style laws (as in, the laws governing the universe specifically mention pokemon types) or more descriptions of emergent properties? (for example, the notion that water is strong against fire somehow being a result of the fact that water cuts off combustion from oxygen as an oxidizing agent, would make the water vs. fire relationship emerge from a different set of rules)

*** Red in the story does cast doubt on "The Type Chart" meme, saying it is mostly just cultural baggage from the early days of pokemon, and that it is the actual reality of "Water physically prevents fire" that created it.

Which is why the only problem Daystar faces is rationalizing a "Fairy Type" pokemon's sudden immunity to dragon fire, not the type itself.

*** If you are comfortable with stretching the canon a bit more, you /could/ have the later-Generation Fairy types present ...except they lose the Fairy type, or are transformed into Normal type just like Togepi, Clefairy, and jigglypuff if they are pure-fairy type. That would allow you to use the cool explanation while keeping any conspicuous fairy types you had in mind for plot in the story. It would be a cool little "wait, what? that's normal type?" moment for the reader, which would happen to have a perfectly good explanation.

You don't actually have to answer the physics/emergent question, but this provides an interesting opportunity for the /characters/ to consider the distinction. After all, many of the legendary pokemon are considered gods. It's fitting for them to alter big laws, and the challenges that posed to those who are trying to figure out which laws are universal constants and which are just local peculiarities.

For example, if Fairy type appears and disappears (in sync with Xerneas's hibernation habits, although I don't know whether the characters are aware of Xerneas or not) it means that Type law must on certain other factors, and that we don't know the whole story.

If it's really 1000 years, I imagine what would /actually/ happen in a world like our own is that people would assume the ancient records were simply mistaken about the existence of a Fairy type, its properties, and the pokemon assigned to it before considering the idea that the rules actually changed. You could have some staunch traditionalist insist upon it.

If you want to get around /that/, then there are multiple Xernea, they have a localized effect, and there were no fairies in earlier versions because the Xernea weren't nearby. That's generally a model that works for all legendary pokemon - there could be more than one, but they are rare and powerful so a local mythology develops around them. (We do much the same with our own animals, despite them not being powerful).

Yeah, that's kind of what I had in mind for the hint-dropping. A thousand years would put them back beyond the point of modern technology, and firmly in the scope of legends.

The idea of there being multiple Xernea works too, though that works best paired with a localization effect, which means there can still be stories of Clefairy exhibiting odd properties in other regions from time to time.

***** In general, I think the world makes a lot more sense if there are multiple legendaries, although they don't necessarily have to be in the ecosystem or reproduce like the others.

Pokemon like Mewtwo can get a pass for uniqueness, but it's kind hard to design a universe where some individual Pokemon is /actually/ the sole embodiment of Big Concepts like Life, God, Space, Time or whatever, and then not have weird, universe ending implications when a trainer catches them or they get defeated by some Gastly with destiny bond.

***** If you want to make things simple, you shouldn't go out of your way to include elements not present in the game your story is based on. If you really want to include, or at least comment on, the Fairy type in the story, I think a periodic event/localization effect is the way to go, since this time next month you'll be able to mention Hoenn in this context as well as Kalos. It looks like the Generation III remakes are going to calmly ignore this dilemma altogether, for the Fairy type and for Mega Evolutions.

**** So if it's a descriptions of emergent properties that means in a way you almost /have/ to depart from game canon at various points - For example, a hydro pump should absolutely decimate a Slugma, but there's no particular reason an Arcanine should care any more than a Raticate if it takes a water jet anywhere that's not directly to the fire-pipe, unless you're going to say that the fire stems from the fur somehow.

So while I think the fairy sub-plot is fun and worth doing, you're already sufficiently far away from canon to get away with almost anything you want without people feeling it's "wrong".

***** Part of it is that the typing matchups are much more mechanical than the games can demonstrate.

Water isn't strong against an arcanine the same way it's strong against a slugma. With the latter, "it does more damage" makes sense. But with the former, the reason a water type has an advantage is that its attacks can cancel out the fire type's, which means it has to resort to purely physical attacks while the water type can use its special attacks too.

As for the fire coming from the fur, arcanine can combust their fur the way rapidash can their hair, but it doesn't necessarily hurt to get it quenched. Though it is likely very distracting and uncomfortable.

****** Even considering the various fringe cases where type matchups do not behave as deterministically as it happens in the games, I find it curious that we haven't seen a more deterministic and well thought example of type matchups yet.

If the inhabitants obtain even some 17 cases of clear type differences and impacts and make with them a linear system it woud be trivial to compute the full type chart. With so many Pokémon it should be relatively trivial to get a statistic indication of a general graph, and then the discussion would move more towards each Pokémon's type classification.

I can't help but feel that someone like Bill has gotten the hard data from N official and registered Pokémon battles and wastes quite a bit of time classifying type matchups.

** I generally prefer to retcon things so that they were always there. In Generation 1, there were 150 known species of Pokémon - never mind the millenia old, civilization-defining interactions with other species a few hundred miles away. In Generation 2, Pokémon eggs were just discovered. Before that, Pokémon just... didn't reproduce, I guess?

The Pokémon series does this sort of thing all the time. You certainly /could/ explain it with the Xerneas thing, but that would make the issue of typing even more confusing than it already is. It would make "types" more fundamental to the universe than I think you want them to be. You shouldn't just wave a magic deer and turn on a latent type, just like you can't wave a magic wand and turn on a latent exoskeleton, whatever that would mean.

On the other hand, Fairy is basically pure magic, so if any type can be turned on and off, it would be Fairy. But if you want types to be emergent properties, then you'd have to specifically tell me that Fairy is different from organism-with-oil-bladder. And if Fairy actually is a real fundamental thing, how should I know that Rock is not? Can I trust that you won't pull out special rock-magic the same way you would pull out special fairy-magic?

*** Yeah, there's a definite division between the types that are emergent properties and those that aren't.

As you said, the Fairy type is basically mystical: that's part of why I made Daisy's clefairy show abilities with so much of a "wow" factor, to ease in the idea that Red might not be completely correct in his belief that the types are *all* merely descriptive.

Dragon energy, as well as Psychic/Ghost/Dark energy, are the other things that, as "Types," clearly stand apart from physics as we know it, but I'm also going into those last three quite a bit this chapter, so I'm curious to find out how well you think the description of them walks the line.

**** Make fairy energy similar to Psychic/Ghost/Dark energy then but far less understood and subtle, to the point of not being yet known and used as a separate Type classification.

As to why their moves have different strengths, what Fairy-Type moves actually existed as Normal-Type in the original games? Maybe the trainer has to actually understand and be in tune with whatever Fairy energy is to effectively use it in a way that somehow disturbs Dragons, disrupts the counterpoint Dark energy, surpasses the defenses granted by Ghost energy, confuses complicated Fighting moves and affects hard but porous Rock a bit more than expected?

Harder would be to explain why no one noticed those moves being less effective when it comes to combustion capable Pokémon or those with natural immunities to Poison (often because they themselves contain such). Maybe the weakness is subtle and the effects haven't been studied enough because of the rarity of such encounters? Something to do with volatile chemicals?

In any case there seem to be only three second generation moves to change from Normal to Fairy.

Much harder still are the defensive traits though. I can't come up with anything easy and sensible for those changes at the moment.

At worst you just forget those and act as if they were just Normal types, maybe with a few very conditional exceptions that seem to crop up more and more often, culminating to whatever triggers Xerneas awakening?

** If at all possible, you might want to wait until ORAS comes out. I'm getting a feeling that XY & ORAS are actually a part of a sort of "universe reset" timeline, and ORAS's story might lend something to that. Especially with the Hoopa side-plot.

In the immediate sense however, it could be said that Kalosian Jigglypuff are Fairy Type, while Kantoan, etc., Jigglypuff are just Normal. You could link it back to Xerneas, and the war 3000 years ago, perhaps had a regional effect which gave those pokemon special powers.

However, since ORAS is technically contemporaneous with the Kanto games, and those games will have Mega-Evolutions and Fairy types, which were "discovered" upwards of 15 years later in XY, it might be better to just take the same approach Gamefreak does, and just make new things, always things.

Edit: Sylveon, for example. Any random affectionate trainer who teaches their Eevee charm could concievably evolve it into a Sylveon, but for some-one reason this only happens in Kalos.

Edit 2: Your Awakened Xerneas theory is good, but I can see one small problem. Moves like Moonlight, that were retconned fairy type. If "Fairy Magic" comes from Xerneas, then why do these moves still work exactly the same? And all the moves that are only fairy type, what happens to them?

I'm definitely going to be interested in ORAS's story, since they take place at the same time :) I plan to keep the focus of my story firmly on Kanto, but the events in Hoenn will make waves (so to speak) far and wide, and there might be an interlude or two that takes place there.

Or only happens when a Xerneas is out of hibernation, and the rest of the time possible Sylveons remain dormant as Eevees and evolve into something else.

To be honest the whole method of evolving Sylveon is too gamey anyway, and I'm going to be tweaking some of the Eevee evolutions mechanics.

Well this is actually another problem with the way the game arbitrarily classifies things: the Moon is given huge importance for Fairy pokemon, with moves like Moonlight and Moonblast, and pokemon like Clefairy praying/singing to the moon.

But pokemon that are inherently tied to the moon, like Lunatone or Cressalia, were not retconned as Fairy types. And Clefairy is actually the only Fairy type pokemon that learns Moonlight, while the rest are non-Fairy types.

So the typing of moves can be left to interpretation if it doesn't really make sense within Pokemon's own internal logic. For example, I'm not making "Bite" attacks dark type. It's one of those really illogical things that the game does for mechanical balancing reasons (when Dark was introduced there were virtually no moves for it, so they converted some existing ones).

It's also why dark is bad against steel - underhanded tricks won't help you punch through metal.

In this sense, it's clear that Bite is a dark attack, alongside the likes of sucker punch, thief and feint attack.
