** If people rather have a physical copy of the book made out of dead trees rather an electron-only version, you can get a copy off [[https://www.amazon.com/Magical-Delinquents-Physics-Magic-1/dp/1499367139][Amazon]].

** This is more young-adult/urban-fantasy, but it's written by a rationalist and the characters make clever use of the resources they have available.

It's not the kind of thing that typically gets posted here, I know luminosity wasn't very popular, but I quite enjoyed them back when they were first published, which was shortly after the first CFAR workshops.

They had disappeared from the internet, so this is me getting it back on the internet in case anyone else goes looking for it.

** Did you "share" the files properly? I get a "No items" notice when I open the folder (on my phone).

*** It works fine for me in private browsing. Maybe google is just caching things weird.

Here's the share links to the individual files:

** Are they completed? The first pdf ends rather abruptly for me, like it's missing the end.
