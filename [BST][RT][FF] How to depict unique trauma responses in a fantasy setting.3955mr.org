This question stems from my efforts in writing my first Naruto fanfic, and trying to create a more interesting, but far more unpredictable and mentally unstable (dare I say sociopathic?) Naruto.

The fic is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11077254/1/Fuujin-Chronicles-of-a-Jutsu-Smith][here]], for those interested. I haven't broached this particular topic in the story yet, which is why I want to discuss and refine the idea before putting it out there. Now, as a general idea of the circumstances surrounding said trauma, and the resulting questions:

1. The orphan child (in this case, Naruto) starts off mostly normal, but has no knowledge of the overwhelmingly negative social stigma around him (in this case, due to the demon fox sealed away inside him).
2. A freak disease, similar to the aftereffects of the fox's rampage, sweep through the town, killing hundreds. Through mob mentality, insecurity and lingering war memories, public opinion starts to come to the conclusion that this disease is the "fox's revenge", even though there is a rational explanation for it.
3. The child finds himself at the mercy of said public soon afterwards, leading a particularly incensed group of civilians to engage in beating the child to near death. The child eventually recovers, but remembers nothing of his life bar a few names, and develops a minor speech impediment (cause unknown; possible brain damage).
4. The child, unfortunately, loses his primary caregivers in the wake of the disease, and is eventually given up to an orphanage. This universe's equivalent of the Secret Service (ANBU) are forced to swear the staff to a binding oath to never intentionally harm Naruto. The fact that this is necessary, and the fact that some civilians are entertaining the notion of 'martyrdom' by making attempts on the boy's life despite the inevitable execution, does not bode well at all.
5. All goes relatively well for a few years, until certain tensions boil over, and the child is grievously attacked again, this time by means of immolation over the course of several hours, well out of sight and earshot of most authorities. The child only survives due to the near-inhuman regenerative properties of the demon fox within him, and some timely interference.
6. Due to a certain political power struggle around the boy (who could very well be maladjusted enough to play into the hands of unsavoury, war-mongering folk who want a walking human weapon), the child is forced to live as a street urchin, but not without a highly skilled patrol tracking his every move and keeping him out of immediately lethal danger.

From here, I intend to develop Naruto as being strangely affected by the demon fox's attempts to keep him alive. In a normal scenario, Naruto will be depicted as a boy harboring a near-obsessive desire to survive by making as little human contact as possible, opting instead to eavesdrop, sneak and steal. When he recognizes a threat to his life, however, he makes a psychological 180 to hyper-aggression, essentially amounting to 'remove threat NOW, at all costs' and acting akin to a frothing berzerker. My questions are:

1. Is aggression as a trauma response a viable and consistent reaction? Can it occur in children? (Assume 10+ years old)
2. What are some of the physical and mental tells of an aggressive traumatic response? How does a person usually build up to such an explosive reaction?
3. Can a child have such massive temperament swings because of a trauma response, or does it only lend itself to older characters?
4. Are there any lasting negative effects of such a condition?

This lists the effects of ptsd in children.

This lists some common causes, which could also work as triggers, e.g. surgery to implant a body part.

[[https://www.myptsd.com/c/threads/dealing-with-the-explosive-anger.23005/]]

This notes some stories of dealing with triggers. I would particularly note how they modify their behaviour to avoid triggers. Waiting is stressful, so avoid activities that involve waiting for example.

This has a good list of triggers

A good picture to imagine their mind.

A comic by a sufferer to picture how their mind works.

The best fanfiction I've read that deals with ptsd well.

*** I'm starting to think I may have underestimated just how crippling a traumatic response can be. In the context of a fantasy setting, it can be twisted somewhat to the story's advantage, but god/damn/ is it emotionally jarring to hear about. In ANY context.

**** Consider that chakra makes ninja super-humanly strong, fast, and physically durable. Chakra do that sort of enhancement for the mind and mental state as well.

And look what canon Naruto's got: an abundance of over-the-top optimism /and/ chakra. Sort of fits, right? Might not make someone sane, but it could make them stable when any normal person would be a complete psychotic mess. Even if your Naruto wasn't taught in the academy how to properly use yin chakra and meditation to keep himself sane, it could be a natural side-effect of his situation.

Might also go a long way to rationally explaining why ninja don't just PTSD out almost immediately, even when they're /not/ genius 12-year-old murderbots with the fate of the village in their hands. Would also be a good explanation for veteran ninja with absurdly exaggerated personality traits, a side-effect of directed yin/yang chakra imbalances that supported their mental states over their long careers as professional spies, assassins, combat engineers, and forward scouts.

So Kakashi meditating on his dead friends at the memorial stone isn't a sign of weakness or sloth, but is perhaps a Hokage-ordered method to keep a severely traumatized, top village asset from suiciding or going on a rampage.

***** You managed to rationally explain strong = crazy, holy shit. Totally going to incorporate this concept. Thank you!

** That's some really complex stuff, I'd recommend asking a subreddit on psychology or childhood development. I wouldn't trust anyone without a degree on the subject, anything else could be conjecture.

*** While hard facts are nice, I'd still be reasonably happy with references to fics that address similar problems in a convincing manner, rooted in rationality. I'd take it with a grain of salt, naturally, but if I can draw parallels between said fic and science, then it can certainly be worked with to some extent.

**** Find stuff aimed at family caregivers. "/How to cope with X/", where */X/* is something horrible happening in the (even canon) Naruto 'verse. Look for charity organizations, university press, and not-for-profits. Avoid mainstream news stories and articles.

**** Also, mention the time period the plot takes place at. Medieval responses to this trauma differ from modern responses.
