** I don't have a beta or proofreader and I am aware of the many grammar errors lurking beneath, despite the fact that I swept it over one or two times for such errors.

It's also scary for me to post something here, even though I post the same damn thing on three different forum, but I don't receive very much feedback. People aren't interested in original content.

The story I posted is not all I have written so far, just some that had been edited at least once. (6K posted in that thread versus 11K I have written so far)

**** It's the name of the planet, but earth is earth.

I have no intention of replacing phrases with unnecessary phrase or speech.

It would be like calling tanks barrels instead of just using tanks just because British in a different timeline opted to use 'barrel' to conceal the development of an armored fighting vehicle.

I will just use tanks. The reader will know what I mean, and I don't have to explain to them that particular bit of trivia, and the readership don't have to memorize that unique piece of terminology.

Besides, they are not speaking English anyway. Just treat it as a translation convention.

** Is this going to be like HPMOR, reeling in the readers with the promise of scientific revolution, then dropping it by the wayside in favor of Plot?

*** Space exploration is the plot or the driving motivations for characters, but it's never quite the only thing that happens.
