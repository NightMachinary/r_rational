** OK, I tried to read your story. Got to the first part of the fourth chapter before dropping it. Things that stuck out at me:

- The opening is super, super weak.

  #+begin_quote
    Catherine, a 21 year old graduate student, heard the morning news while facing an emerald encrusted mirror and straightening her beautiful blonde hair. Though the girl didn't see it, her television showed a news reporter on the street approaching a young man with slightly spiky, messy brown hair
  #+end_quote

  This immediately pattern matches to something out of the [[http://www.bulwer-lytton.com/][Bulwer-Lytton contest]]. The third word is not the place to be lazy and refuse to write out twenty-one, and that alone almost made me kill the tab and drop the story... but the rest of the opening wasn't much better. This sort of bad writing is not unique to this part of the story, but the opening should draw me in and make me keep reading, and this story completely failed that metric.

- You have bits where you write with a sentence leading up to a piece of dialogue, then put a colon and separate the dialogue on the next line. This is super weird formatting, and breaks flow occasionally. You also seem to be constantly worried that the reader will not know who is speaking in a dialogue of two speakers - you have a lot of superfluous 'X said' and 'Y said' stuff in your text that breaks the flow of the dialogue. Shortening it down by using pronouns such as "He said" instead of proper names, or ideally removing them as much as possible altogether and still have the dialogue make sense, would make the dialogue read better and be much less stilted.

- Something interesting starts happening at the end of the first chapter. Why didn't the interesting stuff happen at the start, instead? Was the chapter of semirandom foreshadowing and setup work particularly interesting to you?

- I dropped the story in chapter 4, during the trial of Arthur. I just couldn't force myself through the particularly awkward and stilted dialogue of this section.

*** Thank you for your help! From what I'm gathering all of this seems fixable so at least I know I'm not writing /complete/ garbage. Every author I've studied says that the first few books will always suck, but at least it could be worse, right?

I've been told about "bad formatting" before but I can't seem to get anyone to tell me exactly what they mean by this. Are there any online resources to improve this? I'm going a bit overboard on the dialogue tags because I received complaints from some of my friends about it being hard to figure out who was talking. This is just for the first draft, though. I prefer to go a bit too much in the first run through and remove them in revision rather than doing it backwards. I just want to get to the ending before I begin editing, so a lot of the flow stuff is taking a backseat while I finish. Anyway, thanks for checking it out!

*** I've not read it. I might try it, but I will say as somebody who has a lot of trouble not writing X said after every quote I'm not quite sure how to do it better. Yes it would still be clear without them, but as I can tell you after just reading a book that had as far as I can tell no instances of X said it can sound strange in that case too

**** I don't think you really need to vary away from 'X said'. It's something that the eye skips over when reading, for the most part. You still need to worry about flow, but that's separate from the issue of removing ambiguity with speech tagging.

If you have each spoken part on it's own line, and stay under 6 lines or so, you shouldn't need any other description-- just end quote and start newline.

I'd also suggest giving each character distinctive ways of speaking-- verbal tics and sentence structures they favor.

Maybe a character enjoys speaking long, flowing sentences; the semi-colons are almost audible as they pile clause upon clause and metaphor upon metaphor onto their audience.

Another? Terse.

And just because a character has certain traits doesn't mean their speech has to reflect them.

You can have yer fancy-pants, Harvard-educated, but still country boy, or a sweet, homely, but foul-mouthed as hell grandma that curses at the end of every motherfucking sentence, goddamn!

Finally, you can give characters physical tics as well-- maybe they like to tug on their earlobe, or tap their feet, or fiddle with their keychain. Even without directly identifying them, your reader will begin to notice who's speaking by looking at textual clues.

Of course, now I just need to take my own advice ;)

Yup! Unless otherwise indicated, the reader will assume that the last person mentioned is the one talking. It's a neat trick that... I probably use too much, come to think of it. Example:

#+begin_quote
  Violet choked on her tea. "Ex-excuse me?"
#+end_quote

See? Don't even need the "she said".

** #+begin_quote
  "Ahh that's because they think, quite accurately might I add, that I'm carrying a, small, yet incredibly dangerous nuclear bomb" said Emmet, still trying to find the correct key. He got out a pulsating metallic sphere with his left hand and gave it to Catherine. "Here, hold it for me would you?"
#+end_quote

Best line. Gets funnier every time I read it.

#+begin_quote
  "Quick explanation: we're currently inside an-"\\
  "Island-shaped dimension where reality constantly changes," said Arthur, "I know."
#+end_quote

... I didn't know that. Were we actually told about the flexible reality before this? I think I missed that line.

#+begin_quote
  "The city acts like an anchor for reality. It's the only stable point of the universe and if it gets destroyed, then EVERYTHING will be gone."
#+end_quote

This is incredibly contrived.

#+begin_quote
  -I don't get it, why doesn't she just share her feelings with Emmett?-
#+end_quote

I didn't notice that either. Was there an entire romance arc that I missed? Am I just bad at remembering things I've read?

--------------

The story needs an editing pass, at least. The narration's very stilted, phrased strangely and punctuated inconsistently. There's several errors that your spellchecker should have caught. And you use some words that don't mean what I think you think they mean, I think. All fixed easily enough, you just need someone else to read your story and find the mistakes.

Beyond that, I have some other questions. Emmett seems to be the protagonist, but he's not the viewpoint character. We see the story through Catherine and Arthur's eyes, even though they do essentially nothing to advance the plot. What's the reason for that decision?

Is Emmett secretly the bad guy? In places he's channelling Quirrelmort from HPMoR. Brilliant but dangerous, flippant attitude to other people's lives... Yet he seems too likeable to be a real villain. If that's the twist you're building up to, you need to be less subtle about it.

There's a lot of focus on character interaction, but apart from Emmett I don't find any of the characters engaging. If I want to listen to twenty-something grad students argue about their lives, I hardly need your story for that.

It's the end of chapter 8 and I have no idea what the plot is. Apparently they're saving the universe from an unspecified threat, but I don't see how anything that's happened contributes towards that goal.

Edit: Actually, do they still have the bomb from chapter 2? I don't recall it being put down at any point. Quite an important thing to forget about!

*** Thanks for taking time to read the story, your feedback is very helpful to me and I really appreciate it! I'm sorry if this reply is too long, but you're the only person I can talk to about this since I haven't heard anything from anyone else caught up. I hope you don't mind, I'm just excited I can talk to someone about it.

Arthur assumed the flexible reality when Artemisia says:

#+begin_quote
  -The Dreamscape is a chaotic realm where the only constant of the environment is change! The journey to the island's center is an incredibly dangerous one that could take decades, even knowing the proper route to it. No person we've sent has ever returned!-
#+end_quote

But I wanted to reveal it to the reader without info dumping too much so I had Arthur say it in the next chapter. Do you think there's a better way to do this?

I don't think the spoiler tag is necessary since this is revealed in the next chapter (and this is amateur fiction; not Game of Thrones here), but [[#s][Spoiler:]], though it's not as simple as that. [[#s][Spoiler:]]

[[#s][Bigger spoiler that some of my friends figured out, so maybe you've already thought of it too:]]

[[#s][Even bigger spoiler that I haven't seen anyone figure out yet:]]

I wanted Catherine and Arthur to be similar to the average grad-student/college senior, smart and good natured, but still too young to see how egotistical and overconfident they are. I'm trying to strike a balance of likable and arrogant so that, when all is said and done, the audience can see how much they've grown. If it helps, once I finish showing Catherine's backstory in the next few chapters, they're going to stop arguing about their lives and stuff. I just want the reader to see where they are coming from before I have them step up. [[#s][Spoiler:]] If you're at all familiar with anime, then the best comparison I can give to what I'm aiming for is Neon Genesis Evangelion. It's supposed to get darker and darker as the story goes on, along with subverting common tropes, suicidal/existentialist mindtrips, and convoluted metaphysical nonsense. Unfortunately, most of that is going to happen in the second half of the story since I needed to set up my characters before I could do any of that in a way that wasn't complete pretentious horseshit. It's also why I'm having the characters be a bit too philosophical in their conversations, so that the reader doesn't throw away the metaphorical book once they reach these moments later in the story. I mean, if they read past mushy stuff like:

#+begin_quote
  I deny the existence of love, not because I want to, but because I have to. Otherwise... it would just mean I've never been worthy of it.
#+end_quote

then odds are they won't mind my philosophical rantings later on, right?

Edit about your edit: The dreamscape machine works by sending the user's consciousness into the dimension, not their physical bodies. I /did/ forget to explain this, so thanks for pointing it out for me!

**** This is just bizarre. Your summaries and spoilers evoke a very interesting and meta story, one that I'd probably love and not be able to put down. Yet the actual story you've posted seems meandering and poorly-written, no offence. Maybe it's just that it's not finished yet and it'll make more sense as a finished product than as a serial? Like you say, a lot of the interesting twists are yet to come, so large chunks of the story at the moment are effectively pointless until you write the part where their foreshadowing pays off.

I can accept that it's part of Emmett's character to be unhelpfully evasive, but Cathering and Arthur have little reason to trust him. Consider what he's actually done to them - tricked them into coming to an alternate dimension, under threat of the SWAT team surrounding the house and the nuke he'd threatened to use, and while he's the only one who knows how to go back to reality (where they're presumably still surrounded by armed soldiers) - he's basically their abusive kidnapper. But they still trust him and consider him a friend, which is strange.

... I actually did not see any of the things in any of the spoilers coming. Sorry.

Am I right in thinking English isn't your first language? That would definitely explain why you have impeccable grammar but odd turns of phrase, and it means your story would benefit a lot from a native-speaking editor. The jarring language (including your use of -dashes- instead of "quotation marks" for dialogue) seems like a small thing now, but it makes it incredibly difficult for the reader to immerse themselves in the story.

***** Yup! English is my second language. Oh, and no offense taken! In its current stage it /is/ meandering and poorly-written! I really don't want to sound like I'm making excuses here, since I recognize that my skill isn't yet where it needs to be for this story to reach what I'm aiming for. This is the second long-form story I'm working on, so I don't expect it to be great yet. I want to finish writing before I start revising though, or else I get stuck in editing mode and never finish.

I think a lot of the problems right now can be attributed to the fact that this is just my first draft. Again, not an excuse, just an explanation. I'm not afraid to admit I'm still a shitty writer! I started writing this in march so I still haven't worked on it as much as I'd like. I'm just confident I have something special here and that, with /a lot/ of work, I can make it a good story. Without people to read it, I've basically been jumping in blindly without knowing what works and what doesn't.

In its current form, is there really no redeeming value to the story? I thought that, despite its flaws, it could be a somewhat enjoyable read. Interesting enough to spark curiosity about the next chapter. Then again, I'm biased here so I'm obviously not the best person to know whether I'm fooling myself or not. Also, I was using quotation marks at first, but IRL people were complaining about them and I was told to use dashes. I really don't know what to make of it.

Still, I've been considering making this a whole book instead of separating it. It really might help it to do it entirely in one go, but I'm not sure if its worth the trouble.

Of course not, don't be ridiculous. But as you say, it's a first draft, unedited, and will need some work to reach its full potential.

It's not worth the trouble. Finish this project on time and stick with the plan you're already working on. I say, any lessons you learn about how to publish a serial or how to plan a story, you can apply to the /next/ thing you make. Better to have an imperfect, finished project than one that never finishes because you keep trying to make it perfect. (That's why I don't post anything substantial that I write. Once I start editing it properly, I'm too afraid to release it until it's perfect, which it never is. Don't make my mistake.)

Nobody expects your first book to be your masterpiece. You show a lot of potential already, you just need practice to bring it out.

Edit: Quotation marks are the standard in written English. All the English-language stories I've read use quotation marks for dialogue. Other languages vary. German uses „a different style of quotation marks“. French uses «guillemets» for short quotes and a single --- emdash when an entire paragraph is dialogue.
