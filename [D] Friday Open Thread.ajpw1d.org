Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

*** I use [[https://www.amazon.com/Verilux-HappyLight-Lucent-Bright-Therapy/dp/B079YBGPM5/ref=zg_bs_13053141_3?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=VZN33WQ547B69BZ8Z5MT][this one]], a Verilux 10,000 lux LED lamp that's set up next to my computer so that I can use it while I'm surfing reddit (or whatever). It's super simple, which helps make it fairly cheap, and I've been using it for the past two years with okay results. It's hard to tell though, because the interventions for SAD are:

- More sleep
- 300 mcg melatonin at night to regulate sleep
- Vitamin D supplements
- Exercise
- Light therapy

So the relative success of light therapy itself is hard to judge. /Personally/, light therapy gives me a touch of nausea until after I've adjusted to it, so I start with 15 minutes and increase whenever the nausea starts to go away. I'm at an hour now, with no nausea, but the nausea comes back if I skip a few days (as happened with Thanksgiving).

**** I also use a light box in the mornings, mainly for a sleep disorder. I also use a blue light filter app on my computer (f.lux) and on my phone (a default option with some samsung galaxy phones) to reduce my blue light exposure at nighttime. It's also a good idea to avoid chocolate in the evenings and avoid drinking coffee in the afternoons and evenings. It's also good to set your alarm to wake up at the same time every day so your sleep cycle is regular. It should also go without saying, but a lot of people don't sleep enough. For some people 6 or 7 hours a day don't cut it and they need 8 or more. Daytime naps should also be avoided, they tend to ruin your nighttime sleep. That doesn't apply to elderly people though since sleep patterns tend to change as people age, with elderly people often sleeping less at night, getting up very early, and taking naps during the day.

Another thing most people don't realize: don't lie down on your bed for anything other than sleep or sex. It reduces the psychological association between your bed and sleep.

If all else fails go see a doctor. People who wake up feeling unrefreshed in the morning may have sleep apnea, and people who feel refreshed in the morning but tend to fall asleep during the day such as while driving may have narcolepsy. Hypothyroidism can also cause fatigue, and so can some other conditions. Some medications can also be sedating.

Edit: Also, I really shouldn't have to mention this but it's disturbingly common so I'll just say this: don't use alcohol as a sleep aid. Not only is alcohol terrible for you, but it's also terrible for this. The alcohol gets processed by your system through the night and people end up just getting up early. It also messes up your sleep cycle. Same with benzodiazepines, don't ask your doctor for xanax for sleep. Benzodiazepines are also pretty addictive, so like alcohol tolerance develops. There are better medications like zolpidem for that.

***** Wow, huge thank you for the reminder that chocolate contains caffeine!

I recently "quit using all caffeine" and haven't seen any improvements in my urge to sleep. Eating dark chocolate as my late night snack is probably a larger part of that now that I'm not drinking 240-300mg of caffeine daily.

The silver lining is that this encourages me to have the chocolate as my first meal of the day!

*** The overhead lights in my ceiling fan all burned out most of a year ago so I've gone most of that time with just a not-particularly-bright floor lamp, but maybe like two months ago I was able to get a four-pack of daylight bulbs from Walmart for like 10 bucks. I was surprised by how gosh darned bright they are, and they're exceptionally white to the point of almost looking blue (they're just exposed to the world, no covers/shades/whatever).

After like a week or two I noticed that I was feeling WAY too alert around bedtime and that I was having a lot of trouble falling asleep, and that I was starting to feel somewhat manic during the day. I haven't felt manic in a very long time. I put two and two together and realized it was the light, so I've started shutting off my overhead lights around 6-7pm and that's helped me regulate things.

Something is always better than nothing, right? Mania is the opposite of depression (in terms of one being a surplus of serotonin and the other a deficit) and the cheap bulbs (relatively speaking, compared to other solutions sold explicitly for SAD) from Wally World were capable of inducing an almost hypomanic state, so replacing your bulbs could possibly help alleviate some of your symptoms.

As far as general depression is concerned, I'd definitely recommend lifting weights. If you haven't taken even a single step down the path that begins your fitness journey, start by purposefully walking an additional 15 minutes a day, even if that means pacing back and forth in your living room (that's what I do, but roughly 5 minutes at a time every 90 minutes to 2 hours). After a week or two you can start doing bodyweight squats and pushups every other day (don't expect to do more than 5 pushups, starting with just three sets of 2 reps is enough, and with all exercises try to add just one single additional rep every time you do work out).

I can't be bothered to cite my sources, but whatever. I know I've read studies that claim to show that antidepressants might not work by increasing serotonin levels, because if that's how they worked then you'd expect them to work pretty close to immediately since they raise serotonin levels pretty much immediately. They increase neurogenesis, which most people (in the general population, at least) didn't think was a thing until like 10 years ago. Your brain should constantly be changing and growing new neurons and making new connections/associations. Exercise is good at stimulating neurogenesis. Hell, lots of things are. Varying your daily routine, learning new things, talking to different people and having new and different experiences, all that stuff contributes to neurogenesis.

But life /does/ suck for a great many people, and it can be difficult not to feel like you're just living though the exact same day over and over on repeat. I've been unemployed since like forever. I still live with my mother, which I've started to feel less bad about after having recently read some articles and finding out that 1 out of 3 people aged 18 to 34 still live at home with their parents, a number which hasn't been so high since the late 1930s about 10 years after the Great Depression started, and we coincidentally happen to be about 10 years out from the beginning of the Great Recession, the curves in the graph are pretty similar.

But on top of still living with my mother, we're living at my grandmother's house "between houses" and we were supposed to move to New York like 6 months ago and now it's looking like we'll be lucky to move out of grandma's house before /fall/ and /it hasn't even been spring yet/ and I'm going to have turned 29 /and/ 30 while living here, and I haven't hung out or communicated with any (presumably former) friends in close to 2 years, and I had bright-red bloody diarrhea (10 or more times a day, every day, for 3 straight months) at the end of 2017 /and then again at the end of 2018/, but y'know what, I'm in a good place mentally. I'm playing around with FL Studio again, I'm writing again, I'm reading again, I'm lifting weights again.

I don't know what good any of that information does for you or anyone else, but I've already typed it, so let me try to retrofit a point into there somewhere.

Eh, there's probably one in there somewhere already.

[EDIT: It looks like the "learning and experiencing new things can increase neurogenesis" and the "life is hard for a lot of people and that makes it hard to afford things which might help increase neurogenesis" bits were meant to continue on through to an additional paragraph, the point of which was probably something like /"even though life sucks, if you can force yourself to take/ any /sort of action in spite of the suck, it'll start to feel like it sucks less; I've been in this living situation for almost a year now and have made the excuse not to lift weights because my old bedroom was 20ft by 20ft and my new one is 10ft by 9ft and I have a friggin queen-size mattress in here and a litter box and a cat tree and a cat feeding station and a computer/chair station and I only have a 3-foot-wide by 7-foot-long little square of space at the end of my bed, but once I exorcised whatever demon was living in my intestines for three months, I forced myself to work around the situation; maybe exercising isn't your thing, maybe you need to teach yourself how to play a new game or teach yourself how to cut down a tree or teach yourself how to tile your kitchen floor or how to juggle or how to play an instrument or how to XYZ, the point is that forcing yourself into novel experiences can/ *HELP* /even if it isn't a cure; something is always better than nothing, it doesn't matter if you perfectly clean your room to an immaculate state, thinking that way means you never do it EVER because you can't be arsed to do it 100 percent, at least if you're doing it 80 percent every few days it'll be done more than it would be if you did it 0 percent most of the time and 100 percent only on occasion."/ Or something like that.]

Elevated levels of cortisol might inhibit neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Most adult neurogenesis takes place within the hippocampus. Ashwagandha reduces cortisol levels by like 30% after 12 weeks, and that isn't "alternative health" nonsense, you can look up studies yourself.

Cortisol also affects fat storage around the midsection, so there's that too as a bonus (though never expect any pill to magically peel away stomach fat to reveal abs, there's no such thing as "spot reduction," like, you can't work out specific areas of the body to lose fat in those specific areas, your body deposits fat in certain areas in a certain order; the stomach is pretty much the first place where fat is stored (for men anyway, it's a different order of fat storage for men vs women), so it's pretty much the last place where it's lost).

The lamp turns on at 7:30 a.m., more or less, and my mechanical alarm clock goes off at 8, more or less. It's all very analog.

**** I've found that ensuring that the first thing I do in the morning (before showering et al, literally within five minutes of the alarm if possible) is /eating something substantial/, has calibrated my brain so that it naturally /wants/ to wake up right when my alarm goes off. (This is, AFAIK, to do with orexin release in the brain being the counter to adenosine release---animals naturally recalibrate to wake up at the time of best historical meal availability.)

Sadly, this means that you can't spend any time cooking in the morning before eating. Depending on your meal preferences, that either translates to preparing breakfast the night before (e.g. non-instant porridge), eating something you don't cook (e.g. granola and yoghurt), or eating an “instant” meal (e.g. a grocery store frozen “breakfast wrap” which you just microwave.) I alternate all three methods. If I crave more complex breakfast meals, I'll prepare those as brunch on weekends, after first having toast or a granola bar (something small that will kickstart your appetite) the moment I get up.

I also, more recently, acquired a light therapy lamp, which I sit in front of while eating said breakfast. This was a good multiplier for the wakefulness-calibrating effect of eating first thing upon waking up, I think, but when I tried it on its own, it didn't help nearly as much as eating first thing on its own (i.e. I quickly went back to feeling unable to get out of bed.)

So, from ~June to ~November, I'm going to be living in Paris - around the 19e, if anyone in the area wants to be my new best friend. I'm working on my visa application this coming week - I've booked in a 6 month course in a language school.

** I've been interested in reading both fictional and non-fictional works that make use of Social Combat, preferably one that handles the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero][Guile Hero]] vs [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard][Manipulative Bastard]] tropes. I'm tired of direct battles and magical/sword fights. Are there any good works you can recommend?

I've read that [[http://luminous.elcenia.com/][Luminosity]] is a good work of fiction with a manipulative heroine, is that true? Does it handle social combat well? Is it really like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Cards_(U.S._TV_series][House of Cards]]) but with vampires?

On non-fiction, I only know the classics such as:

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince][The Prince by Machiavelli]]
- How to make friends and influence people by Andrew Carnegie
- 48 Laws of Power by Green. This one has the caveat that it heavily contradicts itself in some parts so I question it's usefulness.

Are there any other good non-fiction social combat books you could recommend?

Also I've been wondering just how far social combat and guile can take you. Implying you're successful in manipulating someone into giving you a high position at work for example, even if you're very charismatic, if you fail in most of your assignments in a row, it will soon catch up with you.

So, I wonder if characters who invest heavily into social skills at the expense of the rest would really be using an optimal strategy.

--------------

This week I've been reading the book [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7845157-bounce][Bounce]], and really enjoying how it demystifies the concept of natural genius. It explores geniuses such as Mozart, Newton or more contemporary ones like chess grandmasters and the training they have undergone to achieve "genius" status. It's inspiring to think a person could reach such a level provided enough effort and sacrifice was made. Still, I wonder what are the limits of such a "Theory of Effort" and if it applies to outliers such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Ung-yong][Kim Ung Yong]].

It also makes one question just how much they sacrificed to reach such a level of mastery and if their stories are correct. Maybe their training regimes could be reverse-engineered to reach the same achievements as them if enough effort and resources were invested.

I've been toying with the idea of a Boku No Hero fanfic about a villain that makes use of guile and careful planning to compete with Deku's brute force approach, with the plot twist that his Quirk is super-strength. The idea would be that he had developed his tactical mindset and guile by reverse engineering smart villain's strategies and using rigorous training to imitate their skills without being naturally gifted himself.

--------------

Any fans of [[https://mrgone.rocksolidshells.com/nwod.html][World of Darkness? I've found that the character sheets]] are great to depict almost any character. They show each of the attributes and skills that characters can practice in a measurable manner, with the flexibility of adding more traits if you so wish.

I've found them useful to describe a character for a story, simply adding or subtracting attributes and magic systems, along with allowing to more easily keep track of equipment and progression the character makes through the story.

--------------

Finally a question to the community. When you write original stories, do you start with the worldbuilding and get the story concept from there? Or do you prefer to create the character and think of the scenario they interact with, and build the world around them afterwards?

Do you think there's an advantage to one approach over the other?

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26073079-the-cultural-revolution][The Cultural Revolution: A People's History, 1962-1976]] by Frank Dikötter. How Mao used the Cultural Revolution to manoeuvre his opponents into lose-lose positions.

If you're into podcasts, we did two episodes on this for Rationally Writing, [[http://daystareld.com/podcast/rationally-writing-21/][Top Down Storytelling]] and [[http://daystareld.com/podcast/rationally-writing-22/][Bottom Up Storytelling]]. But if you don't have an hour and a half to listen to those:

I usually start from the worldbuilding and then move outward from there, finding themes as I go. This tends to make for a much more naturalistic piece, less tightly plotted, but more believable simply because the world doesn't exist to serve the plot. That said, there's something of an iterative process where I move back and forward between approaches, first making the world, seeing what kinds of plots come from that, and then going back to tweak the world if I think there's not enough room for interesting plots, or if there are more interesting quirks that might come from slight rules changes. Because a world has many parts, this can be a long process of going back and forth, seeing the effects of changes, making tweaks, seeing different effects, looking at possible plots, and going through more iteration.

The advantage of the /other/ approach, doing the story concept first, is that your story can have tighter plotting, less extraneous bits, and hit your themes harder.

(I don't think that one is strictly superior to the other, but I will say that it'll be easier to adhere to [[/r/rational]] standards if you're finding the stories in the world, rather than building the world to suit a story, generally speaking.)

I don't use a full RPG character sheet, but I have a template with sections for different things like primary trait, motivation, gear, etc. Characterization is really hard for me, so having a step-by-step checklist for the soft stuff helps a lot and the other sections just make sure I have a central reference so I don't mess up continuity.

  When you write original stories, do you start with the worldbuilding and get the story concept from there? Or do you prefer to create the character and think of the scenario they interact with, and build the world around them afterwards?

I started with an interesting idea: what would The Magicians crossed with Ender's Game look like? From there I just kind of kept picking the "inspect" option on each new idea. For example, Battle School had a single objective (kill the buggers). I decided that my Academy's leaders wanted to take over the world, not because evil, but because they didn't want everyone else to ruin it. That in turn begged the question of why they hadn't already, so I chose to have magic be strong, but not so strong that a group of sorcerers could take on an entire army. That led me to having the Academy be secretive and more interested in political manipulation than direct power. And so on. I didn't get down to characters till the end (ish, since it's still being worked on).

**** Seconded. Although it's very dark in several places which ruined those parts for me. Definitely not for the squeamish. The philosophical theme is super fascinating and the reason I read it in the first place. Bakker's writing is top notch. One of the very few portrayals of a "dark rationalist" main character, whose quotes keep ringing in my head from the sheer poetry of it.

  preferably one that handles the Guile Hero vs Manipulative Bastard tropes
#+end_quote

"Going Postal" by Terry Pratchett neatly fits into this category (on the fictional side).

The hero - well, the /protagonist/ - is Moist von Lipwig, a con man, a trickster, a double-crosser who swindles and cheats and steals his way through life, until he gets caught and Lord Vetinari offers him a choice between more-or-less honest employment (running the Post Office, which hasn't worked properly in decades) or a sharply truncated life. And then takes steps to make /very/ sure that Moist can't get out of the deal.

The /villain/ of the story is someone who starts out having succeeded where Moist failed, having conned, lied and cheated his way into being both rich and respected, secure that his position is nearly entirely untouchable...

  Maybe their training regimes could be reverse-engineered to reach the same achievements as them if enough effort and resources were invested.
#+end_quote

That'd be cute, do you think people are that stupid that in what? Centuries worth of competition they haven't had the idea to emulate the top people in their fields ?

​

Anyway on your other point, no there are hard limits to how far you can get with just training. Yes you can get very good with training and effort, but the people at the top are all doing it too, the outcome of this is that people with natural advantages are more likely to win and be at the top at competitions. i.e higher long capacity, height in certain sports, arm length, leg length etc.

​

It's not necessarily PC or how we'd like things to be, but it is how it is. Olympian medalists for instance tend to have a more similar body structure and characteristics to their competitors than to their own siblings and parents, that's how competitive these things are..

That's what I wondered. According to the book, most world class athletes, artists and academics spent an average of 5 years practicing 8 hours daily to reach their genius status. That assuming a good amount of resources and focus is spent and methods are given to motivate them to keep going.

According to the book, most young geniuses simply started at a very young age when their brains had the most plasticity and thus on average only started showing their true talent at 5-10 years old.

I bet there's a genetic component too, it would also be interesting to see how it develops across generations.

I sort of build these out in tandem. For my current work-in-progress, I started with a couple of kernels that I built my world around. I came up with an idea for the antagonist, then got stuck for a while trying to make a protagonist or any kind of plot, or even meaningfully tie together the two different seeds that my worldbuilding was founded from. Eventually, after agonizing brainstorming, I got all of that to click into place, a story idea and character I was excited about, and that formed the basis for an outline. Since then, I've had to simultaneously flesh out the world and the characters as necessary, sometimes tweaking background details in the world to allow for the story I really want. Sometimes, though, characters that started as background or plot really ran away from me and took on their own life, which feels magical. (Usually this happens when I actually start writing them on the page, since before that point, it's too easy to think of them as blank faces pinned to a particular plot function without fleshing them out.)

I don't have a lot of experience, but the reason for the number of stories which take place on Earth (as opposed to someone designing a world) became more apparent after I came up with a story and that was what happened. People interact with this world, and it's familiar, so working with that just takes generating a story and characters, as opposed to also coming up with a world. (It can literally spring from looking at something and going "What If...".) If I end up making it into something I probably will make a different world for it - it requires some things to change, so the background (stuff that happens before the story starts, and out of view of the characters) as well as how people operate needs some work. (A different society, or less atomic culture or something might be required for the number of groups to exist to make the story feasible.)

So you can come up with a story by initially thinking about it taking place on Earth, and then if things diverge too much, I think you can flesh a world around it, and rework it. What easiest or best probably depends on you - there's a story about writing that goes like this: An author wrote a book, and wrote all the fun parts first, but then didn't want to write the rest. They looked through what they'd written, cut the boring parts out, and sent it to the publisher.
