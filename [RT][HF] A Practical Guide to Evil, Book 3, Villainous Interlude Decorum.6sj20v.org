** I liked this chapter; Black's cold and unemotional analysis is always interesting; but I came away with a feeling like he is overlooking something. But I can't quite figure out what.

Possibilities that spring to mind, in no particular order:

- Alaya isn't who she was years ago, and that makes me think he can't predict her behavior as well as he thinks he can. Black's assumptions on her reaction to Cat's actions may be flawed.

- The Calamities (plus Scribe, the OG Calami-Groupie) don't factor into his analysis at all for how they'll act when Cat takes Black's Name. Of them all, only Captain has any affection toward Cat. If the others don't know of Black's impending death or his plans, they may turn on her as the one responsible.

- Speaking of Captain, holy death flags, Batman! I wonder if Black knows that he's setting her up for a potential trap. Actually, I wonder if he /planned/ it.

- Why does Black give himself 1-2 years? Like, I get why he figures he has to die sooner than expected. But why, specifically, that time frame? Is it the expected time frame until Procer invades, and thus White needs to die before that happens so the war in the Free Cities can be over first?

- I think that Daoine might draw closer to Cat/Callow as a result of the far invasion and Diabolist. Black's plan for slaughtering 40% of the population (also, isn't the casual calculation of /that/ horrifying?) may actually be made irrelevant. Plus, wouldn't culling them open up problems with the Bloom?

- The 6 month deadline for Diabolist being defeated is sure to happen, but I'm curious what Black considers "minimal casualties"? Summer has already burned two entire cities, and I can't see a healthy future for Liesse or its abundance of refugees. I could kinda understand if Black just meant /military/ casualties, but considering his emphasis on the importance of Callowan farming earlier in the story, I think he may be miscalculating how screwed Callow is between the fae and Diabolist.

- Thinking Tyrant will act like Black expects him to is just begging for trouble.

- I wonder if Black is missing something about the nature of the White Knight or the relationship between them. White can tap into past White Knights' lives; what if that disrupts the pattern of 3? Black is /positive/ he's going to die within 2 years; and while I agree it's likely, his certainty also makes that assumption the most likely thing he's got wrong.

- Also, I think most readers would be surprised if Cat takes the mantle of Black Knight. That's the other assumption Black seems certain about. While it's a stretch, I wonder if Cat takes up the mantle of White Knight? And that's why no pattern is established with Black; because his pattern will be against Cat. Though I still see her more likely as a Grey Knight. Or... Queen of Blades (though this is obviously a long shot).

*** I think Black's really good at seeing the patterns in the stories and following their conclusions. But, I think the Squire is sort of forging her own story, and Black may be assuming just a tiny bit too much of how that story goes. I just don't see Cat becoming the Black Knight, she'll transcend or subvert the story instead. I think she has to, to complete her arc. As part of this she /has/ to exceed Black's expectations in a way she has as yet been unable to do. By it's very nature, Black is unable to anticipate Squire transcending his story.

*** I, too, liked this chapter. Very much. We've never seen this much detailed exposition of Black's motives and process. Amazing list of how things may not be as Black sees them. I suspect your point about Alaya is correct but I'm also drawn to your point about the other calamities and your last point about Black's relationship with White.

I think the author has stated that Queen of Blades isn't a Role.

*** So the catalyst of this is that Black has not entered a pattern of 3.

We as readers know that the bard remarked that the knight was attempt two, giving judgement a shot after contrition failed. William wasn't as much an attempt to take down Catherine, as he was about liberating callow.

So i think the reason he can't get his pattern of 3 is cause the knight is about to enter the story of Callow, the current city being merely a prologue. If the story subverts his expectations, its going to be by killing him sooner, not later.
