Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** Well, I almost made it. About a month until my projected vaccination time and I catch COVID. No respiratory issues (yet) but frequent chills, 24/7 headache, and fatigue. I'm in a very low risk demographic, but am disappointed in myself and fearful of long term effects.

I was in some extreme circumstances, but still could've done better. Don't let other's lax attitudes and disregard for safety lull you into complacency about your own precautions. Hopefully they turn out to be nothing, but I didn't think much about long term risks before I caught it.

Now to do my best not to get anyone else sick.

Nonetheless, there remains no good evidence - the studies in that youtube are no better, with a self report survey and two more no control studies which tell us nothing more than post viral symptoms exist in some people. I don't want to tell people how they should respond to risk, but at some point it's worth thinking like a Bayesian and realizing that the serious absence of evidence must push you towards evidence of absence. Even the surveys, which are about the only things we have to indicate if long term effects are an issue, have only found 2% of people continue to report symptoms (extremely vague symptoms like fatigue) after 3 months.

For proposed treatments, the standard of evidence is much higher, in which case you would be right that we shouldn't rely on evidence from any study that wasn't rigorously designed with appropriate controls.

However, the standard of evidence for prognosis (i.e. a forecast of the likely course of a disease or ailment without intervention) is much lower. The question of Covid-19 sometimes causing lingering lung damage /is/ a prognosis. For prognosis, a case series is typically taken as acceptable evidence /if/ the results are consistent across multiple studies /and/ until better evidence is available. All four of the links I provided are case series of varying quality, and all agree on the presence of lingering lung damage in some percentage of patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19.

Obviously, this does not tell us a prevalence, as you mentioned, but it does tell us that lingering lung damage is an observed outcome for some hospitalized Covid-19 patients. It would be /prudent/ to take that possibility into account during recovery rather than make specious claims of 'no evidence'.

Here's one of the most widely reported stories about coronavirus, with the entire scientific establishment dedicated to uncovering everything they can about the disease, and millions upon millions of potential test subjects. Any scientist could instantly make a name for themselves by demonstrating the dangers of long covid. Yet for all that, the evidence remains a handful of surveys and a few follow ups with hospitalized cases.

I don't know which survey you are referring to here.

The first study I linked about Covid-19 survivors was not a survey - it had results from actual medical measurements of 57 patients, 40 of which were considered to have been non-severe cases and 17 severe. The measurements were taken 30 days after discharge from the hospital. In fact, if you read the methodology you would see that your assumptions about "lung damage being from something else" are in fact false since the medical histories of all 57 patients were assessed as part of the study. Of those 57 patients, 54.4% showed lingering lung damage in CT scans 30 days after discharge.

The second study of survivors that I linked was also not a survey. Its results were based on medical measurements of 86 patients 6 weeks and 12 weeks after discharge from the hospital. I fact, the [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7736754/][later published paper]] by the same author showed that of the 133 survivors included in her study 42% had impaired lung function as recorded by medical tests 60 days after covid-19 onset, and 36% still had impaired lung function as recorded by those same medical tests 100 days after Covid-19 onset.

Your comments at this point seem to demonstrate you are not actually reading or considering the evidence presented to you.

This remains meaningless without a control, not to mention a very small sample, and comparing different things - medical histories are not lung imaging. Even if you discard these weaknesses, what enables you to distinguish these effects from regular post-viral syndrome?

I did already point out that I could not read the second study of survivors you posted as it is behind a registration wall. But the link you provided seems to have much the same weakness, in fact they didn't even attempt to select for previously healthy, with 61% obese and 77% pre-existing conditions.

** So I've been reading [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/][The Last Angel]] that was mentioned here recently. And I have some comments on cultural references in SF. Overall, I enjoyed the story, but I have some nits to pick with regard to cultural references, that I think are worth discussing with other readers and writers of the genre.

The story revolves around The Compact (think The Covenant from the Halo series of video games) which has existed thousands of years before encountering humanity. We have a galaxy full of bipedal alien races (c.f. the Star Trek problem), but let's not worry about that for now.

There are several instances of cultural references in the text of The Last Angel that I found a little bit jarring, and which I'd like to see being avoided in future works by everyone.

*General Cultural References*

At one point, this squad of shock troopers (alien race called Tribunes) is having communication problems (actually due to subtle and active jamming by their adversary), and compares his state-of-the-art military comm gear to "a dime-store radio".

So in 2021, "dime store" (or the even older "five and dime store") is already a dated reference for USA citizens. And it makes no sense whatsoever for an alien species (that has existed for thousands of years before humanity had dime stores), to refer to them in a time thousands of years /after/ any dime stores have existed at all.

So in this case, I'd replace "dime-store radio" with "children's toy radio" because that is much more likely to exist across multiple cultures. I encourage you all to think about this sort of thing in your own writing.

*Units of Measure*

At another point in the story, another Tribune refers to an incident in his youth where he and his sister were running from danger as the ship they were on was being attacked. He says (thinks) about how he was "a few meters" ahead of his sister when they were separated by a closing pressure door, and she was sucked into space.

I've read more than a few SF novels where the aliens had their own units of measure, and that was always a bit clunky. And of course there is the conceit that these aliens don't actually think / talk in English, and that we're reading some kind of translation of the original anyway.

But even beyond that, I'd like to see SF authors avoid references to our culture's units of measurement when possible. If the phrase had been "a few strides ahead" instead, that is much more cross-cultural and less (to me) intrusive to the flow. And what is a meter, or a yard anyway? It is about one stride, so it would be common for many cultures (of bipedal aliens) across time and space to have a similar unit of measurement.

Again, this is not a call for SF authors to invent their own units of measurement for every alien species. That is more annoying that useful in my opinion. Maybe just write something like "the ship came out of warp about 10,000 [kilometers] off the bow" to indicate the units have been translated. I don't know if people would find that more annoying or not.

The unit "years" is actually OK in my view. For any culture that evolves on a planet orbiting in the green zone of a G-type star, the orbital period is likely to be approximately a Earth-standard year. And in fact, The Last Angel does mention a Compact-Standard Year occasionally. It isn't going to be exactly an Earth year, but that's OK for storytelling purposes.

*** Even more so than Earth units, I've put a lot of thought into the usage of words that are etymologically derived from places. Things like "phonetic" (from Phoenicia) or "geosynchronous" (which specifically refers to the Earth, as opposed to something like areosynchronous for Mars), where people realistically shouldn't be using it. Neither is a fantastic example, since phonetic is pretty acceptable and geosynchronous being used for other planets isn't a mistake most scifi authors make, but it elucidates the point adequately.

I wondered for a while if this was /actually/ a problem, or just something I worry about for no reason, but then I read Brent Weeks' Lightbringer series and realized it actually is - that series uses so many Earth concepts that it's incredibly distracting.

'phonetic' comes from Greek 'phōnē' meaning 'voice'. The word 'Phoenicia' is completely unrelated.

The geo- in 'geosynchronous' comes from Greek 'gē' which means both 'Earth' (as in the planet) and 'land' or 'soil'. Using one word for both Earth and land is quite common (see Latin 'terra') so using the word 'geosynchronous' when on Mars or some other planet isn't necessarily wrong etymologically. That said, it is possible that when words using geo- (e.g. 'geography') were first coined they might have referred to the planet exclusively rather than land or soil though I can't really find a definitive answer.

There might be cases in which geosynchronous is acceptable for other planets - if you're writing science fiction about humans that aren't from Earth (e.g. The Hand of Darkness) and you're working under the premise that you're translating it to be understood - but if someone uses it to refer to Mars, rather than areosynchronous, they're wrong. Even in the counterexample I gave, "synchronous orbit" would work better.

** I've heard a bit about Tony Robbins, a self-help author, and he seems a lot more reasonable than I was expecting from the stereotype. Does anyone else know about him? I'm curious what others think.

*** Pirate some of his programs and see what you think of them. If they are helpful or not etc.

I don't get the self help stigma, I'm not too proud to take advice and / or be angry at people that give it, but many people are.

​

I guess lets compete and find out in the long run who has the better outcomes.
