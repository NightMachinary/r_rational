Steven Universe fanfic by yours truly. Steven starts asking questions and using available magical devices to full effect.

Hard-ish Science-Fantasy, Soft-munchkin, and very character-driven.

Now with /12 additional chapters/, and almost 40K words, because I am a very fast writer with nothing to do.

** This is great. I honestly have no idea what chapter I'm on because the site went down. Really hope it comes back up so I can read the rest!!

*** The problem is that the Clones are impermanent, and qualitatively different.

And your bitter tears of hanging on my cliffs only makes me stronger. :P

**** Nah, the trick is that you can have a room that contains more than 100% me. So it wouldn't even matter which clone dies, as long as one survives, if we ran on Waves Arisen rules instead - ie. it can defer the decision of which me becomes "final me". Not a practical difference in this scenario, but the lack of clear differentiation might have prevented the weird divergence of this arc.

***** The problem is that the clones /are/ smoke and mirrors. They dissipate after an hour or two. They can be un-made by the wand. If the wand breaks they disappear. There's a number of other disadvantages too.

Connie herself is still vital. The clones are expendable.

True duplication is so broken it's not even funny. I have to limit my characters in some way, right?

****** No yeah, definitely. But it's like... your mantra "hard-codes" the smoke-and-mirrors-ness.

(Old programmer joke: "No ethical programmer should ever write a routine such as =bombBaghdad()=. At the least, the city should be specified as a parameter...")

The correct behavior should arise naturally from the fact that some of my selves happen to be ephemeral.
