** Adapted from [[https://qntm.org/unbelievable][Unbelievable Scenes]], by Sam Hughes.

Drawn about four years ago. Thought I lost it in a computer reinstall, but was glad I found them in an external hard drive. I'm proud of the first few pages, but the rest lose much of that quality. And also cut exactly zero words. Not the best adaptation.

Learned about all-caps comic-writing, though.

*** It's the first chapter of [[https://qntm.org/unbelievable][Fine Structure]], graphically illustrated by that guy who posted it. A completed semi-rational (internally consistent with intelligent characters, but not specifically written to be in this genre) serial. It has its flaws, but I really liked it. Would recommend you check it out.
