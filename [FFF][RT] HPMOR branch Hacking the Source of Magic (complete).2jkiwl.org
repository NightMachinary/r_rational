**** He tried to constrain the safety of his command, instead of just asking the system what the command /would actually do/. He did something without knowing what would happen!

To clarify, my spoiler is what he /should/ have asked.

Things that also would have worked: "Are you aware of reasons why I wouldn't want to do this? List them to me, in order of descending importance."

[edit] "Do this for every command that hits this protection."

****** The machine was pretty intelligent, it could probably work out what importance was. If you wanted to be explicit you'd ask "List any problems that would be a problem to me in a concise manner according to my interpretation of Maslow's hierarchy of needs."

  *Fuck for Forest* (*FFF*) is a non-profit [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_organisation][environmental organisation]] founded in 2004 in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway][Norway]] by Leona Johansson and Tommy Hol Ellingsen. It funds itself through a website of sexually explicit videos and photographs, charging a membership fee for access. A portion of funds are donated to the cause of rescuing the world's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainforest][rainforests]]. It is the world's first eco-porn organization and may be the only porn website specifically created to raise money for a cause. The group moved from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo,_Norway][Oslo, Norway]] to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin,_Germany][Berlin, Germany]] following the trial of its founders for having sex in public.

** This fanfanfic was recently brought to my attention. A fun quick read. Dunno how far it goes to be rational/ist/, and it's a bit of a clunky HPMOR derivative, but it certainly plays with rational themes. And very successfully, too. All credit goes to [[/u/qbsmd]].

*** When Atlantis was unfallen, presumably the physical token was better secured.

Also, steelmanning Atlanteans, I'd predict that by default most of the functions could only be performed at a subset of the cores unless those cores were offline, and that those cores had increased protections against pastviewing. When only one of sixteen devices survives, you're not going to get optimal functioning.
