Does anyone know any good rational stories in audio format?

** [[https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Martian-Part-1-Audiobook/B00B5HZGUG][The Martian]] is great.

[[http://audioworm.rein-online.org/][Worm podcast]] is very well done.

[[https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Final-Empire-Part-1-Mistborn-Book-1-Audiobook/B002V0QCYU][Mistborn Series]] by Brandon Sanderson is awesome.

[[https://www.audible.com/pd/Storm-Front-The-Dresden-Files-Book-1-Audiobook/B002V8KYMI][Dresden Files]] - I didn't like it as much, but people here recommend it often. Personally, I prefer the [[https://www.audible.com/pd/Night-Watch-Part-1-Watch-Book-1-Audiobook/B004HCDZAO][Night Watch]] series - really amazing urban fantasy where mages weave complex plots against each other, I think you guys will love it.

[[https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Knowledge-How-to-Rebuild-Our-World-from-Scratch-Audiobook/B00J55GD0W][The Knowledge]] - non-fiction book about rebuilding civilization from scratch.

[[https://www.audible.com/pd/Atlas-Shrugged-Part-1-Audiobook/B002VA3KG8][Atlas Shrugged]] is absolutely amazing, and the audio version I'm linking to is extremely well produced.

Also, technically not fiction, but biographies of [[https://www.audible.com/pd/Elon-Musk-Part-1-Tesla-SpaceX-and-the-Quest-for-a-Fantastic-Future-Audiobook/B00UX8ODPM][Elon Musk]] and [[http://www.audible.com/pd/Nonfiction/Ghost-in-the-Wires-Audiobook/B005H3FYR4/ref=a_search_c4_1_3_srTtl?qid=1487463773&sr=1-3][Kevin Mitnick]] read very much like rational fiction, I highly recommend them!

Also there's [[https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Phoenix-Project-A-Novel-About-IT-DevOps-and-Helping-Your-Business-Win-Audiobook/B00VAZZY32][Phoenix Project]] - people recommend it often but I haven't listened to it yet.

*** How is atlas shrugged rational? Objectivism comes off as ant-rational at times.
