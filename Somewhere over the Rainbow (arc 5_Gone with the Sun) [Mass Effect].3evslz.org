** "Somewhere over the Rainbow" is the fifth story arc in the "Gone with the Sun" series, posted today.

Earlier arcs were notified in prior threads; posted stories appear below. The first was "Eternity", recapitulating the events of the Red Flash. The opening chapter of the story proper is:

arc 2, "Queen's Gambit", followed in order by:

arc 3 "Grave to cradle",

arc 4 "Road to Nowhere", and now

arc 5 "Somewhere over the Rainbow".

To recapitulate the earlier post's description:

The next ME apparently involves an N7 operating in Andromeda.

Mass Effect 3 came out some time back, following which I wrote a 'rationalist' novel exploring the aftermath - posted for the canonical year and a day. It explored consequences of ME3's 'red flash' from the point of view of certain characters.

As it happens, the closing lines of the last arc had survivors heading for Andromeda. Imagine my shock when the recent E3 2015 trailer, "Mass Effect: Andromeda" was issued, showing an N7 in Andromeda, obviously not Shepard but still. Hence the excerpting of the final scene as a prologue.

This latest post is Arc 5 of that story, dealing with exploration, restoring survivors, and coping with trauma. Each arc ends with a pointer to the next arc.
