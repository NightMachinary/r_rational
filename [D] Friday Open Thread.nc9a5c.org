Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** After Worth the Candle finishes, what do you guys think will replace it as the [[/r/rational]] ongoing staple? Wales' next project? Origin of Species? The Flower that Bloomed Nowhere?

I was just noticing I've been watching the number of new stories explicitly made by this subreddit decrease, so hopefully we'll find something.

** Back in the age of sail, the great powers invested heavily into shipyards, and consistent investment over decades and centuries plus a symbiotic relationship with merchant shipyards allowed the great naval powers to have influence disproportionate to their population on world events.

SpaceX is building about one Starship prototype for month (this is hearsay until I find a source) and [[https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/1000-starships#:%7E:text=Previous%20%2F%20Next-,Elon%20Musk%20says%20'Building%20%7E1%2C000%20Starships%20to%20create%20a%20self,on%20Mars'%20is%20SpaceX's%20Mission][plans to build 100 per year]]. Assuming this isn't just Elon bigging himself up as usual, that's going to give the United States a truly insane lead in spacecraft building infrastructure, as it's developing and building (space)shipyards on a scale that no other nation will even try to match for potentially decades.

I don't really have any conclusions to make here, I just think this is really interesting.

*** Naval powers in the age of sail had an incredible value proposition - subjugate far away lands, extract goods and labor from them, and monopolize trade on any goods unique to that region. Space doesn't have any laborers to exploit, so I don't think it can have anywhere near the kind of impact that early modern imperialism had.

I think it's more similar to when Germany was synonymous with automotive manufacturing, or Japan with semiconductors, or the current Chinese/Taiwanese dominance in chip manufacture. A country invested heavily in technical expertise and infrastructure, to the point where they have an outsized influence on that field, and could extract a profit from being the place everyone has to go to get that product. That's still a big advantage, but some of those examples have already fallen by the wayside. Also launching satellites is not as crucial an industry as chip manufacture.

I don't support anyone on Paetron. I do tend to buy the ebooks of ongoing webfiction at least. I have in the past sent one-time payments to my very favorite authors, but haven't done that in a while.

*** I read an enormous number of web serials, and I would like those authors to continue producing content. So I vote with my wallet; I'll happily toss five or ten bucks a month at authors who provide me with more than a burrito's worth of joy per update.

Sure, this means that I'm opening my wallet to the tune of a couple hundred bucks a month to Patreon, but I love reading, I love the amount and variety of stuff to read I get sent straight to my email inbox every day, and as a software developer it's not like I can't easily afford it out of what amounts to petty cash.

There's obviously no moral obligation to support an author on Patreon, but you might ask yourself "do I want this author to continue producing this work", and if the answer is 'yes', consider that there's only one real way to make that statement and it's with your dollars.

*** You don't owe anyone anything. Unless you are pirating content that is only supposed to be available for purchase, then you are fine. I'd guess the fact that you have paid anything at all puts in a very high quantile among online fiction consumers (maybe not among this sub, but more generally).

I'm sort of in a similar boat to you where I have in the past supported an author on patreon, and have also bought ebook versions of things when they got published, but generally I am very hesitant to pay money for something that isn't completed. The rate of abandonment in online serials is just way too high. I'm also really not a fan of the patreon model for fiction because unless the monthly payment is /very/ low or the rate of production is /very/ high, the value proposition just isn't there (for me, obviously other people have different value calculations and that's fine).

So, I'd personally rather buy a book once when it's completed if I really enjoyed it. Now this makes it difficult since lots of people will never officially publish their work, even if they do wind up finishing.

In summary, as long as you aren't pirating, I wouldn't worry about it. Pay for the things you feel like paying for and don't pay for the things you don't feel like paying for.

**** I don't pirate anything. There is no need to do so. There is already so much to read, so much to play, so much to watch.

Heck, last year I signed up for Curiosity Stream for a pittance, and it included some of the higher quality Youtubers (Nebula streaming service), all of it ad-free.

I have a bunch of video games I haven't played yet. I've been fairly good about checking in with the Epic Games store and grabbing the free one every week. Though I've only played a couple of those (What Remains of Edith Finch was really good).

And I still have to master Rust programming, and there are plenty of projects there to work on for fun.

Time, is what I need more of these days. Time...

** In psychic crystal woo, is there some sort of obvious tier list of which crystal is more powerful than the other? I've written myself into a corner where a technically-minded character needs to MacGyver some psychokinetic explosives, and I need three tiers of those. Rigging psychic crystals to explode is my best idea for it, but I don't know if quartz is better than amethyst or whatever.

**** There's a pretty clear consensus that clear quartz is the best for healing, but after that it's very mixed. Some sources go for mostly for quartz-derivatives like rose quartz and citrine, others go for a bunch of semiprecious stones with short names like jade and onyx. Nobody seems to think a crystal can be destructive, even though logically^{1} any near-miss on a healing effect is deadly.

I will give an arbitrary shoutout to [[https://soonyata.home.xs4all.nl/crystals.htm][this site]] for pursuing the field of crystal woo with some of the same mood that [[http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/index.php][Atomic Rockets]] pursues hard SF rocket designs.

edit: All this said, I'm mostly looking at random listicles, which is not an accurate source even for topics where it is possible to be accurate. It's possible there's a more consistent canon that a crystal aficionado would know about, but I don't know how to access it.

***** I read an entire page of that site before realizing it wasn't satire or conspiracy-observing. This hurt my brain.

I'm pretty sure that site has all of the "research" you need. You're going to be "wrong" to anyone with different crystal theories no matter what, and I'm sure there are thousands. The best option is probably to pick some "powerful and dangerous" crystals and explain them well in story. Stronger crystals and those easier to psychically detonate due to their frequency/power type stand out, maybe even combine crystals to create "unstable" frequencies/opposing properties?
