Other details:

- Main character was some sort of programmer for the information network

- AR is introduced by showing threat raings over people as he walks past them. Specifically soldiers drinking, with protestsnt catholic tensions, so might have been set in northern Ireland.

- Information sent is different for every person and tailored to what is most likely to make them beleive. Protagonist realises this at the end

I've been googling for half an hour and not found it, it was I think by someone like Charles Stross,

It popped in to my head when hearing about the events in Turkey, and how much of a role control of the media plays in a successful coup


** I recommend posting this question to [[/r/whatsthatbook]] - it's a pretty good subreddit for this sort of thing.

** Probably different, but I recall an Asimov short story where a programmer manages to cause a revolution over a few weeks/months by tweaking the Computer.

** I believe the story you are describing is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moon_Is_a_Harsh_Mistress][The Moon is a Harsh Mistress]] by Robert A. Heinlein

Edit: Now that I re-read your description, I'm thinking I'm wrong here.

** Probably not what you're looking for, but the premise sounds similar to [[http://smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&id=2286#comic][this SMBC comic.]]
