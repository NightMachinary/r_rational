** There are two big problems with this (though I don't think those problems get in the way of the story too much).

- Let's say that Orin is a spy. What's to stop Orin's country from simply paying the money for a new stall? It would cost the Northern Kingdoms a thousand gold in order to cost Defensibleland far, far more than that. If we're at war, and I can spend a dollar to make you spend a hundred dollars, that's well worth my money.

- Orin might be a patsy who legitimately believes that an attack is coming, because he's been made to believe that by an outside party (a friend of a noble). If you're trying to bleed the kingdom dry, it makes more sense to use a patsy than a trained spy, because the patsy literally can't give you information that would let you distinguish truth from falsehood.

Or, in a more general sense, he could just lie about how much money he's got.

*** For the first case, if Orin is wrong, it's likely that in addition to forfeiting a substantial sum of money, he is going to be heavily investigated as to his loyalty, so if he is a spy, he's likely to lose his life as well as that money.

That doesn't deal with the patsy case at all, though.

** The king should have exchanged some information about the man of the Northern Kingdom that he knows for some information about the friend of the simple man, to confirm that they were both talking about the same person.
