So I have just recently posted a discussion post on finding a way to end the war between the Jedi and the Sith in Star wars. I have gotten mixed opinion on it, but that got me thinking does anyone know of any good fanfics where the heroes find a way to end the conflict for good or at least come up with a solution to maintain the balance between the light and the dark and are more proactive in stopping the bad guys from gaining power?

*** I think Lucas is on record as saying that the dark side isn't actually a part of the balance of the Star Wars universe, but the manifestation of imbalance. So if you were sticking to that interpretation, you wouldn't. I find it kind of interesting that so many go in for this 'light and dark together' idea of balance when the original intention is quite different.

And Qui-Gon (as written by Claudia Gray) had a take on it as well:\\
“...It would mean the darkness would be just as strong as the light. So it doesn't matter what we do, because in the end, hey, it's a tie! It doesn't matter which side we choose.”\\
“It matters,” Qui-Gon said quietly. “It matters which side we choose. Even if there will never be more light than darkness. Even if there can be no more joy in the galaxy than there is pain. For every action we undertake, for every word we speak, for every life we touch---it matters. I don't turn toward the light because it means someday I'll ‘win' some sort of cosmic game. I turn toward it because it is the light.”

***** Interesting side point --- Yudkowski posted his thoughts on the Pixar movie Inside Out which is about (spoilers: the value of negative feelings.)

He analyzed the rational components closely, but I see correlates here.

Perhaps a ratfic of light/dark balance is one which notes the need to have multiple Sith lords somehow, each representing different dark feelings, in order to maintain a better balance and then each dark faction is pitted against each other by the Light who in turn vies for influence over teenage protagonist.

Then just like Star Wars and Inside Out, the main lesson becomes --- as a teenager--- do you give in to rage, anger, depression, disgust, lust, etc. hormonal impulses or do you follow the peaceful and rational way of the Force?

Edit: hm, I realized that my “lesson” actually undoes the storyline. Do you as a teenage recognize the importance of of rage, depression, disgust, lust, etc., as NECESSARY portions of your journey to achieving enlightenment and following a more peaceful path and the rational way of the Force?

****** The Force seems to be an entity that, for those who manifest it, will end up amplifying their negative emotions (really, emotions at all: Anakin is undone also by love, after all) to unhealthy degree. So basically if you're born a Force sensitive you're shit out of luck and a therapist's nightmare; you either have to go full suppression, the Jedi's way, or become a psycho murderous Sith. I think this is also one of the main issues with the new sequels, by the way. Instead of exploring more in depth this interesting mechanic, which takes "rationality vs. emotion" to the extreme, it just went for the Force being an awesome inspiring motivational empowering something that Everyone Can Have And That's Okay. Utterly toothless and uninteresting, whereas the old approach to it at least gave a glimpse of a far more difficult reality to deal with.

The movies don't do this concept full justice --- they explore it initially in the first part of the trilogies --- but don't follow through with it.

So what I'd like to see in an Inside Out/Star Wars Rationalist fiction is a Jedi like HPMOR's Dumbledore who recognizes through prophecy that the Sith are necessary --- and splinters them into numerous parts to expand the journey of the Jedi to further the emotional/rational exploration.

*** There were some who lived in balance, and it was kind of like the final goal for Force users.

#+begin_quote
  The Ones initially lived in peace and harmony in the home they made for themselves near the site of the geyser. The Father warned his children to never drink from the Font of Power, or bathe in the Pool of Knowledge; however, they eventually disobeyed his orders, with the Son drinking from the Font, giving him the power of the dark side, while the Daughter bathed in the Pool, bestowing on her the power of the light side. The siblings then claimed areas of the jungle for themselves and started to fight each other, while the Father tried to keep the peace between them.[4]

  In canon, a young woman somehow came to their world. She initially became the Servant, serving and catering to the Ones' needs; however, she eventually became the Mother, doting on the Father and succeeding in mending the relationship between the Daughter and Son. She also managed to persuade the Son to use his destructive nature for a constructive purpose by using his Force lightning to carve new rooms in the walls of the gorge where they lived. However, she was still mortal and as a result she grew old, and was no longer able to keep the peace between the siblings. The ageless children started to resume their fighting, and neither the Mother nor the Father were able to prevent it.[4]

What is evil? What is good? Some might say evil is doing something horrible to the other side. Well, people do that to the other side in war all the time, and they are considered good by their own people.

Some might say evil is crossing an arbitrary line, such as sacrificing someone else's soul. Or eating people. But if your particular group needed to do either of those things to live, you would view it as good.

I think we need to actually define evil. Can it be merely hurting others for enjoyment? In that case, the true evil is being passive aggressive.

**** Star Wars canon doesn't have an answer to that question, mostly because the different authors can't make up their mind.

Much of the EU jumps straight into Manichaeism head first - that is, opposed forces of light and dark, always in conflict, requiring each other. That seems to the the understanding most people instinctively jump to. In a Manichaeism view 'bring balance to the force' means bring jedi and sith into equilibrium, since you need both.

It's out of Manichaeism that you get debates like is it good verses evil, light verses dark, calm verses emotion and so on.

But the actual movies (at least the original and prequel trilogy, spear headed by Lucas) don't really subscribe to this. For example, did you ever notice the term "light side" is never used? Not once.

This is because in the Lucasian view, the force /isn't/ clashing light and dark. The force is defined as balance and the jedi are guardians of that balance. The sith bring imbalance and corrupt the force towards selfish ends. That imbalance is the dark side.

Or, as Yoda put it:

#+begin_quote
  YODA: That place... is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go.

  LUKE: What's in there?

  YODA: Only what you take with you.
#+end_quote

The dark side isn't properly part of the force. It is a corruption of it, created by people who misuse it.

In this view 'bring balance to the force' means something very different. It means wipe out the sith. You don't bring balance to a system by introducing equal parts balance and imbalance. That's absurd.

*** Unhappy Anchovy wrote some good posts on this topic:

#+begin_quote
  There are three different and mutually exclusive views of the Force in Star Wars canon. (If you quibble the word 'canon' with me, or start bring up Legends or Disney or whatever, I will be angry. By 'Star Wars canon', I mean officially licensed and published Star Wars products.) I'm going to call these Jedi Orthodoxy, Manichaeism, and Deconstruction.

  Orthodoxy: The Force is unitary, and it is somehow connected with life. It binds the universe together, it flows strongly in some people or places, and it is inherently benevolent. Particularly wise or spiritual people can sense its currents and draw upon its power. However, there are also some evil people who can twist or pervert the Force, wielding it to their ends and against its own will. This creates the Dark Side. There is no such thing as 'the Light Side': there is only the Force, which is good. Orthodoxy is the viewpoint you get in all the films: this is why 'bring balance to the Force' means 'destroy the Dark Side', and it's why the phrase 'Light Side' is never mentioned in the films.

  Manichaeism: The Force is still connected with life and with holding the universe together, but the Force as a whole is in some sense amoral. The Force is divided into a Light Side and Dark Side, which constantly push and pull each other. People can tap into or serve either one of these sides, but never both. The Force is characterised by a constant struggle between good and evil, but neither Light or Dark can ever be eradicated. They are like yin and yang, rather, constantly moderating each other in this eternal dance. This viewpoint is very common in EU works. Manichaeism is operative in comic titles like Jedi vs. Sith, for instance, or in KotOR's alignment system. There is Light, there is Dark, they constantly fight each other, neither can ever win, pick one.

  Deconstruction: This is the rarest view, and is a conscious response to and criticism of the above two. Deconstruction often denies that there is any Force/Dark or Light/Dark distinction to make at all, and tends to question all conventional dogma. It might question whether the Force is needed for life, or if using - or following the will of - the Force is at all meritorious. It might liken the Force to a hostile parasite on life. Alternatively, it might still embrace the Force, but suggest that the Force is somehow beyond all of our categories or understandings. The main feature of Deconstruction is the suggestion that everything you thought you knew was wrong. It mostly appears in works like KotOR II or Traitor.

  When I have to interpret the Force in Star Wars, I find it can be useful to start by trying to work out which of these perspectives is in play. George Lucas is mostly Orthodox. (Though you still get weird things, like The Ones, which are clearly Manichaean.) The Manichaean view seems to be the most intuitive for a lot of people: it's surprising how many people reacted to the 'bring balance to the Force' prophecy with 'well duh it means killing all the Jedi'. Figuring out the underlying assumptions of a particular piece of Star Wars media is important so that we can understand what the Force is doing in it.
#+end_quote

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/why-is-han-solo-a-good-guy.360128/page-8#post-19341826]]

I tend towards the Orthodoxy position myself. There is no light side. There is only the force (which is defined as balance and who the Jedi serve) and the dark side (which is defined as creating an imbalance through selfish acts and deeds).

Or, as Yoda put it:

#+begin_quote
  YODA: That place... is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go.

  LUKE: What's in there?

  YODA: Only what you take with you.
#+end_quote

At the same time, I think there's room for this to be an in-universe debate. We can have a jedi orthodoxy, while at the same time Manichaeic heretics. I can see how Manichaeism could be a very effective tool to corrupt jedi.

Basically, the Jedi say the Force has a Light and a Dark side, and through suppressing your emotions you avoid the Dark Side.

The Potentium says the Force is the Force, it has no sides, and the Force is inherently good. The Dark Side exists /within the individual/, and is still to be avoided, but not at the cost of total self-annihilation.

Take, for instance, Anakin Skywalker. The Jedi would say the he fell to the Dark Side only partially by choice; once it had its hooks in him, the Dark Side corrupted him, made him a worse person. The Potentium would say Anakin Skywalker fell to the Dark Side because he was a bitter, spiteful prick with anger issues and no self-control.

The dark side is more about strong emotions. If you let yourself be swallowed by emotions amplified by The Force (especially anger / hate) then you can turn into evil. If you can draw from the light and the dark without giving yourself over to them, then you can be pretty strong and not evil. I'm probably not doing the story justice in explaining it...

#+begin_quote
  The Je'daii Order was an ancient organization unified by its belief and observance of the Force on the planet Tython, in the galaxy's Deep Core. Focusing on maintaining a balance in the Force, a state at which Tython was itself hospitable, the Je'daii saw the Force as three aspects of a whole; the Ashla (Light), the Bogan (Dark), and the Bendu (balance). They saw this duality in the Force represented in the night sky of Tython in the form of two natural satellites; one bathed in light, the Ashla, another shrouded in darkness, the Bogan. In keeping with their view of balance, Je'daii who fell too far to either the light or dark were exiled to the opposite moon to meditate until they returned to balance.

Expanded Universe fans will argue, but I would bet $100 that this is what was in Lucas's head when he wrote that line for Ep I.

Also, Eliezer wrote a short alternate fic of the Darth Plagueis conversation where Palpatine makes a convincing case that there is no such thing as the light side of the Force. The Force is a combination of telekinetic powers and an evil emotional alignment. “Light Side” Force users access the former while purging emotions to avoid the latter. But induce emotion and a temptation for more power and a dude who woke up a flawed but noble Jedi will slaughter a temple full of Kindergarteners before he goes to bed.

Obviously the Galactic Empire rules through fear and military suppression, but the simple fact is that the poverty-stricken worlds we see depicted didn't suddenly *become* poverty stricken when the Galactic Empire took over; they were presumably like that under the Republic, too. It's very clear that the Star Wars galaxy is rather brutally divided between the haves and have-nots, with smaller time evil like the Hutts being the only clear winners regardless of regime.

The Republic had its problems, but it was never as bad as the Empire. The Empire

- destroyed an inhabited planet to teach others not to step out of line, and had no qualms about doing it again,
- enslaved entire races to build its war machines,
- inundated its citizens with propaganda that non-human aliens were inferior, that species like the wookies and mon calamari were "non-sentient" and to be used as slave labour,
- carried out genocides against alien races,
- had its government and military controlled by xenophobes,
- brutally crushed any and all form of dissent.

That the Empire evil is is a central theme in Star Wars. It's not even a secret that Lucas based the Empire on Nazis. They're the bad guys.

The Republic was corrupted by a Sith. Before that it was actually a pretty good form of government. I'm not sure where you get the whole "they carried out coup d'etats and then disappeared" idea, but I'm fairly sure that never happened the way you described.

Again, the Jedi weren't without flaws. But one of their central tenets was that they didn't have the right to rule others simply because they were Jedi, that they were servants of the Force, something greater than themselves. The Sith were users of the Force, in service to themselves, and that always turned out badly (for others especially). It's arguably this difference in mentality that separates the light side and the dark.

They can think, calmly, rationally, and peacefully, that for the greater good, painful as it is, some might have to die. They don't have much problem fighting, killing and waging war. But it would take the right setting for them to do that. Though for example, it's not genocide, but we see them go along pretty easily with the whole clone army thing, which is monstrous by our standards (but then again, that's probably more of an oversight in the writing).

Traditionally the Jedi have avoided getting involved in wars. Only when there was a great enough threat, like something that could topple the Republic, did they do so. But even then, the Jedi were careful - they knew that the horrors of war could (and would) turn some of them to the Dark side.

Episode 6 they take down the Galactic Empire. Episode 7, Luke is a hermit and the New Republic is apparently completely unable to police its own systems to the point that the First Order is basically in charge; what were they even doing all those years?

Which brings me to the fact that I think it's the most recent trilogy that has made me super ambivalent about the so-called "goodness" of the Light side. We're shown that Storm Troopers in the First Order are unwilling, brainwashed conscripts, but then the Resistance goes in guns blazing and destroys an entire planet's worth of ships carrying those troops. Not as obviously morally repugnant as Alderaan's destruction, sure, but the practitioners of the Light side as depicted in the movies are virtually incapable of comprehending the complexity or moral ambiguity of their own actions. It's cool to kill a bunch of unwilling conscripts because they're on the "bad side", yet Darth Vader and Kylo Ren are both back in the Light because despite murdering and torturing their way across the galaxy, hey! Turned out they were capable of human feeling toward a single person each.

** If I recall correctly the Lore behind the Dark/Light balance is that they both were "supposed" to be eradicated when the Vador killed Palpatine (Bringing balance to the force). The force users who came after would have been neither Jedi nor Sith but an average of both that wouldn't drag the universe into needless wars to maintain the constant swinging seesaw that is the force balancing itself out.\\
This is the biggest reason to find balance. The star wars universe is defined by destiny/fate, (it actually defined by telekinesis and cool laser swords but ignore this) people who use the force and those who are around them are guided by it to fulfill a destiny pre-ordained by the force. the extent to which this limits their free will is debatable but that is another argument for getting rid of the dark/light dichotomy that drives force users to kill each other in a never-ending turf war over the fate of the galaxy.

** So.

​

As some have pointed out, Lucas never saw the balance as having a balance between light and dark. Rather, The light side being the balance and the dark being the chaos and disruption of it. My issue with it, of course, is the themes his movies explore, especially the prequels, as well as the simple question: balance what?\\
if you wish to create a balance, common sense and the definition of the word dictate that you equal two different things, or more. usually they are opposites. So if the light is just another word for balance, and the dark side is merely a chaotic, outside force to disrupt it, then what is being balanced?\\
later on, in the prequels, we saw more of the Jedi mantra and codes, and we saw that they act in ways of heavily suppressing the emotions of their members to give them control. This is then countered by the Sith, who revel in emotional turmoil and chaos.\\
This gave rise to the fan consensus, which was a heavy point of focus in the old legends, that the light side of the force is the calm side, and the dark side the emotional one.\\
In which case, the Jedi takes the light side to it's absolute extreme, banning confusing emotional maturity and level headedness with stoic apathy, suppressing their emotions and indoctrinating their younglings that as the dark side thrives in emotions, they must be wary of their emotions, and seal them away. Or as Yoda puts it: "Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering." Of course this quote can be used differently, but it does show how rather then teach how to confront your faults and your emotions, the Jedi instead makes them the enemy.\\
On the other hand, the Sith takes the dark side of the force, who's source is in emotions, to it's absolute extreme. They believe that one must act from the most inner places of emotions and revel in every single act. Most of the time, however, the only emotions that matter are fear and hatred. Because the Sith has a severe issue, and it's their lust for power. Due to acting out of their basic emotions and desires, each Sith is a lone wolf, one that try and grab as much power as they can and wish for, which resulted in far too many civil wars and purges amongst the Sith. Which led to a weird, and convoluted system in which masters inspire specifically fear in their apprentices to control them, using their wild emotions to restrict them, which should, in theory, stand in stark contrast to the code of the Sith, in which your emotions should liberate you. Palpatine and Anakin are a perfect example for that. Palpatine has been scheming and acting all calm and collected, being busy with politics and running an empire, that he very much so became like the Jedi, a Stoic, overly powerful Bureaucrat. And Anakin, on his side, once turning into his emotions was betrayed, destroyed, lost everything he had, and entered into a long period in which he was manipulated and emotionally devastated, being almost a machine. Tolkien once claimed that evil plant it's own seeds of destruction, and the Sith ideology of freedom of emotions while at the same time being a selfish ideology that supports the limiting of other's freedom of emotions ruined it from the beginning.

*** So now, after laying down these issues, I will present my case:

The ideal of a calm and rational Jedi is inherently wrong, as the Jedi were never calm and collected. They simply avoided any and all emotional tasks and tried to make themselves into cold machines while claiming to be the light hearted, good guys. Mace Windu is a good example of what happens when you don't teach someone how to properly vent anger and how to conduct himself, as well as Anakin Skywalker.

Spoiler Corner:

>!In the Darth Plagueis novel, an interesting case study is shown with Palpatine.\\
Palpatine was strong in the force since his birth, but had no real knowledge of it. However, it still affected his life, and his relationship with his family. Opting not to send him to the Jedi temple to receive proper training, they suppressed these powers in him, limited him, and eventually placed so much stress on the young man, without actually teaching him how to properly use his powers or to vent his anger, that he ended up murdering his entire family.\\
This is why the existence of an order like the Jedi order and their work are so important, by letting individuals simply discover these powers on their own and growing up without the proper guidance, they can grow up emotionally immature and become people like Palpatine, who view in part the non force sensitive as insects and non dark side force sensitives as fools, going on with his life thinking of himself as a god.

The teaching of Plagueis himself certainly did not help, as he taught Palpatine to revel in this emotional immaturity, to use his intellectual superiority and the force to lord over others and grant all his childish whims.\\
The Dark side certainly loves it's intellectual superiority, and all forms of superiority in general, having no qualms about pretending to feel certain emotions, lying to itself and others and being a cold, manipulative schemer while it's basic ideology stands in complete contrast. The Dark side is very much so hypocritical, at least in the way the Sith interpreted it. To being with, the galaxy is not big enough for two, true Sith Lords working together, as the poor execution of the rule of two in the late republic showed, as each one of them only looks for his own emotional liberation and superiority at any and all cost!<

**** This, as many of you probably already realized, create a situation in which the "light", as represented by the Jedi, and the "dark", as represented by the Sith, are two failed ideologies and products that each adhere to an ideal about the human mind and behavior, and fail spectacularly in it's execution.\\
The Jedi fail to realize the wisdom and maturity comes not from avoiding your issues, but confronting and solving them, and that a truly calm man is not one without fears, worries and wants, but one who can safely deal with them and live in happiness. The Jedi failed to understand that fear and hatred are two emotions that comes from places of insecurity, and a good way to deal with them is to teach others compassion and love, rather then Apathy.

The Sith, on their side, failed to realize the undermining side of their ideology. While you can form a Cult who could work properly in unison around the failed model of light the Jedi have, you cannot form a proper, working hierarchy based on a hedonistic, individualistic ideology and expect it to work in the long run.\\
The Sith had to adopt in many ways the Jedi model to actually work, which not only undermined their entire ideology without them realizing, but also spelled their own doom.

​

Which brings me back to the topic of proper unity and balance:

Luke Skywalker.

***** Obi Wan, by watching over Luke since birth and guarding him, gave Luke the chance to experience perfectly normal life up until his later adolescence, allowing Luke the gain the proper experience and the wide emotional range of a normal human being.\\
Introducing him to the force so late in the game, as late as Palpatine was in his days, but with Kenobi acting as a guardian who managed to prevent any accidents to happen which could have alienated Luke and ruined his experience, allowed Luke to grow into a proper adult, UNLIKE Palpatine.

Later on, as he taught him briefly the ways of the force, he never told him to shun away his emotions, despite the old and wise Jedi understanding now well the wide range of emotions there is to feel and their danger.\\
Luke's journey, from there on, was filled with both emotional highs and lows, giving him a taste to the more extreme realms of their wide variety.\\
In his trainings with Yoda, he learned of the dangers of wild and uncontrolled emotions, but not through lectures, rather through personal experience. Through his own frustration, through his visits to the dark side cave, and ultimately, when his emotional recklessness betrayed him, costing him his hand, as well as the emotional shock resulting in his confrontation with Vader, showed him how dangerous it was to let himself be controlled by his own emotions and not adhering to his senses.

And finally, we have the final duel.

****** In which, at long last, Luke, filled with rightful fury, almost completely in the dark side, managed to use it to defeat his hated and detested father, crippling him even more and bringing him down. And then, as the voice of temptation whispers in his ears to kill him, end it once and for all, to accept the dark side and it's powers he found inside of him, Luke decided to reject them.

After experiencing the wide range of emotions, Luke managed to bring Balance to the force by embracing his emotions as they are, and acting out of both love, and rational level headedness, decided not to kill his father, and asking him to join him.

This act, which fully embrace both the dark side and the light side of the force as they are laid down through the Jedi and Sith code, led him to his victory, as Palpatine, trying to deny this young, successful mirror of himself from his emotional maturity and freedom, lashes out against him and by doing so betray the dark side, as he now tried to take away Luke's emotions, as he did with so many others. And again, with the ironic laugh of fate, and evil planting it's own seed of destruction, the emotional immaturity and the cage of pain and fear Palpatine locked Anakin in, in direct contrast to the commandments of the dark side, came back at him in full force, as through Luke, Anakin found his salvation and peace, and attacked Palpatine, killing him.

******* This is why, in my opinion, there is balance in the force after Luke wins. Luke is not a real Jedi by the end of episode 6, neither is he a Sith. He is a man who, knowingly or unknowingly, fully accepted the wide breath of both the dark and light side as they are, without conforming to extreme ideologies.

​

This is, as I see it, the rational end for this giant mess.

Both sides need to let go of their extreme views and understand their own folly, and allow themselves to learn from each other.

There is power in being one with your emotions and acting through them, and the Sith would say, but there is also power in serenity and level headedness.

If only they understood that both things go surprisingly well together, and that without the other they are just a broken mess, the galaxy would have probably been a far better place.

** Frankly there isn't. The Jedi/Sith is alot more complicated than it initially seems

The Light side of the Force represents the natural order of the universe. That is, life existing as it should in relationship to other life. Because the Force is a metaphysical field of existence which exists in all life. Life exists with the living force, and when it dies it returns to the Cosmic force in a feedback loop

If the Force is a living organism made up of every organism, than the Dark side is a cancer.

Its why the 'Jedi are the same as the Sith' argument is such bullshit. The Jedi as a system exist to defuse the latent danger present in the existence of force sensitives. Which is that force sensitives possess an absurd amount of power. Not just the visible telekinesis but an ability to see the web of relationships and causality that allows them to effect the world to their desire.

There a reactive force, not a proactive force. The Jedi are the white blood cells who uphold peace using violence for the sake of de-escalation not for the sake of personal gain

Furthermore the force isn't an ability you can fine tune to manipulate its mechanics. The abilities of the Jedi and Sith are tied more to intent, desire and understanding. Its spiritual not utilitarian.

This is why force lightning and force choke belong to the Dark side even if they seem arbitrary. Not because electricity is evil because they are both techniques born solely with the intention of inflicting abuse on another sentient and emerge from the desire to do so. Its about the application, not the actual mechanism itself. Its also why a Jedi can't use Sith magic because to use Sith abilities requires Sith intentions to do so.

Its also why the Sith always have to be stopped. Because the Darkside is a cancer born when sapient life wields the force to try and impose its will on reality. But as stated earlier it works by a feedback loop. The Sith starts out wanting to change the world and in doing so becomes more and more addicted to his own power inevitably devouring others and wreaking havoc in order to fuel it. The bigger the tumor grow the more it consumes.

The Sith desire dominion over nature. The Force is all about the intrinsic relationship between living things and their constraints. So as a result the Sith desperately want to escape from those bonds and put themselves somehow above nature. Which leads to all their works and endeavors always culminating in destruction. The Lightside is the understanding that all things have to exist in harmony and that no one is an island untethered from anything else.

Ultimately there isn't a solution to the problem. The Force is a setting specific thing which is intrinsic to life in Star Wars, it can't be removed without killing everyone. Meaning there will always be force sensitives, the only solution is the Jedi which exist to defuse the threat they pose.

*** Okay but, when it comes to maintaining balance in the force the Jedi are very bad at their job. The fact of the matter is that the Jedi's reactive stance has allowed the Sith to grow and plot right under their noses and by the time the Jedi the Sith will have killed hundreds if not thousands of people and/or they are two powerful for the Jedi to handle which results in a purge of Jedi and the Sith takin over the galaxy. I suppose it is logical to assume that trying to destroy the force is a bad idea, but fact of the matter is is that the Jedi's withdrawn nature and reactive stance has led to the death and suffering of thousands of people across of the galaxy. Now if ending the conflict between the Sith and Jedi is impossible then at least the Jedi should fight smarter and take a more proactive stance against the Sith.

**** TBF the Jedi were operating after a millennia of peace in which there was no war or Sith to speak of.

They fucked up badly with Palpatine but considering that the Sith always fall Id say they have a pretty good track record.

The sheer size of the galaxy makes it impossible to police everything. Expecting the Jedi to be able to defuse the Sith 100% is generally unrealistic given how vast the galaxy. Not to mention that being proactive risks infecting the Jedi with agendas and biases. In order to be effective the Jedi have to be closed off.

Which is why they put so much effort in collecting force sensitives as a preventative measure.

The Jedi are passive and reactive. But it's counterbalanced by the fact that the Sith are unrestrained and self destructive.

Granted it would risk infecting them with agendas and the PT is evidence that doing so is a bad idea, but if they got out more they would be able to improve public relations with the galactic citizens who are mostly apathetic towards the whole Jedi-Sith wars until it's too late.

** My idea of it is that the force is a sort of echo/ psychic field that is imprinted upon by its users. There are inherently some destructive imprints, but trying to destroy them actively is itself a destructive process. I feel like the way to destroy the dark side would be to let it fade naturally, or to start over with a blank slate in a galaxy where force users have never been. There is some indication that any plan to delete the memory of the force would cause some sort of wound. Maybe there is a way to cut off the galaxy from the force.

Whether that's destirable permanently is a difficult question, but I would maintain that doing so temporarily, if it results in the history of the force getting reset, may be desirable.

Other than the casualness a big difference between his teaching and the mainstream Jedi is not actually trying to make the darkside taboo but rather just risky, impractical and only occasionally useful in niche use.

He eventually died in bed after a happy and very long life surrounded by friends and family, not having made any significant impact on history.
