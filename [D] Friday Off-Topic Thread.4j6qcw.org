Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

** GMing a Pathfinder campaign where all of the PCs are different kinds of magical engineer turns out to be a good way to force yourself to internalize scope. For instance, the scope of how much of various metals exist within a given mountain, when your players have invented mining-snake automatons that can burrow through solid stone faster than a man can sprint and hunt metal by magical scent. Or the scope of the shaped-charge explosion that results from filling a shipping-container-sized extradimensional pit with gunpowder and flying it into a dragon's lair.

I'm simultaneously proud of and horrified by my players. I tossed a buffed 12-headed cryohydra at them and they wrecked it in basically a single turn. The five CR 14 Furnace Golems they fought right after didn't fair much better. Golarion is doomed.

** I'm glad that we were able to get a Wednesday World-building thread. I find many of the stories on the subreddit to be confusing or lacking context (summary, like "since last time" for quick catch-ups, or a "Harry thought he was a normal boy until... something something wizards and witches are real!" to give me a teaser of the stories) so I wasn't finding any creative outlet in people's threads of their online novels.

--------------

It's just nice to be able to let loose some creative thoughts and discuss various worldbuilding concepts with other people. We needed a place to discuss things like "What if people could double jump in reality?" or "What if we could fly but that would still be a form of exercise?", and judging by the 90 comments in the thread, it seems like people have responded positively to the thread idea.

I hope from it we get some more stories based on personal headcanon and concepts.

There are some like you who like to write, where discussion of their ideas can be demotivating to writing their stories, those who will write their stories regardless of discussing their ideas, and another category of people who just like discussing worlds with different rules and laws.

I think this thread will be beneficial because you'd be providing the third group of people a place where they can discuss their ideas and hopefully take them into the authoring stage. At the very least, it's one more avenue for people to bounce their ideas off and gives people like me a place to contribute more often.

Perhaps you could draw some of the concepts into the weekly competition threads, so that people could be encouraged to write based on the worlds/concepts discussed?

And to be clear, I'm not against discussion or brianstorming, I just want authors to be aware that sometimes talking about the things that you want to write about makes you less likely to write about them, which is presumably not what they want. I sometimes hit a wall in my writing and /need/ to talk to people about it, or I want wider input so that I can properly simulate the diversity of reactions or schools of thought within an organization.

It's kind of interesting to consider how the different pieces of a fictional universe might overlap in weird ways, depending on their levels of mutual consistency and interrelation. If all works purporting to represent /Avatar: The Last Airbender/ are all just distorted reflections of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Forms][the same "One True Canon"]] that's perfectly rational and internally-consistent, can that "true canon" [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_problem][be extracted]] by somehow averaging the reflections so that their distortions are canceled out?

I get the feeling that it's a piece of anti-isolationism propaganda:

#+begin_quote
  “Now, Congressman, the only way for an inferior army to accomplish anything is to refuse battle until the chances are as favorable as they can be made. The inferior force must retire before a superior. It must force the invader to follow till he is weakened by steadily lengthening lines of communications. His difficulties of food-and ammunition-transport grow. He becomes involved in strange terrain. Last but not least, he gets more and more deeply into a land filled with a hostile population. But if we must defend a specific place at all hazards, then we must stand and give battle---well, it will be only one battle.”

  “You mean---?”

  “I mean that such a battle is decided already. It was decided years ago---when the country refused to prepare.”

  “Good God, man!” The Congressman wiped his forehead with a trembling, fat hand. “I can't go back and tell my people that.”

  “You'd better not,” said the General, grimly.

From the same source, [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/52053][a 1920 advertisement brochure for a gyroscopic compass]] ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrocompass][more information]]):

#+begin_quote
  If you were to conceive of a compass which would be free from all the troubles and errors found in most compasses, which would relieve you of all the worry and care the present compass requires, a compass which would be accurate and reliable, a compass which would be the Ideal Compass under all conditions, you would undoubtedly conceive of a compass that had the following characteristics:

  1. It must point True North.\\
  2. It must free you from the necessity of making calculations and corrections.\\
  3. It must free you from compensating the compass for errors.\\
  4. It must free you from the burden of swinging the ship, or otherwise taking the deviation of your compass.\\
  5. It must not be influenced by inherent magnetism of the ship.\\
  6. It must not be influenced by any change in the character or disposition of the cargo.\\
  7. It must not be influenced directly or indirectly by any temperature changes.\\
  8. It must not be influenced by the roll or pitch of the ship.\\
  9. It must not be influenced by any weather conditions.\\
  10. In the event of failure, or error, it should give instant warning.

  The Magnetic Compass does not point to True North, it points to Magnetic North, which is about 800 miles from the True North Pole. The Sperry Gyro-Compass, which is not a Magnetic Compass, and is not affected by a magnetism of any sort, and derives its directive force from the earth's rotation, points True North. It does not point to the Magnetic North Pole.

**** Agreed, there are consistent biases in fanfiction, with certain tropes appearing more often than others. If all fanfictions were random, symmetric deviations from canon, you could perhaps somehow average them together and estimate the original work with some degree of precision, but fanfics are far from symmetric and random.

As for Zach's question in the OP, I'd say that what is canon is defined by the author, who in turn has the ability to retcon the original, existing canon in favor of a new one, or otherwise create an "alternate canon". I also suppose the creator of a work can be a /fan/ of their own work (as google defines /fan/ as "a person who has a strong interest in or admiration for a particular person or thing", with synonyms: enthusiast, devotee, admirer, lover; supporter, follower, disciple, adherent, zealot; expert, connoisseur, aficionado), but to me "fan" connotes admiration /of another/, so unless the original author has amnesia or dissociative identity disorder or something they wouldn't really be a fan, which'd be a necessary condition of producing fanfiction.

Check out the /[[http://raggedjackscarlet.tumblr.com/post/135533951313/a-remake-without-an-original][Undertale Prime]]/ theory.

Undertale makes use of a lot of fanfic tropes despite not actually being fanfic of anything. The author of that post - which I won't summarize here - imagines what the "canon" to Undertale's "fanon" would be like, and reinterprets some perceived plot-holes in that light.

It should go without saying that that is just one of the many many bizarre edge cases that you can encounter when trying to create a formal definition of the "is fanfic of" and "shares a canon with" relationships. Such a formalisation can never exist in a coherent way.

#+begin_quote
  The radio version has an entirely new, upbeat ending, appended to the existing story.

  In the alternate ending, after the destruction of Earth, the description of the Babel fish from the earlier series is replayed with an additional section, which states that dolphins and Babel fish are acquainted, and that the dolphins' ability to travel through possibility space (first mentioned in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and elaborated on in So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish) is shared by the Babel fish as well. During the ending, Ford explains that the dolphins got taught this skill from the Babel fish in exchange for knowing a good place to have parties. All the major characters are carrying Babel fish in their ears, which rescue them at the moment of Earth's destruction by transporting them to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe. The characters are reunited with Marvin, and it is revealed that beyond the Restaurant (and beyond the car park in which Marvin works) lies an endless series of blue lagoons --- the final destination of the dolphins. The series ends with Arthur asking Fenchurch, "Will you come flying with me?", and her reply, "Always."

** Just finished watching Erased. Spoilers follow, read at your own digression.

The ending sucked. Some people complained about episode 10, but that was pretty much fine. 11 & 12 though... They sucked. To have the main character go into a coma as a means of time skip is bad. Yeah, time skips are very hard to pull off correctly, but it was still a cop-out. The whole ending felt rushed and anti-rational. He never took what's-his-name on, except for that very last scene. It was like, "reveal!" And I was like, "since when did he become an unreliable narrator."

Also, it violates Yudkowsky's rule, "If you give Frodo a lightsaber, give Sauron the death star." The MC (I'm bad at names) doesn't use his power to its full potential; he doesn't come close. And, his enemy is some serial murderer? And you missed a ton of important clues that could have easily led you to the murderer? Plus, he didn't tell anyone about his power. I thought that he would've almost immediately after going back. Or tell his other smart friend. He only kinda reveals it at the end.

This story has such potential for a rational fiction. Whether you start from the beginning or after the murderer reveal, it doesn't matter. The story, although filled with tension, felt wrong in ways because the characters were dumb. Yeah, a moral of the story is to put trust in your friends, but still. Even after he goes back the second time, he didn't tell anyone.

UGH! I'm sorry, I'm just frustrated. The story feels like a draft for a better story. The ending at least. Although I hear it's better in the manga, he still does the coma thing. That's bad in my book. Oh yeah, especially at the end, he implies that if he dies, he'll come back because of his power. Then why didn't the author have him just and come back at the murderer reveal? Because it would ruin the story by having him being rational? Well, he would still have to figure it out, especially without evidence.

I feel like many authors don't want to ponder out what would actually happen sometimes, and want to leave it closer to what they know. Reliving out your life is hard to imagine, so boom, cop-out to the coma. [[#s][Worm Spoiler]]

It's just awful. Tell your mom about your power, test out of shit, and get a headstart on your life. And, if you want to be a true rationalist, take advantage of your rewind and invent/invest in new technologies. You know stuff from the future. Use that jump to make your life and everyone else's better. Even if you're that young prodigy who was great at drawing. You have a freaking jumpstart in life. The problem is how that fits with the story: it doesn't. So everything's awful.

I know I will be thinking about what a rational fic will be like. There's a tiny chance I might write some (I took a writing class last semester, but I'm busy, so it's hard). If anybody knows of any good erased fanfiction, that'd be great. Thanks for reading my rant. :D

** I have a /qualified/ anime recommendation.

Maoyuu Maou Yuusha. It's about a destined hero who ventures forth alone to vanquish the evil demon lord and bring peace to the world. When he reaches her (After about two minutes), she tells him how the war against her demons is the only thing keeping the human nations from constantly warring among themselves, and here are the economics of it, and the politics, and the history, and it's similar on the demons' side of things. So instead of trying to get one side to win and enslave the other species, why don't we use our powers to secretly cooperate and try to set up long term conditions for peace with these interesting new crops I found? And this 'vaccine' against small pox, and these inventions that will make life easier on farmers and-

It's basically a cookie cutter [[/r/rational]] Fantasy premise, and the hero soon agrees.

Unfortunately, while the premise is great, it's only one season, and they still manage to squeeze in 50% filler and big boob fan service everywhere, and some things still happen just because the plot demands it, like the demon lord taking several months off from plotting for no apparent reason other than that it would have been too easy otherwise.

So it's a qualified recommendation. If you don't mind/can stand excessive fan service and a hero who panics whenever a woman shows interest, and you are alright with 50% filler, then it's pretty neat to see a secret hero/demon lord alliance manipulating the economy and working behind the scenes to take the world out of the dark ages.

Spice and Wolf does economics better, but is not otherwise rationalist. Good romance though.

** So I'm reading about relationships and marriage for this biweekly challenge and I wondered what's the best method to raise rational children. One thing I asked for example is about horror stuff.

Would it be better to talk logic with a child and teach it to not fear the darkness and the unknown and rather look at it with curiosity while avoiding exposure to supernatural/horror topics? Or would it be better to expose it to a bunch of horror topics so that they become desensitized with them in the same way butchers and surgeons become desensitized to seeing blood?

I wondered this due to the idea that organisms that don't interact with certain aspects of the environment tend to fare poorly due to lack of experience. Thoughts? Are there any known books or methods for raising children according to rational values?

*** My standard response is to read a lot of developmental psychology. Humans are not rational, but kids are even less rational in fairly well-known ways. Before certain ages, things which would be good for adults would just damage kids!

**** Biggest take-away for me was: Find the point at which attempting to understand no longer frustrates the child, but rather leaves them confused yet intrigued - smiles and excited giggling are good indicators of the latter. Talk the child through their confusion and into understanding, while patiently and gradually reducing how reliant on you they are to reach that understanding. Once they're no longer reliant on you to reach understanding, the child has mastered that development.

If you're going to take that approach, though, you'd need to fairly heavily emphasize social aspects of development or else your child will grow frustrated with their relatively underdeveloped peers. Also, you'd preclude traditional education holding your child's interest if enrolled with their age bracket. Plus the incredible time investment necessary to pull it off. And godly levels of patience. Might want to become really proficient at mindfulness meditation, first.
