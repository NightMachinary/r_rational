** If I had a nickel for every time a story involving hallucinatory cactus people was featured in this sub, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice.

*** Huh. You missed either /Universal Love, Said the Cactus Person/ or certain fun chapters of /Unsong/ (admittedly by the same author).

** This is really good. Not exactly rational, but good. I'm getting Haruki Murakami vibes, like Hardboiled Wonderland and the End of the World vibes.

*** As per the endnotes it's partly inspired by Ted Chiang's [[https://www.google.com/search?q=hell+is+the+absence+of+god+ted+chiang][/Hell is the absence of God/]], which has much the same flavor. For a 'steel-manned' or more realistic version, I'd recommend reading CS Lewis' /The Great Divorce/.

**** The story did not hold my attention. Perhaps it is because it is too similar to "Hell is the absence of God", and I've read that already.

**** I forced myself to read Lewis' novel a while ago when it was posted somewhere in the rational sphere because he's held up as a good writer and a powerful christian apologist and I wanted to give him and his ilk a fair shake after my childhood self hastily abandoned /Narnia/ due to having interesting literature also available. I gained little from that endeavor.

** I was wondering from where I recognized the author's name--he translated the excellent Three-Body Problem.

The whole time I was reading this was as unsettling and ominous as when I read Hell is the Absence of God. I'm not sure if it's the subject matter or the tone of the writing, but it speaks to the author's skill when awful events in the plot don't relieve the sensation of waiting for the other shoe to drop.

*** If you liked this story Ken Liu has published several short story compilations with many gems like this one in them.

** Thanks for sharing. Starts off feeling similar to Ted Chiang's story, but eventually diverges onto its own path. Whereas in /Hell is the Absence of God/, Angels and miracles are shown to be irrefutably true, forcing all kinds of strange thinking and logic upon the characters, this story turns out to be a more grounded search for faith, with a weird science-astrology twist.

*** When /The Great Divorce/ was recommended in another comment as a more realistic version, I was confused. As you said, /HitAG/ contorted its setting to explore certain implications of Christian theology. To me, this was the realistic, non-supernatural counterpart. The setting was explicitly our own, with the only fantastic element being extrapolation of single-bit errors to our fleshy substrate.

Actually, what this really reminds me of is a more satisfying take on Greg Egan's [[https://www.gregegan.net/OCEANIC/Complete/Oceanic.html][Oceanic]]. Both have the tension between a transcendental experience and the base, materialist process that is or could have caused it.

**** To clarify, I meant that /The Great Divorce/ feels like a more coherent setting (or more like it could be our world) than /Hell is the absence of God/.

/Single-Bit Error/ outdoes both, IMO.
