** I'm guessing Dizzy wanted to hide (and stop the demon's plans) because she felt like she caused her father's death and she didn't want it to be in vein. A sort of sunken cost fallacy.

The chapter raises a good question: at which point does Nic end and the demon begin? Personally, I don't think there's any separation between the two. All of the insights Nic had were his but only because there's no distinction between him and the demon.

That's why I was surprised at Nic still suspecting the demon will come out and take over. I was under the impression that once they merged the demon (and Nic) are gone and what you get is some mixture of the two. Having the demon take over would be like changing a chicken back into an egg - I don't think that's how it works.

*** Only thing I could think of is maybe worrying that merging lead to a merging of their priorities/desires, and considering of the original Demon's "desires" too highly is thus the demon rather than Nic?

** Interesting, Nic is still lying, which probably points towards him not being the demon.

That said, since it keeps being referred to as a merger, I'm guessing there won't be such a thing as a dominant party. They're both one from now on. And Nic got stirred towards the demon's beliefs, that he was a hero?
