It's going to be less of a rationality-shits-on-the-world romp (i.e. how I saw Luminosity (which I nevertheless enjoyed) and how HPMOR began) and more of a serious, semi-mature story focused on plot, development, and engagement (like what I think HPMOR became by the end). Like HPMOR, it will begin with the only ostensible difference that a certain character is smarter.

I'm still in the planning stage, since I want to breadcrumb the major plotlines very carefully, but I'm approaching the point where it becomes reasonable to actually start writing. However, I'm worried about the story falling flat on the community, solely for the reason that it's based in ponies. Please take for granted that this plot cannot be written in a non-pony context; changing the setting is not viable.

I think the title is important. Something facile like "MLP: Science is Magic" (in addition to not really fitting the story) is sure to seem bland and maybe juvenile.

Other than that, I'm not sure what I can do to minimize the effect of the 'ugh field' surrounding the fandom. I think I could, in fact, write smart content compelling to the community, but it seems there would be a strong bias in plenty of individuals to categorically ignore an MLP fic (e.g. I've seen heavy resistance to MLP: Friendship is Optimal recommendations, even though that story /takes place on human Earth/). So I'm very wary of completely wasting my time and effort, since it seems possible to me that the MLP fandom at large might also not be the right audience.

Can you think of anything I can do to ensure the fic is taken seriously? Would you, personally, be willing to give it a shot?

Also, has any straightforward "character X is smarter" MLP fic been (successfully) written before? I haven't really seen anything like that.

Thanks!


** I think Friendship is Optimal was actually quite popular, all things considered. Ultimately, there are a fair amount of limits on what you can do to make a fanfiction popular to an outsider since the range of people who understand it is dependent on the fandom. For example, a fanfiction of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (JoJo's Rational Adventure anyone???) is going to have a smaller audience than a fanfiction of Harry Potter simply because Harry Potter has a much larger fandom and is much more widely consumed in the general populace.

Picking MLP as your base for your fanfiction will help you because many people are familiar with the original work. It will hurt you because many people are not familiar with the original work. If your goal is to try to get readers who haven't watched MLP, your best tool is probably basing the fic off of something other than MLP. I think MLP has an active fan-community and is widely watched, though, so I wouldn't really worry about this.

*** I've started reading Austraeoh, and at least in the beginning, the writing is awful. The prose is 80% purple, and the conjunctions of phrases and clauses are done in the most nonsensical ways.

I'm still reading it, though. The series is currently 2,382,826 words long; SS&E /has/ to have gotten better in that time. If they haven't, well, that's one hypothesis completely obliterated. Although, if only non-purple wordcount (u) decreases your purple ratio (y)...

Let's say every 1,000 non-purple words decreases your purpleness percentage by 0.1%, a ratio of -1/1000. Every non-purple word shifts purpleness down by 0.0001%, making dy/du = -1/1000000. x is the number of total words, and x and u are related by the equation u = x - yx, the total (x) less the purple wordcount (yx).

Since we want dy/dx, change in purpleness given a change in total wordcount, we can use the chain rule to get dy/dx = dy/du · du/dx, and since we have u(x, y), we can take the partial derivative with respect to x and obtain du/dx = 1 - y. dy/dx = -1/1000000 · (1 - y) = (y - 1)/1000000.

Plugging this in to W|A (with y(0) = 0.8 purpleness) (can you tell I gave up on the math?), we get a solution of y(x) = 1 - 0.2e^{x/1000000}. This equation gives us a wordcount-to-zero-purpleness of 1,609,437 words. We can then integrate from 0 to 1609437 to get a total purple wordcount of 809438, which, when divided by the series total wordcount, gives us a to-date average purpleness ratio of 0.3396.

If we change dy/du to reflect a decrease of 0.1% purpleness every 10,000 words, a more conservative estimate, we obtain a total purple wordcount of about 1,844,690 over the entire current run of the story, yet to reach zero purple. This gives us a much more likely to-date average purpleness ratio of 0.7742.

Whether it's good or bad, 2.4 million words is impressive, to say the least.

** I would be strongly resistant to any pony-based fanfic. The reasons that I read /Friendship is Optimal/ were that a lot of people highly recommended it to me, it was complete, and it was "not technically fanfic" (in the way that a story about a bunch of people living in a virtual version of the /Enterprise/ is not technically fanfic of /Star Trek/).

I don't actually think that this is an example of an ugh field. It's not a matter of being conditioned against those stories, it's an honest assessment of probability. The odds that /any/ fanfic is going to be good is low. The odds that I will enjoy a fanfic about a franchise which I don't enjoy is low. The odds that a given serial work will be abandoned is fairly high. The odds that I will enjoy a serial work which is incomplete is low. The only real way to counter this (for me) is for me to read some rave reviews that cause me to adjust my level of probable enjoyment.

This leaves you in the Catch-22 that lots of writers fall into; people don't want to read what you've written without assurances that it's good, but people aren't going to assure others that it's good until they've read what you've written. Having it be MLP fanfic only makes this problem more extreme.

Sorry if I don't have great advice on how to solve this problem. The best I can offer is to just write well continuously until people start to take notice; eventually you'll pass through some barriers as your story garners recommendations, which will get you more readers, which will get you more recommendations. But that takes a lot of time and effort.

That's how I felt about HPMoR and MLP:FIO, but one of the things that I enjoyed most about them was that they lampshaded the hell out of the things that annoyed me about the canon genres. Inserting a rational or genre-savvy character into any irrational genre is going to have a huge popcorn effect for me.

And I can't see any rational!MLP that didn't bust the genre actually being rational.

Starting out with a few genre-busting epiphanies would ensure a jet-assisted take-off.

Equestria appears to rate friendship and sociality above the kind of single-minded focus characteristic of, for example, pre-S1 Twilight Sparkle.

Of course, what might be interesting is a rational character who /embraces/ the tenets of Equestria and deliberately sets out to enhance themselves and others through friendship and close relationships.

Thinking further, there's also the issue of Celestia. It's not unknown for rationalist characters to become sufficiently powerful (or at least influential) that their actions start having political consequences. It's not too far a stretch to imagine that at some point, Celestia is going to want to talk to such a character.

[[http://www.fimfiction.net/group/1418/lesswrong]] has a lot of similar fiction to what you suggest. I don't think the basic straightforward HPMOR premise of making just a few characters smarter and only tweaking the world building slightly has been done before all the way to a good and complete fic. The Great Alicorn Hunt and Mortal are both pretty close to that premise though.

***** When you write fanfic, you're making a transformative work. Sometimes this is an extension of the work, other times it's commentary on the work, but it's (almost always) contained within that created world itself.

Works like /FiO/ are a level up. It's like the difference between putting on your own production of /Lysistrata/ and putting on a production of a play about a production of /Lysistrata/. The additional meta level is not at all trivial; it makes the work about a totally different thing. /Lysistrata/ is about sex, feminism, and society. A play about a production of /Lysistrata/ will necessarily have to be about how people interact with /Lysistrata/, about art as representation, and about producing meaning in art (also, likely about interpersonal relationships between actors, directors, etc.).

That change in focus that comes with switching levels makes a huge difference in what the work is about and who might like it.

****** I don't think that's it. Fanfiction does not have to deal with the same themes as the source material. Nor does it have to use the same characters, or happen in the same world. It should almost certainly fit one of those three criteria, but none are mandatory.

Fanfiction is a label which tells the reader to refer to the original work for context, such as themes, characterisation, worldbuilding, and emotional investment. Subpar fanfic authors use this to patch over parts of the story where their own writing is lacking. It's a label which has to be added by the author, either explicitly or by using names from the source material. It's a label which can be deliberately removed, too - /50 Shades of Grey/ is not /Twilight/ fanfiction, even if it's only a find-replace away.

In any case, /Friendship is Optimal/ is not about the creation of the TV series /My Little Pony/, it's about the creation of a (fictitious) AI based on it. And if a story about creating a simulated world based on an in-universe television series isn't fanfiction, then /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/1/The-Finale-of-the-Ultimate-Meta-Mega-Crossover][The Finale of the Ultimate Mega Meta Crossover]]/ isn't fanfiction of anything other than /Permutation City/.

/Friendship is Optimal/ also uses a lot of tropes that are characteristic of MLP fanfic. There's plenty of other stories about Equestria contacting Earth and humans turning into ponies, which I will not list here as they don't deserve the attention. FiO doesn't fall on the blurry line of genre boundaries, it's so far inside the fanfic norm that it's in a well-documented subgenre.

******* We just disagree with what makes the label "fanfiction" appropriate then, which is not going to make for a good conversation. I think what I disagree with most strongly is the idea that an author has some ultimate authority in deciding what labels can or should apply to their work (though I don't deny that they have /some/).

My argument against /FiO/ being fanfiction is that it doesn't take place within that world (except where that world is acknowledged as purely fictional), it doesn't share any characters (except when those characters are acknowledged as purely fictional), and so far as I can tell isn't about any of the same things as /My Little Pony/ (though I'll admit to not having watched more than a few episodes). So I don't see how it's any more fanfiction than a story about the production of the television series would be fanfiction, or a story about someone watching the show, or a story about a fan convention, regardless of whether the author thinks that it's fanfiction or not.

But as I said, it's a difference in definitions, which means that we're not going to convince each other.

And if the story had ended in the first couple of chapters I wouldn't be confused. But /Equestria Online/ is Iceman's invention, extrapolating from the real-life MLP episodes, just like fanfiction. It's like if someone wrote a story about the production of Season 8 of the TV series, and included detailed storyboards or scripts of the episodes. Is that just fanfiction with a framing device? That can't be right.

I think giving /FiO/ the label "fiction about /My Little Pony/" gives a far better idea of /what it is/ than saying "fanfiction of /My Little Pony/". It's obviously moot here, because we've both read it and know what it is more fully than the distinction could encompass.

That said, whether or not FiO 'is fanfiction' or not is the sort of meaningless label-fight that comes down to arguing about what the definition of various labels 'should' be, and is therefore completely pointless to debate or discuss.

For what it's worth, I don't like MLP:FIM canon / source material very much, and there are like ~3 stories that come from it's source material that I enjoy, of which FiO is far and away the best.

For any statement you make that's not directly related to the definition of group membership, there's a good chance you can find a counterexample.

Also, bayesianism only works if you have meaningful numbers. Did you actually conduct a survey to determine how much the trait is expressed on average? Was the methodology sound? Or are you just pulling traits out of the air based on salient individuals?

It's not even about bronies specifically. This is true of any sufficiently large group.

Even when you do have solid evidence, there are always lots of other factors to consider. For example, it's well documented that in America, black males are much more likely than others to go to prison. But if I asked the next 5 black males I see, I bet that none of them have been to prison. People I meet is obviously a biased sample of all Americans.
