** In general I think there isn't a single subreddit which you can rely for advice about all sorts of topics. I would recommend a subreddit that flairs and verifies experts in specific topics, like for science, [[/r/askscience]]. Lesswrong often attempts to substitute an expert knowledge base and years of studying with basic reasoning and bayesian statistics, and that approach is shallow at best and give deeply misleading answers at worse. If you just want to have fun talking about a topic with people that like thinking, that's one thing, but if you are looking for genuinely right answers, that's another.

I've seen two recommendations for [[/r/slatestarcodex][r/slatestarcodex]]... but I've gradually been turned off from it, as the way it allows people to express any view so long as they obey rules about charitably and citing sources has allowed the alt-right to use it as a starting point in a pipeline. It may have gotten better since the culture war open threads were discontinued, but the spin-off subreddit, themotte, aimed at continuing the sort of discussion the culture war threads had has gotten even worse with full-on mask-off 14 words (rephrased into thousands of words with multiple citations to obey the rules). themotte also claims to allow any discussion and be neutral, but the moderation is much stricter with mainstream leftist positions and soft on hardcore White Nationalists positions.

As for the blog slatestarcodex itself... Scott Alexander claims to charitably search through multiple sources and to be a left-leaning centrist... but there is a systematic pattern where he fails to grok basic leftist principles and his attempts at reading leftist material fails in a way that misses the point, while right-wing material gets a much more charitable reading. I am not sure if he is naive, or Dunning-Krugering himself, or unaware of his own biases, or if he is outright hiding his power level, but it is something to keep in mind when reading from his blog. The overall effect is that the Overton window of slatestarcodex is dragged to the right even as Scott Alexander insists that he is center left.

For a clear example of this, Scott wrote a piece (prior to the 2016 election I think?) about how Donald Trump isn't really any more racist or worse than the average Republican and the people who are warning about his racism and fascism are "crying wolf". The whole piece is weird for partially acknowledging how racist Republicans are but for the most part serving to try to say Trump isn't that bad. So it acknowledged Trump was bad but overall tried to normalize Trump, so it was heavily liked by Trump supporters even if Scott managed to avoid being "pro-Trump" per se. It was a weird angle to come from and it really made me question what motivates Scott to write a given post (and thus suspicions about him hiding his power level). And Scott has commented on some of his older posts before but never to my knowledge recanted on that post so yeah...

"You Are Still Crying Wolf" is from after the election. You might be curious to note some of the comments that he's added to the top of it since then. [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/11/16/you-are-still-crying-wolf/][Here's the link.]]

What's more, a whole bunch of that essay is basically saying "Actual alt-right and white-supremacists are few in number and almost insignificantly politically weak. People like me --- a left-leaning Jewish atheist in the Bay Area, so nominally a political, racial, religious, and sectional foe of these people --- don't really have much to fear from them. Please stop scaring my patients; they have enough anxiety already."

(I thought at the time that he was wrong about Trump, but right about the KKK. I think this is basically correct today.)

Even taking this as what he says... Scott is asking people to downplay Trump in order to avoid causing anxiety for people that get stressed about world issues. That seems like a a really weird take. Also, Scott's take on racism in that post is just as stupid as I remember. By the logic Scott uses, as long as someone says they aren't racist, you aren't allowed to call them racist.

I think the real aim of Scott is revealed in your paraphrase:

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Scott is in a privileged position in which all the policies Trump pushes that put migrants in cages and hurt various disadvantaged groups aren't actually a perceived risk to himself by Scott, but being labeled a racist is perceived as a risk by Scott. Thus Scott spends thousands of words to normalize Trump and to get people to stop using the word racist. It's not alt-right, but it is some [[/r/enlightenedcentrism]] and alt-righters find it useful because it gives them more room to mask themselves (hence the culture war thread gradually getting colonized by altrighters until Scott shut it down and they spun off into themotte).

This pattern is continued in other posts. The anti-reactionary faq tries really hard to steelman reactionaries. And Scott doesn't agree with neoreactionaries, but by taking their ideas seriously, he drags the Overton window of his blog and the commenters he attracts rightward. Conversely, Scott fails at his attempts to steelman leftists ideas...

To get back to u/[[https://www.reddit.com/user/wooohooohooo/][wooohooohooo]]'s question. If they do chose to make slatestarcodex the place they hang out on reddit, they should avoid going go themotte and keep an eye open on what other subreddits people who post in SSC also frequent. To give an example sometimes a person is just interested in IQ as a measure of intelligence... and sometimes they have an agenda to push to argue that IQ is a valid measure of intelligence in order to argue that African people are less intelligent.

This is exactly an example of what that post is criticizing:

#+begin_quote
  Many people have tried to tell me this post “didn't age well”, but I think they're just continuing to make the same mistakes this post warns against. For example, this post warns against thinking of Trump's opposition to immigration as some sort of shocking new development when it's similar to other immigration opposition from other presidents of both parties. I predicted that Trump would not deport more people than Obama. Given all of the evidence of ICE atrocities, I've gotten a lot of people writing me to complain about how wrong I obviously was, but this is on track to be correct -- Obama deported more people in 2010 than Trump did in 2017, and ICE was pretty atrocious during his administration too. *If it doesn't seem that way, that's because my original thesis is still correct -- Trump is acting within the (worst parts of the) US mainstream, but the media is spinning it as an unprecedented atrocity.* (bolding mine)
#+end_quote

Those cages were constructed and used under the Obama administration, and many of the pictures used in news stories about them were actually taken prior to Trump taking office. It's a really good example of taking something that's a fairly normal bit of awfulness that Trump also engaged in, and pretending that it's a feature of Trump instead of our mainstream.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

He also addresses this:

#+begin_quote
  This is just a tiny representative sample, but the rest is very similar. Trump has gone from campaign stop to campaign stop talking about how much he likes and respects minorities and wants to fight for them.

  And if you believe he's lying, fine. Yet I notice that people accusing Trump of racism use the word “openly” like a tic. He's never just “racist” or “white supremacist”. He's always “openly racist” and “openly white supremacist”. Trump is openly racist, openly racist, openly racist, openly racist, openly racist, openly racist, openly racist. Trump is running on pure white supremacy, has thrown off the last pretense that his campaign is not about bigotry, has the slogan Make American Openly White Supremacist Again, is an openly white supremacist nominee, etc, etc, etc. And I've seen a few dozen articles like this where people say that “the bright side of a Trump victory is that finally America admitted its racism out in the open so nobody can pretend it's not there anymore.” (All of those 'openly racist's are links in the original post to different people saying exactly that.)
#+end_quote

It's more fair to say the Scott's point is that as long as someone says they aren't racist, you aren't allowed to call them *openly* racist.
