**** I just excitedly whipped out my phone and went to Mother of Learning in the middle of a rehearsal, and my groan of disappointment broke the pianissimo the violins were working on. Whoops

** Drawn by the brilliant [[https://aslovefromlies.tumblr.com/][Aslovefromlies]], commissioned by me. This is the scene from chapter 101 after Zorian smashes through the invader's defenses in the Dungeon.

*** That is a nice face on Zorian. Definitely a face of an archmage! Imagine the face a mercenary has when he commanded, "Hey, cut my head off!" Hahaha.

Cool stuff. Though I need to reread whether his golems are top-heavy.

**** We never get much detail on them, I went over a few passages on them when talking with the artist, but there's a lot of improvisation.

*** So, a question. Do you want me to add this to the list of fanart on my site?

Also, I'm not sure what the attribution procedure for commissioned artworks should be. I though about crediting the artist (Aslovefromlies) as the artist, and you as the one who made a commission. I usually ask the artist for permission, too, but I'm not sure how that works in the case of commission - I assume it's now up to you to give such permissions?

Anyway, tell me your thoughts about this.

**** Please put it up, I love the story and it'd be neat to have more fan art for people to see.

Crediting both is fine üëç
