Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** You can control anyone for ten seconds after they are in the area four millimetres outwards from your skin. It is like their body becomes your second body and you can control it, and use it's senses, as if it was your own. You also a get a multitasking boost to be able to easily control up to five bodies and that number will improve with practice.

You cannot make them do something they would absolutely not do, like having a the target just randomly kill their best friend, and if you try the target will have a chance to brake out of your control. What you could do is control the target so they get into an argument with their best friend which escalates to the point of killing them. As long as the context is there for them to justify to themselves why they did the action you can make them do it.

After the controls end people will remember things as if they were the ones in control and give themselves the emotional context for why they did what they did. So if you controlled a random person on the street into asking you out on a date, depending on what type of person they are, they might remember the action as they making a spontaneous joke or they might remember how they though you were so attractive they just had to ask you out right then and there.

You also learn much faster to be able to easily control the new body. Figuring out how to best move in a body with some sort of abnormality would take less then a minute.

How would you use this in the real world? How would you use this in a superhero setting?

*** Become a prison rehabilitator. For both the real world and the superhero setting.

Since people remember the actions you make them do as if they chose to do it themselves, you could mind control various prisoners and make them turn over a new leaf. For example, you could pat someone on the shoulder saying "I believe that deep down, you're still a good person." and then control their body to make it burst into tears and say they are sorry for their crimes. Then afterwards they would with high probability believe that they said that because they truly felt remorse for their crimes.

If you aren't skilled enough then you would be unable to use the prisoners body to do a convincing redemption scene and they would likely remember that as them acting out a fake redemption in order to mock you or something. Also if you are to over the top after you leave they might think back and notice they start acting weird or overly emotional whenever you touch them leading them to suspect something.

The first thing that comes to mind, offhand, is hanging out in some kind of gambling establishment and rigging the bets, assuming the me in this scenario is not troubled by morality. You'd need seed capital to play the odds right, though.

You could keep touching someone every nine seconds to permanently keep them under your control.

** I'm curious what you guys think could be muchkinned about elemental magic and for the sake of this post let's limit ourselves to the elemental bending from Avatar, specifically water, air, and earth bending since fire bending makes no sense to me (unless it functions as a result of an entirely different magic system than the other 3 elements). I'd also like to add the limitation that bending abilities can't be extended into the bodies/material of living creatures otherwise you get really broken shit (blood bending, air-in-your-lungs bending, bone bending, etc.). Another rule/law I've been thinking may need to exist to really solidify the boundaries between elements is that, for example, a water bender can bend any material whose natural state on Earth is primarily thought of as liquid (if it was "any material whose primary natural state on Earth is liquid", then water benders would be able to bend the materials that compose the Earth's core).

Water Bending

I think if we start by looking at what water benders can do (turning water into steam, mist, and ice or the other way around), we can conclude that they can control the speed water molecules are moving as well as the distance between them, and if you were to extend these capabilities to earth and air bending you could get some interesting things. Even within water bending, there's probably more exploits to be had, especially if we assume water bending is really liquid bending.

Air Bending

Increasing or decreasing the speed air molecules are moving would result in warmer or colder air, but it isn't hard to imagine that someone that can vibrate air molecules to create heat could also oscillate them in a more patterned manner to create sound. I think Worth the Candle does a great job of explaining how useful sound magic can be. You might also be able to create explosions and plasma by compressing air while heating it depending on what sort of 'air' molecules you're working with. Assuming you have some ability to sense whatever magic you are using to bend and by extension, the element you are bending, a bunch of sensory abilities should crop up (for all the elements really). For air benders, sensing the way the air they are bending is displaced by objects in their environment or sensing the way it is being oscillated would result in echolocation or an approximation of it.

Earth Bending

Using earth materials such as permanent magnets in conjunction with highly conductive metals, you should be able to generate electricity in the conductive metals. Vibrating the molecules of something that qualifies as an earth element could result in lava bending. Compressing the molecules of gravel/dust/sand would also result in a fair bit of heat and you could probably crush people like this, similar to Gaara's sand coffin technique from Naruto. Vibrating the earth beneath someone's feet may lead to many of the same sorts of bone-shattering, vomit-inducing, and balance-ruining resonance techniques sound bending could pull off.

** You have the power to swap utility functions: whenever you are in physical contact with exactly one other person, saying "I wish we were more like each other" will cause each of your utility functions to become the other's.

Memories, physical bodies, knowledge, abilities, etc. are all unchanged. You still retain your power and knowledge of how to swap utility functions, and so you can swap utility functions with A, then with B, to effectively give B the utility function of A. However, this plan would only work if you still wanted to swap with B after gaining A's utility function.

​

The utility function is intuitively a list of all stimulus and concepts that would make someone happy or sad. Having one's utility function swapped does not cause any immediate symptoms, and the person may not notice at all until they experience something that their new utility function treats differently from their old utility function. E.g., a person who loves golf may then find the game very boring the next time he plays golf, even though his memories tell him he should be having fun. At that point he will be confused about why he no longer enjoys the game, but you will be long gone.

An interesting effect occurs if the new utility function contains elements not found in the memory of the recipient. For example, if your utility function contains a very great love for a specific person A, and you swap utility functions with a person B who has never met A, B will gradually start to feel that something is missing from their lives. Then, if B gets to know A, they will feel like A is the thing that has been missing from their lives, that "A completes them".

What do you do with this ability?

**** yeah exactly - anyone who's willing to use this power doesn't have a particularly strong utility function (e.g they're fairly aimless in life), and they'll use it until they get one that's strong enough to say "actually priority #0 in this utility function is to not lose this utility function" (e.g, they develop a strong sense of purpose)

like the only way to actually use this power is to come up with some pre-comitment scheme to guarantee that you'll get your original utility function back, and even then it'll probably be circumvented by a particularly strong utility function.

**** You could always swap it back. For example, if there are two people A and B who you want to swap utility functions between, you can swap with A, then B, then A again to get your own function back while making the other two swap theirs. The only issue is making sure the utility functions of A and B won't make you want to stop halfway through the process.

** I want to start a miniature battle royale quest here. This is a super low effort thing, but I think it will be fun. Updates are intended to be weekly, in these munchkinry threads. People's comments will be translated into suggestions that the main character is privy to (there is no voting; the final decision is hers).

--------------

Felicity's head still rang from the crash, everything in sight painted sickly colors, heaving about, to and fro. Her chest ached, and she looked down to find a metal beam skewered through her shoulder, her arm almost severed from her torso. She grasped around with her other hand, failing to think, unwilling to do nothing, incapable of action. She looked to the passenger seat---

---**snap**

“You are dead.”

As the figure spoke, the scenery faded and homogenized. The figure's every detail stood in sharp contrast, crisp, beautiful, perfect, so Entire and Right that the brain failed to even dare reduce it to mere semantic content.

“There are ten rounds. You win a round when your opposition is eliminated. You lose when you are eliminated. After completion, all parties proceed to the afterlife. It is in your interest to win.

“Before each round, you will be granted one wish, each vastly more powerful than the last. Regardless of the details of the wish, the entire power of each wish will be applied. If your wish violates the rules of wishing, you will be asked to provide an alternative.

“You have one wish available, of mundane power or trivial magic. Combat commences in thirty minutes.”

The figure disappeared. Felicity stood in an expanse of white, rolling her miraculously healed shoulder beneath her miraculously healed clothing, wearing a stunned look on her face.

--------------

You get the picture: a vague wish with unknown rules and barely-specified power. Note that I'm hoping to give you an almost-even playing field with the other contestants, though I'll be making most of it up as I go along. If you're significantly more creative than me, you should stand a shot of winning.

*** Well the first option is just offload the decision to the wish engine (like for example saying grant me whatever valid wish will make me most likely to win). But that is likely to be forbidden, Test anyway.

Then we can try to wish for something specific but the rules are too vague to even know what kind of thing is even valid.

So first whish that after afew seconds the particles on the arena to be rearranged in such a way that she's alive and there's an small cut in the brain of all other participants that instantly kills them. If that's not possible just wish for the small cut in everybody's brain.

If thats not valid then depends on why it's not valid.

If she isn't told why the wish is not valid test wishes like rocks on top of the other participants, explosives, compressed ball of electrons that kills everyone but is situated to kill her last , complicated mechanisms that shoot stuff towards then etc.

If possible add some kind of cover for herself to the wishes (she can wish for a contraption that includes both)

*** I wish you had given some example of what counted as a 'mundane power or trivial magic' since it's annoying to munchkin something that's so vague.

--------------

Well the first thing to do is wish for omnipotence and work down from there. That way Felicity will get the strongest wish she can under the limits.

*A few considerations*

- We want a power that will still be usefull in the rounds after this one. So planing for some combo's will be a good idea. Or the power could multiply the MC's power.

- Since there is a high likelihood someone will have a hax power physical durability might be worth much less to invest in. As such it will be better to have power that let her avoid takeing attacks rarther than resisting them.

- Felicity seems like an average human so without wishes bosting her skill and mentality she will be pretty shit at fighting.

- She has thirty minutes of prep. Picking a power that you can charge up or has more effect if the user is given time would work well here. If she dose this allot 5 minutes to experiment then make the wish and start changeing up.

- If she could capture and interrogate her opponent that would be good. She should find out if the other people have redditors giving them suggestions. Also if they are captured she could exstend the match for more time to charge up a power for the next fight.

*The Wish Idea*

- [Summons Small Sprite]: A magical ritual that take a minute to cast that summons a [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/04/Navi_%28The_Legend_of_Zelda%29.png][small sprite]]. The sprites are a fast as you are and has 1/20th of your strength at the time of casting. The sprites are very loyal to you and folow basic instructions. Since you will probebly be teliported to the area make sure they are all touching your body when the timers up. Can be combind with a strength stealing wish latter down the line for exponential physical power growth.

- [Charge shot]: The kinetic energy of your body (this includes body heat) can be charged up and be fired off in a directed AoE attack. Shoot it the moment you see the enemy.

Things should get more understood as you progress, since you'll be learning not only from experience and future information, but seeing other people's attempts. Plus, the nature of a single-elimination tournament is that the early challenge is easiest, most of the time.

**** I think with powers granted like this, it's inevitable that the more generalist you make your power, the further scaled down it would become. Asking for omnipotence -> you can do anything to an extremely small degree, which makes it possibly the worst power you could choose (since you can't use all of it at once).

I think your idea of combos is spot on, as it's all about picking abilities that are usually underpowered (so they won't be nerfed as much) and then pairing them in a way that allows them to fit their niche.

On the downside, I am /not/ particularly creative, and it appears that all the combos I can think of require abilities that are already OP on their own.

***** A pretty good power for combo's is something like being able to see a second into the future since the more power you have the more effective it becomes.

Let's say you can teliport 10m: with future sight you can now dodge any non AoE attack simply by knowing it is comeing and instantly moveing out of the way.

Let's say you can move a 1000x faster than a normal human: Since you are moveing so fast from your perspective that second of future vision is like 16 minutes to a normal person.

Have a power that works by random chance: Look into the future to make sure the randomness always gose the way you want it.

**** Steal powers can be really OP for someone who can guarantee their first victory without an ability. If Felicity can get a powerful set up, then that might be a good ability to get soon.

Edit:

A possible implementation of it: From each person I defeat, I can steal an ability and keep it with a strength of minimum (their stolen ability, my powerstealing ability). This means that later on, when enemies have a range of abilities, Felicity can yoink away (a weaker version of) a clever one without spending an entire wish on it. I think this is balanced as the wishes get vastly more powerful as the tournament progresses, so it's a sacrifice of present power for future flexibility.

If Felicity doesn't get this, then it would be interesting if she faces someone who does, either to great effect (and they win) or they should've gotten a more immediate wish (and they lose)
