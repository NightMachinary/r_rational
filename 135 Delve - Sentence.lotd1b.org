** The numbers religion has had their prayers answered, as Rain finally resolves to go delving for blues. Now it's time to speculate on the over/under of when they actually find one. I presume it hasn't happened within 7 or 8 chapters as the patreon readers would have mentioned, but could it still happen by 145? 150? Or even longer?

** Did not see that coming. Was a very surprised, only Anton seemed psychopathic enough.

I would have expected Brovose to claim that they once killed a team of plate hunters. Given that that would be an alternate plausible explanation, he really missed a beat there. So definitely the right move to kill him.

Rain was really lucky that he made the choice so easy.

Mechanics-wise, can you prove that you dropped all your accolades? Brovose could not have simply dropped a couple and said that those were all he owned?

** I'm very surprised with Rain's decision, even though I know he's grieving right now. Amelia is the one who started the fight! It seems wrong to me for them to start the fight, see that they have all those accolades, and then condemn the mage to death for it.

That being said...given all the evidence, it seems pretty likely that the mage was in fact a mass murderer. Still, his personality from the previous chapters makes me feel like he wouldn't be that kind of man.

I think that Rain made the right decision, but I very much feel uncomfortable about it. He really should have waited until he was in a better state of mind.

All of that being said, I happy that Rain has finally grown up a little. This chapter, to me, signals that the author has taken the criticism to heart and will try to pivot the story in a better direction.

** “I know what you are thinking,” Tallheart said as the shower of accolades finally came to a stop. “You want to give these to the company. You will not. You will take them, and you will take them all. Only through your own strength can you keep anyone else safe.”

FINALLY. If Rain kept up this “nice guy”TM act and the author didn't accordingly punish him for not changing, that's a straight drop on this novel. Hell, I'm not sure slogging through the drudgery of the past 50 or so chapters was worth this buildup and character development, it's long overdue.

That being said, it's clear that power is exponential in this universe, so it makes sense to fewer people have higher levels then multiple people with lower levels.

Not that Rain shouldn't help others, but I do agree that it's long overdue for Rain to get some upgrades.

**** I think the point of the story is that its only like this because everyone's selfish, but it doesn't need to be. If people were trusting there would be more room at the top. If people protected crafters, there would be more powerful items. If people take specialized roles, more powerful blues can be killed by people of appropriate levels, removing the need for power leveling with a higher level person.

***** Mostly "nerd" references.

1. Lots of Tolkien references. Lord of the Rings, the Hobbit, that sort of thing.
2. Marvel/DC comic references. You know, super hero stuff
3. Star Trek references. Maybe Star Wars too, I can't remember.
4. Lots of general America pop culture references. I'm not sure how specific they are since they're so common place. Music.
5. Meme "culture" in general. Slang or phrases that get repeated a lot by young people. Although the slang he uses is kind of outdated. Young people nowadays use a completely different set of slang. I haven't seen or heard anyone use "owned" in over a decade.

Personally, I think #5 is especially egregious. Keep in mind that Rain is speaking a different language entirely. It's utterly bizarre Rain would force idioms and slang from one language into another. Yes, in my experience with other languages, sometimes it works perfectly and feels great when it does. Most of the time, it doesn't make any sense whatsoever and is obnoxious to force it. If anything, Rain should be using the local idioms/slang more. Too his credit, he does use some, but only to a very limited degree so far. Hopefully, his merchant friend can get him more books so he can blend in better. The children's story book seemed especially helpful.

  Rain had reached out as Tallheart spoke and started sifting through the pile. The first few boosts were small---accolades from low-ranked lairs, Heat, Cold, and Force. The sorting process came to a crashing halt as he read something that he knew was possible but that he nevertheless did not expect.

*** Hasn't happened as of the latest chapter. They're in the depths, though, so it seems obvious that this arc will conclude with him killing a blue.

On a different note, the latest (patreon) chapter had way too many annoying references. They've always been there, but there were maybe 5 in one chapter alone... and then there's a bit where Rain asks Ameliah if they're that annoying, and she says no to protect his feelings. Writer, it's obvious you know what people think of the memes. Why are you still cramming them in? Do you hate money?

I really want to make an editor's cut of this story that goes through and eradicates 90% of the cringe and bloat. It'd probably cut the runtime in half.

Also I'm mildly miffed about him being able to casually translate Hobbit on the fly into a language that's entirely divorced from any on Earth. Something really tells me that the author isn't bilingual.

I can buy some of them, like in some recent chapter he made a "special eyes" reference. It seems plausible to me because someone else brought it up so he'd probably laugh at the unknowing reference.

As it is currently though, Rain just feels like one of those military LARPers who nonstop uses military acronyms in their daily life despite knowing full well that no one they're speaking to understands them. Knock it off, you're just intentionally being an asshole.

****** Tolkien has a certain meandering style, but Hobbit or no, translating things is difficult because languages approach things in wildly different ways. There's endless nuance to the different word choices, so the process of translation requires a huge amount of creative effort because you essentially have to rewrite the entire text without actually rewriting it.

Like, take the word "meander" there. Even though it's my native language, I have no idea what Finnish word I'd use for that. "Kuljeskella" is more like... moseying around with lazy connotations. "Vaellella" is closer, but that's a more weighty and introspective sort of "journeying." "Haahuilla" has similar vibes of aimless wandering, but it's more clueless than aimless. And so on.

******* I suppose it makes sense. The languages I know all have germanic/latin roots, so there's usually a similar-rooted word at hand- wandern in German has similar connotations (and sounds like it has the same origin) as meander.

(I just looked it up, meander comes from French. Oh well, wandern still gets the point across).

I get what you mean, though. The words of a language form a basis for describing/partitioning reality, and when the bases of two different languages don't commute, your only choice to be accurate might be to use 10 words where the original language used 1- which you can't really do, so you have to trade off verbosity and elegance versus accuracy. Interesting problem!

*** If Brovose drops a respec (or Anton and Hegar did and Tallheart stonewalled Mariah) and he hogs it, I'd be really annoyed, though. Who knows what Mariahs level cap is? Possibly higher than his own.

But yeah, exponential growth makes for some odd min-maxing that might conflict theoretically conflict with the ideals of the Rain-King. But not as much as Tallheart thinks. And completely hogging them, keeping what's available a secret? Would mean the end of Ascension. And this world is heavily underestimating synergy. Accolades can be freely dropped and exchanged. I think Rain should hold most of them and force Ascension members to push themselves harder. Tarny was straight up planning to replicate his build! Could easily make Tarny let him pick the same metamagic, but picking his auras, so that they have full coverage together. Val is probably as tryhard as it gets. But he too must overcome a weakness of character. He must be forced to learn calculus and think mathematically! Otherwise he's not worthy of the accolades and will never be ready to face his daddy issues. Get gud, Val!

So I don't quite see that there's a resource conflict, after all? Except you can't easily hogtie a higher level blue, to maximize level yield. Too dangerous.
