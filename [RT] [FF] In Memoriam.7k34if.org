*tl;dr:* a rational /Raildex/ fanfiction is [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/in-memoriam-a-certain-magical-index-scientific-railgun-au.1540/page-25#post-9779575][*updating again*]] after 3.5 years of hiatus.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/in-memoriam-a-certain-magical-index-scientific-railgun-au.1540/][*/In Memoriam/*]] is a /[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex][A Certain Magical Index]]/[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACertainScientificRailgun][Railgun]]/ fanfiction attempting to reconstruct the entire setting and plot in a more coherent/rational fashion.

For those unfamiliar with the canon sources, the premise: Japanese scientists learned to unlock psychic abilities native in a small percent of human population, and built "Academy City" to study them, which became one of the largest scientific institutions in the world. Independently from that, a belief-based /bona fide/ magic exists, and is kept hidden by various religious organizations.

The plot deals with various conflicts arising from this setup. Among the main characters are: a low-level esper with power-canceling ability restricted to his right arm; a high-level esper who controls electricity; a girl with eidetic memory which was used as a living library by one of the magic organizations.

The fanfiction's premise and main characters are the same, but the details of worldbuilding, plot and characterization are different, and more "rational" in a way that would likely appeal to members of this subreddit. In particular, the library girl is a lot more agenty. *Knowledge of source material is not necessary.*

It clocked up ~75k words, stopped updating for three-and-a-half years... and [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/9779575/][updated again]] this Monday.

** I was /just/ thinking that it might be worth posting here if it's updating again, but I decided to wait until there was two new chapters just to be sure it wasn't a one-time fluke.

I agree that this story is suitable for this subreddit.

** Raildex is one of those series where the author built a fascinating, unique world and then populated it with terrible plots and characters.

I'm interested in seeing how this goes.

*** I would add the additional caveat that the author often has plots that are very interesting in their basic concept, but get dragged down but stuff like power-level inflation, random side characters, and harem-genre tropes. Likewise, the author has lots of characters that could be interesting (Index has a lot of potential), but get ignored in favor of introducing more random side characters, who in turn are ignored for new characters right as they start to get interesting themselves, or they are ignored for super bland characters (i.e. Touma to some extent, but Hamazura is a tumor of blandness and plot armor that needs to die or be ignored).

** While I'm a fan of some of the changes, the character personalities suffer a lot from the transition to PoV. Everyone is a snarkster, even the characters who were humble and shy in canon, because being humble and shy is a mark of incompetence and all of those must be excised for the fic, apparently.

** Is it worth reading this fic if I haven't seen the original?
