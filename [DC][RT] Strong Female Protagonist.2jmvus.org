** I read this from start to end, and I my one problem is that it is not finished yet. It has a lot of stuff to like. There is this theme that heroes should change the whole world, but they cannot fix all the problems. They don't know how. They need to get smarter, better. Figure out the answer. But while they are busy getting smarter, there is actual suffering in the world that they need help with. So, what do you do? Do you use your power to make enough food to save 100 people from starvation every day, or do you spend years and years to finally end world hunger completely. How do you justify that to the 100 people who die that day because you are thinking long-term?

It doens't have answers yet, but I am really curious what it will come up with.

** I'm not very experienced in superhero genre, but this webcomic is on the level of Metropolitan Man while being pretty long (and ongoing, but it may not be advantageous for some).

***** Oh boy, I don't know if I could do it justice.

/Worm/ is a rational superhero web serial. It was written by [[/u/wildbow]], and just finished a few months ago. It was recommended by Eliezer Yudkowsky (the author of HPMOR), which is how a lot of people in this community first found it.

The main character is a girl named Taylor who has the ability to control bugs, and how she rationally uses her power in the setting, which features a rational take on superpowers (which are actually explained by the end, so not just deus ex). And all the superheroes (and villains) use their powers rationally and have very clear motivations. Its subtitle is "Doing the wrong things for the right reasons."

Easily one of the best free pieces of web fiction I've read, and that kinda says something. Highly recommended by basically everyone.

Except me. I consider it irrational and totally implausible.

***** Someone on tumblr wrote this about it:

#+begin_quote
  Worm is intense. It is like looking into the sun, if the sun, if the sun was made of Cerberus Syndrome instead of plasma.

  It is a story that you have to take breaks from, because the emotional experience is too taxing.

  It is a story that absolutely refuses anyone a good time. It has major character deaths with believable consequences, post traumatic stress for everyone and their dog, an apocalyptic society, and denies anyone emotional closure.

  It is heartbreaking. It is the most amazing piece of fiction I have read to date. It is a never ending stream of disasters, interspersed with waiting for the other shoe to drop.

  I drips with unease. Every problem is solved by a liberal application of intelligence. Every impassable obstacle is circumvented by sacrificing a little humanity.

  Every fanfic I have read has been one wherein the characters can be happy, get a breather, and fall in love. Simply because canon studiously denies them simple pleasures of security, humanity and justice.

  Read it. You'll be thankful.
#+end_quote

I'm currently a little over halfway through and I don't quite agree with that endorsement, but it is a good piece of fiction that has made me think and laugh and be tense.

Also, I love the portrayal of Kid Win. (Despite that cheesy name.)

** I've been reading this +since before it was cool+ for a while now. About two weeks ago, it suddenly stopped rendering in Firefox -- the image just doesn't appear. I can read it fine in Chrome or Safari, though. I've emailed the author about the issue with no response.

Does anyone else have this issue?

*** On the contrary, it would be more accurate to describe it as a deconstruction of the Mary Sue, showing that being one isn't much of an advantage when your goal is utopia.

*** It really isn't a mary-sue. The entire story is about how little conventional superheroes can actually do to help the world. If you don't think it has any rational elements I'll give you an example: [[#s][Spoiler]] I highly recommend the story.

*** Supervillain claims to reform and makes friends with the ex-superhero main character; despite being a Large Brick, her powers are basically never relevant to the actual challenges she faces except in flashbacks. Primarily deals with 'how would superheroes affect the world, and what would it take to change it in a real way?'

People talk about a rationalist story with a main character who isn't very rational. This is pretty much exactly that.
