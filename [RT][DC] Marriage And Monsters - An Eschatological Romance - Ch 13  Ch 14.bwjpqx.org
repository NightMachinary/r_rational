** Thank you for the story, I'm really enjoying it!

I like the narrative shenanigans similar to the Practical Guide and look forward to reading what you will come up with!

** I'm enjoying the story so far. The worldbuilding is nice and the characters feel 3-dimensional. Looking forward to see where this is going.

I am wondering about the title. Haven't seen any eschatology in the series yet.

*** Eschatology means "the part of theology concerned with death, judgment, and the final destiny of the soul and of humankind." I think the relevance to an apocalyptic story is pretty clear...

**** What makes this story more eschatological than any other apocalyptic story? There's nothing in this story about judgement or souls and their final destination. Admittedly there's lots of death, but I don't think just killing lots of people makes your story eschatological.

*** My interpretation was that it was about the future godlike power of Haley.

** Can someone give me a summary of what to expect from this? I've liked roughly 50% of the things I've seen posted to this subreddit, and I'm hoping to avoid wasting a couple hours before deciding it isn't my cup of tea.

*** The back-of-the-cover summary is: A healthy marriage is an ongoing conversation. So what happens when one partner is speaking English and the other is speaking the Celestial Language of Creation? Also the world seems to be ending, so maybe that should be a priority. Civilization is collapsing, magic and horror are rising, and suddenly all those lazy day conversations about heroism and fantasy are becoming very, very real. Can Sean and Haley's oddball partnership save the day? Can it even survive?
