Pro: Has elements of HPMOR and Ender's Game. Prodigy MC who has been trained in the scientific method which puts him leagues ahead of his peers. Tactical genius who reluctantly enrolls in a military academy and beats the senior students in training exercises. Stunning landscape art.

Con: Jarringly sexist in the way young women are depicted. MC is a creep who borderline sexually harasses women


** I liked the story, but there were two things that really grated at me.

First, the use of kids in the military. This is a Japanese story, so it would be odd if the main characters /weren't/ kids, but even so... I get that there's a bunch of cultural differences at play here, but it still comes across as wrong. There's the obvious (and most important) problem of having child soldiers, but there's also this weird disjoint when you see a teen ordering around adults.

Second relates to your cons - the way women (or in this case girls) are portrayed. This is a pet peeve of mine, but it seems Japanese authors don't realize women in fantasy settings can wear pants. Like, they're going to war, they pack all their gear and get everything ready...and the female lead is wearing a miniskirt and stockings.

(I don't remember the MC sexually harassing anyone, but I might have just blanked that out. I wouldn't be surprised given how common it is in Japanese art/media.)

Like I said, the story itself is good, so if you can look past these things you'd enjoy it. It has quite a few tropes that are common in Japanese stories, but for the most part I'd agree it is rational.

I mean, I haven't watched this show but it sounds like the typical stock LN adaptation. Thing is, a lot of these start pretty much with the express purpose of being wish fulfillment power fantasies for a certain demographic, and very little beyond that in terms of ambition. There's a few exceptions (such as Tanya the Evil being more of a satire - though it can still be read as a power fantasy if you're kind of ignoring its subtext), but in general, the miniskirt part is simply for the purposes of fanservice. Because regardless of the world of the story, its /purpose/ is to please/arouse male readers, and so they'll end up having miniskirts. Which obviously runs right counter any concept of "rationality" in the story itself.

*** I've only read the light novel translation, but agree with you both. A large numbers of elements are very stereotypically "anime" in character archetypes, plot beats, and the setting in such a way that detracts from the experience. While I did overall enjoy reading it, some additional areas of concern are in the character interaction, which can seem rather surreal the way it goes while the characters are in a warzone. The variety and soundness of the MC's strategy can very from realistically impressive to feeling like deus ex machina. The MC can be both likeable but also quite irritating on times. The views on sexuality go all over the place from quasi-progressive views to full on typical sexism. Politics seem to lack nuance and I also have objections to the way it portrays science.

I'm left feeling profoundly mixed. There are a lot of parts I enjoy, but serious issues as well.

I think a fanfic writer could do quite a bit with the setting, characters, and overarching plot, if they made some changes.

This brings to mind another fairly similar series, both available on Skythewood translations, Altina the Sword Princess which has a similar list of issues and strengths, but also interesting depictions of tactics and some fairly solid fight scenes.

When it comes to anime war stories, albeit less tactics focused, an anime I like quite a bit is called Flag. Pause and Select did a good [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW75SnALjEc][video]] on it. I'm not sure where you can find it anymore, though.

One final series I like, is the first volume of a series called 86. It's quite powerfully written as a stand alone piece, but I feel that the sequels are not nearly as strong. While it is also "anime" feeling (teenagers in mechs, sent to die, etc.) much of it feels more maturely done than anything other than Flag. I really enjoyed reading it.

**** I've only watched a few episodes of the anime and I pretty much agree entirely. I have to say I didn't find the MC likable at all. He acts arrogant, but the show tries to convince you that it's just an act and he's actually wise. It doesn't really work and I just found him more irritating. I also didn't like the female lead either. I can't really explain why this annoyed me so much, but there's a scene where she solos a platoon of soldiers and I hated it. I think it's mostly because how the MC comforts the female lead after that scene. It just felt so nauseatingly fake.

I enjoyed Altina the Sword Princess considerably more, although I got bored of it after a few volumes. It has similar flaws but the story is lighter in tone, the characters are more likeable, and the humor is less cringy. The worldbuilding is less ambitious, but more believable and logically consistent.

I'm trying to find stories where the main character is an underdog tactical genius, but I've haven't had a lot of luck. Probably the best ones I've read are the How to Train Your Dragon books (very different from the movies btw), but that's aimed at elementary schoolers. 86 sounds interesting though, I'll check it out.

***** I also think Altina got dropped without being completed in favor of the author's other series, which I find to be pretty much the worse kind of isekai slave trash.

Please let me know what you think of 86. [[https://www.novelupdates.com/series/86/][Here's]] a page about it. The pages can be accessed via the wayback machine. It doesn't really count as rational IMHO, but it's a good read. Also, from what I've read, apparently things pick up again around volume 4, but YMMV.

Finally, another interesting rational-adjacent light novel, but not tactics focused, is May Your Soul rest in Magdala, by the author of Spice and Wolf, but this time about early alchemy that seems to be transitioning to chemistry. It can be found [[https://www.novelupdates.com/series/may-your-soul-rest-in-magdala/][here]]. This too has its flaws, but feels very unique. In addition to the fact that some of the alchemy experiments are things that I have really done in my college chemistry class another thing that I like about it is that the mc is flawed and the story acknowledges this as they slowly grow over time. I think it is well done.

*** I concur. I find myself constantly off-balance when I watch anime. The characters /look/ like they are underage but at least in this story the main characters (except the princess) are said to be 18. It makes me uncomfortable but I can look past that if the rest of the story is good as is the case here.

But it also rules out watching it with my family, because I don't want to normalize portraying girls in this manner. Which is a pity because the tactical stuff is cool

*** "This is a pet peeve of mine, but it seems Japanese authors don't realize women in fantasy settings can wear pants."

For an antidote to this, try watching Seirei no Moribito. It's a rather well told fantasy, with a strong female protagonist, in her 30s, who wears pants, and some of the side characters even use the scientific method.

** Seconding. The protagonist is like a more frivolous version of Yang Wen-li (LoGH). The show diminishes its potential gravitas by embracing some too-anime-esque ideas, but it manages to find some depth about halfway into it. A minor masterpiece with a focus on the ability to survive, and on what it means to be a leader who deserves respect rather than has it given to him by rank or by violence. I'd say its characterized by a low-key idealism about the latter.

This is the second time I've seen a casually stated disapproval of how women are depicted in a work on this sub and felt both the desire to respond and hesitance to get involved in the argument, in part just to avoid stirring up trouble. I'll just surmise that I can't be alone in this feeling, and say that the heroine was an excellent character. Though, again, it does have some of the usual anime cringe, so I wouldn't necessarily watch it in front of family.

Btw this terminology has also spawned discussion on LW:

** *THANK YOU!*

I can't believe it, there is actually a pseudo-almost-as-rationale anime that I didn't watch already?

I thought I've already watched them all.

Do you have any other recommendatinos like this?

BTW, Can you recommend good ones?

**** There isn't any really rational anime, but there are certain ones that I enjoyed.

​

Code Geass, Death Note,

Mirai Nikki, Psycho pass,

Attack on Titan, kabaneri

maybe Steins gate

maybe Danganronpa all versions

maybe Guilty Crown,

almost all animes have their silly elements but they could be kinda partially rationalized if you try hard enough
