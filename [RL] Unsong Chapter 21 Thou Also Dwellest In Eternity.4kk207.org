** Is Scott finding all this kaballah stuff himself? That comparison between San Francisco and Jerusalem is crazy. Is there some kind of kabbalist wiki where you can look that stuff up? Did he put tons of research into this? Is he making some of it up?

*** Some of the similarities are causal rather than coincidental; the Golden Gate Strait, which the Golden Gate Bridge is named after, got its name because John Fremont was making a reference to the Golden Gate of Constantinople, which in turn was named by Constantine, who was Christian and presumably knew about the Golden Gate of Jerusalem (especially given the symbolism).

I'm fairly certain that Scott is just putting in a bunch of work though, and hiding all the comparisons that don't pan out, which makes it more impressive.

I mean, for all we know, Unsong is his manifesto, and he just has enough self-awareness to market it as fiction.

Most of it is coincidence.

**** So, um, literally the first result on Google, if you search for "Thamiel," gets you this:

#+begin_quote
  Thaumiel (twins of God) is the name of one of the Qliphoth in the Kabbalah, the shadow side of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. It is the shadow of the Sephirah Keter (the crown). While Keter is concerned with the unity of God, Thaumiel represents the dual contending forces, struggling, and it is represented by /two giant heads/ with bat-like wings.
#+end_quote

Well, okay, his heads aren't giant, but he's still got two of them. Also, that other stuff's been mentioned, I'm pretty sure.

But just in case it wasn't, the article also says this, point blank:

#+begin_quote
  The ruler of Thaumiel is Satan.

***** Isn't that a bit different though? I mean, if I'm reading this right, Thamiel is either a class of angel or class of existence rather than a singular angel. And Satan is the ruler of these angels, rather than literally a being called Thamiel. It's like a place or categorization scheme rather than a person.

****** Thaumiel is the personified form of the duality of God and the Sephirot. Whether Thaumiel is a person or a place doesn't really matter, just as God is both a person and a spirit. In fact, Thaumiel is both a person (one with two heads and bat-like wings) and a place (which Satan rules).

Anyways, Thamiel isn't Satan. Thamiel is Thaumiel. Sataniel is Satan.

******* I think that they're sharing the role. Sataniel has some of the characteristics of Satan or the Devil (e.g. led a third of the host of heaven in rebellion), but so does Thamiel (e.g. ruling Hell, actually being called "the Devil").

****** Rereading them, I can see how the text is more ambiguous than I remembered, but there's [[http://unsongbook.com/chapter-6-till-we-have-built-jerusalem/][this passage in chapter six]], which I interpreted to mean that Thamiel is more than just a type of angel, and what we see as Thamiel is just the incarnation of something that is far bigger:

#+begin_quote
  I remembered reading something about how Thamiel was a facet of God and couldn't actually be killed
#+end_quote

Also, when Uriel is telling Sohu why he can't kill Thamiel, he explains that even if he /did/ do so, Thamiel would still be able to interfere (in some way that dead angels, it seems, cannot).

Like I said, though, this is less clear cut than I recalled.

******* Sataniel said Thamiel was a new aspect of God that he discovered in the center of the Earth. Back before Uriel made the Universe run on Math, things that we now think of as metaphors were actual people, so it makes sense that "the duality of God" would have a physical incarnation.

**** This is very much /not/ the conflict between truth and beauty that the comments section portrays it as, though. At least within the context of the world of Unsong, it's a conflict between awareness of a bigger-picture truth/beauty and awareness of the present, local situation - the latter of which is directly epistemologically inferior, as the former isn't /unaware/ of the present, local situation, it just realizes its true irrelevance.

The Right Hand Of God isn't ignorance, as the comments suggest; it's the opposite, awareness. And the Left Hand Of God (Thamiel) isn't truth, either: it's a lie.

  Random guess at an an important theme: blissful ignorance vs. bitter truth, as seen with angels and Ana, perhaps reflecting Raikoth's truth/beauty dyad.

  It seems (almost) like the moral equivalent of just putting them on opium for the rest of their lives, which we could do now but don't really.
