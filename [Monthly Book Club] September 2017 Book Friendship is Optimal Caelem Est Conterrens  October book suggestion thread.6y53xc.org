** THIS MONTH:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: this-month
   :END:
We're reading [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/69770/friendship-is-optimal-caelum-est-conterrens][Friendship Is Optimal: Caelum Est Conterrens]]! It's as far as I know the only MLP fanfic that boasts the tagline "As Horrified Eliezer Yudkowsky!".

This is a recursive fanfic that is based on [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal][Friendship is Optimal]] (39k words), but you don't need to read Friendship is Optimal to read Caelem Est Conterrens, and if you only have time to read one, I would say you should read Caelem Est Conterrens. CEC is a wonderful story - a likeable and relatable protagonist who is a regular person. She starts playing the My Little Pony MMORPG and eventually becomes addicted. This story ultimately touches on transhumanism, the AI singularity, and most hauntingly of all the concept of identity. If you have any interest in AI and the Singularity, or in that old "do transporters kill you?" chestnut, and you are scared of reading something with ponies, I implore you: you may find you love this story.

You can find it online for free at [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/69770/friendship-is-optimal-caelum-est-conterrens][fimfiction.net]] which I find extremely readable on my phone. It's 57k words so should be quite manageable in the next 10 days for most people. If anyone has an epub link or anything feel free to post it in the comments.

Firstly: I am not sure when the book for the following month should be selected and how that could be handled. It could be part of e.g. a regular weekly thread, or part of the recommendation thread from the 1st of the month. But I suppose we'll see.

The books each month will be chosen by a complicated subjective process entirely at my whim until such time as someone comes up with good selection criteria (in particular I would like variety in setting, theme, published-ness and genre so that way if something is not your cup of tea one month it might be someone else's next month). So, in your October suggestions, try and avoid fanfiction, sci-fi, AI and transhumanism.

Please suggest books here. We are looking at probably something in the 50,000 word - 200,000 word range (feel free to critique this) that is available free online or on Kindle (free or paid).

** *Title*: Cordyceps by Benedict_SC

*Ebook cost*: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868][free on ao3]] (the Download button is at the right side of the page)

*Word count*: 64k

*Genre*: Sci-fi, Irrationalfic

*Synopsis*: An unnamed main character wakes up with amnesia, in a strange hospital they do not recognise. As they attempt to figure out how they got there, the mystery they face soon becomes far stranger than expected.

*Why [[/r/rational][r/rational]] would like it*: On a first glance, it conforms to the rules of rationalfic; characters take their time to figure things out and act according to their motivations to solve a mystery placed in a world with coherent rules. In some ways, it's also a clever whodunnit; an astute reader will figure out what is happening before the characters do.

That is what the work looks like on the surface, but soon enough, it becomes obvious that the work is an /irrational/fic, in which rational thought is not the optimal route. I found this to be very interesting and would love to discuss both this work and the genre in general with this sub.

Also, the work is of course well-written.

*** Your review definitely drew my interest, and it seems like this story would prompt a lot of discussion; however, since this work in particular stands in contrast to normal rationalfics, I think we should establish a "baseline" by examining other works first.

***** Well, I think /Three-Body Problem/ is "standard" fiction (in that it doesn't attempt to be particularly rational or irrational), which we could then view through the lens of rationality; whereas it sounds like /Cordyceps/ starts as rational, but then specifically tries to *subvert* rationality as the optimal approach.

But generally I'd agree, that at least the first 2-3 works examined should be clearly rational or rationalist fiction. That gives us our "baseline", so when we start branching out into less rational works, we have a proper lens of rationality to view them through (in what ways is this work rational? in what ways isn't it? what would a more rational character do in this scenario? is the story overall helped or hindered by being less rational? etc). In that way, /3BP/ probably isn't a great choice for the next story either.

--------------

*Title:* /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/ by Eliezer Yudkowsky

*Availability:* [[http://www.hpmor.com][Free]]

*Word count:* 662k

*Genre:* Adventure, Drama, Humor

*Synopsis:* Harry Potter's aunt married an Oxford professor instead of some schmuck, and Harry was raised in an environment of books, science and rationality, instead of in a cupboard. When the Wizarding World, in a fit of extremely poor decision-making, reveals itself to him, he is gleeful: magic allows him to accelerate his plans for World +Domination+ Optimization by quite a lot!

*Why [[/r/rational]] would like it:* Explicitly written as a rational fanfiction, it checks off all boxes, deconstructing /Harry Potter/'s entire story, upping the intelligence of not only Harry but all characters, weaving an intricate web of plots, and preaching the wisdom of Big Yud (instead of Big Resh's).

*Content warnings:* discussion of rape and torture, involvement of happiness-sucking literally evil entities, psychological and emotional manipulations, politics, bullying, heartbreaks, The Fourth Wall Will Not Protect You-heartbreaks, character death, dismemberment, mass murder, blasphemy, discussion and explicit depiction of moral and philosophical dilemmas, dreams of necromancy, gross violation of the laws of physics, existential horror, cosmic horror, social horror, pranks, snarks, mindrape, spiders (probably).

(EDIT: Hijacking my own top post to say the below book will not be selected, it was just an example, and that upvotes will only be a minor consideration in the choice of book, which will otherwise be done entirely based on my own personal whim)

*Title*: The Three Body Problem by Liu Cixin

*Ebook cost:* $5.33 USD

*Word count:* 128k

*Genre*: Sci-fi

*Synopsis*: 1967: Ye Wenjie witnesses Red Guards beat her father to death during China's Cultural Revolution. This singular event will shape not only the rest of her life but also the future of mankind.

Four decades later, Beijing police ask nanotech engineer Wang Miao to infiltrate a secretive cabal of scientists after a spate of inexplicable suicides. Wang's investigation will lead him to a mysterious online game and immerse him in a virtual world ruled by the intractable and unpredicatable interaction of its three suns.

This is the Three-Body Problem and it is the key to everything: the key to the scientists' deaths, the key to a conspiracy that spans light-years and the key to the extinction-level threat humanity now faces.

*Why [[/r/rational]] would like it*: It's a hugely acclaimed sci-fi novel that is the first of a trilogy. It was originally written in Chinese by a Chinese author and has a lot of content that is related to that, the cultural revolution, etc. The translator's notes in my edition provided a lot of interesting context. Added to that, it's a science fiction story that has a lot of mystery. I wasn't reading it through a rational lens when I read it the first time, but it seemed really well-grounded.

*Any content warnings*: Some violence in parts, but nothing too graphic

*Genre:* Mystery

*Synopsis:* A group of vanity publishers, increasingly exasperated by absurd conspiracy theories they're presented with on a daily basis, decide to entertain themselves by inventing a conspiracy theory to end all conspiracy theories. Events go downhill from here.

*Why [[/r/rational]] would like it:* This book could be considered a self-aware commentary on conspiracy theories, and deconstruction of conspiracy fiction. By its very nature, it shows a pretty rational approach to its themes.

One may also find it reminiscent of /Unsong/ (or vice versa): it's full of clever wordplay and references to obscure occult topics, combining that with several surprisingly modern ideas.

** *Title*: The Martian by Andy Weir

*Ebook cost:* $9.99 USD

*Word count*: 120k

*Genre:* Sci-fi

*Synopsis:* Astronaut Mark Watney gets left behind on Mars because of a freak dust storm, and must use nothing but his wits, knowledge of botany and engineering, and the limited resources he has available to him in order to survive long enough to return home. Features a movie adaptation directed by Ridley Scott and starring Matt Damon.

*Why [[/r/rational]] would like it:* It was originally written as a web serial, and is one of the most grounded and realistic mainstream science-fiction books ever written. My only worry in recommending it here is that most people on this sub will have already read it---it's a perfect fit otherwise. Also, I think following it up with a discussion of the movie would be interesting, as it's one of the few pieces of real rational fiction that has a movie adaptation (only other one I can name now is Arrival).

In any event we'll see how much of a hit these threads are. Ultimately six months from now I'd love to be discovering new novels that I wouldn't have thought to read or have been meaning to read but didn't (e.g. I've been meaning to read A Mote in God's Eye forever), but if people only end up discussing books they'd already read - so months with Ender's Game and The Martian get good play, and The Three Body Problem gets crickets - then that might say we'd be better off doing a weekly "discussion series" where each week we select a new book that is considered "required rationalist reading" that most people "should" already have read. We'd publish the list a month out so people can "catch up" and read what they haven't already read in time for the discussion. So that could work, as an alternative?

There should be a bot that responds to that phrase with book recommendations, but there isn't, so let me take its role.

Based on you recommending The Martian, you seem to like hard sci-fi with an emphasis on clearly illustrated thought processes. Off the top of my head, you might like:

Peter Watts - Blindsight. Featuring both some extremely alien aliens and a species of Vampires who are human-like, yet mentally quite different, this book excels as hard, yet colourful sci-fi. In the afterword, the author cites over a hundred papers to substantiate the technologies and alien biologies he speculates about.

Greg Egan - Reasons to be Cheerful. A meditation on what it means to be happy, enabled by some interesting innovations in medical technology.

Vernor Vinge - A Fire Upon the Deep. Less hard scifi, but with some very interesting thought processes, as a race of aliens is introduced whose minds are conglomerates formed by a group of individual bodies. The exact combination of those bodies changes how the individual mind works, which has some interesting effects on individuals.

EDIT: How could I forget Crystal Society? It features an artificial intelligence whose mind is occupied by several different personality threads. They use a betting market to figure out what the body should do.

That said, this won't run on upvotes, since I think those would bias in favour of people voting books they've already read. It's purely on my own personal criterea - and I will try not to let upvotes influence the selection (though in practise it isn't possible to remove their influence on my subconscious since I'm sadly not a robot or anything).

So I'm not sure if it's as important?

Also given the volume of suggestions, I think it might be best to only take them every three months or so? (Or just leave the thread open for the six months you can still comment to it, and provide a link in each month's bookclub thread - that's probably the best way)

But yeah, Contest Mode is mostly just a deterrent for making sure people who casually look at the first 3 or 5 out of 50 entries don't bias the vote in favor of either newest posts or posts that are already getting upvoted, probably not as important if it's your own personal thing where you're planning on looking at every suggestion.

** I don't think book clubs should cycle through books on a strictly monthly basis. Not all works are the same length. We should agree on a word count per week rate and use that to calculate how many weeks to give to the selected work.

*** That's a good idea, but not all words are created equal. Using two examples that were suggested in this thread, The Martian and Three Body Problem are about equal in word count, but the first time I read The Martian it took me about three days. Three Body Problem took about two or three weeks.

**** Good point. We can make adjustments for that on a work by work basis.

***** I think for now, I'll probably do a 3 or 4 month "pilot" with a new book each month, and then have a meta thread for people to give feedback to work out how to go forward.

I'd like the threads to be well-organised, you know? I've prepared some, for wont of a better word, "discussion points" to put in the FiO:CeC discussion thread that I'll be posting in the next few days, and I am not sure I'd (personally) be willing to do that more often than once a month. (This would be moot if I wasn't the sole czar though.)

** Title: Book of Matthew, King James Version Ebook cost: free Genre: Religious, Fantasy, Historical Second most popular book of the bible, I would like the rational community to begin to look at religious books and their history, monthly, perhaps as an extra side project? There is culture value, and empathy value, and if allows us to discuss in a safe space without too many objections. What I would like is to get peoples opinion of the book without having the book interpreted to them. Maybe a bad idea. I would also be interested in doing this with other religions more notable scriptures.
