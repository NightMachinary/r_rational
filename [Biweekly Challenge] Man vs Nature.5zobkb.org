[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5wmkww/biweekly_challenge_games/][Last time,]] the prompt was "Games", and our winner was [[/u/viceroychobani]], with [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5wmkww/biweekly_challenge_games/denakqw/,%20The%20Galactic%20Games][their story]]. Go read it now!

This time the challenge will be *Types of Conflict: Man vs Nature*. The story should depict a person pitted against an animal or some other external force of nature. The most common type of Man vs Nature conflict is a natural disaster, though simply surviving in a hostile environment counts and some varieties of hunting stories do as well (so long as the thing being hunted isn't given human characteristics). Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, March 29th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-time
   :END:
Next time the challenge will be *Weirdtopia*. Your challenge, should you choose to accept it, is to write a story set in a world which defies sensibilities rather than confirming them in a positive or negative way like (most) utopias and dystopias do. [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/xm/building_weirdtopia/][See this article]] by Eliezer Yudkowsky. The weirder you go, the better, but remember that the world /also/ has to make sense. Prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 3/29.* Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5zofiv/challenge_companion_man_vs_nature/][here]].

Note: this takes place in the same world as a previous story I submitted for megastructures: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VetRhoNY0GCNxsMJrc5rkRK7v47durtMHPCduGw41WI/edit?usp=sharing][The Unending Land]]. I tried to make the story as independent as possible.
