** YES!

You've really elevated Mercedes Lackey's work here. Thanks for putting in the effort. I was a lit major and I could go on and on about the many ways in which I appreciate this series, but I need to actually read the chapter now!

** To anyone else who clicked this, saw that it took me to a 'chapter 1' of some fic, started reading, and felt fairly lost in a thousand references - this is part 6 of a series that [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13579596/chapters/31168950][starts here]].

Haven't read much yet so can't say how good it is, but this might avoid some confusion :P

*** Yes! There's a case it's /better/ without having read canon because lack of spoilers on certain events. You should start on part one, though: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13579596/chapters/31168950]]

** I love this series. I also love that the divergence is slow and that vanyel isn't a hpev clone in Valdemar.

*** I've gotten mixed responses on the slow divergence (some dislike from rationalists who've read canon, which is a pretty small subset of people), but I liked writing it that way! I loved Vanyel's character in canon and tried to write him pretty close to the original, though apparently I've ended up with enough differences that re-reading Magic's Promise for reference on book 5 was one of the most deeply uncanny-valley experiences I've ever had.
