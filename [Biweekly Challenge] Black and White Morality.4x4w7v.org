[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4uxg75/biweekly_challenge_superheroes/?sort=confidence][Last time,]] the prompt was "Superheros". The winner was [[/u/DocFuture]] with their story, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4uxg75/biweekly_challenge_superheroes/d633nu4][The Old Man]]. Go read it now! Congratulations to [[/u/DocFuture]]!

This time, we'll be doing [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality]["Black and White Morality"]]. Write a story about pure good and ultimate evil. You are entirely welcome to do a subversion of the prompt, so long as you're rotating around that theme. If you can write a recognizably rational story which is about unambiguous good and evil (in contravention of the sidebar rule), more power to you.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, August 24th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Next Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-time
   :END:
Next time, the challenge will be "Underground". The only requirement is that the story takes place mostly underground, whether it's in a cave, a bunker, a basement, or during a journey to the center of the earth. Suggestions for stories or settings to rationalize (if you prefer not writing purely original content); The Core, Wool, Journey to the Center of the Earth, Dante's Inferno, The City of Ember, or Faerun's Underdark.

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 8/24.* Please private message me with any questions or comments, as the beloved meta thread is now archived. The companion thread [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4x4yyq/challenge_companion_black_and_white_morality/][is available here.]]

*** What does your flair mean? I can't figure it out. Is it something to do with construction? Videogame cheats? Or is it some sort of joke about anagram stoichiometry from "The Study of Anglophysics"? Or is it just a nonsense sentence designed to look like it means something so that people will wonder what it means? Sorry if this is a bit off topic but I really really want to know.

**** No problem. It's a metaphor. It's easier to physically use a window like a door than it is to use a wall like a window (see through walls). Similarly, it is easier to go to places you can see than it is to see places invisible to you. Translating the flair would be "Turning the unknown into the known is harder than putting the known to use." Also my name is blasted0glass, feel free to imagine me breaking windows. Explosively.

***** Ideally yes, since breaking the window allows you to use the opening as both a window and a door. It's harder to use a window as a wall, after all. Except your username is blasted*0*glass, so wouldn't you be failing to break windows? :P

*** Depending on the limitations, this could work, given sufficient resources. For example, no one said they have to be live humans. Can't we set up some sort of corpse freezing and shipping process? Especially if these creatures aren't vulnerable to mundane diseases?

If they, for some reason, need freshly killed humans, then I think we'd have no choice but to exterminate them, assuming their energy costs aren't something really low like one human every year. We can't support their species.

It also makes no sense in a natural environment that they would only be able to eat humans, so there appear to be some supernatural/artificial shenanigans at work here. Perhaps hacking those is an option? If not, then yea. Genocide a go.

**** I'm glad that you mentioned it. In the inspiration (Touhou) it is supernatural shenanigans--but they don't rule out just eating corpses as far as I can tell, so it would probably be a non-issue there. For the story I wrote, might as well imagine that the humans have to be alive and neurologically intact for it to work. That preserves the difficulty of the problem.

Another possibility: volunteers. Maybe soon-to-die but generous people would donate themselves. The creatures might have something they could bargain with, too, to pay volunteers' next of kin.

***** With Gensokyo, there's tons of possibilities. They could eat fairies, who get better. The same goes for the characters that used the Hourai elixir. There's apparently some lady with a bag of legs that asks you if you want one. Instead of changing the subject and leaving like they're supposed to, people could be encouraged to take the legs, then give them to the youkai to eat. Eirin is a doctor from the moon, and I wouldn't be surprised if she could regrow human flesh. Sanae can perform miracles. Perhaps she could do her own version of Jesus's famous feeding a crowd. And last of all, they can just kill people. This is a world where reincarnation is confirmed. Humans get better too. It just takes longer than with fairies, and they have amnesia afterwards.

But I guess this takes place before they moved to Gensokyo.

****** All good possibilities. However, Touhou was merely the inspiration. This takes place in a different universe. Sakuya wouldn't need to hire a cook (she can take as much time to do the cooking as she wants after all).

Who has a bag of legs? I hadn't heard that, though that is my favorite [[http://smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&id=1765#comic][solution]] that you mentioned. Humans reincarnating makes a big difference too.

******* Did she say what position she was hiring him for? Maybe she was looking for a gate guard. You can't do that job with time paused.

The bag of legs was from Forbidden Scrollery. There's this story arc of a bunch of urban legends coming true, and that's one of them.

***** The amount of resources (both actual and moral) to make this feasible on either end seems too excessive to properly function. Again, unless their energy costs are very low. Even something like one human a week would get exorbitant.

*** Interesting.

I don't think that doing what you must in order to eat can be evil. It seems rather odd that some species must eat humans, with no possible substitute; but given that premise, I don't think it would be evil for them to do so.

That said, I still might try to stop them, not because I think that they're evil, but as a simple matter of self-defence. There would be a clear incompatibility between our species, such that even if we respect each other, we still can't peacefully coexist.

**** Thank you.

I think the same things. The incompatibility interests me most. I think that the creatures are in a precarious position. The death of the entirety of either species spells their ruin.

They aren't evil under my normal definition, but I think a different and reasonable definition could label them as evil. If 'evil' just means 'severely against my goals in a way I cannot compromise with,' the hypothetical creatures are evil. Even then, others may be willing to compromise.

Having to exterminate them would be a tragedy.

*** When thinking of morality, I like to divide judgement of the action and judgement of the person. It works wonders for actions with unintended consequences, where you can say that a misguided attempt at good that ends up doing evil makes the action evil but the person still remains good, but I think it can apply here too.

As expressed, it is possible that no one deserves to die, and thus killing anyone is an evil action. With this divide, it would not matter if the person killing wants the killing to happen or not, it is an evil action. But by the same token the action being evil does not make the person evil or good, since judgements on a person can only be based on their intentions.

If we can assume that our vampire does not want to kill people, then you could say that her intentions are not evil, since she does not want anyone to die for the sake of their death. With the divide, you could conclude to say that our vampire is a good person doing evil actions.

This is all snapshot-level judgement, though. It doesn't contain the decision of the most moral action based off of this knowledge. Under that perspective, the question is not 'is the vampire evil?' but 'does the vampire's life cause more evil than good?' Even if you can say that the vampire is not an evil person, the vampire is the cause of evil actions, possibly enough to say that the vampire's continued existence will cause more harm than good. In such a case, it would be regrettable to end the life of a good person like the vampire, but it would be the right thing to do, for the sake of her victims.

Anyways, that's just how I look at it, and there are a good deal of assumptions there, like the assumption that there is absolutely no way, now or ever, for the vampire to be allowed to survive without eating humans, and that the vampire truly does not desire the killing she is responsible for, and so on and so forth.
