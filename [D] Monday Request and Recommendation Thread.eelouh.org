Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki][take a look at the wiki]]?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

** I have finally tried Forty Millenniums of Cultivation and I really liked it. I am just in chapter 160 though so I haven't encountered much. But till now, I really like the concept and the main character (side characters haven't been really developed till now but I'm sure that they will in the future).

** I am looking for an apathetic protagonist and was wondering what would happen if you mix rationality with apathy.

/Can you be rational whilst being apathetic?/

/Will this character try at all costs to "cure" his apathy and would want to feel emotions? Or will he rationalize that it is quite impossible? Does he even want to feel emotions or create bonds with people/

If you know of any piece of fiction that explores apathy, do recommend.

Thanks :)

*** I'd recommend the anime Hyouka. It's the story of an apathetic teenage boy who's sole goal is to exert the least amount of "energy" and effort possible. His apathy/lust for laziness is only really affected when outside forces cause him to be convinced that doing work is easier than fighting the outside forces.

The anime falls under the slice of life/mystery genre. It's created by KyotoAni so the visuals are absolutely gorgeous.

*** [[http://neorice.com/hoh_noah_222][Hero Oh Hero]] is a comic about three protagonists in the same world: Burk, Noah, and Tobi. This link takes you to only exploring the Noah story, but the author does intend you to read [[http://neorice.com/hoh_1][all three perspectives.]]

Noah is a highly apathetic protagonist. His friends tell him to try. His superiors force him to try. His superpower encourages him to try. But he still only does the bare minimum.

The comic deals with social fallout from his apathy (as well as neurodivergent traits, probably aspergers and prosopagnosia)

This is an outside POV comic, so it doesn't narrate the character's thoughts, but we can still know his value system: wholesome but defeatist.

** I'd like to recommend something a little different: the books of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Smullyan][Raymond Smullyan]]. Wikipedia calls him a "American mathematician, magician, concert pianist, logician, Taoist, and philosopher," which sounds about right.

The two books I'd try out are [[http://www.cronksite.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/SmullyanGC.pdf][The Tao is Silent]] and [[https://archive.org/details/WhatIsTheNameOfThisBook/page/n1][What is the Name of This Book?]]. The former is a light but worthwhile take on eastern philosophy and specifically Taoism. The second is a book of riddles, mostly focused on logic games.

I'd also like to suggest that, if you have an interest or inclination, and if you're looking for something somewhat productive to do over the holiday, consider starting to learn programming. I know this is common advice these days, but I'd recommend starting out by exploring the space at your own pace than by making some big choice to learn it and get a job in the field. Programming is an amazing professional skill, but it's also a satisfying discipline suited to those who think logically and systematically but who also care about meaning and expression. Like writing and speaking, it's a flexible skill that can be applied in many professional and personal situations, and like speaking and writing, the things you do with programming tend to be able to scale. It can also be a lot of fun.

Python is an increasingly popular and highly readable language that is extensively used in both data science and creating apps for the web. Years ago I started out by working through a book, /Learn Python the Hard Way. I'd recommend buying */Learn Python 3 the Hard Way**, since Python 2 just got retired. After starting out with Python, I also got into Lisp and the Emacs text editor, but maybe I'll recommend those in more detail another week.

** League of Legends(LoL) have an interesting lore in that the planet that the whole setting revolves around was created by one divine group(Celestials) to produce living weapons to fight another divine group(Watchers). The planet features a slew of different cultures and magics in addition to bio-punk and magi-tech which suggests to me that the celestials are just trying a bunch of stuff and seeing what sticks. The Watchers seem to have no creativity to create new beings but are adept of analyzing and copying which creates an interesting arms race.

The main difference between the new lore and the old is that they've removed the concept of the games being a representation of a proxy war fought between various factions via the Institue of War. They've replaced that with the eternal war between the Celestials and the Watchers as the new overarching storyline.

****** The Watchers want to completrly annihilate all of reality and return to their eternal slumber in the Void. The Celestials would probably be satisfied with sealing all the Void breaches and ensuring the Watchers can never find a way back.

It's interesting how both sides are using each others' actions to gain a foothold in the conflict - the Watchers created the Voidborn by modifying Runeterran creatures and then champions like Kai'sa and Kassadin use Void energies to fight back. Those are probably the Celestial's best hope after the failure of the Darkin.

I do think that the Watcher motivation is a little flimsy. If they got woken up by a sudden window into Reality, why can't they just close the window and go back to sleep? Instead they continually poke holes into Reality. I feel you could strongman them in interesting ways like maybe they are morally opposed by the number of death in Reality or maybe Reality existing somehow is painful to them/threatens their lives.

One thing I liked was that it felt like /Harry Potter, but with consistent worldbuilding and intelligent, interesting characters/. (I actually liked both Ginny and Ron and found Harry/Ginny believable in them, which was a huge surprise.) Contrast with MoR, which for all its virtues is a crack fic. Are there other good fics in this vein? Enormous bonus points if someone has done this for any of Garth Nix's series.

To try to give more examples; Naruto fics. This is harder to articulate since I haven't read/watched most of canon, but Time Braid is pure crack, Waves Arisen is on the crackier end, and Chiaroscuro and Team Anko are on the opposite, "played straight" end.

*** Eh. I read the first two books of The Arithmancer (which cover the canon plot, there's apparently a third one now), and while it's entertaining it feels like it bends over backwards to have the same 'big picture' plot as canon.

I'd say the first book of the series is in general pretty good, even though Hermione is a bit Mary Sue-ish - but at least it's presented in an interesting fashion with the magical research and math stuff.

But the second book just falls apart halfway when the full war erupts. The characters hobble themselves in incredible ways to balance out the fact that Hermione is OP as fuck, and this leaves them acting in silly and unbelieveable ways. Like, Hermione builds up a ridiculous arsenal, they're on the run, and they still proceed to fight nonlethally against opponents going for the kill.

The book is also ridiculously prudish in a way that becomes plot relevant at one point - but maybe that's just hosting requirements on ff.net

***** The prudishness mostly struck me when Hermione was working on the ritual to remove Harry's horcrux. Harry and Ginny are at that point in a relationship for years, they've been on the run in the wilderness. It goes something like Hermione considering that she needs a reverse symbol to the killing elements of the horcrux ritual, mentions sex (as act of childmaking) in a roundabout fashion, then decides that even if it was correct it would be too big a price to ask of Ginny.

Later on Harry and Ginny are soullinked and are said to sleep together... only holding hands of course.

​

>Especially when most lethal magic has mental effects, and so even if yours doesn't, everyone will assume it does - which does in fact come up on one of the few times Hermione breaks out her lethal arsenal.

It never comes up in a relevant fashion. Especially at the point where the existing power structures are already lost anyway so any supposed reputational damage is irrelevant. They end up killing most of the recurring bad guys (like Bellatrix or that evil research guy) later anyway.

Also Hermione is personally involved in many actions that make no sense, like the warning of muggle-born wizard children. They know she's the only chance to solve their big problems, but she's still exposed in situations that any other muggleborn wizard could handle - much more safely and inconspicuously.

I guess what mainly struck me as the self-hobbling was that in what Hermione herself describes as a war, they take no action that would possibly improve their war situation until Hermione and others are on the run and she starts working on the unhorcruxing ritual. Why did that start so late? But they still get involved in a bunch of risky initiatives of dubious value, Hermione refuses to use any of her advantages to remove Death Eaters, they get in a bunch of fights and lose a bunch of people without even a prospect of achieving anything significant.

** Has anyone read the John Wayne Cleaver series, by Dan Wells? Not because it is particularly "rational", but precisely because it isn't---when I finished the second-to-last book, I was really sharply struck by something that a rational protagonist would never do, and that I thought was actually really /wrong/ and a bad idea. I have an idea of what might happen instead, but I've never written...anything really, fiction or non-, fan- or otherwise...so I can't write it myself. (More accurately, I don't care /nearly/ enough about seeing it written to do the years of necessary work to become skilled enough to do it justice.) So I thought I'd post the idea here, no strings attached, in case anyone wanted to take it and run with it. If this isn't the right place (would the Wednesday thread be better?), I can repost it somewhere else.

Massive spoilers follow, obviously:

So at the end of /Over Your Dead Body/, John goes to take Brooke back home so she can enter therapy. And like, yeah, she's in a bad state, and being on the road is not good for her, and John is not skilled enough to really take care of her. But despite all that, the first thing that went through my head is, "Marci is going to be /piiiiiiiiiiisssssed/ when she wakes up." And I kept waiting for that to come up all throughout the last book, and it just...didn't, and I was really disappointed.

Because the thing is, John /outright admits/ that Brooke going through therapy is probably going to /have as a goal/ the integration and/or suppression of the personalities from Nobody's memories, meaning that if it succeeds, Marci will be gone forever. John forces himself to believe that she's already dead, and the right thing to do is let go and move on---but I don't think so. Nobody's weird magic seems to have created pretty damn high-fidelity copies of all the people she inhabited over her life---high-fidelity enough that I would come down on the side of "getting rid of them without trying to see if there's a way to save them is more-or-less murder".

So the fic I'm imagining runs in parallel with /Nothing Left to Lose/, with /Marci/ (and secondarily Brooke/Nobody/etc.) as the protagonist. The opening scene is probably the aforementioned Marci-waking-up-and-being-pissed---the first time her personality comes to the fore back in Clayton, and she finds out what John did. And the thing is, based on evidence in the book, she's _smart_---as smart as John, just with different strengths. So the core point of divergence for the fic is that Marci is, while not a card-carrying transhumanist, familiar with some of those ideas---leading to my conclusion, above, that "curing" Brooke means killing morally-relevant entities, including herself. But of course none of the people around her agree, and she's not in any kind of state to make things happen the way she wants.

Obstacles:

- She's under involuntary psychiatric care by people who consider her presence a disease, and consider her mentally ill and not a valid source of information. (They don't realize/are unwilling to admit that "her" is the wrong pronoun---it should be plural-they, and while Brooke and Nobody legit are mentally ill, Marci is entirely stable as far as we know in canon.)

- Also, she's under constant observation, so "passing notes" to communicate with the other personalities without being seen isn't going to be possible, nor is keeping notes of thoughts/plans.

- Some of the other personalities don't share her views---Brooke could probably be persuaded around if it weren't driving /her/ insane, Nobody might go with it for the lulz but is also super unstable, and most of the other personalities are from a long time ago and just don't have the relevant ideas.

- She doesn't have control of their body all or even most of the time, or even when she wants to---though she /does/ seem to have the ability to hold onto control for longer than any of the others, and it's been hinted that she can be /given/ control if they're in a situation that one of the others is scared of.

- The FBI might be able to help in various ways, but they're pretty goddamn incompetent and resistant to listening to "kids" in the first four books, and now they're also pissed at John, and what Marci wants is going to look like something John might want too...

So, Arc 1 is finding a way to not have her psych doctors trying to "cure" Brooke in a conventional sense and actually /talk/ to her. She needs to, in some order:

- Find a clever way to communicate with the other personalities and get some of them on board. (I'd love to see the Regina personality again, the scene with her and John talking /about/ Marci was really powerful.)

- Gain a sympathetic ear among her treaters---probably unofficially at first, a new therapist or aide, someone not in charge, who says something that suggests they might listen and she goes for it and they do.

- Leverage that into some kind of in with the FBI and get them to lay things out more clearly to the doctors that this is /not/ conventional DID.

- Also get the FBI actually thinking about the implications of the Withered even being /possible/.

But at this point things still suck, because we still have a whole bunch of personalities at various levels of stability and completeness stuck in one body. Arc 2 is figuring out how to fix /that/, and here is where things get real hazy.

More or less the only thing that comes to mind is to wonder how the ritual that made the Withered works, because dude, if actual fucking magic is possible, there are some serious unexplored possibilities. Two problems, though:

1. The books clearly don't intend for it to make sense---the rules are explicitly super fuzzy and don't seem to be part of any larger system or structure---so coming up with a believable explanation is a lot of work.

2. That ritual in particular is pretty much a deal with the Devil and more or less guaranteed to screw over the caster---using it directly, while tempting, is extremely stupid.

But first, how do we get there? One possibility is that Marci /almost/ has the FBI convinced that they should be trying to find a way to save her/Regina/etc. when they get the call that they've cornered Rain (at the end of /Nothing Left to Lose/). They make the call that they have to put an end to this, Marci freaks out and almost despairs but decides to sneak along with them somehow (maybe the abovementioned sympathetic ear?)...and then the ending scene there happens, exactly as it does in canon, except that when Rain agrees to try to do better and John agrees to help her, Marci gets to walk in and be like, "actually, you might be able to fix some of what you did---not all, but the part where a few hundred women are stuck in my body anyway".

Or, it could be that Marci isn't far enough along to even know about the thing with Rain when it happens, but she finds out, I dunno, a few weeks to a couple months later and is like "holy shit they dodged a bullet there"---and when in canon the FBI agent just tells John that Brooke is doing well, instead she's /with/ him with more or less the same proposal as above.

In either case, maybe it would be best if the story just ended there, without exploring /how/ that's going to happen, because of the abovementioned issue of having to come up with the entire theory of magic. But I can also imagine being dissatisfied with that, because, well, unexplained thing, right?

I dunno, I think that's all I've got right now. If anybody cares enough to want to do something with it, I'd be happy to bounce ideas back and forth.

- doesn't pick a fight with /every/ enemy he sees and easily wins
- actually treats monsters like people, if they behave like people

I'm looking for a rational fantasy where the world is dangerous, and the protagonist can't roll through every encounter as if they're synced perfectly to his level. I want some real obstacles. And preferably, I want the world to have some depth, where monsters aren't always bloodthirsty and 100% evil.

**** "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" has a free website, so your money might be better spent elsewhere: [[https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter1/]]

Also if you have the mental muscle I'd recommend a more traditional computer science book, Automate is more vague about concepts and definitions than standard.

Edit: I got the Automate book and quickly realized that to follow along well you need to be on a computer at the same time anyway, so you might as well just split screen the book with your editor as opposed to having it open next to your keyboard.

Here's also some interesting interactive python lessons I've seen recommended but haven't tried out: [[https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-Jupyter-Notebooks]]
