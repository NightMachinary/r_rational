*** I think it's because most people are choosing to reply on the story site. Then again there aren't many posts on the site either.

Hmmm, my best guess is that the story is only starting and we haven't really gotten very far in terms of plot. I mean it's only chapter 11 and we still haven't left the town yet! Not that I'm complaining. I love the slow pace, but it could be a contributing factor to few comments; there's very little plot to comment on (but plenty of world-building!)

**** That's true. I actually kind of enjoy the leisurely pace and the world-building. What makes this story interesting is the fact that the main character is quite observant and introspective.

*** Wow, thank you!

Sometimes it amazes me what can be found in Reddit! The fact that [[/r/pocketsand]] existed would have never crossed my mind without your comment. Now that I know it does exist, it just seems right.
