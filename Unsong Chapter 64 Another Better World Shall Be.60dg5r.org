** Here's a thought.

In the first chapter, it was said that the longest Names were the most powerful and the HaMephorash would be the longest of them all.

What's the longest word in the English dictionary? "Smiles", because it has a mile between its first and last letters.

The process of incanting the HaMephorash was described as "A fearsome joy. A fervent wish."

And when you're joyful, you smile.

That's why "fervent joy" was an essential part of the True Explicit Name of God, because it was all a pun all along.

** To be honest... I kind of want Malia to win this. I've gotten that tired of Dylan's crap.

Also... really worried about the radio working. Ideally, it a question of so who is responsible, but worst case scenario, it might be another, or it might be Thamiel who want to be able to make announcements.

*** How many people do we know who:

- know celestial Kaballah
- studied under Uriel himself
- have messed with the workings of the world on accident a number of times
- is highly moral and feels comitted to the wellbeing of people

Just Sohu.

**** I don't understand what you mean. How are those four criteria (which do uniquely identify Sohu) line up with what we're seeing in the plot?

***** Scruiser in parent comment is worried about who restored radios. I believe Sohu to be uniquely able and thus responsible.

*** Prediction: Dylan fights bravely, starts to lose. In a last second placebomancy, he sacrifices himself to save his friends/the world/kill Malia Ngo, in the hopes of also being brought back to life Disney Death style.

** Okay, I don't get this. When you read a Name that you don't know about, isn't the first thing that happens "you gain an understanding of what that Name does, without triggering it"? That's how the whole plot started, after all. And yet, Dylan used a Word twice now to trick somebody into incinerating themselves.

*** My guess is it's only if you don't know what the word does, which everyone probably does, since it was used to assassinate Bush. Whether or not it's realistic that people who know the Name would read it without noticing is debatable, though.

**** I could see Bush reading it without understanding, but after that, every bodyguard around would probably have studied that as part of their training. Though on the other hand, I won't complain too much about an anonymous UN security guard momentarily forgetting that...

*** They probably know the name - it's the shortest and probably the most well-known one - but simply don't recognize it in time.

Alternately, the effect is only suspended if you're the first person to ever speak it - while the instinctive understanding/vision is something separate. Aaron "tasted the correspondences" of the moon-finding name and instinctively understood what it does without having to say it. Once he did say it, it worked the first time.
