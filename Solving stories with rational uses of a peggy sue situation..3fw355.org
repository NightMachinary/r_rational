Which fictions would, if trying to solve and not trying to write a fleshed out novel of similar length to source material, be reasonably easy to solve if the memories of the MC from the end of the series are transported to the MC at the start?


** Also interesting: Which ones wouldn't?

Solvable stories will typically involve specific bits of knowledge which render previous investigations unnecessary. The majority of murder mysteries, for example.

Unsolvable ones will involve either disastrously ignorant main characters, heavy slogs of unskippable work, or unlikely coincidences which become difficult to replicate.

To an extent Vonnegut's Timequake explores the ugliest aspects of a powerless Peggy Sue. Which other stories would involve the largest amount of semi-Sisyphean repetition?

***** Hard Reset 2 had some really rather complicated time physics that it spent several pages explaining and still left me with important unanswered questions. But it handled it well otherwise, it definitely demonstrates how the story stays interesting when the villain is looping.

There were a couple of clever scenes where Twilight made a plan and then saw that Chrysalis had already pre-empted it because it had worked in an earlier loop.

******* Sometimes Dumbledore wondered if he was doing the right thing.

It had taken, by his very rough estimate, approximately 37 attempts, 37 wild and dangerous and reckless and /unpredictable/ repetitions to find a reliable path that led to a certain room in the Department of Mysteries without Voldemort immediately concluding that he'd broken the Compact of Fate, and abandoning all restraint. One memorable time, he had had to wait for nearly a century for Voldemort to let down his guard and deploy his Inferi elsewhere.

37 times a decade of warfare had left his mind deeply scarred. Once he had found the stable path, it had taken him nearly another three loops to regain some amount of internal composure, and another five to fully research the rituals that would stabilize his mind and outward behavior for the millenia to come.

When all you have is a time loop...

Dumbledore had in fact heard of the chaos effect, and in the countless years behind him, he had seen ample evidence of it. The slightest permutation, the most minimal of touches sufficed to alter history. And one of these days... one of these decades, he'd find the words to say that made everything work, the words that would, if not avoid, then at the least minimize the casualties.

Dumbledore rose from his seat, and behind the kindly spectacles and gentle eyes, a counter that had been set in motion a long time ago ticked forward another step.

“Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! /Spring/!”

In fact, you might be bringing back his addiction and desire to keep the Ring, which would thwart the plan entirely. And as you suggest, the unlikely coincidence of Smeagol stealing Frodo's finger and falling into the lava at Mt Doom wouldn't be repeated. Frodo would ensure that Smeagol couldn't follow them.

Assuming that they get a head start this time around, the whole state of the world is going to be drastically different. Gollum would still be in his cave, Theoden would be in his early 50s and his son would be an infant. Denethor wouldn't be as crazy and Boromir would by in his prime.

They wouldn't run into Aragorn by chance at the Prancing Pony, and being called into the Fellowship specifically for his bloodline would drastically affect his relationship with the Hobbits at the start. Moria had already fallen by this point, so a quick note to Gandalf about the Balrog would probably convince them to get through the mountains by a different road - especially if Saruman could somehow be kept in the dark about the Ring's rediscovery.

****** I forgot entirely about the seventeen year gap. That would vanish, since I think it was for research and counsel with Saruman to determine that it was the One Ring. Their chances would be significantly raised by the time gained, but it would also be much harder to obtain a fellowship, since leaders of the various races wouldn't know that Sauron had returned.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3fw355/solving_stories_with_rational_uses_of_a_peggy_sue/ctsmzqg][As for Moria, that was necessary, unless you retcon the entire setting.]] Unless Saruman's betrayal could be prevented, Gandalf's fall would be necessary to restore an earnest leader of the Istari.

However, the gap could still be present. Frodo would probably avoid confirming it as the One Ring due to his ring-lust, and when Gandalf left he might even fall to it as Gollum did in the intervening years. Then they would be in an even worse situation.

There are many magic rings in Middle-Earth, and the One Ring had been lost for 2500 years. Saruman had told Gandalf that it had rolled down the Anduin River into the sea. Those seventeen years were to confirm the locations of the other Great Rings, the Rings of Power that Sauron had created, because only they could grant such longevity. Gandalf was no idiot. Before all of that, it was a cheap party trick, just as Bilbo used it.

** The first Matrix movie would be solved almost instantly, since the single big thing that happened was entirely internal to the protagonist's mind. All of the conflicts are almost instantly eliminated, until the next two movies roll around.

Almost all detective stories are about finding the evidence, so almost all of the conflicts just get solved through sheer foreknowledge. This includes pretty much every episode of Scooby-Doo.

Death Note, no matter which of the main two you consider the protagonist.

Works of fiction with second act betrayals are also a wide field ripe for instantly solved problems; if the bad guy is your traveling companion and not ridiculously overpowered, it should be easy to kill him (assuming the main character doesn't have ethical qualms with that).

*** Gandalf's fall in Moria was fated, or at least foreseen given that they passed through Moria. In addition to this, the sacrifice he made by dying was necessary to prove to Eru Iluvatar that he was worthy of being returned from death, stronger, as Gandalf the White. This moral test was planned by Eru Iluvatar so that the mission of the Istari would not fail, as Saruman, originally the White, had betrayed them. Without the sacrifice, everything would have been significantly more difficult, if not impossible, and the Istari would have completely failed. Changing things in Lord of the Rings is significantly harder than other stories, simply because its world is so vast and intricately designed.

*** Naruto would stomp, but I don't think it would be that easy for him...

Like, if Naruto tried asking for Kyuubi Chakra Mode that way, Kurama would think Naruto was tricking him and probably become totally uncooperative.

** Hm... The novel I'm writing, "S.I.", could be Peggy Sued if I were to pull an "and it was all a VR-like simulation" cliche. Even if the reset back to the story's start kept the rest of the universe the same, my protagonist wouldn't necessarily assume that... and given that her story has been something of a piqaresque travelogue, it's hard to say that she's going to have "solved" anything the first time around; so in her second go, she would probably still be something of a wanderer, looking for useful data, gear, and power-ups. Only now she has some Big Thing other than an impending Second Singularity to motivate her, she gets to try to puzzle out the Reset... and she's probably a little wiser, and a little less willing to jump into situations without preparation.

I could probably make a go of it, if I tried... Though I expect that by the time I finish the first go-round, I'd rather start a brand-new story instead. :)
