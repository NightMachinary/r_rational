** Hi there!

This is an old 'story' I wrote which was more of an extended thought experiment than an actual plotted story. You might notice how the 'power level' ramps up as the time travel hijinks get more and more complicated and more and more overpowered. In an actual superpowered time travel story, this doesn't make sense.

Of course, other than a slightly unsatisfying one-sided clash, we also don't see adversarial time loop logic. (and only hint at a hilariously bad application of an Outcome Pump-esque trick)

** It's not explicitly rational, but I think it's a good short story exploring the implications of having the power to time travel where the type of time travel is like Time Turners in Harry Potter.

** Interesting story, I will admit I got completely turned around and confused by some things but I think that's more due to my lack of familiarity with causal reasoning and time paradoxes and such than due to any particular flaw in the story.

Spoiler question: Did the unnamed, mind controlling man sexually assault Anne when he first encounters her? I ask because the story is rated K but that's a fairly dark thing to hint at, so I wasn't sure if I was misinterpreting him "reaching under her dress".

Also what age is the Anne we start off with? We know sixteen year old Anne is the one being mind controlled into setting off a nuclear war. And how exactly is she broken free of the mind control, to come back at age 24 and help save the world? I got soooo confused, won't even lie. Like I thought the movie /Predestination/ was confusing but that doesn't even hold a candle to this. Overall a good show tho, must admit.

*** I shan't answer the spoiler.

As to how she broke free of the mind control, her friend Cheryl has the ability to 'resurrect' people by reversing time on an object. This of course undoes everything, including death, mind control, memories, etc.

Anne was rewound all the way back to the point where her older self appeared in the police station.

EDIT: It wasn't ever presented in-depth, but the existence of a time reversal power allows an Anne-Cheryl combo to pull time loops of objects that never existed.

NOOOOOOOOOO T_T

But ok. So Anne didn't spend that long under mind control then? Also I asked how old she was at the start of the story because I got the vibe that she was like elementary school age, which doesn't line up with her sixteen year old self being mind controlled unless there were time skips I didn't notice.

***** The total Cheryl-time from learning time travel to the destruction of the missile base is maybe three months? I never plotted a timeline to that detail, but it's not a significant span of time.

How long she spent under mind-control was not given in the story. By Anne-time, it could be very long (although clearly not long enough to age her). By Cheryl-time, it was two weeks.

Doesn't matter once she was reset.

******* Let's call it sixteen since she's the same age as Cheryl. It's not really important.

** Neat!

Any inspiration from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_(role-playing_game)]] ? You use a lot of the same concepts pretty exactly, although you don't use any of the words, and Kaho's effects were pretty rad.

*** I never played or read Continuum although I was aware of it's existence.

TiLaR doesn't use the concept of frag and history preservation. In a sense, the time travel here is both more powerful and more restrictive than Continuum's.

Anne can't change history but she can constrain what happens into a limited set of possible futures arranged by her own time travel. This allows her to function like an oracle machine, which is the source of most of the crazy overpowered feats she performs (Butterfly Effect Genie is just the most obvious).

**** Yeah, TiLaR doesn't have frag, but you also don't have players in need of motivation to follow through on their yet ;)

TiLaR also reminds me a lot of musings friends and I had over the use of the tech behind the "T"s in the "Sufficiently Advanced" RPG.

Basically - Acausal information is as accurate as it is tested AND The less you understand the information from the future, the more you can trust it.

***** You can use full NCP with players. I did write a python tkinter game based off a similar premise.

[[http://forums.xkcd.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=111370]]

Of course, computers aren't oracle machines, so in this version of time travel, you don't just get to constrain possible futures, but also to choose which possible future comes true. Which is even more overpowered.

(in the game, any 'solution' that both solves the puzzle AND is consistent is considered valid)
