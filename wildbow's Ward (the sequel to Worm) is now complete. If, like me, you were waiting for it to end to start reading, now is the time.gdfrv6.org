**** Try starting at arc 19 or 20. Victoria gets her shit together and being inside her head is not as dreadful after her time in shardspace.

That review is not a fair review. It spends half its time on tangents, and half the remaining time on extraneous bs, such as worm having focused on a group of characters who survived scion and how the fact that the ward mc sometimes chooses to stick with familiar faces is somehow illogical or inherently makes the story bad.

90% of the "review" isn't even a review so much as filler but that's beside the point. Ward's problem is the same as Worm's problem: the fact that the MC has no way to affect the outcome of the ending except by being the puppet enacting Contessa's will. Or in other words the existence of a character whose superpower is "always win at everything as long as you're somewhat careful." The rest of both stories was just an in-depth case study of the internal monologues of trauma survivors and Taylor happens to have her shit together to a greater extent theoughout Worm than Victoria does in most of Ward. Where ward and worm differ is that Taylor loses her shit at the climax while Victoria collects her shit at the climax.

**** Same here -- struggled my way through the prologue PHO (?) chapters as they were being released, but continued to be super bored as the main story continued. Was waiting until completion to see if anything improved, but the Weekly Rec Thread's review has dissuaded me.

Are there any good fanfics of Ward out yet? I found myself liking lots of Worm fanfics more than I did the actual Worm, so maybe I can glean the canon resolution to older plot threads and character arcs through derivative works.

Alternatively, were there any must-read standalone Ward interludes?

I mean, this:

#+begin_quote
  People have various complaints about Worm [...]. But these problems are all small, petty, easy to work past to appreciate a well-told epic. They're nothing in comparison to the problems that define and pervade Ward. Ward's problems aren't subjective quibbles with how clearly some scene was written. They're basic errors in the writing process, [...] problems that have metastasized to the story's outline and style. The story is fundamentally and fractally half-baked.
#+end_quote

seems to me like the reviewer got way too attached to the original and saw something that wasn't really there?

I'm not going to do a point-by-point counter-review, because I think these get tedious and petty fast. But I really want to comment on the general approach. Parts like these:

#+begin_quote
  We hear it said explicitly that the apocalypse killed something like 90% of humans and something like 99% of parahumans. But the actual story certainly doesn't act like it; /the fucking apocalypse/ never stands in the way of bringing a character back from Worm.

  But somewhere early on, Ward got into its head that worldbuilding is masturbatory nonsense for rationalist nerds (which is a shame, because Wildbow excels at it when he's trying, which he usually is), so it dropped all of these threads; nothing was honestly examined or went anywhere. Instead, Ward concerns itself first and foremost with characterization. That's the defense that Ward's proponents generally give,

  An addict's house may be full of syringes, but that doesn't mean she's better at using them than a nurse. Ward spends much of its nearly two-million word (!) duration on highly introspective internal monologues and inane navel-contemplating small-talk between characters; after a point, it's just polishing something it's already completely worn away.

  and the podcast became something very different - much less meritorious, but still very popular, effectively a glorified recap podcast endlessly pumping out content each week just describing what happened last week. And it became a literal feedback loop - Wildbow hearing a constant drone of "you're great, you're perfect"

  because whiny fans treated tension and stakes as writing flaws and the writer was desperate to win their approval back just for a moment

There's something you probably don't take into account here: huge reserves of faith in the author after reading Worm. This was the sole reason why I didn't abandon Ward.

Ah yeah, I did this with WtC when I realized I wasn't enjoying it anymore, and even then I was left feeling so bitter it took a lot of willpower to not start ranting online about it.

It's hard to walk away from something that you had a lot of hopes for, specially if it's something that kind of proved itself to you or you thought had a good track record. I guess what I mean to say is that regardless of the sub we are in, we're still people, with all our flaws, and there is no button to instantly purge all biases and negative feelings and thoughts that might remain.

That guy's disrecommendation doesn't exist in some sort of fully rational and unbiased void, and neither do all of the echo-chambery praises that started being sung in the Parahumans sub after Wildbow made his self-deprecating comment last week. Both are equally valid, and I don't think being dismissive of the points being presented because either side has strong feelings about it serves the actual discussion.

Let's stay on topic and talk about Ward itself, and not about what an internet stranger's feelings are towards Ward's author.

I just wanted to point out that everything else, especially the post's analysis of Wildbow's intentions and his last post should be taken with a significant grain of salt.

On an unrelated note, I'm sorry to hear you don't like WtC, I still enjoy reading it (though not quite as much as in the beginning). What were your reasons for stopping?

Spoilers for WtC: It's been a few months now, so I might be a bit hazy on the details but I hated how Fenn's death was handled. I'll start with that because looking back it was sort of the turning point for me, I didn't have any complaints and I really enjoyed it up to that moment (even berated myself a bit mentally for not reading WtC sooner), but there was something about that whole event that felt so jarring and wrong. Like there was a lot of build up and a lot of time that went into setting up their relationship, and then they have a little fight and literally two chapters later she dies? And it's not just that, but her death barely seems to phase the MC at all, like there is a little arc of 'getting over it' and then they move on with their quest? The same quest that started with his friend's death? The one that influenced the whole fantasy world he is living in right now? The one he keeps having constant flashbacks to because of his regret and inability to move on? I wasn't a big fan of Fenn, and I didn't care THAT much for her, but it bothered me that her death didn't seem to matter as much as it should, like the author just disregarded one of the main themes he had been pushing for most of the fic and one of the biggest flaws of his own protagonist.

I sort of gave it a pass for that because I know WtC likes to get all meta and play around with tropes, so I stuck around to see if that would lead to some sort of subversion or anything interesting. I'm not sure when it happened, but I think it was a bit after the library arc (which imo was amazing) that I started to feel like the story wasn't hitting the same right spots that it had been hitting up to that point, it really felt like I was reading a fanfic of WtC rather than WtC itself. The pacing took a nosedive, unfunny references and memes started to crop up, the whole harem thing Fenn had pretty much undermined appeared again (which I somehow didn't enjoy in this story despite the fact harem, polyamory, and other unconventional forms of pairings are some of my biggest guilty pleasures), it also felt like a lot of characters lost depth and nuance and became cartoons of themselves. It was bizarre how the story as a whole seemed to tell you things, and then do others or have the complete opposite happen. I remember that scene where everyone gathers together and they resolve to not let themselves be manipulated by the narrative, taking the fight to the threats instead of letting them come to them, only for the MC to do anything but that so he could go to school, wtf? Then there was the cringy cannibal Shia Lebouf thing, Reimer appearing to deliver some exposition and then being written out, and then still magic.

One thing I enjoyed a lot about early WtC is that you could see, almost feel, the MC's progression, seeing him use what he learned or just anything he could to get by was cool and interesting. I think it's before the whole still magic incident happens that all of that is thrown away. There is this weird and unexplained power gap and suddenly he can do stuff he couldn't do before for no reason, and nothing bad he does seems to have any consequence. The narration keeps telling you that sacrificing a skill for a boost means MC will have a harder time training it back later, but that never seems to be the case and it never seems to matter. Still magic being introduced and then exploited means he doesn't even have to bother with that anymore, suddenly MC is OP and any semblance of 'midgame' or coherent power progression is entirely skipped. Oh, and don't forget about the unicorn bones he kept on using to save his life which he never used to save Fenn because...?

That was annoying, and many things I didn't mind before started to become increasingly annoying as well. I think at that point I sort of realized that there wasn't much of a 'world' planned out like I was led to believe and that every set piece and location existed as it was and there was little to no depth to it. The story tells you about a world that despite all of the chaos it has going on, it has a semblance of order that most of its inhabitants are used to by now. That's what you're told, but the truth is that things simply don't seem to exist until they're relevant, and once they're not relevant anymore they might as well stop existing. The dwarf city was a big example of that, it seemed to be such a big and important deal in earlier chapters, and then when they finally explore that part of the world it's just a cardboard cutout, and the same thing seemed to apply to everything else.

Things happen, scenes happen, and it really does feel like there is little thought and planning to them. Which this whole thing being based around a tabletop is to be expected to a point, but even then it's jarring, and everything feels fake.

I was bitter by the point the MC fights the infohazardous kaiju, none of the rules that had been established early seemed to matter anymore, there were no stakes because he had infinite revives thanks to the unicorn bones, and a lot of it felt like padding so we could get to the 'cool' scenes.

I stopped reading on the chapter when Bethel and Val leave. I can handle flawed protagonists, I prefer them way more than bland or self-insert ones, but the MC's morality and the inconsistency of it started to get on my nerves early on. Him turning on his friend over what he did to the sentient house, condemning him despite the fact that Arthur pretty much stopped the world from being a giant shithole several times, was disgusting, specially after how he pretty much forced Fenn to kill a lot of people so they could get to said house in the first place. And that's without mentioning all of the other people he turned his back on and died because of him.

I'm not one to get squeamish over violence, sex, or sexual violence, so I'm not one to get triggered over those topics (stuff like the fridge scene in Worm don't get much of a reaction out of me). But the whole rape thing in WtC and how it was handled sickened me, and to this day it's probably one of the most deplorable things I have read. Rape is a very serious thing for a lot of people, and whole it never affected me or anyone I know, to me it's still not something that should be treated lightly. The protagonist not taking consent as seriously as he should have, regretting the act, and then victimizing himself while taking a stance of moral superiority after the fact disgusted me and opened my eyes to what I was reading.

I was sold this story as an isekai with an interesting world and magic system that was also an exploration and subversion of common narrative tropes. I went into this expecting Mother of Learning but with some strange tabletop RPG spin on it. So why am I reading about the fantasy equivalent of a false rape allegation?

It wasn't what I wanted and what I enjoyed anymore, I wasn't getting 'anything' from it either, and I... I honestly didn't care about the characters anymore or what happened to them. So yeah, there is that, a very bitter feeling left. It's a real shame too because I was genuinely enjoying it, and then Fenn started acting OOC, died, and the fun survival adventure stopped being fun and reading became a chore that only kept making me even more annoyed and angry. I'm ashamed that it took me up to chapter 160 or so to realize that and finally drop it, maybe it got better, maybe it's even good and interesting now. But I don't care anymore, I moved on, I'm done with WtC.

Sorry for the rant.

********* *SPOILERS FOR WTC BELOW*

Don't be sorry at all, I understand the feeling of a loved fic going bad. You bring up a lot of interesting points that quite frankly, I would need to do a lot of rereading to be able to fully engaged you on, so maybe I will do that. I do agree that fenns development and abrupt conclusion were surprising in an off putting way, but I went back for a quick re read and there were subtle (admittedly, maybe TOO subtle) references showing how Fenn was really tried of being treated as comic relief and not being taken seriously.

I agree with you on bethel, I don't think she is a redeemable character (despite the fact that I am horrified at what happened to her) and I'm glad she doesn't really seem to be in the story anymore. As for Joon, the more I read about him the more I see him as not a hero or MC, but just a dude, one I might not necessarily like if I met but not necessarily one I would hate either. Just a flawed human being, who's trying and sometimes failing to be morally and logistically consistent. I think empathize with that, because i don't often like myself either.

Last, it's kinda funny you say the world is a cardboard cutout, because I thought that was the whole point, explicitly confirmed by the One True God. That miiight just be deliberate and not a failing on the authors part.

I'm sorry to hear that WtC disappointed you though. I hope you've found other isekai fics that you enjoy. I would recommend Patchwork Realms by eaglejarl if you want a really quirky isekai litrpg. The main character is a dog(yup, really) that lucks into an epic tier skill, and that's all I'm going to say, in case you want to read it. Good luck!

I see a lot of things like these in WtC, and I get it and appreciate it for what it is. But there is a mark that is missed, or some balance that is not quite met. But that could be on me, perhaps I can't stomach characters that are too flawed and don't show as much progress as I believe they should. Either that or something being unique and interesting isn't enough 'payoff' by itself and I need it to reach a certain level of narrative satisfaction. Something to introspect about I guess.

Yes, I contemplated this briefly during the part where the MC wondered what would have happened if he never met Amaryllis and instead saved that other girl at the beginning, if she would have turned into Amaryllis instead.

Context matters, you can't just nitpick one detail and make an entire assumption out of it. The point was that I didn't want to read about rape at all, that I had different expectations and reading about rape wasn't one of them.

Also, as far as I remember this isn't wrong either

The protagonist was raped, yes, but that doesn't take away that the way he handled it wasn't as serious as it should have been, that he was a jackass about it, and that everything he did afterwards was terrible. But that's his character, this is how Fenn's death was handled, or his murder in the library, or him causing a whole exclusion zone.

The rape was the point where I stopped at because I didn't want to read about that in the first place, I didn't enjoy such a serious topic being carelessly toyed with like that, and I simply couldn't stomach the story anymore.

I completely support not reading works you don't enjoy. If the story no longer gives you want you want out of it, it is definitely preferable to stop. If your comment was just about not wanting to read about rape or not liking the direction of the story I would not mind at all.

  Ward is the kind of story that gives a secondary character a dramatic, wonderfully-executed death at the hands of a fresh, fascinating, brilliant antagonist, but then the fans throw a collective bitchfit that pierces the heavens, because the character who died was a fan-favorite from Worm, so he brings the character back a few chapters later, literally doing what a facetious meme had suggested, reasoning that we hadn't seen the body, even though her death was from the perspective of an alien with local omniscience in charge of blowing her up. The bullshit-soap-opera-retcon-resurrected fan favorite then proceeds to kill the interesting new antagonist who had originally killed her, in order to secure cheap cathartic revenge on the fandom's behalf.

#+begin_quote
  This is an aside, but I blame a large part of Ward's disdain for worldbuilding (also known as "being set in a world that attempts to make sense") on Doof! Media. In the months running up to the start of Ward, a popular liveblog-type podcast called "We've Got Worm" sprung up and became extremely influential in the parts of the fandom closest to Wildbow; he even became a frequent listener and participant in the post-podcast discussions. It was well-produced and well-done all around, and in a very difficult-to-replicate way, it brought a fresh perspective and fascinating analysis to Worm. But the host responsible for much of this, Scott Daly, was very much of the mindset "well, I don't care about worldbuilding, because I'm not some fucking nerd, I'm here for all that other good stuff in writing, like character arcs". That's a valid lens for an individual reader to take in a project like that, but Wildbow wound up hearing a lot of Scott. I mean, the guys make a long professional podcast devoted entirely to relentlessly praising a particular artist; it's not a surprise that the artist would wind up hearing a lot of it. And then, when Ward started, the We've Got Worm guys moved onto Ward, and the podcast became something very different - much less meritorious, but still very popular, effectively a glorified recap podcast endlessly pumping out content each week just describing what happened last week. And it became a literal feedback loop - Wildbow hearing a constant drone of "you're great, you're perfect, I love this unconditionally, you're so good at characters, your shit is golden, but we don't care about worldbuilding, Wildbow, I love this, we don't care about worldbuilding at all, we're not fucking nerds, Wildbow, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter at all..."

In Ward, a post apocalyptic society apparently still pays money for spandex clad heroes and it makes no sense.

Additionally, the fights with powers were way too bloodless. At the end of Worm, Manton limits are generally eliminated. Reading the fights in Ward was like reading about two people getting into a chainsaw fight and having no blood.

Also, no one is willing to kill. Nursery's power is literally filling the room with Cronenberg babies and having them rape your face. She does this to Victoria and Victoria is super blase about it. Such a person would have a kill order on them after doing this dozens of times.

** (crossposting my review from the rec thread, since the other one is pretty over the top)

Ward is very good in a lot of ways, but still flawed. The characterization in Worm was great, yet Ward's is still much better. Ward's pacing problems are even worse than in Worm, but in new, more nuanced ways that make them even more aggravating. And the focus has changed significantly, which will leave a lot of fans behind.

If you enjoyed Worm for the clever interactions between simply drawn powers, you won't find any of that here; powers still behave in a consistent manner and interact properly, but none of them have simple explanations like "Controls bugs" or "Sensory deprivation smoke," and the details of power interactions matter a lot less when your main character has to solve most things by punching them. If you enjoyed it for epic monster fights and play by plays of combats, I can't tell you whether it's gotten any better, because I found it dull both times around (but I can at least tell you that the biggest monster to punch is smaller in Ward).

If you enjoyed Worm for parsing Taylor's self-oblivious and extremely biased point of view, you'll probably enjoy Victoria's shaky self-awareness and half-constructed attempts to be impartial even more, but if you didn't notice that part of Worm then you're going to be missing a huge chunk of this story. And as I mentioned before, the characterization really has grown, so if that's what you're here for, you'll have a good time - Breakthrough are much more believably real, traumatized people, especially compared to the Undersiders who mostly exist as one or two character traits drawn to a maximum. I was impressed the first time around when Wildbow would spend an interlude writing a convincing POV of a dog, but now his writing has the nuance to characterize as just much difference in thought process just by using people that lie within human norms.

The biggest problem with Ward though is the pacing. After spending several arcs slowly working through characterization and inter-character conflicts, Wildbow folded to fan pressure and started smashing people into combat trial after combat trial. After the first one, they rarely have the buildup time they need before the punching starts. And many of the combats go on until the fans get bored of the excessive slog of combat, then rather abruptly stop, only for the slow inter-character part of the work to return until some segment of the fanbase gets bored of it, and then suddenly lurching into more superpowered fistfights. I'm obviously on the side that it'd be better if it stuck to being mostly character-based, but the sudden lurching back and forth between the two modes didn't do a service to anyone.

***** It's really not the same at all. The only serious power boosting that takes place in Worm is right near the end, with an interlude to set it up and for a power that we've never seen the base power level of, allowing the description within the story itself to be simple and easy to follow. Taylor's power changes so slightly and so simply that there's no seams to it. She gains the extra sense so gradually and her range expands so subtly, there's no comparison to the bullshit Ward pulls.

In Ward, powers will change multiple times, sometimes radically, never in an easy to follow sense. If it wasn't past midnight I'd list all the examples I can think of. Lord of Loss? His power is ridiculous and even boosts itself in a way that's orthogonal to Lung's. It's impossible to follow what he's doing half the time. The second time he fights Victoria he's kaiju-sized, something the narration has trouble getting across. At the end of that fight we learn it's thanks to teacher giving him a secondary thinker power, which just complicates the power further because a reader would've only then managed to accept his power can be that strong and still be within Victoria's weight class , only to have that contradicted immediately after.

** I finished it, more as a factor of taking my mind of panic attacks than enjoyment, mostly without reading the comments. I really see it as a continuation of the progressing problems in Worm. As Worm went on, it seemed to get more and more bloated, particularly the fight scenes. This was partially ameliorated by several factors: I wasn't reading it while it was coming out; Taylor's powerset is really, really interesting; and secrets about the setting were being revealed. The normal fightscenes were broken up by Endbringer attacks, which were unique, hugely dangerous, a change of pace, and used relatively sparingly. The setting in general was fresh enough, dystopian superhero.

​

Ward really took away a lot of those supports. Victoria's powers aren't that interesting. The most important secrets had been revealed. And the setting is wildly inconsistent. It starts with an interesting rebuilding society kind of setting, but it feels like Wildbow got bored/ didnt't like it, so it all went to shit again. As this was going on, the fight scenes got more and more bloated. Some of the sections, like March, the Family, and the Assault on Teacher's Compound just got boring. There was also an expectation that you would care about all these minor characters, some of whom changed their name since the Worm days. I also don't think most of the characters showed development. To me, the characters feel mostly static.

​

This all adds up to incredibly inconsistent themes. Worm has an internal and external descent into darkness driven by the main character's need for control. Ward is clearly supposed to be about characters getting better, becoming more whole, and breaking cycles. You don't see this in the plot, setting, or characters until there's a rush at the very end.

​

So you're left with a book where a lot of stuff happens, there are fights against people that don't matter, and the fights that do are too long. I had little emotional connection to any of it. Don't read it. It's not terrible, but it's not worth it.

***** Twig has a heavy focus on relationships between characters. It has a clear protagonist, but more than in WB's other works, you get invested in other characters than the one, and in the relationship between that protagonist and the other characters. It covers the largest time period of any of his works, and (arguably, given Ward) has its characters grow and change the most. It has the biggest mindfucks, unreliable narrator, of anything. It's setting is unique and I love its worldbuilding. The crimson blood-covered biopunk Victorian-esque/industrial revolution era Crown States. It is my favorite of his works.

Pact follows a protagonist who keeps fighting, and fighting, and fighting, despite accumulating personal costs (something common perhaps to all of his works) but in which those injuries are sustained and change the character and how the character has to deal with things. Its sort of an urban fantasy, with a bit in common with Mage: The Ascension, but very rooted in the protagonist's ignorance of all things arcane as they struggle to adapt and survive. I think that while Twig's big thing was the ensemble cast, relationships, and humor, Pact was more "rather than OP Taylor, we'll take a broken half-a-person with barely any power, give everything costs, and see what happens." There are elements of that that were kept for Twig, ones which weren't really present in Ward (where the main character, despite their various injuries, wasn't moved all that far by them). A lot of people didn't stick with Pact when Worm ended (it was an entirely different story), and WB had personal stuff going on that kept it from being what he wanted, and the community at the time was afflicted by a meme that pervades to this day that Pact is hard to get through due to never-ending escalation and tension which I really don't see; Pact has long been "known" to be WB's "weakest" work, and I disagree with that, and it's my understanding that WB has come around to like it more as time has gone on, despite being fairly down about it at Pact's conclusion.

It's higherbrow in the sense that while being in Taylor's head and centered within her powerset was compelling, Ward tried to create a compellingness from the characters themselves that didn't rely on the superpowers. And I think he succeeded, with several very memorable interludes.

But there's something to be said, that the Worm experience of interludes was "Oh no an interlude drawing me away from Taylor and the story, I'll post asking whether I can safely skip it" while the one here was "This Interlude was amazing and recontextualized so much!"

Amnesty even clones of slaughterhouse 9 members created to end the world, and the fucking endbringer cultists. Weirdly retcon the Fallen so they are slightly disreputable rather than endbringer cultists. Vicky tries to argue someone out of joining the Fallen but doesn't think to mention they are endbringer cultists who burn down malls for jollies.

Then there is Vicky's character(In the first few arcs). She refuses to join some hero team because they hire racists, so she joins a team with a racist only there to use the nutters as human shields and a slaughterhouse 9 member only there to convert the autistic girl to villainy.

Also I'm half convinced Glowworm was a producers-esque scheme to murder Ward's hype. Reading it felt like debugging code, I've never had to read something so closely to follow it. Then there was no point because all the characters it introduced were introduced normally in the actual story.

*** It's more focused on inflicting emotional pain on the characters than Worm is. I don't think there's anything as physically nightmarish as Worm's fridge scene in the S9 arc, but there's still a lot of pain, injury, body horror, and violations of autonomy. Then on the emotional side, first person perspective PTSD flashbacks are just par for the course.

Definitely not the most comfortable thing to read, and worth avoiding if the state of the world is getting to you.

- "if you like ward it won't be for the same reasons as worm" so maybe not? I started reading it, got caught up, and stopped, and there was some dark stuff, but not that much blood, but I didn't get very far in, and decided to start reading when it was over.
- Another complain I saw was that the fights were too bloodless (unlss

So, I'm not positive, but maybe it's not as "dark" if by dark you mean rivers of blood and such? Though I could see some potential for that, from where I got to.

Many people miss the part where Amy /didn't/ transform Victoria into an abomination while trying to heal her. According to her dialogue in Carol's interlude, Amy pretty much fully healed her but hadn't woken her up yet. Then she got /lonely/ and 'made some tweaks', resolving to fix her after. Then, while fixing /that/ she decided to take a break, and finish fixing her later. And only after /days/ with tweaks that caused Victoria to love her did Amy decide to finish the fix only to find she couldn't.

**** Just reread the interlude. When I read it, my understanding of what happened is that in order to keep her alive, Amy had to like fuse her into the coccoon as life support, which was what all the work was ostensibly supposed to be: unfucking the body horror that was required to keep her alive. And then along the way, she's exhausted and she starts making mistakes. She's indestribably exhausted and she stops being able to see Victoria as Victoria, like semantic satiation, and her caricaturistic on-a-pedestal perception of her bleeds into it too. And that's what resulted in the abomination-ing.

I don't really know what implication is supposed to be there when she mentions taking a break. I can't draw a line from it alone to sexual assault, but I can't draw a line from it to /anything/, it just leaves me confused.

When she talks about being lonely, I gather that she's trying to excuse how her personal desire bled into the process and resulted in Victoria becoming a caricature of how Amy sees her.

And I'm pretty sure you're wrong when you say "tweaks which caused Victoria to love her"; that didn't happen during this event, but earlier on as a seperate thing.

But that's just a reading from the interlude alone, and I'm not sure about subtext to that that I missed or what was explained or retconned in Ward. And regardless, I'm more interested in just looking at Worm, not considering what Ward may have added or changed.

What's ambiguous is whether Carol abandoned Victoria or not, in Worm. That's something that's made explicit in Ward, not before. What's also ambiguous is whether Amy's Victoria-centric sexuality was intended to be a result of aura exposure, or maybe "breadth and depth". Guts and Glory was going to be centered around this family in a world where capes are routinely shaped by powers, especially when exposed at a young age. This has always been a setting conceit of Worm's.

I find it pretty funny that, somehow, when it's time to assign responsibility and mitigating factors, the characters who never did anything /too/ offensive or horrible get full marks, while any who did mental illness /'wrong'/ gets the "you had perfect agency! Why did you think this was a good idea!??" treatment.

When you set out to make a sequel built around themes of second chances, healing, therapy and redemption, having your protagonist be a pure victim that BTFOs her perfectly agentic rapist is hypocritical at best. Especially when there's a bunch of WoGs centered around implying there was power intervention in Amy's breakdown and subsequent actions.

**** I honestly don't remember. My decision to drop Ward ultimately had very little to do with Ward itself, and was a while ago now.

*** Amy was done dirty in Ward. Any moral ambiguity regarding her circumstances was thrown out the window and the worst takes you could possibly have about her personality and the things she did is what her entire character becomes. It's like the author was personally offended that people felt sorry for her and set out to make her as unlikable as possible in the sequel.

**** Yeah, I always thought that a good chunk of the horror regarding what Amy did is that it was so plausible and believable and still terrible, I stopped reading Ward around the time she was getting heavily flanderised.

EDIT: Just to clarify, I mean that Amy was a horrifying villain because what she did was so close to something real, and was a few degrees of fantasy/sci-fi away from being just a realistic rape story. She was an Umbridge, so to speak. I disliked it when she started pivoting to mwahaha-ing megavillain.

**** Wow, I'm glad I didn't go deep enough to get there.

I was kind of hoping to see more of her friendship with Riley/more of Riley's redemption story...

**** I think Wildbow made sue not to make Any ambiguous in the sequel was because once he decided to make her a rapist any sympathy with her would be sympathizing with rapist in a way that mirrors real world minimization of rapists' action if they are famous or well liked.

**** No, Amy's core problem was just that she couldn't bring herself to actually accept responsibility for her actions. I've had the misfortune of dealing with people who were the same way. It's like that Friends meme irl, they'll agree with each individual line of reasoning inexorably proving that they acted wrongly, and then conclude "and it wasn't my fault!" And it can lie dormant for /years/, never realizing they were that sort of person until they've done something atrocious and you get to have that baffling, incomprehensible conversation. For the sort of person who posts here, if you ever have to have that discussion, it will make you doubt the other person qualifies as /people/. My best guess for what's going on under the hood is something like "Ego Protection beats the piss out of Internal Consistency Checker".

Shit, the one I knew irl even ran off and got the stupid tattoos. If anything, Amy hit too close to home.

** How bad is the torture porn? I'm asking this as a serious question, Worm went out of it's way to have a lot of torture in it, and it made me regret reading on as it just got way less fun and more and more horrific.

*** Ward has by far the most positive, uplifting Wildbow ending but there's a lot of darkness between where you dropped and the ending. So take that as you will
