[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/455k69/biweekly_challenge_new_age/?sort=confidence][Last time,]] the prompt was "New Age". [[/u/OrzBrain]] is the winner with their story [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/455k69/biweekly_challenge_new_age/czzbszx][Nuclear Rapture]]. Go read it now! Congratulations to [[/u/OrzBrain]]!

** This Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: this-time
   :END:
This time, the challenge will be "First Contact". My first thought when I hear that phrase is /alien/ contact, but there's no reason that you couldn't do contact between pre-Industrial civilizations on the same planet, contact between parallel worlds, or contact between the past and future. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided *Wednesday, March 9th.* You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

** Rules
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rules
   :END:

- 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. *This is mandatory.*

- No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

- Think before you downvote.

- Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

- Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights.

- All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

- Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

- In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

- No idea what rational fiction is? [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index][Read the wiki!]]

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing][add it to the list]] (remember that [[http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE][a good prompt is not a recipe]]). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge][posted them on the wiki]].

** Next Time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: next-time
   :END:
Next time the challenge will be "Mere Reality". In other words, fiction that takes place in the real world, or something very close to it. No magic, no fancy super tech, just people in the real world doing realistic things. We're looking for something that's exceptionally grounded. (My personal advice would be to look for real life examples and work from there, but YMMV.)

*Next challenge's thread will go up on 3/9.* Please private message me with any questions or comments, as the beloved meta thread is now archived. The companion thread for recommendations and discussion is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/47g8p1/challenge_companion_first_contact/][available here]].

**** First: Wait! Just give me a day to think of something.

After an hour: So right now the problem is confined to the box, right? How about you destroy every box in existence, appear to my company's shareholders and employees and all heads of state and tell them to ban this technology? If someone is about to use it again, just teleport them to jail.

I don't see how lack of time could be an issue for you. Boredom could, though it seems disgusting from my perspective to allow trillions of sapient being to die because you can't be bothered, but more importantly shouldn't it be trivial for you guys to

Also, while we're on the subject of fAI gods, any chance you or that AI could help us redesign the world to be less filled with misery and death?

***** Your argument kind of assumes that the Godly Being cares about us. Maybe he just wants to harvest us for resources, and slight changes to our timeline every century or so is the most resource-efficient way to do it.

I would plead for a chance to have a continued discussion with the alien. Time is unlikely to be of the essence (or else he would not have had this discussion with me) so I can only assume that his bottleneck is timeline changes, so he'll probably accept to chat with me for hours as long as he's having fun. I would interrogate him on his motivations, his needs, what ethics he has if any, and see if I can try to broker a deal with him. Highly unlikely (though I could try to ask for RationalFiction's collective brainpowers for help), but at the very least it would give me a few more enjoyable hours to live, whatever /that/ is worth.

EDIT: and by 'enjoyable', I of course mean 'increasingly filled with horrible despair'.

*** This is good.

I didn't like the following, however: " The Makers will refer to the people who sent us, a little corny and dramatic but easy to remember". That sounds out of character, like the author speaking through a character and being self deprecating.

There is also a problem with the grim Vingeian Slow Zone-esque picture she paints -- [[#s][Spoiler]]

**** Thank you.

Yes, that is indeed the author's self-deprecation over being unable to think of anything better to call them. At first Amanda was saying "the people who sent us" over and over again, and it started to sound like an M. Night Shyamanlan script. I justify my choice with the idea that she wants to disarm the narrator just then, and saying something out of character is a way to do it. [[#s][Vinge]] [[#s][and...]]

** [[http://pastebin.com/LpfNVCih][Rats!]], 500 words. This is short, almost a sketch. I was going to expand it, but I had some trouble coming up with an ending that wasn't either "everyone dies," or, "aliens come back, notice the 95 percent human death rate, and make some ironic comments about manifest destiny before putting the remaining humans on reservations and colonizing the place."
