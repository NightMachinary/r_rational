After 2 and a half years of writing, editing, and completely rewriting, I am finally going to show my book series to the world. Infinity Doctrine: Avenging Venus tells two stories, one in the near future on Earth, one in the more distant future in space. On Earth, Xavier Xavillan, after his embarrassing failure in the first chapter, will use his Invention and cunning to exploit various factions and ensure the third world war end with him in charge of everything. In the clouds of Venus, Dragutin Dragomir, born in a synthetic womb and raised by robots, has always vowed to become an asteroid miner, use asteroids to threaten Earth into submission, and end the cold war that nuked his home city. His plans are interrupted when Venus is attacked at the worst possible time, and he and his friends must not only escape back to Earth, but figure out why they were attacked and why only they survived before the 4th world war begins. My main goals for the series are:

1. Active protagonists- the protagonists, especially Xavier, are not good people, and from the beginning want power in order to force peace, and for other reasons I will not spoil.

2. Subverting expectations- the protagonists will often fail, there will be no romantic suplot, and they will hardly ever "leeroy jenkins into battle".

3. Hard science- while some speculative stuff will be eventually introduced, 95% of the technology in the series will be real. All spacecraft trajectories are also real and simulated using GMAT and/or Orbiter 2010.

I will be releasing 2-4 chapters a week, harsh criticism is encouraged.\\
