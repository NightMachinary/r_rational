Any good references on day to day interaction in American high schools? As opposed to what's shown in movies/TV. I didn't grow up in the West and American high school culture as portrayed in film is significantly different from my own home culture/older generation. So I feel like bit of a fraud when I need to write high school scenes in my stories.

This excellent article by Paul Graham seems to reinforce stereotypes: [[http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html]]

Can people who have been through US high school please comment on the linked article, if they agree or disagree? I have trouble understanding the "popularity contests" portrayed in film/TV, since my own home culture tends to revere nerds/geeks (The idea of nerds being unpopular is quite bizarre to me.)


** Everyone's a lot nicer than in the stereotypes. I don't know if I was lucky or if every other school was Mean Girls, but popularity and grades/intelligence were correlated and school sports wasn't nearly as big a deal as in movies. There wasn't any battle between cliques or anything. You have a few people who were at the center of some group, and they tended to like each other.

  The whole "struggle of the nerds" stereotyping is archaic at best and never existed at worst.
#+end_quote

Attending college after graduating high school used to be an unusual thing. Now, it's the expectation. It's not surprising that being a straight-A student was once considered "lame nerd shit" and now it's pretty normal for someone to get straight A's, especially when you consider the effects of grade inflation as more and more kids have been pushed to enroll in college (even if they're not particularly sure what they want to study).

As recently as [[https://trends.collegeboard.org/education-pays/figures-tables/educational-attainment-over-time-1940-2009][1990, most adults ages 25 to 34 never attended college]] (which reflects the education level of people who graduated high school 1976-1983). Paul Graham (author of the "Why Nerds are Unpopular" essay) would have entered high school in 1979, back when "college track kids" were still a minority (but growing in numbers, eventually becoming the majority 10 years later).

There was some [[https://loving-not-heyting.tumblr.com/post/181527573744/on-smartness-and-nerd-persecution][discourse]] on this subject earlier this week:

#+begin_quote
  It's worth remembering that Every Context is Different and that Your High School is Not Archetypical (whoever you are).

  In particular, I think the “persecuted contemptible brainiac vs. popular dumb jock” meme is an old one that gets more and more obsolete every year, at least in urban and liberal-suburban America.

  During the days of the Boomers' youth, I gather, it was very real indeed. Adolescent society had a very high premium on conformity, there was a very narrow range of acceptable interests, and being too devoted to academics was a strong sign that you were insufficiently devoted to winning the acceptance of your peers. During my own early-Millennial youth in the ‘90s, it was still at least sort of a thing; the very smartest and highest-achieving kids in my (liberal-suburban) school were in fact outcasts by dint of being too weird, and the valorization of the football team etc. was still a social fact that was to some extent being actively supported by the community and the administration. Looking at high school now, it seems to be true not at all.

  At least to some extent, this probably has to do with the ever-increasing academic pressure on American teenagers.

*** I think that this is true, but only in certain areas. For reference, I went to high school in the SF Bay Area, where property taxes are high and schools are well-funded. There, school life is dominated by the pressure to get into a top college, which means taking the hardest classes, doing the most extracurriculars, and getting the highest grades.

​

Travel a bit further east into California's Central Valley, and you'll find that students aren't as stressed out about their GPAs. The socioeconomic status of households there is different, so no one really expects their kids to get into an Ivy League. Of course, they have problems of their own to deal with, but academic achievement isn't as much of one.

*** There was definitely a transition at some point, perhaps in the 1990-2010 period, when being a nerd would get you beaten up.

I think things change (and things continue to change, at different paces depending on the location) happened more or less when the prospect of getting "beat up" at a school stops being something that realistically happens. When I went to school you had to watch yourself physically, 10 years later my siblings at the same school with many of the same teachers even were /shocked/ that my experiences ever happened.

I bet Hollywood writers primarily depict even earlier periods, the ones they grew up in (like 1960-1990) so it would have been even worse back then.

Hint: if being gay or foreign or otherwise different wouldn't get you beaten up every day of your life, you probably didn't go to a school where the nerd / jock / cheerleader "popularity" dynamic existed. As soon as 1) being "different" is celebrated rather than punished and 2) physical violence comes off the table as a way to "win" a social interaction a tipping point occurs, and these are related phenomenon.

You wouldn't get beaten to the ground daily but might be a little kick at you as you as you walk by going on here and there, subtle enough to seem like an accident. Or a verbal threat. It's more the daily, randomly enforced fear that /it might happen at any time/ that makes it feel subjectively like a daily struggle. So every day you have to be vigilant even though it doesn't happen daily. It's more like a thunderstorm than a sunrise though.

** When I read the linked article, two quotes popped out at me.

#+begin_quote
  "The stated purpose of schools is to educate the kids. But there is no external pressure to do this well."
#+end_quote

This is not true today. In many cases, a school can be punished for having low standardized test scores by having its funding reduced or being closed altogether. Some schools give teachers pay raises depending on how much their students improve under their tutelage.

#+begin_quote
  "I didn't realize that the reason we nerds didn't fit in was that in some ways we were a step ahead. We were already thinking about the kind of things that matter in the real world, instead of spending all our time playing an exacting but mostly pointless game like the others."
#+end_quote

I think almost every high schooler I've ever met is a "nerd" in this way. They're already thinking about things that matter outside of high school. They also play the game of popularity, but they don't spend nearly as much time or energy on it.

Maybe this is why my high school experience was so different from the one described in the article. Our school was trying to educate us, and we were trying to get an education. To some degree, we did have cliques - there were the nerds, the athletes, the band geeks, and so on. People with similar interests tended to stick together. However, there wasn't much of a hierarchy: the cheerleaders didn't lord their higher social status over the rest of the student body, and the nerds weren't revered either.

That being said, America is a big place, and your high school experience can vary wildly depending on the kind of school you went to. For example, I never had to worry about gang violence, but many kids did. My neighbors didn't need to set up a suicide watch because too many teens were ending their own lives, but people in another city did. Maybe, somewhere, there still are high schools where popularity contests dominate.

** Just outta high school, roughly a year and a half now, I still remember what my English teacher said about us students every recess.

Him and other teachers liked watching the inner courtyard of the 2000+ student school every time we were released to lunch or extended passing period from the teacher's lounge 3 stories above us.

According to him, he could instantly pic out the different years each student belonged to by how fast they walked and where they were sitting. Same friend groups sat in the same place save for the elevated very center of the courtyard which was passed between the most popular groups of each year.

Territorial disputes were settled in a mainly stereotypical British manner. A frown, force of numbers, and tradition (most sitting in the same location for all 4 years) determined who would move.

Inter-year friendships outside clubs or sports were rare according to my teacher as well as my own personal experience.

At least in my school, there was an extreme segregation between AP (advanced) students and regular class students. Not only social segregation but physical. AP classrooms were often on upper floors and on one end of a building and regular classrooms were on the other end. Again, outside of clubs and sports, there were rarely any interaction at all between these halves of the student body. Even then, clubs and surprisingly sports were super majority composed of more academically inclined students.

And I'm not going to lie, there was a prevalent undercurrent throughout school culture of disdain and superiority of AP students to regular students. As this divide also appeared along racial lines, racism, while not overt, coastal California is way to progressive for that, underlined every interaction between the two groups. Im not going to name them but you can probably guess the composition of the two bodies.

Outside this larger academic divide between classes, there is no "popularity contests" as they're mostly won in middle school (largely the same student body from elementary to middle to high school). High school battleground is mainly forged along GPA differences and every 0.01 counted.

Especially at the very top, everyone in the top 20 knew where other people stood within the same year and their chances of college.

This could most evidently seen in senior year where all pretenses of "learning" was dropped and students were either preening with applied and then accepted colleges (oh the social humiliation of those who thought they were guaranteed and told everyone but waitlisted/rejected).

In fact, if you want a glimpse into the minds/stress of academic high school seniors, take a look at the new tab on [[/r/ApplyingToCollege]]. You have everything, from memes to serious discussion.

This reality is obviously not shown in Hollywood television as you cant really magnify the interpersonal drama of late teenagers buried in paper

** The thing is, there are at least 22,000 high schools in the US. Most of these will be public high schools, but many are private, vocational, agricultural, or some other variation.

With 22k schools in 22k different locations, every single school will have its own unique flavor that has a lot to do with the specifics of the surrounding community. While there are some federal standards, each state, and each town has a lot of say in how high schools are organized and operated.

The experience of a student at an inner city school in Boston will be very different from the experience of a student at an inner city school in Flint. Their experience will be different from the experience of a student at a prestigious private catholic institution.

Furthermore, the experience of students change from year to year and from cohort to cohort. For instance, the year ahead of mine in high school had a stronger reputation for partying and traditional high school dramatics, while my year had a more studious reputation. Popular students in my year were also quite high-achieving in grades and athletics.

If you want more useful information, then I believe you will need to be more specific in your query.

** I think Graham is making it more complicated than it is. In cultures that haven't managed to quell interpersonal violence (such as some American high schools in the 1980-2010s) people would solve social problems through violence. Violence can actually become a way to /gain/ (rather than lose) status. Physically weak people and people who were raised or have a natural disposition towards not being violent or fighting back can become at a social disadvantage. Targets for violence are often people who are "weird" (slightly autistic, slightly adhd, gay, foreign, etc). Therefore being different, unathletic, or pacifist makes you a social outcast.

When I was in middle school I wad regularly harassed (punched, kicked, tripped, glasses stolen, verbally threatened, clothes stolen in gym, rocks and small objects thrown, and so on) by two boys for being, foreign, socially inept, and generally unwilling to fight. One day I hit a third boy (not one of the bullies) for saying something unkind about my mother (in retrospect it was actually a misunderstanding, I had recently immigrated from a culture where it was an unthinkable insult while the the offending boy intended it as light teasing) and noticed that other people began talking about what I did in a sort of a praising fashion. This is why I say that violence - even when disproportionate and culturally inappropriate - can actually raise social status, paradoxically.

Also, over time I became friends with a group of more accepting boys (in retrospect, i think they were less racist because they all happened to be black or Hispanic) and some of them were more athletic and less averse to violence than I was and would defend me against the people who would try to fight me. I think my experience was kind of the decline of bullying in schools. I never had the really bad stuff (stuck in the toilet, etc) done.

I think if there's any extent to which intelligence can be a disadvantage in this environment, it's probably because the cultural correlates to intelligence are linked to the cultural correlates of nonviolence. I was not really physically weaker than the boys who bullied me, but I had glasses which put me at a /huge/ disadvantage in fighting and unable to retaliate and "stand up for myself". I used to imagine that one day they'd very publicly throw the first punch and then I'd really show them, but it would often be a subtle kick or something made to look like an accident done while a teacher was watching, or a veiled threat made in private - there was a social component to the violence which made it something more than just "who is stronger" . I imagine people who weren't physically able to fight got it even worse.

*** Thank you for your perspective. I'm sorry you had to go through the initial rough patch in school.

Your comment on violence being present or absent as part of the culture makes a lot of sense in hindsight. I was raised to be very pacifist and I am psychologically incapable of fighting to defend myself. It wasn't an issue for me, since my home culture is very pacifist and I was tall and well built for my age. But I would have had a rough time in certain American schools, I imagine.

BTW, insulting one's mother is unthinkable in my culture too. When I first landed in the US, I was appalled by a certain swear word relating to ones's mother which is thrown around casually.

** The article is pretty inaccurate now. Popularity isn't hugely a thing, neither are school sports. Really students are divided by "care" and "not care". Either you take all the ap classes, try your best on tests, do random clubs because they look good for college and it's a way to be with your friends for longer during the day, or you take regular classes and just do whatever. Being smart makes you more popular if your in the first group, and dosen't affect you in the second. Sports are like clubs: unless your in them, you don't really care about them. High school is mostly full of hormonal teenagers who don't really have anything to do besides school, and if their lucky, a major interest or hobby. Often the type of people who don't care about school simply have nothing that particularly interests them or motivates them in life. [[/u/LiminalSouthpaw]] comment is pretty accurate

Source: am in highschool currently

EDIT: I would also like to note that this changes pretty heavily based on location. The above is what the suburbs are like, where school is pretty much your entire life, as there's not really public transportation for kids to get around and do stuff. In cities, everyone from school is so spread out from each other, and it's such a big school that no one talks to school friends outside of school, and classmates often change year to year or class to class.

**** Homecoming is a tradition that's kind of vestigial these days but still is pretty big at some colleges and small town high schools. The idea is that alumni all come back for that weekend and there's a football game and parades and stuff to celebrate. What's relevant most of the time is that there is a school dance that is the biggest social event of the fall. Everybody dresses up (although it is less formal than prom) and many a young man dreams of asking his crush to dance or go to the dance together as a prelude to dating. There is also a Homecoming Court or Homecoming Royalty elected. Usually a King and Queen, maybe some more. They basically get like a tiara or something and maybe they flip the coin before the homecoming game.

Opposite Homecoming is the Prom, which is the major social event of the spring, as well as the year or even your time in high school. It is black-tie formal, so the boys rent tuxes and the girls basically do a practice run of the wedding dress purchase process. It is sometimes restricted only to seniors and their dates, or sometimes juniors, seniors, and their dates. There is more pressure to have a date and to slow-dance and things than at homecoming which is more of a party. Popular kids or well-known couples often publicly ask each other to prom in elaborate ways, like how some people do stunts when proposing. These are always loudly applauded and there is a bunch of pressure to say yes. Traditionally senior prom would be the night when high school sweethearts have sex for the first time. After prom parties are also a big deal. Prom King and Prom Queen are socially more prestigious than homecoming royalty, but are basically the same deal with even less actual significance.

** skimming the linked article, I don't think it echoes my own (mid-late 2000s) experiences well, though I'm not sure how well my case generalizes elsewhere (I attended an all-male Jesuit college prep school, so e.g. nobody paid attention to clothes, since we all had to abide by the same dress code). Popularity and intelligence (and athleticism and charm and so on) were largely decoupled at the school-wide population level, or perhaps even weakly + associated. Though I guess we didn't have much in way of "global" popularity, either, in that a lot of the social interaction splintered into individual microcosms, where one could garner more or less popularity that would not carryover to other groups. This division was so profound that I recall at graduation observing with a friend that over half the school (~150 / 300 people) was utterly unrecognizable to us, despite having apparently worked alongside us the last four years. Though that may more appropriately reflect our own reclusiveness or obliviousness. These local groups had their own semi-hierarchical social networks, sure, but being, say, the star quarterback only gave one very minor "standing" among e.g. band geeks or robotics nerds or whatever, unless one also chose to cross-train in their interests. There also wasn't much in way of bullying, either -- usually nicer individuals were more popular, and more obnoxious and rude individuals universally shunned (I guess niceness/gregariousness formed the ultimate basis of one's global level of popularity). People in my experience also tended to have a few partially overlapping groups they hung out with, so the networks were loosely connected rather than completely isolated.

ofc, that's not to say that the smartest students were also the most popular, or vice-versa, or that /within/ groups there weren't inverse associations not seen in the broader pop (b/c joint and conditional distributions are diff't things, Berkson's paradox, etc.).

edit: economic status also didn't seem to structure much of the social groups -- my own sampled from across all levels of parental income and class, from the borderline impoverished kids attending on scholarship and work-for-tuition-waiver to children of deca-/centimillionaires. With a few exceptions people in my group didn't care too much about (relative standing wrt) grades, either, or test scores etc.

** That article sounds like stereotypical 70's. As for my own high school experiences, I wasn't really paying attention. I mostly read books instead of interacting with people, and pretty much didn't make any friends or enemies. Well, there was that one kid who kept teasing about making soup out of my pet, but he turned out to be alright. As far as I could tell then, and now from looking back at yearbook pictures, the kids in the honors classes seemed to be overall fairly popular. Also there was that one girl who seemed to lead a pretty cliquey group who was kind of mean to me but later declared it to be some sort of initiation or something that I had passed and then tried to be friends, but I wasn't really interested. I think that might actually have been in middle school. I don't remember noticing any cliques in high school. My school overall was pretty noncompetitive gradeswise, I would say. The majority of my classmates who graduated went to the nearby community college afterwards, which is pretty easy to get into. Anyway, I put absolute minimal effort into popularity at school and still managed to end up pretty well known and not unpopular somehow.
