Hey, everyone! Can you recommend me some rationalist comics(if they exist)?


** Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal is rationalist enough to have already appeared on this subreddit, and is also my favorite webcomic.

Edit: I have no idea why autocorrect would change subreddit to diversity, but it happened.

*** Comics by rationalists, for rationalists, and most certainly not about rationalists.

Bouletcorp is another good one. I find them to be somewhat related, one of them referenced the other once and Bouletcorp did the illustrations for Wienersmith's /Augie and the Green Knight,/ which I want so very badly.

Examining the layout of a QWERTY keypad, the letters for those are all really close together.

S,D\\
U,I\\
B,V\\
R,E\\
E,R\\
D,S\\
D,_\\
I,I\\
T,T\\
_,Y

Almost aligns perfectly, each pair is adjacent... and even where it doesn't align, the unaligned letters are either repeats or adjacent to the previous letter.

Experimenting further, Swype is really surprisingly good at picking up the difference between the two... I haven't taught it subreddit as a word but it was reliably picking either subvert/suggest or diversity depending on which I tried to type, even when I tried to exaggerate the laziness of the swipe pattern to make it a bit ambiguous. I guess based on whether you go E-R or R-E, and whether or not you flick back to the Y after the T at the end.

** [[http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/fleep/][Fleep]] is the one that occurred to me first.

While trying to remember the name, I found [[http://rationalreads.com/#/works][this page]], which allows you to filter by the 'comic' tag. I suspect you'll find some others in there.

Erfworld is pretty good, a bit of a tabletop gaming deconstruction.

*** Bookhunter and Demon by Jason Shiga are excellent as well, and may qualify.

** I would also be interested. Unfortunately, all I know of is rational comics like [[http://brainchip.thecomicseries.com/][Transdimensional Brain Chip]]. If, perchance, you mistyped, then that's a suggestion.

**** I would point to the art as the biggest fault of Thorsby's comics. I find the weird treatment of romance, sex, sexuality, and gender relations the second biggest. But by good writing, do you mean the story, or the actual dialogue? He is ESL, I suppose I might be unusually tolerant of bad translations.

** Fullmetal Alchemist is a fairly rational manga, with an interesting magic system and good characters - the protagonist in particular pulls off some excellent munchkinry in the last third that wouldn't be out of place in a rationalist fanfiction. It can be somewhat deathist in places, though other than that it's about as rational as mainstream media gets.

*** If manga are applicable, I would recommend: Qualia the Purple: A single girl sees people as robots, and can modify them as such, things spiral out of control as one of her friends becomes literally everything.

Ajin: Immortals start appearing at the rate of 1 to 250 million or so, and the main character is immediately on the run as he gets hit by a truck. Ramps up into terrorist and anti terriorist shenanigans.

** Recommending [[http://www.undefined.net/1/0/?strip=1][1/0]] by Tailsteak ([[http://oneoverzero.comicgenesis.com/d/20000827.html][alternate link]]). Once you get past the rough intro, both in art and writing, it starts doing some interesting character drama and exploring the idea of a comic strip as a system.
