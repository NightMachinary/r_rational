Nothing comes to mind.

**** If it's a heptagram of dragons, it's a herptagram. But even so, it's a heptagon/herptagon because you get -gons when you've got only points, and -grams when you get to add all your fancy lines.

Also: I assumed that stuff like making something so odd that it couldn't be in more than two places and then using the Vanishing Name wouldn't work because it's so obvious /everyone/ (with the Name) would have immediately tried it, and then Unsong would have sold Vanishing tickets, which would definitely help out with the whole "yeah, tech like airplanes sometimes doesn't work because Uriel can only fix things at a god-/like/ rate" thing. Plus, we haven't seen Singers with a massive escape system with nodes all over the place in safehouses.

**** How? If they can recreate the dragon formation, they already know what your base looks like. Practice safe sympathetic magic, change the pattern every so often, and use comet speech to tell, in Arabic, your siblings the new pattern.

I also had thought that the name picked the most similar spot, and that could be the dragon pattern because of complexity.

****** As other commenters have pointed out, there may be some placebomantic components, i.e. "Universe, it'd be pretty lame if our emergency escape method we spent time setting up sent us into danger instead" though of course backfiring escape methods is a fairly common story concept, so it could still backfire.

At the time of my first post, I had imagined some sort of function that weighted proximity and similarity, do the closest similar thing would get the teleport, but I admit I had no evidence, and the Jane and Angel teleport is pretty strong evidence against.

In conclusion, more information needed!

To me like it felt like one of the less interesting chapters in the whole work, they just fight random monsters just by blowing them away, as opposed to e.g. clever use of palindromes, or of Aramaic.

**** 1. Stuff happens and the plot progresses, with like actual plot revelations and plot points happening and so forth. The status quo is changed as Aaron and Jane both find out new things and change their present circumstances, and a new character is introduced who may be a crucial part of the story (depending if she really is his computer as claimed). A lot of Unsong chapters have nothing happen to progress the overall plot, and while they can be interesting digressions I really like it when things actually happen.

2. I really like the plot structure of a lead-in with random talmudic musings about vampires, leading the reader to think "oh another random Kabbalah chapter" - as a lead in to "vampire-like creatures attack!". It felt like a neat reversal and subversion of reader expectations.

3. The clever wordplay, references, puns, and so forth are integrated into actions and plot advancement in an interesting way, as opposed to it being the subject of digressions that are expected to be interesting in and of themselves.

** Let's say you encode two different Names into a Klipotified sentence, e.g. the first letter of each word is one Name, and the last letter of every third word is another Name. Which Name takes effect? Do both? Does it depend on which name you are thinking of at the time? If it does, which feels natural, maybe you could use it to turn a klipah into a killpah, where the more obvious Name is dangerous to the utterer, to prevent a bad guy from figuring out what you're saying. If more than one can be used at a time, I wonder if they could be combined to form complex spells. You'd work out interactions and interleave the names.

Given that the heptragam is presumably one of only means of ingress into the Cometspawn's base, it is safe to assume that the area is well-guarded against the sudden appearance of The Other King.
