Subsequent chapters have different POV characters, and use different writing styles to show how the different characters see the world.

The world is an altered version of the D&D Spelljammer and Planescape physics. There are no stars and planets as we know them; the entire universe is a 10,000-km hypercube between eight elemental planes.

The upload frequency (and quality) of future chapters will depend heavily on reader feedback.
