Hi guysüëã

I would like to recommend new fic on spacebattles forum, about how Joffrey Barateon is not a total psycho and noob in politics.

He is not lucky, his plans have many iterations and everything seems to balance on knife edge.

MC is basically a good student of history of Westeros. So no supernatural knowledge for him, just pure rationalization, based on desire to survive.

** Just to be clear, is this a real cat on the throne? Or is MC just human? Please let it be a cat...

EDIT: My disappointment is immeasurable.

*** Lol üòù

MC is human, Joffrey from game of thrones, but he kinda thinks that his chances of survival on iron throne are similar to cat üêà

*** I assumed it'd be like that Simpsons episode where it's revealed that Burns declares a budgie the CEO whenever OSHA inspectors arrive

** I'm enjoying this one. I have to imagine this Joffrey as the older version from the show rather than the book version that acted like a spoiled little kid. Joffery being a spoiled idiot ended up kicking off a lot of the plot and him having a good sense of self-preservation and being willing to sacrifice a lot for it definitely changes things.

I wonder what Tyrion's been up to during all this?
