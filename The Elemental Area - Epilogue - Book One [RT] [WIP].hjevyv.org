** There's a lot of (sometimes literal) world-building in the epilogue. It looks like the elements are, themselves, the five highest beings in the Immortal Collective. Tygerion appears to be an ascended Fire user who (logically) doesn't get along with two of the five.

The sequences with other players hint that there are a /lot/ more features hidden around the Arena than the ones we've seen so far.

We also see a couple more of the rival species. One of them appears to be both brutish and monstrous - a likely common rival for Maya's presumed federation.

Oh man. I picked up on the 5 members of the oversight committee = 5 elements, and completely spaced on the elemental affinities/constructive-destructive cycles = personality conflicts and who gets along with whom.

Although, I did find it interesting to note that of the greater ascended identified in this chapter, only Tygerion, a lesser ascended, has a name that doesn't appear to be quasi/elementally related (unless I missed something).

[Edit] clarified Tygerion's status vs the council members

**** Tygerion is only a Lesser Ascended while the others mentioned are all Greater Ascended. Presumably you don't get a title name until you ascend more.

** I think Tyggy is tricking himself about how real Meg's friendship with him is. Seems like if it is/was lonely it has the power to fix that.

Rather, I think it relating to him in this way for/in roughly the same reasons the others are rolling their eyes at his cheating. She/they find it to be cute young ascended behavior to think he is putting one over on them.

*** It may well be Meg is reinforcing "good" behaviors. Ascended who are cooperative with her are more successful - and so she empowers those who will one day support her in turn.

** Get an interesting interlude view from Tygerion, but fortunately also learn what Nathan's fusion is.

Looks like people's predictions on Tygerion's motives were pretty spot on. Excited to see Nathan cheese the hell out of his new skill.

*** An option could be dummy enemies. Keep a live horned beaver in a cage, throw that into a pile of enemies, and target the beaver that can't even move.

**** Has anyone gotten NP in the middle of a fight? I think no one gets anything until the fight is over. Keeping a monster alive would be something to try, but I wouldn't be surprised if it prevents any NP or other benefits from the group it came from, or eventually despawns, or has some other effect that would break this plan.

***** It seems that any kind of reward doesn't apply until the player looks at their wristband interface. This tends to disable the player, if not knock them out altogether, so nobody does so in the middle of a fight.

My own headcanon is that the reward does not exist until the player checks their interface. When they do, Meg then calculates, applies, and notifies of the reward. Take this with a grain of salt.

** Hmm, I had to stop reading when I consistently saw him take the physical option after spending a million lines describing why the mental option would be powergaming but he couldn't afford being weak. It made sense in the beginning but seeing him continue with the SAME choices even when he clearly saw that he was, to put it in a word, much stupider than other members of his team, felt like a cop-out that artificially wanted to keep his power level low.

Also, the Swedish lady is so fucking annoying and a simple apology wasn't enough for me to start liking her.

Have things changed at all in subsequent chapters?

*** Things have changed. Details below, if you're interested (but a bit spoilery for you).

Nathan's skill growth is mixed between Physical and Mental, but his primary NP investments have continued to be Physical. That said, Nathan is very likely to see Mental skill-ups in the near term. A lot of his better skills are enhanced by, or increase his Mental attribute.

Johanna is still around, but has all but vanished from the narrative.

Nathan's performance and interactions with the other players continue to be a mixed bag. Players learn and grow, but this comes at the cost of occasional moments of disharmony that have made me wince. The story is gritty, and characters earn their successes.
