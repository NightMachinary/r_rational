** Assuming going back in time.

I wouldn't want to overwhelm myself with too many things to focus on in case I forget, so I would probably have a minor plan in a notebook somewhere that I could review every once in a while. As a kid I kept a couple of journals that are still around today.

Throughout grade school and Highschool, I would do my best to act my age, and try /not/ to excel. I don't want more attention than I already received. If my parents thought I was brilliant, I would have had much less autonomy. My goal would be to go at this from the down low until I could build up a sizeable amount of cash (500 million dollars, no less)

Some things would change by virtue of past experience. I would stop watching tv long before I did as a kid. I would probably get into drawing a lot more to make up for the (lack of) tv time. I don't want to be a perfect kid in school- my older sibling made all A's and had all the parental attention whereas I had Bs and Cs and didn't get half as much focus about grades, so I would get all A's in math and purposefully not do well in English classes.

I would find more creative ways to get away from the house until 14 or so. Around that time I bought my first PC which is where things would be getting a little different. In order not to attract attention, I would still do mostly the same stuff I did as an x-year old until I was 17 and Bitcoin came around. I sell out on my first million from BTC and look to reinvest elsewhere.

While I am 14, I would start programming for real, dropping World of Warcraft, etc. Eventually, I would make my own version of Minecraft for the PC. The game wasn't getting worked on until Zachtronics released Infiniminer in 2009 or so- I would have approximately 3 years as a highschool student to get it working... Of course, I would probably do .75 meters per block instead of 1 meter per block.

I believe at 16 brokers will let you open a stock account and actually invest (with parental permission of course) in companies. When it comes to stocks, my idea is to purchase and short only a couple of times, as I want minimal influence on the market. This was a major conversation in my family as the housing bubble was about to burst and many stocks were sky high. By this time Apple had already boomed, so I would purchase Facebook, Tesla, and Netflix stocks until Oculus is formed. My big play would be to (at 21 or so) invest a million or so into it and let Facebook buy me out. By this point, I have several hundred million, if not a billion dollars by selling Oculus and Minecraft. With that money, I would set aside approximately 5 million dollars as liquid every 4 years or so for living and pet projects. That's my exit point.

From there (my current age or so) I would be putting one million dollars every year towards eczema and arthritis research- two diseases which I think are currently under-researched for effective cures. An additional million would be set aside for pet projects. Having sold the game studio I created around Minecraft, and becoming a rather big name in gaming I would hire a bunch of game devs and fund pet projects that interest me.

I have no desire to influence national politics in any way, there's just too much money too high up for me to care, although I may get involved in local politics to help my town not be a craphole.

It's plagiarism of a sort, but only you will know that it's plagiarism. And it's even possible that the person you're stealing the idea from will not have even thought of it at the time that you begin to make the game.

There's also the possibility that your version of the game/book/movie or whatever is either worse quality than the original, or perhaps you're just not in the right position to promote it well enough to make money off of it.

Then at that point you've effectively exposed the idea to the world that would have been profitable for someone else and maybe influential to future works. And it's possible that the person who would have originally had the idea will be discouraged by your failure or even success.

In my understanding, until someone actually creates the idea, all bets are off. It's not plagiarism in the same way that the clones of Minecraft are not considered plagiarism. My ethical wall in that situation would be if I were to go back with my own (pirated) copy of Minecraft and claim it as my own.

That would be unethical. So long as I would be able to make my own from scratch, I don't see anything unethical about it.

It's worse than copying concepts from a successful person, because you're effectively taking away from their potential for success.

If you make it big by making a Minecraft clone, it's very unlikely that Notch (the main inventor of Minecraft) is going to make it big by making the original Minecraft in the same timeline.

So you've more or less traded their success for your own. Which to me feels shady, though not necessarily criminal.

#+end_quote

I approach the situation with three arguments, and if irreconcilable, an idea for reducing the net bad. From your quote it sounds like you're assuming this is zero-sum- because I have success means another person can't have success either.

1) (The game is not zero-sum)- While not sharing in my success, Notch would not be left homeless if I succeeded with the idea. He made no big bets on the game, and the fact that it got as big as it did was as much chance as anything else. Someone else would have come up with something similar that would have caught on if MC didn't catch on.

2) This is assuming my implementation is successful. Let's say I deliberately do a C++ version (which can't support mods) that allthough has good FPS and basic gameplay, never ends up getting bukkit or pistons, etc due to the work required to reverse machine code. I make a couple million off the game, not a couple billion. Minecraft comes out for Java and is moddable. Notch loses little (if any) money between timelines. 2a) I can still make a TON of money if I only make a little amount of cash, because some companies are still getting big around this time, like Nflx and TSLA, as well as a couple of medical companies

3) I believe the net harm to the disadvantaged party in this case is less than the net good from utilizing my knowledge to gain wealth in this manner. As a selfish individual (and perhaps conceitful) I think that I could make better use of millions and millions towards public good during the time I have foresight than Notch would during the same amount of time with the same amount of cash (Not saying Notch is using his money unwisely).

Attempt to reconcile: If none of the above points reconcile the issue, One could attempt to 'invest' some portion of the earned money into Mojang during this time period, giving them a chance to create a separate/decent product with the proper funding.

******* 1) I agree that his success may in part be contributed to luck, but it's a hard argument to make that he doesn't lose a lot. Yes there is a vast difference between making someone homeless and not giving them millions of dollars. But I don't think this point really adds anything to the discussion. The fact of the matter is that you know that so long as you don't change reality significantly Notch is going to gain millions. And you're making a deliberate effort to gain those millions for yourself, utilizing his ideas/methods.

2) It's possible that you could make a little money and still leave room for Notch to make his money... but I think it would be incredibly hard to actually plan to do that. Especially since seeing your game come to market might discourage Notch from creating his game in the first place. And if your game comes out first the brand recognition you gain may be more important in the long run than the quality of the game itself. Things might work out the way you described, but I don't see any way for you to be reasonably sure that they actually will turn out that way.

3) This point is your strongest point. If you actually believe the good you can do with the money is significantly greater than the good Notch has demonstratedly done with his money, then maybe you do have a point.

Though I would argue that all your other methods of gaining money in your original post are probably sufficient that you don't NEED to go through with this plan in the first place. But if for some reason whatever altruistic plan you have cooking requires more capital than the other ideas/investments can provide, then I say you're justified in going through with this, knowing that there's at least a chance that you're significantly altering someone else's life for the worse, for the sake of potentially improving many other people's lives.

As for your attempt to reconcile: that's better than nothing I suppose. But I'm sure if you gave the people at Majong the choice between already having created a widely successful game and an investment towards making a potentially successful game, they would choose the former.

So I say, sure you're justified in doing this if you intend to use the money for The Greater Good™ and you have no other less morally ambiguous way to gain the money. But if those conditions don't apply I don't think this is a particularly moral plan.

I find it difficult to conceive of my plan as morally wrong or even ambiguous. I'm not stealing any code they wrote from the future, merely the idea. Secondly, they haven't thought of the idea or even considered it yet in the time frame I'm planning on making the game.

I just don't think that 1) my plan deprives Notch of potential success, or 2) that even if it did, depriving someone of an opportunity they never knew they had (or even planned on) is wrong/morally ambiguous. My goal in this case is not to have minimal impact on others, but rather have maximal impact.

I think it's morally ambiguous because it is similar to other situations of intellectual property theft.

Mainly because you didn't have the original idea and your actions are likely to deprive the person who did have the original idea of the profit they would have made.

I believe that them not knowing that they've lost the opportunity doesn't negate the fact that they've lost the opportunity and it was a result of your deliberate actions.

It's still "ambiguous" because as you've said it's not a case of directly stealing someone's intellectual property. But if you are successful the results of your actions will be exactly the same as if you HAD stolen their intellectual property, used it as your own, and got away with it.

I'm judging the morality based on how it effects the person who originally had the idea. Not based upon the person's knowledge of how it effects them.

********* OK, I'm going to try to cut in here because you both are making good points, but I just don't think you're managing to understand each other properly and that hurts my soul.

I think what Fresh is trying to say is that, in one time line, Notch had an idea. That idea went big, and made him millions. You had the luxury of watching Notch do this, and realising that 'hey, that's a good idea! I should do that.'

Then you go back in time, to before Notch had the idea, and do it yourself. That, however, does not change the fact that you got the idea from Notch. Notch is still the originator of the idea, as far as your personal timeline is concerned. Fresh considers going back in time and using the idea in this way stealing, as the idea is not yours, and you are essentially preventing the originator of the idea (Notch), from coming up with it themselves in this new time line you've created.

To give a different example, I could go back in time and, with my current understanding of physics, biology, and chemistry, replace every major scientific figure in history with myself. Would that be right? From Fresh's point of view, the answer is no. Because I did not come up with any of those theories or machines myself. I did not put in any creative work to generating the concepts. Instead I looked at the finished work, the 'ideas' we are taught in school, and then put them forward as my own creative/analytical products in a time line to young to know any different. Even if I brought back an equation, I would still have to do the work of deriving and proving it (similar to how you would have to do the work of actually building Minecraft). But at the same time, the original idea, the first insight, did not belong to me, and now I am preventing the originator from having those ideas and insights themselves; mental events that may have been integral to their appreciation of their lives and sense of self worth. I am 'stealing' their place in history.

In your new timeline, Notch fades into the background, and never gets known as the guy who made Minecraft. My example is more extreme, as it is doing the same thing to the likes of Einstein, Marie Curie, and Tesla, but still the same concept, and it is the concept that is bothering Fresh.

Of course, you may have understood this perfectly and this post might be useless, but I actually saw a discussion like this explode into a shouting match today and just had to write this post.

********** I mostly agree with your assessment of my point.

But I would argue that it's less morally ambiguous to "Steal" scientific ideas, since they're not so much bursts of creativity as they are attempts to understand reality itself.

Also the potential good that can be gained by allowing humanity to have access to certain scientific concepts faster probably outweighs the negatives of individual scientists not gaining notoriety for those discoveries.

In contrast, something like like Minecraft is a luxury item. So it's harder to argue that the game itself being made available sooner will be helpful to mankind as a whole. You could say that the profit gained could be better used by someone with altruistic goals, than by the employees of Majong. But that's about the only justification you can make to justify taking their place in history (In my opinion).

And for the record there are absolutely zero hard feelings about this on my end. At the end of the day, morality is formed by opinions. And it'd be foolish to expect everyone's opinion to line up perfectly.

A loud voice narrated, “Up above the sea's grey flatland, wind is gathering the clouds. In between the sea and clouds proudly soars the Petrel, reminiscent of black lightning. Glancing a wave with his wingtip, like an arrow dashing cloudward, he cries out and the clouds hear his joy in the bird's cry of courage. In this cry--thirst for the tempest!”

However, the interviewers of this world that had never heard of Gorky's “The Song of the Stormy Petrel” and were so shocked that they stared with their mouths agape!

The lottery is an extremely delicate system, given it's designed to be unpredictable. If you traveled back even 30 seconds in time betting on roulette and changed your bet to the number that just came up, you wouldn't expect it to come up the same this iteration, the lottery is the same way it's just not as intuitively obvious how delicate of a system it is.\\
The same thing goes for reproduction, which sperm meets the egg is a delicate system. Expect everyone born in this new iteration to be half twins (same egg) of who would have otherwise been born starting out.\\

** I would first be very weirded out and it would take me a few days to adjust and to really accept that it was happening to me.

The first and biggest change I would make is to slowly ramp up my general competence and ability. I had mental issues as a child and was almost classified as mentally retarded (then in high school was classified as 'genius' go figure!). So my education and life would improve if I could make myself appear as a very smart child early on. Then I would study and review everything I need to know to pass high school courses.

I would insist on certain surgeries for a medical condition I have. First time around I got it in late teens and I believe it would be so much better to get it as early as possible and it would be relatively easy to convince my family.

Convince my mother to not date that guy. He's a jerk and it'd be easy to prove it with foreknowledge.

Start participation in some sports like running, swimming, or martial arts so I can develop good exercise habits early on. Probably learn a foreign language and music. Get myself classified as a prodigy and attending college level courses at a very young age. Where I live is well placed for me to attend courses at a nearby university.

With some academic credentials under my belt, it'll be much easier for me to publish about future research. During the years it would take for me to get through college, I'd be working on code for Facebook and attempt to use it for my university like Zuckberg did for Harvard. Since I was sent back in time to 2000, I'd have 4 years to do it. I'd invest into stock markets concerning companies I know will do well.

From there I'd look out for any publicly traded companies that I know are going to become huge. This would be right around the time of the Internet boom, so we'd have some choices of where to invest.

I don't think I'd do anything like trying to prevent 9/11 or any other major tragedies, since I don't like the spotlight and I don't think such knowledge of the future would be that big of an advantage.

I mean I can prevent a few deaths, assuming anyone takes me seriously, but the more you directly change things, the less accurate your future knowledge is going to be. And in the grand scheme of things, even preventing something as big as 9/11 probably won't have long lasting positive impact on the world. Though maybe that's just the pessimist in me speaking.

So after making a boatload of cash with my family, I think I'd probably change the direction I took in life a bit. Focus more on different areas of education and try to pick up different skills.

In no particular order, I'd probably:

- Cry, because friends are hard enough already.
- Try to come to a decision whether or not to intervene in my parents' failed business attempt. Sure, it was a financial setback and my dad had to file bankrupsy, but they've rebounded just fine and honestly I wouldn't mind getting to hang out at the store(s) again. Assuming I didn't butterfly this out of happening by accident.
- I kinda see anxiety issues being the primary source of conflict. Sure, I could walk into the kitchen at breakfast and start speaking prophecies in French, but I'd probably chicken out when it comes to anything important... and if I wouldn't, my parents would probably take considerable convincing to let me try anything "dangerous", such as tinkering with electronics or exploring the neighborhood or ... exploring the front yard. I have no idea how to work these out (whether for myself or others) other than exposure therapy, which I'm not sure how I'd implement (I don't think my parents waking up to find me making pancakes blindfolded would help, in spite of being exposure to something scary). Advantage, though... being five would make just /asking/ to do these things less awkward. Having the asking turn into opportunity, on the other hand...
- I can't get very far in this sort of scenario without thinking I'd eventually walk into the school counselor's office and start rambling about the situation. But I dunno.
- I'd like to start working on lower-level programming ASAP. This would be difficult because I have no idea how I'd manage to read anything on computer screens before 1995.
- Also, I'd try to find some way to work on my print reading speed. I am apparently /extremely/ lucky to have been taught braille starting in kindergarten, and it'd be woefully impractical for me to use large print for much of anything even with the vision I had at 5, but I'm pretty sure I should be able to read sufficiently large print faster than I could the last time I had sufficient vision. I don't know if this would really be that useful, but it'd let me watch subtitled anime, if nothing else. (Also, prevent the loss of my remaining vision. This seems trivial, given how it happened and what I've learned about the condition, but I suppose I'll have to mentally timetravel to find out.)
- All the things I still keep wanting to do but never get around to. I would desperately hope that being back in elementary school would help more than hurt most of these. EX, I can use Science Fair as an excuse to build cool things, I'd have easier opportunities for getting in contact with useful people (to an extent), I wouldn't have to worry about whether or not DHS would pay for assistive technology, obtaining useful books would ... you know, never mind about the books; I tried that one in the original timeline and failed.
- The easiest stock hints I know of come around the .com bubble, which is also around the time my parents filed bankrupsy. Does this pose as big an obstacle as I'm afraid it does?
- Speaking of money, I need to start earning it PDQ. I want to do things whose costs (even the cheap ones) would have nasty down-the-road consequences if I just rely on family for it all. I am not entirely sure how I'd go about doing this at 5, as I suspect wandering down the streets with a harmonica to be an inefficient use of my street-wandering opportunities. The easiest way would just be doing more work around the house, but that would be paid by my parents, vacating the point. Naturally, I'd invest whenever possible, according to future knowledge.
- I suspect that, given the rare opportunity to experience both pubescent and prepubescent form and make an informed choice between the two, I'd be strongly tempted to find a way to dodge puberty II. (Especially if I get to bring a laptop back with all of my voice recordings from this timeline.) This would be difficult to accomplish and more difficult to do right. (Note to self: add "do lots and lots of endocrinology research" to the list.)
- I have no idea what to do about tragic things that will happen without my interference but I don't like the idea of not preventing deaths I could have prevented. I mean, there was a school shooting in my town and I know the names dates ages and plenty of people who were there and could act as my proxy if I couldn't intervene personally or convince the police I'm not pulling a very bad-tasting prank. I don't have the details of 9/11 memorized and preventing it would be such a huge divergence that my future knowledge would become useless on 9/12/2001, and I have no idea whether a post-9/11 world is worse than a no-9/11 world.

*** Interesting. Thanks for sharing. As a point of curiosity, could you have had installed a mountable magnifying glass over your monitor, a la: [[http://images.addoway.com/items/7364/894534/7364_3_11d918.jpg]]?

**** I tried something like that at one point, and didn't feel like it worked very well. No better than my glasses, anyway, which didn't work well with the sorts of fonts I'd be working with.

I think there were hardware speech synthesizers for MSDOS at the time, but I don't know anything about them and wouldn't know how to go about researching them were I in the past having not already done so.

(And they were probably expensive, because everything like that is expensive.)

** Step 1 -- grow up, while vastly improving my parents life because I know how certain things will turn out for them.

Step 2 -- corner the stock market. I remember fairly closely how it's gone over the last fifteen to twenty years. Buying massively into the tech bubble with heavy use of margin and loans, then remembering when exactly Greenspan crushed the market and going way, way past fully invested in short positions in all those stocks that went from two or three hundred down to one or two dollars a share. I figure I could easily a couple hundred million dollars, and might even make it into the billions.

Step 3 -- corner the housing bubble (which happened when Greenspan got everyone to stop investing in the tech bubble which was producing some actual value by providing money for pie in the sky research and increased productivity and instead made all that money go into homebuilding which did no good for anyone except speculators). Then short the subprime mortgage market using derivatives. If I haven't made it into the billions yet, I will here.

Step 4 -- I know magic exists. Research it using my now vast resources. Figure out how it works enough to use it for immortality research.

Step 5 -- live forever.

Step 6 -- increase my own intelligence.

Step 7 -- go foom.

Why would anyone want to play the Loto with all its attendant problems and likely butterfly effects when they can use future knowledge to basically print unlimited money from the financial markets? I may be wrong, but I can easily imagine one Loto win changing the numbers of all future Loto winners after that, while my feeling is that the financial markets are far more robust and likely to follow one's future memories even after one has made substantial changes to one's personal timeline.
