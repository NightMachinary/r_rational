When mysterious portals start opening up around the world at large events, swallowing everybody, you'd think that would warrant some kind of danger pay when you have to sell hotdogs at a Comic Con, right? â€˜No, of course not; what are the odds of that happening here, out of all the big events in the world?'

Well, Emma was always pretty good at beating the odds when it came to shitty luck.

Now she's stuck in a strange dimension, where the normal rules don't seem to apply, together with a costumed crowd who seem strangely happy about this whole thing.

At least, until the first people start dying.

** I like this story a lot, but it's not rational. A major part of the main character's character is that she constantly takes huge unessacary risks and thus far it always pays off.

**** Her bad luck is being sucked into the dimension. Apart from that she seems to have pretty normal luck.

I will say this, she doesn't survive her risk taking by luck. But by a combination of skill and willpower. Though you could say the fact she hasn't bitten off more than she can chew to be improbable good luck in of itself.

** This story is not rational, and in terms of the problems that the main character must overcome, badly written too, however entertaining.

The main character is dumped into another universe without any knowledge of where they are or why they were transferred, along with others. By pure chance, she and a small percentage of others who arrived with her have bodies that can adapt to the different climate this world has. And though she doesn't have any knowledge about where she is, fortunately she is paired with a mentor-like entity that can teach her about the world, to a degree. The mentor is limited by what they can say however, as are the mentors of other transportees. This leads to many of the transportees dying as time goes on.

Luckily, our protagonist has a mentor that can and does give out information that they're not supposed to give when they judge it necessary, which always fortunately let's the main character know what needs to be done when the time is right.

Some things are easier said than done however. It just so happens that said mentor has the ability to control the protagonist and pull off feats that the main character isn't capable of doing, to solve things that should be impossible for her. This is, of course, not normally allowed so it was just done that one time.

Our main character also coincidentally has the perfect backstory to most of the problems that show up in front of her - she has experience as a gymnast, and all of the difficult tests that have appeared so far have been parkour-esque tests!

Oh no. Our main character just got into a problem - one of their five party members got kidnapped, and they're too weak to rescue them! How fortunate that they received four powerful items literally a paragraph before this sudden problem popped up: it's even exactly enough for each member of the remaining party to have one! What a crazy coincidence.

--------------

Basically each time things grow tense they're literally saved by the powers of a) powerful mentor doing something that was earlier stated they can't do, sometimes only paragraphs prior, or b) luck.

The author has stated that The Tutorial Is Too Hard is an inspiration for this, which is what drew me to this series, but frankly, they're nothing alike.

The mentor has exactly one ability to directly intervene, which is to put the protagonist into a meditative trance. She doesn't do it just once, but whenever it's useful. And the mentor sticks to the rules about what advice she can and can't give; on occasion she does ask the higher ups for a judgement call but accepts their rulings.

True. But being a gymnast is hardly a huge stretch.

That wasn't a coincidence. She was specifically looking for those exact items, she knew everyone in her party would need one which influenced how many she picked up. And her friend was kidnapped because it was publicly known that she had a high chance of finding those items and the kidnappers wanted to blackmail her for them.

*** I agree with this assessment. My dislike of the story is that it feels too "rat in the maze". Which is literally true. Our protagonist doesn't really do any long or short term planning, or get past obstacles on her own merits. Moreover, the general flaw with this kind of story is that "played straight", where the protagonist is playing the game by the rules and has not found any significant cheats or exploits, it makes for a story on rails. It makes for a story where the protagonist has no agency and thus while the story might be "rational" it's not good to read. Like reading about the fate of a chicken in a slaughterhouse that evades each near certain death by sheer luck because the chicken lacks the intelligence to really plan anything,

**** It's portal-fantasy, where many people are transported into a dungeon-like realm: clear the 100 floors to return home. It is separated by difficulties: easy, normal, hard, and hell.

The main character, being drunk at the time of the prompt, selected the hardest difficulty.

Throughout the series he munchkins through rules and limitations, exploits the levelling system, solves problems that can't be handled with brute force through rational means, and works hard to always be a step stronger than before.

While it's not necessarily rational, it is definitely at least rational-adjacent. I was introduced to the series by Andrew Rowe, author of the rational series Arcane Ascension (he frequently recommends it).

Unfortunately, the translation of it has stopped and been removed, because the series has been liscensed and will now have an official translation. You can read it via machine translation, but I recommend otherwise, as it doesn't do the series justice.

** I've had this on my 'to read' list for a bit. Looks like there's enough written now to sink my teeth into.

Having read it now, I think it's pretty good. I think there's enough features in it that would appeal to the people here even if it's not completely rational. The main character definitely takes unnecessary risks / thrill seeking but you could argue that's a character flaw and not anti-rational. The same character also thinks about how to maximize their use of time (...sometimes).

All-in-all I'll be continuing to read it.

*** To me the anti-rational part is not her risk taking personality - she even makes good arguments for why taking risks is necessary.

The anti-rational part is that she takes lots of risks that pretty much always pay off in her favour, usually immediately. One (ironically the most sensible, least risky one) caused serious short term problems but resulted in pure benefits long term.

**** I was actually kind of rationalizing that on my own. That is, the dimension's goal is to produce strong people of a certain type it makes sense that she's being rewarded for raking risks. (And there's some indication for this given the competitive nature of the tasks and rewards.)

***** My theory is that they're trying to produce soldiers rather than risk takers. The first hub area rewards teamwork but also encourages conflict between teams; after putting everyone through the wringer so they'll be willing to do more.

The demonic appearance they started to get after levelling up isn't a good sign either.

****** Nah, I don't think it's after soldiers as much as adventurers, they are encouraged to infighting to much for this to be training soldiers, there have been some serious hints that the MC is doing well, but not the best she could because she has morals. If she was willing to betray her team or kill other contestants without provocation then she would be in a much better position, and I don't think that the trials would encourage that if they intended for the victors to be soldiers.

******* The argument in favour of adventurers is meta-knowledge of the genre. But I think they're being trained to stand united with their team and be ruthless to other teams. That would work well for an army.

I don't know what gives you the idea that she'd be better off if she betrays her team though? The next challenge (capture the flag? team vs team deathmatch) will probably be very hard if she goes through the door alone.
