** I'm getting worried that I don't have the knowledge base to keep up with this story. Even when I went to church, we never talked about the kabbalah.

Are you expecting that readers will need a specific theological background to get all the jokes in Unsong? And if so, is there an introductory text you can recommend?

Or is the theology of Unsong more of a mish-mash of copyright law and information theory not based in any specific tradition, and we just need a lot of general knowledge to keep up?

*** Kabbalah is Jewish mysticism, so most churches wouldn't delve into it.

What's in Unsong is basically Kabbalah + medieval Christian-inspired alchemy + Talmud (Jewish body of law + stories + commentary on Torah) + cryptography + sprinkles of random science.

*** She might not actually be aromantic, though. If she had been romantically attracted to people in the past, for instance, but wasn't with Aaron. Or she was homoromantic. Or she wasn't totally sure, and was sticking with asexual until she figured it out. Or she didn't want to confuse him, and figured she could get her meaning across by saying "asexual". Or she didn't like dating people, but knew she could become attracted to people after knowing them for long enough.

**** Either way the asexual reveal doesn't add anything to the conversation in that case, the only time you would offer it up first is if you wanted to date someone but believed that they value sex and don't want to mislead them into thinking any sex they have with you would be enjoyable for you except through the vicarious pleasure one gets from seeing someone they care about happy.

Used as a romantic refusal though it is largely useless.

Communication is the key and I can't imagine her character would rather be not disingenuous but not as honest as she could be.

******** Ok, I am not denying that in the entirety of existence that someone has used asexual instead of aromantic. I'm saying that this character would know the difference and making the claim that she is some every day person when it is clearly not the case is absurd. Things that people are "more likely to know" do not apply to these characters.

Also the asexuality is completely irrelevant, people don't specify their sex drive on a first date unless you want to date someone but worry they'll ditch you if they learn of a low libido later on, and you'd like to be upfront about it.

Again she didn't mention anything to do with sex for the whole conversation so she obviously should have said aromantic.
