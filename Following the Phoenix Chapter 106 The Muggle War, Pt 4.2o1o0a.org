I'm curious as to what other muggle nations think about a nuclear weapon being used on the UK so soon after the Cold War. The Soviet Union is gone, but post-soviet states still have their weapons and resources, and so do the Americans, and so do all the European nations in firing range of someone willing to use nukes. Just /moving/ nuclear weapons has caused international incidents that nearly destroyed the planet.

** I was really disappointed that the author didn't fix the glaring time travel mistakes from the previous chapters. After she started working on fixing things, I had some hope, but nope, nothing.

First of all, Quirrell is utilizing the same method that Harry tried for P=NP problem solving. He is collapsing timelines where his attack led to Harry's death. That's not allowed in HPMOR.

Second, it would be completely pointless for Harry to hide /after/ an attack has occurred - because it cannot be changed. Hiding /before/ an attack would make sense, since then Quirrell might not know that Harry was alive - which means that Harry would need to permanently hide. Doable, if annoying.

All the talk about "throwing" bombs sounds weird - this was not well stated, and repeated many times. And the fact that the word "bomb" was used so many times is a problem from a technical perspective.

Furthermore, Harry was portrayed to be rather dumb when he suggested that the wizards could just take out all the nukes and bombs in UK. It wouldn't have worked - especially with the nuclear submarines, and all the stockpiles of conventional munitions. As well as weapons from outside the country. As soon as the wizards decide to officially start a war, US would get involved and squash any opposition. And it has far more weapons.

From a technical perspective this is a well written fic, but there are serious logical problems and issues of scale.

You were disappointed that the author, who has explicitly stated that she didn't agree that the "mistakes" you pointed out were in fact problematic, didn't change them?

Here's a challenge: if I can provide a possible model of how time travel could work that (a) blocks the prime number problem, but (b) does not block Quirrell's trick, and (c) makes it sensible for Harry to hide under the cloak after apparent and potentially lethal Quirrell-interference, will you admit that you are wrong? :)

#+end_quote

I remember I had this discussion already with ElimGarak, although I did not fully present the model. As long as Quirrel only checks that Harry is alive (which he can probably use the horocrux connection for) and doesn't let any information directly about the success of the attack itself go through, he can then timeturner back and either launch the attack if he saw Harry alive, or not launch the attack if he did not see Harry. If his scrying method wouldn't scry at all if Harry is dead of hidden, then he can avoid accidentally seeing Harry dead and fixing that future.

Thus Harry hiding from scrying (which may be difficult given the horocrux connection) would prevent Quirrel from seeing him and prevent Quirrel from deciding to trigger the attack.

An even better strategy may be for Harry to convince Quirrel that he is dead, although because they cannot predict his reaction to this it is riskier.

I still don't see an appreciable difference between this and the prime number factorization problem.

****** The prime number factorization give a larger amount of information directly back to itself. This makes the timeloops very unlikely compared to "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME" messages. Checking for Harry and nothing else restricts the amount of information and makes the timeloop more stable.

So basically with my model, time loops become more unlikely the more information you try to loop back on itself. At some point (at least by the information of two prime numbers) the loop becomes very improbable. Quirrel checking for Harry alive or dead is basically one bit of information and he allows for false positives, so maybe even less than that. There are 143 3-digit prime number, which means there are 143*143=20449 combination, log base 2 of 20499=14.32. Thus Harry's prime number requires 15 bits of information to loop back on itself. Somewhere between 1 bit of information and 15 bits of information there is a point where loops start to become very unlikely. For Harry's prime number factorization to work, he needs a pre-commitment strong enough to make a 1/20499 event the most likely.

Consider Harry's time turner prank on himself, some pretty complicated time loops are possible, it is just given human decision making and the quantity of information involved they are unlikely. The fact that the time turner prank worked could mean that under unusual circumstances, what seem like improbable loops are probable because people are making decisions differently.

*Edit: If I were to make a simple model a given time loop has 1/2^{number of bits of information} odds of success. Thus Quirrel's usage in Following the Phoenix has a 50% chance of working each time, with the other 50% giving false warning for killing Harry. Tricks like prime number factorization would almost never work with this model. If Harry can come up with hashes for 1, 2, and 3 bits of information, he could test this pretty quickly. The 1 bit would work 50% of the time, 2 bits would work 25% of the time, 3 bit 12.5%. He could then introduce other factors, like trying to strengthen his precomittments or passing the information through someone that doesn't understand it in order to see if it still counts as information for the purposes of time loops (if it doesn't, it might explain how his prank on himself was possible).

Stealing this idea. This would mean that Harry's prime number factorization failed because he was making decisions about what numbers to write down based on what number's he received. Also, I said it wrong in my post, the actual space he was exploring was all odd 3 digit number, so a space of 450*450=201601 possible outcomes 1/201601 odds of success. This still doesn't rule out a more decent success rate for more confined solution spaces.

If Harry could find an algorithm that didn't involve such a huge space of decisions, it would have a better chance of working. Hmm... already got an experimental test. Open the envelope, multiply the numbers or do nothing if "NO". If the numbers multiply to the answer, send the number back, if not send "NO". If the odds of timeline stability are determined by the decision space, this algorithm has a 50% chance of success, if determined by information sent back, it has a tiny probability of working (1/201601 or something tiny like that).

***** Alright then! This model is basically what is done in Hacking the Source of Magic, but fleshed out a little. To keep the model simple, I only allow one time jump rather than a maximum of 6 - which means there can never be more than two copies of the same person running around.

These are obviously simplifications. The model /can/ be extended to a system allowing 6 jumps (and in a way that seems to cover all the time travel in HPMoR and FtP I can think of) but I still have to write half a chapter of FtP before Saturday, so I'm trying to keep it minimal. (This actually /is/ an interesting exercise in an algorithm writing challenge, and I fear I have a bit of a tendency to get carried away with that sort of thing. :P)

THE MODEL: the entire universe is simulated by a deterministic "computer", running the following algorithm:

- assume given: a simulation of the next 6 hours, for which we can query every state at every point in time;
- assume moreover that this simulation is /stable/ with regards to time travel: (a) for every person who leaves from timepoint N to timepoint M, an exact copy appears at time M; (b) for every person and object who appears using time travel, there is a corresponding person leaving;
- now simulate either one further second, or until the next person attempts to time-travel, whichever comes sooner;
- if nobody tried to time-travel, we have a stable simulation for the next 6 hours and 1 second; execute 1 second in reality and continue from start with the remaining 6 hours;
- if someone did try to time-travel, say at 0.31 seconds into our new simulation, call them THE TRAVELLER
- now, for every person and object in the entire simulation who time-travels (including THE TRAVELLER): save their state at the moment of travelling, and the exact time they should arrive;
- make a separate simulation of the next 6 hours plus 0.31 seconds, following standard physical rules, except that you magically insert a copy of the time-travelling person at the moment they were travelling to;
- test whether the simulation is stable with regards to time travel;
- if so, execute 0.31 seconds in reality, and continue from the start with the remaining 6 hours simulation you have
- if not, find a stable simulation to prevent THE TRAVELLER from messing things up, using one of the following three techniques: (a) have them give themselves a warning (e.g. NO or DON'T MESS WITH TIME), (b) if a fails, find a minimal interference which severely hurts them (aside from the laws of physics and magic, the simulation can introduce "temporal magic" to achieve nasty effects), (c) if a and b both fail, prevent the travel simply by having temporal magic flare and break their Time-Turner (possibly killing THE TRAVELLER in the process, if we want to be nasty);
- we now definitely have a stable simulation for 6 hours + 0.31 seconds; execute 0.31 seconds in reality, and continue from the start with the remaining 6 hours simulation you have

EXAMPLE: At 10pm, Harry goes back in time 2 hours to study in his trunk.

- somewhere around 4pm, the computer has calculated what's going to happen in the next 6 hours and detects that Harry wants to travel back in time; nobody else happens to be time-travelling in that 6-hour window
- the computer saves "Harry Potter <complete data>, 8pm, has traveled 1 time for a total of 2 hours"
- the computer makes a new simulation, copying the original one until 8pm, then introduces a copy of the Harry Potter from 10pm there
- there are now two Harrys in the separate simulation: the original one, and the copy; the computer simulates the remaining 2 hours where they conveniently don't run into each other
- at 10pm, the original Harry has had exactly the same experience he had before, so also decides to go back in time; consequently, the simulation is stable and is adopted as the real one

EXAMPLE (situation b): at 3pm, Quirrell plots burning the orphanage, but he will only do so if Harry survives. He consequently sends a note to Marielle "at 6:01pm, use that device I gave you, which detects whether Harry Potter is alive, then go back in time three hours and send me a YES note if he did; if he didn't, or you get a message from yourself saying NO, just send yourself a NO note, and don't bother sending me anything". He decides that if he does not get a note, he will not attack the orphanage, but if he receives a YES, he will.

- somewhere around 11am, the computer has calculated that Quirrell has sent his instructions, but never got anything back, since the time travel is not yet part of the simulation; thus, the simulation so far has Quirrell not burning the orphanage, and Harry remaining quite alive
- finally, shortly after noon, the computer has calculated what's going to happen and detects that Marielle will use the device; since so far in the simulation, Quirrell has not burned the ophanage, and there is no message from her past self, she is going to detect that Harry is still alive
- the computer consequently saves "Marielle Dutant <complete data>, 3:01pm, has traveled 1 time for a total of 2 hours, and is carrying a note saying YES <complete data>"
- the computer makes a new simulation, branching away at 3:01, where Marielle arrives and sends Quirrell the YES-note; in this new simulation, the orphanage gets burned

Now there are two possibilities:

- in the rest of the simulation, Harry pulls another stunt and survives; then, the original Marielle still pulls YES at 6:01pm, so the simulation is stable and therefore becomes reality

Or:

- in the rest of the simulation, Harry dies; then, the original Marielle pulls NO at 6:01pm. This means that the simulation is unstable, because the Marielle who arrives at 3:01pm is /not/ an exact copy of the Marielle who leaves at 6:01pm. Thus, the computer tries to avoid the time travel
- a stable solution is found by making Marielle send herself a NO note, which means nothing is sent to Quirrell regardless of what the Harry-checking-device says; the orphanage is not burned, and Harry survives

Edit: this model is /very/ restrictive: a person who has gone back in time is not allowed to interact with a person who is going to go back in time afterwards at all (including themselves). An obvious improvement is to allow one extra "stabilisation loop": if we find that the new simulation is not stable, then rather than immediately trying to stabilise it using a "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME" we can simply save all occurrences of people who go back in time again, and make another simulation where /those/ people get introduced at the right time. This should allow for self-interactions (and, if extended further, for going back multiple times).

****** Huh, I wouldn't have guessed you planned to go with a computable model. You realize that this means either the universe is a simulation, or that magic is maintaining a powerful simulation forward in time. One problem you have is that your source of magic/computer simulation also needs to isolate information of time travelers from affecting their environment. Considering chaos theory and butterfly effects, a slight shift in the atmosphere from a time traveler may result in someone unrelated to the time loop acting differently 5 hours later. Does your system simply isolate these variables? Also, what about prophecies? Their existence implies much longer length stable time loops, or something with tremendous modeling and predictive capacity over reality.

I would have gone with an uncomputable model. Stable time loops simply exist. However, there are some kind of meta-rules which determine what stable time loops are more likely to exist in the first place. If Harry had forced a hard precommitment on himself he might have raised his probability high enough to make his time-turner experiment work. The meta-rules combined with how humans make decisions result in "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME" messages being the most probable outcome when paradoxes might otherwise arise. There is no hard limit on time travel, but a time-turner that goes longer than 6 hours would result in paradoxes too often and just spit out "NO" messages most of the time (with a small chance of working longer under the right circumstances.). Prophecies work by the same mechanism.

Yes, I see - if you are allowed to mess with the rules universe, adjusting things in such a way that the traveler changes nothing, then you avoid the potential infinite recursion and stack overflow. This is possible primarily because you are assuming a deterministic universe and are playing fast and loose with some of its internal rules.

I don't understand why this is different from Harry trying to solve the P=NP problem. It seems like an identical situation, except that instead of solving the very complex prime factorization problem he is solving a much simpler attack / don't attack problem.

The only difference that I can think of is that the computer has a loop counter and jumps out of the computation loop if it ran more than N simulations. In that case it just aborts and has the traveler send a "do not mess with time" note.

This is a pretty big jump though. Especially given what Harry knows and doesn't know in HPMOR. If he came to such a realization on the nature of time, then you should have explicitly explained it in the story - otherwise it doesn't make sense for Harry and Dumbles to spontaneously deduce Quirrell's method.

Now, what about Harry's decision to hide for 6 hours after an attack? If the attack has already occurred then that won't change. Alternatively, if we use the model you suggested above, then why wouldn't the simulation resolve the unstable loop by having Harry stumble and pop out from under his cloak, and get detected? A much safer and more guaranteed approach, one that avoids potential paradoxes, would be to just hide permanently. Or at least semi-permanently.

Well, in truth, I never considered it anything but completely obvious that if Quirrell can ask the future "hey, is Harry alive?" that it makes sense for Harry to try to make the answer come out "dunno" - no sudden epiphanies about the nature of time travel (which won't really be exploited later beyond avoiding further Harry-targeting attacks anyway) are needed if he thinks like me on this point, even without having a direct model of time travel in his mind.

Rationalising afterwards /why/ it would be obvious to him: Harry is entirely familiar with Timeless Decision Theory, as established in chapter 33. Thus, it would be clear to him that /if/ Quirrell is checking the future, that there might be some kind of simulation of the future going on, to determine the message he will get. Thus, it makes sense for Harry to hide under the cloak after an attack, even though it already happened, /because he might be in the simulation/.

(The actual time travel that Quirrell is doing is one of those "background" things mentioned in the author's note for 104, by the way. So eventually it'll be edited in - and then I expect it will seem a lot less miraculous for Harry and Quirrell to deduce it, because the readers have already seen how it works.)

Harry does not need to conclude "oh, then time travel must work like this"; he doesn't need to draw conclusions about the likelihood of succesfully retrieving information from the future. He /only/ needs to conclude that if it is indeed possible to look into the future, confirm Harry-survival and execute a dastardly plot (surprising though that possibility may be), then any such dastardly plot can be avoided by making sure that there is no stable time loop where Quirrell sees Harry surviving after a plot.

I wouldn't think this to be very relevant in ICBM design. But anyhoo, they're wizards. They can teleport things on touch, they can miniaturise, they can turn metal into wool. Not stuff bomb technicians really accounted for.

This might provide a risk in the most primitive bomb designs, like Little Boy, where critical mass is reached by simply sliding two pieces together. Modern plutonium bombs (allegedly) normally use explosives to compress the plutonium to supercritical density, and the explosives have to fire at once or else it is a dud. Fusion bombs typically use fission bomb primers, with similar difficulties in timing.

More abstractly, a military base would not want a couple of suicide bombers to be capable of infiltrating the base and just nuking it into oblivion by performing the same actions that someone who fails to deactivate the bomb would. You wouldn't even want a cruise missile blowing up a missile silo to trigger a nuclear reaction. Tampering isn't going to blow them up.

That might actually work just as well, assuming you can avoid bombardment, but it wasn't the victory condition.

You're saying that like difficulty is something inherent to the problem, rather than a statement about your knowledge of it.

If you're not constrained by ethics, evacuate all wizards to Mars (we've got pictures), then transfigure up nuclear or antimatter bombs or tonnes of anthrax spores and drop them on Earth. Or imperius people into throwing their friends into concentration camps while continually making perfectly clear they're still their old selves except for being bound into servitude. Or Quirrel's zombie apocalypse thing, starting in as many cities as you can get people to cast the relevant inferius curse. Or just use time turners to ensure zero Muggle survivors in every violent encounter, perhaps with reprisals against relatives, though that wouldn't solve the problem in less than a week.

Following the Geneva conventions and staying on the side of Light is a lot harder. Maybe the winning move is just not to play; teleport to Mars, with the wizards who want to come with, leave the Muggles and stupidwizards be, then use magitech to colonise the solar system before the Muggles have interplanetary nuclear missiles. A magical version of the Soviet Dead Hand system would prevent government interference and arguably not be Dark, leaving only the nonanarchic hooligans, all of whom can be taken out with phoenixes, a magic-proof camera (or good memory), and time travel, or shields that block everything but magic. A lot of negotiation also fits in 6 hours, and since mutual cooperation is in mutual best interest, a solution might be found in that time too by a sufficiently clever arguer.

There are indubitably other methods.

If nuclear missile designers are that idiotic, then just teleport a single unmanned magical item to the vicinity of the nuclear weapons and watch as every military base in the UK goes up in smoke.

? I do expect magic should in principle be capable of anything of equivalent thermodynamic work as things already shown, like creating water out of thin air, or transfiguration. And that the HP world is rich in spells of this level, rather than just having the few spells that exist all be suspiciously plot-relevant.

Take [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Arania_Exumai][Arania Exumai]]: It makes for a more sensible world if there are similar spells for many classes of animals, rather than Aragog and pals happening to be the one type of animal which has a convenient "bugger off" spell taught to second-year students.

Other than magic not working away from the earth (which seems to contradict the Pioneer plaque thing), there is no simple rule I can think of that makes teleportation to Australia possible, but not to Mars.

Other than the danger of radiation poisoning - which there really should be a shield for, considering there's a shield against physical objects - I see no reason why rock-to-plutonium would be an illegal transfiguration. Design basic Little Boy bomb, using rock instead of plutonium and lead instead of regular casing. Have the drop be on a (mechanical) timer rather than based on impact. Transfigure rock to plutonium. Teleport to drop location (under shield). Set timer. Teleport out. City goes boom. AFAIK there is no increase in magical effort for sustaining a transfiguration depending on distance, only depending on target size (a couple of kilograms).

Similar with anthrax: Transfigure a buttload of anthrax into a container that blows up to spread them over a large area but not kill them. Teleport in, drop container, set timer, teleport out.

This really isn't too difficult to think of for me, hence my incredulity at you denying it is possible.

Whereas if they all publicly lined themselves up in the middle of Trafalgar Square with muggles surrounding them and guns pointing at them then Quirrell would have a tough time perpetuating anything because Harry needs to rule the world with Muggles too.

That is the solution seems to be if one persons dies they all should die (or at least Harry).

After seeing bodies of their own dead I would expect most people would decry the whole war not just be like "Eye for an eye", examples are surely 9/11. There wasn't even 95% support for the war after that, and that was way worse than this. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_opinion_in_the_United_States_on_the_invasion_of_Iraq#October_2002][Source]], and in this case it's literally bodies of children after two days on both sides. I mean a nuke was launched within 24 hours of first contact (well Ministry contact), surely the vast majority of people are just reacting to this, and most people aren't even affected.

Someone should make a timeline of these events.

I'm a bit confused as to the scale of this, the way it seems to be written literally the whole country is rioting, and that's far worse than anything the wizards have done. Imports and exports grind to a halt, no more air travel or sea travel to or from the UK, the whole infrastructure breaks, people begin to starve, electricity stops, etc. If no one is going to work the economy just won't be functioning.

Again, I'm not really sure why the people of Glasgow would be rioting because an orphanage in Wales was burned. And the amount of deaths in the UK seems extremely small comparative to the population. Interesting that we haven't seen or heard of any effects due to the dementors wiping out 0.1% of the entire population.

Good point. It took months for Fox News and a bunch of other outlets to stir up enough support for a war. And that was an abstract war, in Iraq, one where the first Gulf war was quite successful, and that didn't touch anything.

Even though the danger here is more immediate, there are too few wizards to be that big of a deal. More people die in car crashes every day in UK than could die from wizards attacks. There would need to be a large publicity campaign and effort to get people to organize like this.
