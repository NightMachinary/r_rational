** Two new chapters. Looks like the story is changing gears again..

For the folks seeing it for the first time, [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/23rfda/murasakiiro_no_qualia_manga_hsfish/][here's a link]] to the last post. This was recommended by Eliezer Yudkowsky a while back.

** I honestly thought the series was over when I first read it... But... My god. I don't even know what to say about these new chapters. It's cracking me up... But I'm not sure if that's because of how ludicrous or how awesome it is.
