** I'm glad to see that this is back. Thanks for the update, I enjoyed this one and liked the fight. It was a bit hard to follow but that seemed like it was intentional since so much of the tactics relied on limiting information and visibility. With regards to Neo I think you did as well as anyone could expect. It's got to be hard to translate a character like her that really only works well in a visual medium into a book. Letting her communicate through Torchwick's internal monologue seems like a good call to me.
