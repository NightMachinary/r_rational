** Hello fellow rationalists!

Faith system is a setting I've been working on for several years now. The basic idea is that reality in a given location is dictated by pervasive beliefs of sentient minds in that location, so you end up with a world where people in different regions hold different beliefs, and thus their region - called a dominion - and their region's magic system, politics, ethnicity, and culture all reflect that. Here I present twenty magic systems, each in their own region, each subordinate to the overall faith system, and a detailed description of what the magic system is like in each dominion.

I'm looking for ways each of the dominions' magic systems can best be exploited / made to be broken by some mage in the setting that knows what they're doing and can think rationally about their situation; or if you have any critiques in general. Thanks!

They already know it's possible to do other dominions' magic... for either xian to do it, or people to do it in their own dominions. Xian doing out-of-dominion magic doesn't mean everyone else can then do out-of-dominion magic. The xian are the only ones able to use out-of-dominion magic.

Hmm very good point!

I don't think you should just assume what they would or wouldn't want to do. They may be Xian but they each have their own desires and power levels. If there are 500 Xian and only 40 territories, they will need to compete with each other for territories which implies working together or building armies.

Xian / ascended is about having had such a major accomplishment /relative to your power/ that it's as if you are above the masses. It is in a sense, a sense of self power and self assertion that is founded in one's achievements, by justifies being "full of oneself" so much that one's faith becomes able to break the rules. Repeated outsized accomplishments of this nature result in further extent of ascension allowing for breaking the rules to a greater and greater extent, and allows for one's out-of-dominion magic to become more potent and for the reach of one's out-of-dominion magic to become extended.

I was thinking some of the dominions may have a number of governments, and there would only be a few dozen ascended throughout the setting (and only a few who can use magic out-of-dominion to any substantive extent), and will generally be in charge of the larger governments, meaning most territories wouldn't have any xian at all.

******* Interesting. In real life, the most powerful tend to centralize authority among themselves, forming an elite that rules over the weaker around them. It sounds like the Xian would be able to dominate all non-Xian and thus would subjugate them, but this depends on their tiering levels and power scaling which you may not have fully created.

Be wary of creating inherent races to the bottom. If there are solid reasons for them to work together (mostly, to beat smaller groups) and the reasons not to amount to "meh rather not", over time the larger groups will win out.

In a similar situation as you at one point I posited the reason large groups didn't form was that violent internal conflicts caused by psychological instability took too harsh a toll on numbers beyond N=7-10 or so.

***** Sure, boiled down it's about the image or associations tied to certain geographical locations. As nations culture, heritage and norms progress, it will naturally sharpen into a sort of "background" for that location. F.ex, if a country is set around an active volcano, and that volcano appears in their rituals or beliefs, maybe in the form of fire, that country will have a sort link to their "image" (being associations, mostly) of fire. People who travel to that country will find that images that resonate with that underlying image will progress faster. A fire mage might travel to a country with a powerful image of fire in order to more quickly progress his skills. Likewise, images that stand in direct opposition will be weakened. Water being the most obvious, but also elements that stand in opposition to the associations of fire. Fire is wild, passionate, uncontrollable. A script mage might find his purely analytical approach to mysticality weakened.

It all ties into a bigger picture of actions being limited by belief and thought. A person with an extremely potent personal image is capable of overriding any underlying associations. "True" belief, be it either that you are capable of something, or that someone else is incapable of something, has a real physical effect on the world.

It's hard to put into words, since this part of the universe has always been a bit... flexible? Hope I was able to express myself correctly.

I thought about this as well. Border cities often have some unique or weird combinations of images, as well as travel hubs, like large port cities or capitals with a competent travel network.

Depending on the obscurity or complexity of the magic, you might absolutely need to travel. Certain plane magic needs to be done in a place where the borders to that specific plane are thin, ergo in a location with deep ties to that plane.

All of this is possible, but it's not that restrictive. There are two "main" categories of magic, which are structural and invocation (a lot of magic doesn't fit either of thise, or straddle the line, but when you have a world with hundreds of billions of people and nigh infinite varieties of magic you can never perfectly categorize). Structural would almost be like coding. You're making the spell yourself. It requires a grounded approach. It involves a lot of steps and requires a lot of practice, but the building blocks are similar for a lot of magic. Like engineering. Invocation would be a sort of prayer. You're communing with someone or something, in this case, most likely a native god of fire. You offer something, usually mana, in exchange for it creating a fireball for you.

So in your examples, the alterations to the fire would be far easier to achieve with invocation. Making fire not hurt allies, or change it's properties to something holy is... vague. Now temperature, that's easier to achieve with structural magic. Structural magic almost has adjustable levers for things like size, speed, temperature and the like (the price steepens, naturally, as you increase them).

What I'm trying to say basically is

1. Certain magics are more heavily affected by latent images than others, and

2. Yes, a mage with f.ex. ties to the church could absolutely still produce holy flames in our aforementioned volcanic area. He probably wouldn't even be restricted, as holy fire is close enough to general fire for it not to be a problem. It would be restricted however, if this volcanic region has a specific god of fire. The priests prayers would have to "travel" further, and go through the native god. If that makes sense.

#+end_quote

I worded myself poorly. Those two are what one would come up with if you somehow decided to categorize all magic under only two definitions. It's basically a scholarly concept, not something a mage would actually be familiar with (maybe on a subconscious level). There's a ridiculous amount of variation between them. One of the main themes of the "Indent" (the known world sits in the eye socket of a long dead god floating through space. Mana is dense enough here that a variety of life formed) is just... magnitude. I wanted it be so large that it wandered into "bad idea" territory.

So I looked through my wordbuilding doc for a few magics that go under structural, nad picked the first three.

Battery magic - structural - 2 primary steps. The first step is shaping and enchanting the chosen material, usually mana dense gems. Certain shapes leak mana faster, giving the battery a far lower shelf time. Once it's been properly shaped through either alteration, transfiguration, or with physical tools, one can "seal" it with en enchantment. Usually, you reserve a part of the gem, approximately 10.-15% (known as Matthews cut) to seal itself.

The next step is bridging. You need a channel in order to efficiently charge and retrieve the energy. If time is not an important facter (e.g. not combat oriented), this part of the process needs only focus on % return (making sure as little mana is lost in transition as possible). Otherwise; return%, speed, nature (having foreign mana pumped into you can be painful. Mana that is outside of your body slowly loses your "nature". A part of you, be it an image or a perception, needs to be embedded into the bridge (or better, the actual gem) in order for the mana not to hurt and harm you when received). The bridge can be written into the gem, but more commonly onto whatever is holding the game, like a bracelet or necklace. The gem needs to be in contact with the skin (unless you somehow have convinced yourself it doesn't. In that case, it doesn't. This is perception. A personal image that shapes your thoughts, and by extension, the world around. Extremely hard to do.

This is an example of a magic that is largely structural (the more I use this word the more I feels like it limits me, but w/e), but also has minor invocative elements. Namely the sealing enchantment and embedded image. Perceptions are more structural, but I don't have time to go into that.

Tome magic - structural - amount of steps vary.

Tome magic is transferring a spell to some other portable medium. There's a lot of ways to do this (with varying efficiency). You have to pay the spell cost twice, once when making and once when releasing, but it can make semi-complicated rituals usable on the fly, and allow unexperience mages the ability to wield some serious firepower as long as they have enough of a reservoir to activate the spell. Some other small restrictions apply.

Think of it like writing the spell "code" down on parchment. Word-based magic (inscription, tattoo magic, engraving, language magic) are a prime example of structural magic. Every spell is like a puzzle of the right inputs. Extremely flexible, but hard to learn and often requires either a strong image or powerful personal perception.

If you want two examples of Invocative magic

1. Loaning. Become increasingly adept at something temporarily, at the cost of other skills decreasing temporarily when it's over. Can be temporary.

Invocation magic doesn't require a God, just an image or perception. In loanings case, it's not something you can learn unless you were raised with the knowledge that it's both possible and learnable. It's such a weird abstract skill that most people would subconsciously disregard it. It has no structural merit, basically. In this case, you're basically giving your mana to the overarching image .

1. Kindling. The ritual burning of materials for either mana or effects.

Straightforward. Hard to learn, since no item has a guaranteed effect. The item only changed rules certain effects out, and alters the likelyhood of the remaining ones. Kindling is term for all types of item-based sacrifice, but it's different depending on image. The Hossian priests have different kindling rituals and effects than f.ex. the Nuhru shamans.

Sorry if this is all a bit unorganized. I just copy pasted most of it from my docx.

I do want to have geographically close dominions have similar philosophies. Hence the 4 orientalist dominions are close to each other, as they share ideas like qi, Faeralism being close to Sigilism being close to Traceism, Dreamism being on its own, etc. I don't want there to be too many dominions since when writing a story in this setting I want each dominion to feel distinct, and having too many can get too difficult for readers to follow ("which sect of which dominion are we in again?").

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

These arose spontaneously through people having certain beliefs due to random chance (praying to a storm god and there happening to be peaceful skies that day causing them to strengthen their belief in a storm god) and then the beliefs getting more complicated as more sub-beliefs get tacked on. I call it "fortufaction". There's also "manufaction" where someone consciously creates a new faith (but for this new belief to have actual magical power, that can only happen once the founder has died). Manufaction requires careful setup and some luck because if you as the founder claim that act X causes magic Y and your followers try it before you're dead, it'll fail and they will cease to belief that claim.

Where? Would a visiting magician's magic even work in your dominion? If you're visiting their dominion, you'd see everyone doing it, so you might believe in it, while also believing in your home style of magic, thus weakening that dominion.

A viable tactic would be just sending a significant fraction of your population to another dominion to dilute the belief there.

If the meta-mechanics of faith tended towards discrete states, the distinct border might make since. Still, I like your idea, and I imagine even if the faith magic doesn't quite work right at borders, discrete border are a modern construct, so there has to be a few edge cases were the magic has blended over just a little. Working against this, I imagine the ruling powers find the irregular combinations of magic at borders to be politically unreliable, and thus go out of their way to suppress them or invent tales and legends that work against them. Going through the map and looking at a few the borders:

Blasphemism/Soulism: Demons near the border have sought to capture the souls of their thralls so that they may serve as tools even in death. The Tyrian Barrows are very fortunate that border magic is so much weaker... it takes Blasphemies to make the Soul magic gain any real measure of power, and demons of sufficient rank are rare near the border. Conversely, Soul mages have experimented with using their power on minor demons, but the results are unstable compared to conventional usage of disembodied souls. The most twisted soul mages, spoken of in hushed whispers, are rumored to have succeeded in consuming demon souls and adding blasphemy magic to their arsenal. A few heretical Souls mages have made a study of how oaths can bind souls.

Noblism/Blasphemism: There are several barren island between Avalon and Tyria. It is rumored that in this place there was once a noble house that could command even major demons through their specialty. The stories differ on how they met their end. Some claim they abused their power, causing them to lose it at the most essential moment and set lose horrible demons. Others claim that the Emperor used his power to destroy them for the threat they posed. Some foreign scholars believe these tales are mutually agreeable propaganda. The emperor's command may grow weaker at these isles, inclining emperors not to allow nobles to settle them, and the oath and vows of Tyria grow unreliable on these isles, motivating Tyrians to avoid them. It is speculated by some in Tyria that the Emperor of Avalon has a secret enclave of demon summoners working to put greater demons under his command, but given that not even minor demons can be summoned in central Avalon, these stories are dismissed as rumors.

Prayerism/Noblism. A few Nobles along the border have occasionally tried to convince their servants and tenants to engage in prayer to them. However, the boost from the prayer is barely noticeable, even at the border itself. Conversely, Dominei has propagated stories that the power of nobility to the north is the result of misplaced faith resulting in weaker, impurer, power. These stories have worked to a minor extent: In wars between these two realms, Dominei has occasionally allowed the acclaim of the conquered/occupied peasantry to work as a temporary hybrid of prayerism and noblism, but in the long term they favor fully suppressing the old system.

If so - religions/mages would bribe people to become followers, and the system that gives the most benefits to most people would monopolize the continent.

"Have you heard of omnipotentism? Everybody is omnipotent. Just sign here and enjoy! *small restrictions may apply"

Also - what is the cutoff point? I know you wrote about flexible borders, but you need a cutoff for how many people-beliefs create a domain and how many doesn't. If there's no cutoff and you only have linear combination of people and their belief - the whole world should be 1 big domain, or everybody should be their separate domain, anything in between needs some kind of granulization in the system (cut off or special kind of sampling).

Most people wouldn't, however all the people "at the top" are "in the know" (and it is their being at the top, i.e. ascended, that allows their belief about how the faith system works, to "realize" the faith system itself).

All the faiths are (to varying degrees) aggressive about attracting and keeping followers, defending against other faiths, attacking weaker faiths, inoculating followers from converting to other faiths, monitoring and enforcing the faith of their followers, and hunting down heretics and those who would try to convert others. (Any faith that didn't do this would go extinct.)

There's a kind of "power limit" tradeoff in each system. If a dominion had both the idea that everyone could become powerful and the idea that powerful meant nigh-omnipotent, only one of these would be realized, this is enforced by the overarching faith system. Then either the dominion changes to be one where people believe the former, or it becomes one where people believe the latter.

At any location, the dominion that wins out is the one that the locals believe (subject to things like certain individuals' faiths being overweighted). The closer the believers of a domain are to a location, the more "dominion pressure" they can exert on that location, to influence its faith.

I feel like a system where most people have some magic would spread a lot more than one where only a few will get any and they'll get a lot, in part because the former means you'll see magic on a daily basis and you're more likely to want to continue to believe if you can do it yourself. Also, it's more conducive to armies. Although, depending on the upper limit of power, small numbers of royalty/mages could be just as effective as an army in a more concentrated system.

Yes, but such a dominion would get wiped out because of the lack of concentration of power. The idea is, in a contest between 1 mage with power 1000 and 1000 mages with power 1, the 1000 mages would have little choice but to surrender due their lack of ability to fully bring their power to bear at the right location and their lack of coordination.

This feels inconsistent. As your comment [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dr3240/faith_multimagic_critiquetry_to_break_up_to_20/f6ksaor/][here]] implies, anyone with a knowledge of inter-faith warfare would be well aware that the power of a magic system is largely dependent on the number of similarly-talented mages present, rather than intrinsically tied to location. Assuming that at least some people who engage in such warfare survive and interact with civilians afterward, this should be fairly common knowledge.

#+begin_quote
  All the faiths are (to varying degrees) aggressive about attracting and keeping followers, defending against other faiths, attacking weaker faiths, inoculating followers from converting to other faiths, monitoring and enforcing the faith of their followers, and hunting down heretics and those who would try to convert others. (Any faith that didn't do this would go extinct.)
#+end_quote

The paradox contained in this worldbuilding is that if reality changes to conform to faith, then once reality has conformed, /it no longer requires faith by definition./

What does it mean to "convert" to a "faith" that believes exactly what reality presents? Any mage of any system can prove to a non-mage that their "faith" is real and correct, as long as they're in their dominion, so the farthest anyone could reasonably go toward "disbelief" is thinking that a system's strength is linked to the location of the user (which is still at least partially correct).

The kind of militant policing you describe would be pointless, because everyone would already "believe" in every magic system they'd witnessed, and non-mages would simply not believe themselves capable of performing magic themselves.

Ah, very good point! Seems that everyone would be aware of how the belief system works.

#+begin_quote
  once reality has conformed, it no longer requires faith by definition.
#+end_quote

However, it requires that the peoples' faith doesn't change again, if it did then the reality shifts. People can be misled in their beliefs and if it hits critical mass, or some very powerful people (the ascended) start believing something different, then things change. This is in a sense like having a kingdom - once the kingdom is established, it doesn't need active supporters because it can force people to act like they support it, but if despite that, enough people revolt against it, the kingdom can be overthrown.

A lot of what you mention here are problems I've had to contend with for a while now, without any really good solutions. What would you suggest would be a good fix?

Thanks for the insight!

****** Why does the founder have to die? If you have one guy who knows it is all made up, and a million people that 'know' it is real, why does the one guy outweigh the million? Does the universe keep track of who started the idea?

Also, the founder may know it is an invented system, but surely he still believes that it can do what he says it will (as long as he has enough followers). If he did not believe that, why go to the trouble of creating the new system/religion?

In any case, it seems like there is a possible workaround for a founder that wishes to give himself time to gather followers without risking that someone will attempt to use the new magic before it will actually work and disprove it before it can start. Rather than saying that the founder has discovered a new magic, the founder 'prophesies' that on a particular day a new magic will enter the world. When the day arrives, as long as there are enough believers, the magic will spring into existence. Ideally, the appearance of the new magic would be accompanied by a big sign everyone can see. If you can predict a comet or eclipse or something beforehand, that would ideal, but is probably uneccessary, since the belief that the sign will occur should be enough to cause it to occur. In fact, if it really is necessary that the founder be dead for the magic to start, the founder could prophesy his own resurrection as a way to get around that.

To create a legacy. It could be that only his children will know about the magic system he creates, that would give them an advantage. Also it could be for benefits other than the magic system (like cult leaders in the real world, who can claim to have magical powers and benefit from making that claim even though the magic never manifests).

** The descriptions are vague and need quantification to make this easier. That said:

*Tapestrism:* Depending on how karma works, you might be able to make a death cycle of infinite sin, like in the end of The Study of Anglophysics. E.g. go to an orphanage, collapse a floor with your telekinetic powers, get karma for the dead orphans, repeat, move on to next building, repeat until leveling cities...

*Bloodism:* Wouldn't whaling realistically be a higher-volume, cheaper, easier, and less-likely-to-lethally-backfire source of blood than international kidnapping?

*Dreamism:* Vague as heck, but lucid dreams are probably the easiest way to hack this regardless of the specifics.

*Yin-Yang (typo???) -ism:* Again, way too vague. Provide a spell list or something and it might be possible to find exploits (aside from being genderfluid and flipping every 12 hours, which also neatly avoids the psychoactive effects).

*Blasphemism:* Again, demonic reality warping is too vague. Tapestrism synergy?

*Evocationism:*

#+begin_quote
  Evocation can also be used for affinity with people in order to manipulate them, sense their thoughts and emotions etc,
#+end_quote

Blasphemism synergy.

#+begin_quote
  People can use spirit stones to try to accelerate the rate at which they absorb qi. However this is forcefully over charging a person's natural capacity and is thus very unnatural, and can hamper a person's ability to attune with nature.
#+end_quote

So find a way to transfer qi from person to person, maybe? Or would that run into the same problem?

*Namism:* I hereby name Namism! Jokes aside, obvious Blasphemism synergy. The description is pretty vague, but it sounds like a straightforward way to power e.g. a factory or ship.

#+begin_quote
  The true name sounds to everyone to be simply the common name of the thing, one can never hear the true name being spoken or written, this makes it impossible to know a true name without proper attainment.

Break with Dreamism or Evocationism?

*Soulism:* Gender reassignment, selling youth/beauty, have a minion possess a whale and keep it in one location so you can periodically drain some of its blood for sale to the Bloodists. Put the whale soul in the minion's body when it isn't in use.

#+begin_quote

*Prayerism:* Kinda antitheist. Anyways, get Tapestrists to connect themselves with those who will probably go to hell in order to summon them back. Better yet, pray a Tapestrist connected to another Tapestrist into heaven, have the heaven Tapestrist entangle with various expensive heavenly objects, have the ground Tapestrist recall the heaven one, and have the now-recalled heaven one summon back the expensive heavenly objects.

Or if Bloodism doesn't work that way, use natural gas instead.

Basically, can a dominion's magic only be accessed within the specific dominion? What if two dominions are waring, does the one on offense basically lose their ability to use magic once they get into the other dominion? This seems to me like it would have a huge impact on how war is conducted and probably result in a focus on non-magical weaponry and/or isolationist policies.
