*** 0 out of negative five... so it got the maximum score, then? :P

Seriously though, it's supposed to be a book close, come full circle type of thing. The story starts with Kion assembling the team and them bickering with each other over their titles, and it ends the same way, showing that despite everything that happened and everything that changed, the most important things remained the same.

In my original draft, Kion actually ended up as more of a villain protagonist/ anti-hero, since people liked that aspect so much about Scar. The opening scene of the first chapter was alluding to that possibility, but in the end, he just has too many friends and good people around him for that to work.

In a way, Kion is actually the inverse of Naruto from NTBS. He is everything Naruto desperately wants to be: Respected, acknowledged for his talents, surrounded by friends and family who he can trust with his life. Naruto is defined by everything he is *not*, and the most heroic part of him is that he still chooses to do (what he thinks is) the right thing to do despite all of that. And that's why Kion could not be a villain, even though he kind of has that arrogant prince side to him: If he went evil despite having everything that Naruto ever wanted, he wouldn't be like Scar, he'd just be a brat.

And that's why the final chapter ends with Ono joking that they'll have to fight him too when it seems like all the power is getting to his head, and why it ends with the team joking around instead.

***** Oh. Well, that's not even a real pun, that's just a double meaning. Just about every tenth sentence in my stories has something like that, to remind my readers that I'm Very Clever (tm). Like when Kion thinks "for a second there, he had almost forgotten,"it refers both to the fact that he can use his ability that way as well as to how he forgot that he doesn't have to take care of everything himself.

Anyway, I'm glad you liked the story :P

** That's it! The story is done, and with that, the world of Scar's Samsara finally comes to an end. I've had a crazy hard time juggling multiple stories, so in the end I decided I just had to sit down and finish this one first before continuing with the Need to Become Stronger again. Sorry for all of those who I kept waiting! In my defence, I recently lost my job, so real life has been a bit of a kicker. Cliche excuse, I know.

Thanks for reading everyone! Be sure to leave a review or a comment if you like. I always love reading your feedback, even if I don't always respond to it :)

** Now that it's over and the possibility of a spoiler is no longer an issue, I'm reminded of a question I got a /while/ ago. Namely: given that one of the chapters back in Scar's Samsara was titled Tiryagyoni, with the explanation given being that while Scar (and others) have similar mental faculties to humans, they still aren't human and thus are not manuṣya. Does that imply that there are humans somewhere out there, in this version of Africa? If there are, what are their relations like with other animals? What do animals think of their relatively advanced skills?

*** Huh, you've been holding back that question for a long time then. You must be a patient man. :P

I read the theory once that The Lion King is a post-apocalypse earth where animals have taken over, and I kind of gave a nod to that with Ushari's temple where (if you read between the lines) one of the statues in the corner is that of a human. However, I think it really ruins the mystique to actually answer questions like that in-story. A large aspect of world building I think is to give the impression of a world that exists beyond the scope of the actual story, and a big part of that lies in raising questions that will never get answered. So this is one of those things I like toying with and hinting at without actually having settled on an answer myself. :)
