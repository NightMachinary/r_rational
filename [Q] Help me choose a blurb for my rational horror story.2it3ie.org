*** Argh. I experimented with adding a second question; apparently when I hit 'cancel' it left it in anyway. Ignore the second one.

** I like blurbs short, so I shortened the shortest one. :)

** I liked most of those blurbs, but it defeats the point of calling it a horror story if you offer a way out "...it can all be fixed". I feel you can't have effective horror or even suspense if there's a ray of hope in the blurb itself.

*** Ah, fair point. It was intended to be the hopeful, self-reassuring but not necessarily true, words of the protagonist, but I see how that might not be clear.

I'll keep it in mind for next time, thank you.
