** I'm guessing she didn't start out with a viewpoint so closely aligned with Harry's, but is good enough at making friends and sherlocking that she knew that's what she needed to say to reach him, and maybe also ended up believing it in order to be his friend.

How did Harry guess that the Philosopher's Stone is real and Dumbledore hides it?

Pretty much. People don't really seem to /die/ in the MLP universe, so she's kind of unfamiliar with the concept, but it's easy enough for her to see how it would make someone sad, really, really sad. Pinkie doesn't like to see people sad, and she's very, very good at figuring out what buttons she needs to press in order to make people not-sad.

That said, I don't think their viewpoints were that far different to begin with. She just phrased her own beliefs in a way that would resonate with Harry in specific.

It's mentioned in later chapters that Harry has read about the Philosopher's Stone and its owner, Nicholas Flamel, and it's open knowledge that Dumbledore is friends with Flamel. Although Harry thinks the powers are exaggerated, he expects that Dumbledore is not as skeptical.

As for guessing that it might be hidden at Hogwarts, well, if Canon!First Year Harry and HPMOR!Draco were able to figure it out, I think it's well within the capabilities of HPMOR!Harry to figure out as well.

**** Chapter 119: "Flamel had more blood on his hands than a hundred Voldemorts, for all the people he could've saved and didn't. The whole time, Moody, the Philosopher's Stone could've healed all your scars and given you back your leg, any time Flamel felt like it. Dumbledore didn't know. I'm sure he didn't know."

***** Well, there's the true power of the Stone which Harry is referring to here, of which both Harry and Dumbledore were ignorant of up until Quirrel's revelation.

At the point in this story though, Harry has no reason to consider anything besides the supposed mythical power of the stone, (eternal life and turning mundane metals into gold).

****** Chapter 102 as soon as Harry first hears Quirrel say its name: "If there'd been a mass-manufacturable means of safe immortality this entire time and nobody had bothered, Harry was going to snap and kill everyone."

Therefore, its confirmed existence would be a surprise, perhaps needing more extraordinary evidence to leap to via logic.

******* That's a fair point, I guess we can just chalk this up to different interpretations of what Harry thought of the Stone in Chapter 87, prior to Quirrell's confirmation. I interpreted Harry's skepticism as being about the /powers/ of the Stone, rather than its /existence/. The same way he might look at a Muggle magician's magic wand and say "That's not a real wand."

Discord really only mentions the Stone as a way to get Harry thinking about Dumbledore. At this particular moment, Harry is more focused on this prophecy that Discord is talking about than he is the Stone.

All that said, the Stone is still something of interest to Harry. I suspect his non-reaction in this chapter will make more sense in the context of the upcoming chapter, wherein he has a little chat with Dumbledore about several matters, the Stone being one of them.

**** Huh. I was under the impression that the only immortals in MLP were the princesses, though I only watched up to halfway through season two. Is there anything in the later material that suggests there's no death, other than the writers' aversion to including it in a children's TV series?

***** Nothing really explicitly says that death doesn't happen, but I also can't recall ever seeing a character explicitly die.

But there are several non-Princess characters where it's implicit that they're hundreds of years old. For example, King Sombra courted Celestia hundreds of years ago. And Granny Smith was around at the founding of Ponyville, which is hundreds of years old.

It's a reference to Roko (although there is an SCP reference in this chapter too)

** Great chapter! I only liked the Hermione portions of chapter one and two, but this chapter finally made me like the Harry and the ponies part too.

Harry and Pinkie's conversation was everything that the Twilight-investigating-Pinkie's-pinky-sense-episode failed to be. I quite liked Harry's reaction.
