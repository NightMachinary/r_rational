** RIP, Angelo.

Lily was maimed, and there's a roster full of disabled or missing humans. Things are grim - but then again, this story is about survival.

The aftermath of Chapter 23 has a lot of dramatic tension. The players will need another 1-2 medical tents. The players surviving the battle with the mini-boss and boss will have a flood of NPs, and will get substantially rewarded. Surviving the second day will likely reward them as well.

Player Species C, a.k.a croc-frogs, are monstrously tough. Not only did the two caught in pit traps survive, the ambush party was driven off without any apparent losses - lots of nasty injuries, though. It even seems reasonable that they'd survive their own boss fight.

Nathan's inspiration to use the outhouse's setup function to dig pit traps got a good chuckle out of me.

I'm guessing the players will be flooded by NPs and new skills in Chapter 24. The relatively close match between humans and frogs makes me think that some detente might be possible, at least for a few days. The hard end of stage 1 means that this cannot last - but the arena itself eclipses the threat these enemies pose to each other.

*** With luck that staff works like staves in D&D, and contains charges that can be used to either cast healing magic or amplify existing healing abilities. As the purest mage in the group, this could turn Emma into a powerful healer--which they desperately need.

**** Lilly's headdress gives a 10% reduction to EP cost of Fire and Earth skills. It would make a lot of sense for the staff to have similar properties for Water.

If Ava can recover, they need her to train into /Advanced Healing/ as well. She can reduce Emma's burden, as well as serving as backup in case Emma is severely injured.

***** Tygerion is quite genre-savvy though. It's common for clothing and other equpiment that you wear to offer resistances or passive bonuses; weapons and magical implements typically offer active benefits.

****** You know, you're right. Nathan's ranseur actually does grant Banewolf Poison to the attacks it makes. The staff may well do something similar to that.

*** A small correction: "Of the fifteen frogs they'd seen, it appeared the humans had wounded four, killed one, and captured two."

So there was one killed, at least.

**** Good catch - I saw that on a subsequent read-through.

I suspect the enemies in the pits are goners, unless they have some very effective buffs or defensive skills. Banewolf Poison and the spear injuries will probably make it hard to save their captives.

The arena's rewards for "defeating" enemy players would have me pretty ticked off if I was in that situation. Fleeing players do not count as defeated. It isn't yet clear if captives count, either. I'm hoping they do. A live captive is conceivably more valuable than a dead enemy, and riskier to get. Reward in alignment with risk would make some sense, here. (Maybe even a first-time reward for capturing an enemy?)

** Man, the team is definitely being winnowed down. It fits the story, but it's rough to see people die and be maimed every chapter. Soon there won't be many people left, and the author will either have to stop killing people or introduce a new batch of people to kill.

*** I gotta say, it's kind of sobering adding a [[https://elemental-arena.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Deceased][Deceased]] tag to the characters in the wiki.

That said - while there are references to bloodbaths taking place off-screen, twelve of the eighteen human characters in the arena are living, or at least not known to be dead. So far, [[/u/Gilgilad7]] has been averaging around one death on-screen every four chapters, along with a lot of life-threatening injuries.

Ava, Maya, and Gabriel are all unknowns at this point, so there's the potential for a big shift. Lillian has a life-threatening injury as well. Many of them may be able to recover by learning a Physical skill, and Asahi is on his feet and likely able to stabilize anyone not yet dead. Gabriel's superhuman speed hopefully allowed him to dodge the shaman's frost ring attack - but this may simply be wishful thinking on my part. Water is the destroying element of Fire, so the attack instantly pixelating Gabriel is a gruesomely likely outcome. If Gabriel is not yet dead, he'll be situated close enough for Asahi's /Injury Stabilize/ skill to take him out of immediate danger.

**** Because it would be very difficult to both stop killing people and introduce new people for the purpose of killing them. We don't need Schrodinger's side-characters here, both alive and dead. Unless someone can make zombies, I guess.
