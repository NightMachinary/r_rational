** I'm removing this post as off-topic. This isn't the place to talk about other subreddits, especially if it's just to complain about how they're doing things or the views that their subs hold. Feel free to repost this in the Friday Open Thread tomorrow, which would be a more appropriate place for discussion, or visit [[https://discord.gg/5sutD3W][our Discord channel]].

(A similar post that was about how [[/r/worldbuilding]] or [[/r/magicbuilding]] is a good resource for [[/r/rational]] writers would be less off-topic.)

*** Hi, I would like to join the Discord channel if possible, but the link you posted here has expired, and there doesn't immediately seem to be one on the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] main page. Is there any chance you could send me another, please?

As a side-note, I just recently listened to your work on the HPMoR podcast. I thought all of it was excellent, especially Instruments of Destruction. I look forward to discovering more of your work!

**** I just checked the server settings and that link is still set to unlimited uses and never expires, so I'm not sure what's going on.

You can try this one instead, freshly made: [[https://discord.gg/B9WUbzs]]

Or this: [[https://discord.gg/rational]]

** Your experience suggests that [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] is not, in fact, the sort of community that you're looking for. As is said in that community's sidebar:

#+begin_quote
  Fic submissions belong in the Weekly Sticky Submitting a Fic to the main page of this subreddit is considered self-promotion.

  Posting to the appropriate participation thread, most notably the Weekly Fic Showcase sticky, will keep the sub uncluttered and your fic on the front page for longer.
#+end_quote

Why are you looking to a particular community for something that community is unwilling to give? Have you suggested to the mods that they hold a weekly recommendations thread, where people can request recommendations? When you go looking for fanfic recs, do you only post in [[/r/fanfic][r/fanfic]], or do you also post in fandom-specific subreddits?

Have you discovered archiveofourown.org's site search?
