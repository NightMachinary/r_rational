** I think a lot of readers (including myself) got really excited for a flashy final showdown without realizing the consequences of it: if Cat had stayed and fought 10 heroes by herself, she would have lost and Callow would have been broken. While we all enjoyed the 'heroics' of Akua, it's nice to Cat robbing the Heroes of their narrative momentum once again.

It's even hinted at in the last chapter, when one of the heroes talked about the eyes of the Gods being upon them. It's a familiar climax to a familiar pattern: a final showdown to end all final showdowns, and the heroes would arise victorious after slaying the Black Queen.

Now, Cat gets to win practically. It's pretty clear by now that the only way for Evil to effect lasting change is by winning in small ways. This is Black's education in practice---Cat needs to impact the institutions (i.e. Rozala) and not the Named.

*** This - Cat isn't playing by their rules. She's looking more so at the meta level (ie. narrative, plot, literary flow) in order to act. She saw that the heroes were starting to have narrative weight behind their actions and swiftly moved to cut it off.

In truth, I doubt that Pilgrim even understands that he's part of a story - he certainly doesn't act like it. This meta-level (near fourth-wall breaking) knowledge puts Cat 5 steps in front of the competition in terms of tactics and success.

I'd say that Black has a pretty good choice in successors if Cat is able to maintain this lead.

Black's tactics worked great when he was an unamiguous capital V Villain going up against capital H Heroes.

** It's kinda disappointing that we as the readers know that any peace talks either won't work or won't last. Cat owes Larat crowns, and that oath coupled with the existence of the Princes Graveyard means that Procer has a smack down coming.

BUT, that means we get to (hopefully) guess where things go from here. I think this battle is probably over, but the Crusade likely won't end just yet.

Events that are being juggled right now:

1) Black's battle in the Vales with Pappenheim (also Warlock vs Witch) 2) The Dead King is in communication with someone (likely Malicia, or possibly Tyrant) 3) The Free Cities are getting ready to pick a fight (probably Procer) 4) The Watch is on the march, and with Cat up they're ready to be ported

And I think that's it? The demon of Absence is probably dealt with, in-universe the last time one broke it no one realized for a century or two, so I doubt will see anything come of that

Black may "lose" to White (thus gaining narrative weight to do something downright brutal later on). But White vs Cat, its more likely that White dies rather than Cat in that confrontation.

This is excluding Dead King opening up a 3rd front, which will end this crusade rather brutally. I can totally see Black and Cat teaming up with Crusaders to shut him down, since even Black fears that particular abomination.

While not ideal, allowing the legions to fight in seiges and open field was what they were made to do. The crusade has lots of manpower, but is not infinite. Even if they pushed the front back, all the way to Praes, Malica has already made it clear she will make the Dead King mobilize if she feels threatened.

The crusade will continue if they are forced from the northern pass, but it will not be able to pull off a victory, even in the long term.

Heroes aside, they're absolutely screwed. They're in the middle of nowhere, with no food left, and the nearest city is... a week of march away, I think? That's leaving aside that Cat can make a series of fortification on the crusaders' path to force them to stay in battle formation and slow them down, without ever engaging them, thanks to the Arcadia gates. And even if they reach Hedges, they have to siege the city (which they clearly don't have the manpower or time to do) before they can claim any supplies.

** A leftover thought from the last chapter: what if all the redemption talk from Akua is the set-up for her plan to escape her bindings?

Diabolist seemed to genuinely consider her actions heroic, so the obvious thought is that she's trying to make herself look like a champion for the Callowan side of the conflict, either as Catherine's "follower" or as a narrative leverage to be unleashed at some point. What if she's aware of the greater scope of the coming conflict, and now aims for a redemption story and a common enemy to bring her into the resulting band of five Named? Akua has no way to know about the Witch of the Forest, since she had no previous connection to White Knight's band (or the outside world in general), and the other major practitioner Named all have their respective bands. Even if she suspects the Heavens might have propped up a mage to match Warlock at Red Flower Vales, she might have banked on them dying anyway.

That way, if Catherine ends up maing a truce with Procer (and tries to unseat the Empress, as Akua suspects), she can either return to Praes with a conquering army, putting herself back into prominence (maybe even as a new Chancellor, given her political connections), or fight whatever new opponents emerge, making herself indisposable.

I'm not saying that's a good plan, but it might look feasible from Akua's perspective. Why do you think would she make an attempt at a redemption story?

** Okay, where's the story going? We have Hierophant probably being resuscitated by Cat, and the enemies regrouping. Saint and Pilgrim clearly do not want to play ball with surrender, and may break with Malanza's truce. If they go part way, why not go the whole way - start calling upon angelic powers, break their word with Cat. At that point, they are truly the villains in the story, and I expect nothing good from there on out. But what form does that take?

Do Saint and Pilgrim find themselves abandoned by the heavens? Unlikely, they're the big boys, and even Black, who's the antithesis of his role, has a measure of power. Heroes cheat, and I can't imagine their power failing them at a critical moment, that's far more a villain trope.

Do the other heroes turn on Saint and Pilgrim? Maybe part of them - I wouldn't be surprised if the younger heroes started fighting each other, or at least leaving, if Saint and Pilgrim break truce.

Does Pilgrim disagree with Saint, who decides to try the reverse decapitation strike? If so, she almost certainly dies, probably to Cat + Archer.

Malanza will almost certainly negotiate a retreat if Saint or Pilgrim dies breaking the truce, or a sizable enough group of the younger heroes depart. The real trick will be negotiating without a failing on the other side, what's the carrot? Does Cat take them back by faerie gate? Drop them somewhere they can ravage Black's forces? Or, playing to Malanza, give her strategic information about the First Prince?

The real problem with all the "Saint screws up" plots is that she literally cannot fail to notice the narrative as we learned earlier, so I doubt she will be the trigger for that. But, who knows? Everybody makes mistakes.

***** thats covered in earlier chapters; shes explained why she doesn't want to kill them all, even using conventional means. If she kills everyone then prince whats-her-name is put in too precarious of a position (in internal proceran politics) to engage in diplomacy with villain-led callow.

If instead a retreat comes about because the invading army decides it can no longer commit to the campaign (as has already happened) it puts Cat in a position to diplomatically treat with procer to not only resolve this conflict, but at the same time use procer as leverage against the Tower

She's making tactical concessions in favour of strategic goals.

****** Your very first paragraph is what does not make sense to me in the setting. How exactly suffering heavy loses or even crippling blow would make Procer more unwilling to consider peace?

They are quite politically fragmented and they are only able to wage Crusade because First Prince united nobles with military strength. Collapse (or wipe) of the Procean armed forces in Callow would weaken First Princes position and could lead to another civil war in Procer. It has been also shown several times, that Procer can't wage protracted war and can't afford heavy loses.

So the strategic decision to limit their loses does not seem sound to me. How does that make Procer more likely to negotiate peace?

******* You should Re read some chapter before the invading army arrives.\\
If the political figures leading this invasion were to be slaughtered it would mean that the Proceran would have a righteous reason to strengthen the Crusade.

Also they (Malanza and Co) are the strongest political rivals to the first prince, so having them dead would effectively remove the core of policial resistance within Procer.

You have a point about princes, but she could kill army and leave Prince to retreat home.

Re-read this bit here, it'll be a bit clearer why Cat is acting the way she is.

Also this, on the next chapter

#+begin_quote
  “We can't slaughter fifty thousand Procerans,” I flatly said. “Aside from the brutal bounding our manpower would take in achieving that, it'd be impossible to make peace with Hasenbach afterwards.”

  “Hasenbach's invading us,” the Hellhound retorted. “The high horse stops being that when you ride it to war. If she doesn't want dead soldiers, she has no business sending them to the field.”

  I knew that in speaking that she spoke as an orc. She had the bone-deep conviction that no one with a sword in hand had the right of complaining about death. And there was a lot about that way of looking at the world that appealed to me even now. But that was a seductive simplicity that'd become the kind of luxury I could no longer afford. If I offed half a hundred thousand Procerans, the Principate would be fighting this to the bitter end. The First Prince might very well get deposed if she suggested otherwise. I had to defeat the crusaders, force them out of Callow, but it couldn't be a massacre. Assuming I could even deliver one of those, which was quite an assumption given the number of Named on the other side.

********** I understand why she is acting that way and I remember this part. It also does not make sense to me. If she cripple their armies, what are they going to fight to bitter end with? They would have to raise more levies, basically crippling their economy.

Procer can't afford to fight protracted war. First Prince herself said in one of the preludes that they have to finish in two years. They have Chain of Hunger, Dead King and Free Cities to be vary of.

How forcing Proceans out of the Callow without destroying their army is aligned with possibility of peace? What prevents them from coming next year again?

Also First Prince mentioned that there is too many fantassins as leftover of civil wars in Procer so they sent most of them.

How can Cat sure for peace? She is villain. Procer is rigorously "Good" nation and part of coalition. I dont think there is a way to make peace without something drastic deeds from her side. If she does not destroy their armies, what prevents Procer to just pull back, replentish troops and be back next year?

*********** You're missing two points here.

Cat doesn't think she can actually massacre an entire army of disposables without the *twelve* heroes that are with them getting significant narrative advantage, likely ending the story with Cat dead and Callow folded into Procer (for another 100 years at least). This is precisely why she was adamantly against Hellhound's "bonfire" plan, as it would have similar results.

Second is that even if she managed to massacre the army and the heroes and everyone with them, she is at a significant disadvantage politically.

1. Once again, a massacre on that scale is a huge ass target on her back for the heavens. Heroes will starts popping up everywhere, causing costly local rebellions and forcing cat to kill more of "her" people. Not what she wants.

2. Once Procer is no longer a credible threat, Malicia gets a /lot/ more leeway. The reason she isn't helping or hurting Cat now is the same thing, she wants Procer and Cat to eat each other. Cat wants the same of both her enemies i.e. Procer and the Empress. Which is why if she massacres the Procerans (only with quite a lot of losses on her side since she's outnumbered in Named and regulars) she would be playing right into the hands of the Empress.

3. There are still some wild cards that are in play, biggest of which are the tyrant and hierarch. Cat honestly doesn't know what the hell he wants. Same with Black. You have to realise she's /surrounded/ by potential enemies, all of whom are perfectly willing to eat her up if she shows weakness. And losing a significant part of her army taking down an enemy to /both/ of them, well she would become a tempting target.

************ You bring good points. I guess I just can't imagine anything more serious than Holy Crusade of several nations against her with dozen of heroes.

************* For the majority of the crusaders, the Black Queen is the minor of the threats (at least that's the feeling I get) since the crusade's objective is to destroy whoever has the know how to create the hellgate machine. If Catherine can prove to the crusaders that she is a reasonable ruler and that Procer has more to gain by her being in power, that would be a huge political victory. Which is why she made rules of war with the Pilgrim and offered to ship them directly to the empress' door. She meant it too, but then they couldn't really promise to /not/ invade Callow even if she is doing all this, since a minor threat is still a threat. So that's why they're fighting the fight.

You also have to remember that the tropes are heavily favoured against Cat. She is a recently crowned Evil Queen who has never been beaten in a battle, and the heroes are combining their powers to try and beat her (as a sidequest).

If her actions are that of a powerful villain, wreaking havoc everywhere on the Named, then the time would be ripe for a heroic sacrifice by the Saint and/or Grey Pilgrim to stop her, and then a newly empowered hero would finish her off.

But if she is a reasonable figure, prompting the ending of bloodshed every time there's a chance, suing for peace etc. then the heroes will become villanous, ganging up on the peace loving Queen. Cat is fae right now, so it's possible that she might be able to play both sides of the coin (which may be why the heavens got pissed at her and sent a crusade).
