** I call it rational.

The stuff about people believing what Force tells them, and using this bias against them?\\
The fact that an emotionally powerful moment is actually a multiple-use joke? Nothing more than a trick, useful manipulation?

Yeah, it feels rational.

**** If you were to rewrite the Star Wars Story as a rational fic, from whose perspective would you find it most interesting to do it? If you could start it at any point in the timeline, whose story would be best to tell ( as a rational fic )?

Yoda and Sidious are obvious No-noes for me, but maybe I am wrong? Idk about Ani/Vader, that might change a bit much. Luke or Lea? I've always felt that SW can work very well as the story of Obi-Wan, so maybe that? ^{^} Anyway, big fan, cheers :p

***** I'd rewrite it around Anakin and Obi Wan, I'd make it a war buddy story first with Obi Wan and Anakin two isolated Jedi in the Republic's army, raising in ranks until one is General but the other keeps getting his promotions deferred over his reckless, anger-prone behaviour, then introduce a love triangle, keep Anakin believe himself Luke and Leia's dad, and have a double-take reveal in the trilogy prequels where it turns out it was really Obi Wan the dad all along.

*** I am not sure if this falls under the bounds of rationality but it seems like there is a very common trope where some horrible secret is revealed and immediately believed despite the lack of significant evidence. I suppose a rational take on this would involve the characters deciding to actually investigate the claims and demand evidence before coming to a conclusion.

I recall a similar fanfic for Code Geass where the scene of Schneizel revealing that Zero / Lelouch possesses a mind-control Geass and turns the Black Knights against him goes differently with the Black Knights demanding proof and ultimately remaining loyal when it cannot be provided.

Does anyone else have similar ideas for other fiction?

*** If we're going assuming this is set in the same universe as yudkowsky's other star wars short fanfic, it's because doing so would reveal the secret that the force was evil (If Yoda even knew)

Although, it does beg the question as to why that should be a secret.

**** Experimental records show that a plurality of apprentices (40%) told this, drop out, go home, and then fifteen years later, turn up as poorly trained dark-side users.

Another twenty percent, go home and manage to just live out their lives as exceptionally lucky individuals that never consciously use the force.

5 percent go home and manage to stumble into becoming a poorly trained "light" side user - that is, a user that does not go crazy.

10 % take the logical consequence and jump of a cliff.

25% sign up for proper training. This is not considered ideal.

** In this universe, Force Ghosts are actually manifestations of the viewer's subconscious mind and can't actually tell them anything they didn't already know. Otherwise, Obi Wan's force ghost would have corrected Luke.

*** I don't know why you think that either this or HPMOR are attacks against the source material. All this is doing is pointing out that there is some absurdity in the idea of your greatest nemisis, the man who killed your teacher, coming up to you and claiming to be your father, and you just believing it. That doesn't mean that the scene would have been better if Vader pulled out a birth certificate, it's just using the absurdity to create humor.
