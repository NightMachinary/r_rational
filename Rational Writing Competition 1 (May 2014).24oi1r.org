Following a [[http://en.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/24gaex/q_should_we_have_writing_competitions_here/][thread suggesting regular writing competitions]], and [[http://en.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/24hzu7/inaugural_rrational_writing_competition_thread/][one seeking input]]... welcome to the first [[/r/rational]] writing competition.

There is no concrete plan, so the winning conditions are /very flexible/: the winner is whoever is commonly judged to be the winner; disputes will be arbitrated by the Defense Professor. There are two divisions: one for original work, and another for finding an existing work (fanfiction will be allowed in both). Entries can be of any length. For original writing, consider [[http://www.terrybisson.com/page2/page2.html][these tips]].

The challenge will run until the end of May. Prizes may or may not exist; they'll probably be special flair and come in four flavors - for winning and participation in each division. Participation prizes will remain open indefinitely.

*Prompt:* /A plan is fixed at the last minute, someone explains a problem, and important information goes unrecognised./

To enter: (added to clarify, thanks [[/u/Drexer]] and [[/u/Calamitizer]])

1. Post a comment in this thread

2. Specifying whether it's [entry:original] or [entry:found], with those tags

3. With either a link to the text of your entry, or for very short entries the whole thing in the comment


** [Entry: Original] Alright, [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mVL90CJgMMgc6As-Jtq6EhjBx5aq-VBRaR7yYTFEr7Y/edit?usp=sharing][here's an attempt]] since we have no entries at the time of this posting. I reserve the right to edit based on feedback (or when I reread it later and realize what all the problems are).

** [Entry: Original] Here's a fanfic for The Originals. It has spoilers up to episode 17. It's about Marcel trying to figure out a way to defeat Klaus, a vampire who's very hard to kill. Not sure whether it's good enough to be considered rational, but I'm open to suggestions for improvement: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10327304/1/If-They-Can-t-Be-Killed]].

** I'm not sure it quite fits the parameters of the contest, but in case it does, I just finished Book One of S.I., an original bit of fiction, at [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AU8o3wSAiufh-Eg1FtL-6656dNvbCFILCi2GbeESsb4/edit?usp=sharing]] .

It fits well enough to count as participation!

** Questions:

Will there be a "Best In Show" prize?

Is each item in that list a prompt or a required element of the story?

*** Not unless we get multiple entries!

The prompt is something to start from, so any or all or none is fine - it's meant to be a structure not a stricture.

*** Text! More seriously, if no one wants to read it that's not good - but anything goes. I enjoy short stories, but if someone writes a brilliant poem or script that's great!

** So is the idea for people to submit their stories through comments or posts, or through links to some kind of site? I personally feel the second option works better(specially if taken as a rule for every participant), at the very least because it allows each author to be in charge of his own fformatting and to circumvent the limitations of writing in a reddit post(which hardly helps those who read).

In a similar way, will it work with a free submission period or is it planned to aggregate the submissions and release a master post with them for voting when the month ends?

*** Commenting here is obviously required for entry; where you post a story (or find one) is up to you. I'd recommend using a link to elsewhere, but I'm not going to disqualify something short enough to fit in a comment.

I hadn't even thought about it; I guess if we get enough entries a voting-post would be useful. We'll see.
