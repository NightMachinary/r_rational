** So no one else is terrified that our primary Magus has been collectively raised by genre-savvy monsters /sarcastically/? I feel like this explains a lot.

*** "What are you talking about? I was told that one should always speak and dress casually when visiting nobility, Uncle Amadeus says they are constantly surrounded by people being formal and polite so this is a nice change of pace for them. I'm not doing the spitting though."

** Given what we know of Masego, leading him on with lady Ubua's name seems a tad cruel.

*** I agree, but this is team evil raising the next great evil wizard. I suppose Masego is lucky they are such a oddly kind group of evil villains.

** Wait, so who was that guy at the end? I'm assuming a high lord of something? Or maybe Assassin?

Also: henceforth she shall be called Lady Ubua!

*** I like the suggestion by one of the commenters that it's the high lord hosting the party. It both makes sense that he'd be important enough to be the one to talk to Warlock afterwards, and that Black would find it funny when Masego snubs him.

** #+begin_quote
  Uncle Amadeus' face was blank again. It was like that a lot, around Papa (Tikoloshe). Father said they didn't get along very well but when Masego had asked why, he'd just said it was â€˜complicated'.

***** Inteligent demon, capable of flirt any non named to do his will and maybe powerfully enough to forcefully make his will be done had it not be for the wards.

Also black does not like to rely on magic for the important things unlike a magical being.

**** The same goes for Catherine. She didn't make a big deal out of it. On second thought I think it was someone else that wanted her dead and Amadeus decided against it, but still.
