Short version: The author of /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11228999/1/Fargo][Fargo]]/, [[https://twitter.com/IMBavitz][Bavitz]], is beginning the sequel, /Chicago/, on May 5th.

Long version: Having recently finished a group watch of all of Madoka and Rebellion with my friends, I thought to look up Fargo and link it to them for their consideration. Upon doing so, I noticed that the author had published a second story related to Homestuck without me realizing, and sought to find out more, as is my habit.

After some cursory googling, I found the AO3 version of his Homestuck story, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10619448/chapters/23486718][Modern Cannibals]], and, on his profile page, a link to his twitter account. There, he tweeted his plans to write Chicago, and the date mentioned above.

I have no idea whether his claims of being a published author are true, or how relevant they are, but it's clear that Bavitz has an... interesting style of maintaining an online presence. I had no idea he had an AO3 or twitter account (though clearly the twitter account is not in regular use.)

I assume there are others in this subreddit like myself, so I decided to submit my findings here as well. At the very least, I suspect most of us were not expecting a sequel to Fargo to come out in a week.


** That's some very good news, I enjoyed both stories immensely and I'm looking forward to his new one

** I do not think it's a sequel. Bavitz mentioned that it's "an *original* dark and psychological urban fantasy featuring high school girls as protagonists", i. e. not a PMMM fanfiction. Albeit that tweet seems to be deleted, there are still, not to put too fine a point on it, /ways/ to access it.

Bavitz is also active on a Discord server of a subreddit related to one of the two stories OP mentioned, though I'll similarly refrain from mentioning the particulars, since Bavitz seems to value anonymity. Frankly, I already said too much --- the rest could be inferred with a bit of work --- but my desire to share valuable findings is only slightly weaker than my desire to be ethical.
