****** Well there's plenty of stuff that seems like magic. Organised by type (not all of this has been shown so you could just not have half the moves exist, but I expect you can do better than that):

- Psychic is the big one, practically everything they do seems like magic, teleportation, mind reading, telekinesis etc..
- Fire, while mostly sorted out as not magic with the flammable materials being expelled, still has the question of why things like fire punch don't burn the user.
- Water, while absorbing and expelling water seems not magical pokemon seem able to hold more than their own volume in it (I won't mention this again if I see any other examples of it), though with things like pokeballs it might not be magic. Moves which affect external supplies of water are pretty magical though, being effectively water only telekinesis.
- Grass, there's a mix of simple muscle like hitting things with or shooting out plant parts, which isn't magical, spores which might be magic but are probably just drugs, and then you have absord which magically sucks the life out of things to heal you and solar beam for a sun powered death ray.
- Rock and earth (they seem pretty much the same), are a mix of simply throwing rock, mud and dirt at things, which isn't magical and limited telekinesis that only works on rocks, dirt or mud.
- Poison doesn't seem to have anything magical.
- Ice seems to have the ability to instantly cool things to sub zero temperatures, which is probably magic.
- Fighting is a mix of non magical muscle and magic by another name ki and aura based attacks.
- Dark and ghost seem to be magic, it's mental attacks and 'energy' blasts (can't think of any other way to describe things like shadow ball and dark pulse).
- Dragon appears to be a mix of brute force, like dragon claw, and magical stuff like creating twisters, fire that doesn't count as fire typed, dropping meteors on people and whatever dragon pulse is.
- steel type seems to be mostly hitting stuff while being made of metal, though there are things like flash cannon which might be magic and there's the occasional bit of metal only telekinesis.
- Normal is a mix of muscle power, supersonic and hypervoice style sound based attacks which are probably all nonmagical, and some weird stuff like hyper beam which seems rather magical. Probably other things, not much pattern to the normal type.
- Flying seems mostly wing and beak based brute strength with a few wind based attacks which could easily be perfectly mundane as wings are used as fans thrown in.
- Electric types have kind of been explained, but the details of how they create the differences in charge and such haven't and certainly seem like magic.
- Bug type moves seem to be mundane physical attacks bugs use, a few mundane web based attacks, the sound based bug buzz which might well be mundane, but there's some stuff like signal beam and leech life that seem like magic.\\

I think that's the lot, if there are mundane explanations for all of that I hope you include some of them in future chapters.

******* Great write-up :) I guess I should have clarified that I meant human-based magic, since we were talking about Bill, though that list only includes the vaguely magical psychic and "Ghost" powers, and "Ki," none of which approach the kind of powers that pokemon can use.

I'll definitely be explaining more of those as the story goes on, though some of them will definitely get cut, or changed somewhat. For example, I'm thinking Hyper Beam is going to be a sound-based attack, since all other Special Normal Type attacks are sound based. Maybe a beam of sound so intense it forms a defined beam of kinetic force. What do you think? Too much of a cheat?

********* Many of the non-Sound based Special Normal Attacks are variable types, like Weather Ball and Judgement and Hidden Power. They can be Normal type, but they're clearly some form of magic that only include Normal in their permutations because their Type changes based on other factors

Tri Attack is a strange case, because it's clearly a Fire/Ice/Electric attack, but because it was made in Gen 1 I guess they decided to just balance them out and consider it a "Normal?" Maybe the technology wasn't there to make it count as all 3 types, and they figure it would be too complicated for kids to have a move that acts like all 3 types at once. In any case I have no qualms about making it an actual mix of the three elements it represents.

I'm okay with Razor Wind as Normal instead of Flying as an exception because it seems to be similar in effect to other Normal attacks, ie, getting cut.

Swift and Wring Out, however, I don't really have an explanation for. I'm not sure why Wring Out is Special, there's nothing in the description that makes it seem like it should be. And the stars formed by Swift seem to be just magically formed sharp objects thrown at something, so there's no real getting around that.

So you're right, there are enough exceptions to this rule to invalidate it. I guess I'll treat Hyper Beam as an energy based attack after all :)

I have always seen Tri Attack as an indication that there is something more to normal than meets the eye. If you had an attack that is both Fire, Ice and Eletric and launched at a Grass type, it would be super effective, since both fire and ice are SE and Eletric is resisted. In game, however, it behaves like a normal type move. And then the Pokemon God is normal-type. And as you said, every move that can change types is normal.

It works in my headcanon.

In Game of Champions, it was some sort of mind-transfer... that doesn't seem technologically possible here. In a parody web-comic (Nerd Rage I think?), Bill was actually cosplaying and was trying to distract Red from realizing this with the science stuff. Metronome seems like it can do anything...? Maybe the mechanism is some sort of ability to copy moves from other Pokemon and implement them, and Bill figured out how to leverage it into getting the Clefairy to temporarily copy his mind? Or just copy his vocalizations, for something more moderate?

** Great chapter once again, interesting to get a few more specifics about evolution, though waiting a month for an explanation about Bill might be a bit annoying (though that's just my own impatience lol). Anyways, I have a few questions if you don't mind me asking:

- Considering you referenced Alolan forms, I'm curious if 6th gen Pokemon are in Origin of Species's universe or not (dunno how you'd explain/work around fairy types though...)?

- How do Pokemon that are said to get along well with humans (Eg. Goodra, Lapras) fit into the more overtly hostile nature of wild Pokemon in Origin of Species (as compared to the main series)?

- Have human psychics and sensitives in Origin of Species ever considered/researched if their powers are some form or parallel of synesthesia as a possible explanation?

This was discussed a bit in an earlier chapter, but I'll add it to the FAQ when I get home: Fairy type exist, but as an "inactive" type. Right now they're considered a myth, but when a Xerneas awakens from hibernation, its Fairy Aura activates those around it, who then activate those around them, and so on, until the Xerneas goes into hibernation again.

As far as I'm aware, synesthesia isn't consistent across people, while psychic phenomenon are. What I mean is, two people with sight/taste synesthesia might describe the "taste of Green" differently from each other. Psychics tend to have different power levels, but the same stimulus brings about the same sensation/feeling.

Obviously, Yveltal can't activate a type like Xerneas does, since Fairy is the only type that needs an explanation like this. I'm curious about whether Yveltal will 'suppress' a Fairy typing, or suppress some other type, or if the phenomenon will be marked as a rare case of asymmetry between counterparts.

Maybe "more evenly than ever". Also the tense is weird for the second clause. Maybe "his ekans shoots out of its mouth every time it is attacked". Also you use "him" to refer to the ekans in the next sentence, but "its" here.

** After the past few chapters, something's been bothering me.

I really feel like Red is completely ignoring how unprepared he is to deal with emergencies, which seems out of character for him after being exposed to so many dangerous situations already. I get that he doesn't care about becoming a strong battle trainer, but it doesn't seem like he's even considered training up a few of his pokemon to be strong enough to protect him when the shit hits the fan.

It just seems strange to me. I mean, he reflects on his mistakes and comes up with countermeasures for the future, he's been shown to have good judgment and forethought when it comes to preparing /stuff/ he might need to increase his safety, and he can usually make sound situational judgments, but he hasn't even /considered/ making a deliberate effort to strengthen, let alone evolve, his pokemon. In a world where you can get attacked at any time, where he's already had some of his pokemon killed, and where he's already witnessed like 10 people die who had stronger pokemon than he does, it just seems really out of character for him to ignore this key part of risk mitigation when he's supposed to be smart.

I guess maybe he could be subconsciously avoiding doing so because he wants to maintain his self-image of being different from "Blue the Battle Maniac", or he could just be caught up in his intellectual pursuits and ignoring it, but it should be REALLY obvious to him that *survival is priority number 1* and that he's woefully unprepared from a pokemon strength standpoint.

*** Thanks for the feedback!

So there's something I'm struggling with a bit, and namely it's that there's only so much screen time to devote to every activity Red and the others engage in. I try to summarize their travels to keep the story going, and I've been also trying to do the same with their training. Red and Leaf are both still training their pokemon to make them stronger: they just don't focus on it the way Blue does, so it doesn't take up screen time.

I'm planning on only highlighting his training when it's in reaction to something specific, or has some particularly important thing happen (like when a pokemon evolves). But the trade off to that is that it seems like he's not doing it all that much, which I'll definitely have to work on making more clear.

**** Hey, no problem. Thanks for the quick response! I totally agree that screen-time shouldn't be wasted on mundane things. I feel like it'd be fine to have it happen offscreen, as long as it's mentioned at some point, because otherwise it just seems to undermine Red's character a bit. Might be a good chance for some introspection too.

For example, maybe when the three reunite after they'd split up for a while to do their own things in Cerulean like they did in Pewter, one of his companions makes a comment like "Oh, your Charmander looks bigger" or something. Then Red can explain that after seeing the Charizard save the day at Mt. Moon and realizing how ineffective Charmander's ember was during the crisis, he's been spending some time each night battling in the trainer house to try to get Charmander closer to evolving so he'll be more prepared the next time there's an emergency and he'll be less likely to have his pokemon die again.

Just an example, but probably wouldn't take up too many words, provided the events you have planned for their stay in Cerulean have room for Red to do something like that.

Even if he doesn't have a chance to take action yet, I think it would increase the realism just to have him consciously recognize the fact that even though he's not aiming for being a battle trainer, he'll still need to put more effort into increasing his team's battle ability some way or other so he and his pokemon will have a better chance of surviving the next disaster. (Though I'm sure you can figure out a more interesting way of addressing this).

Anyway, really enjoying the story a lot. Just caught up today and signed up as a patron for you. Thanks for the story so far and keep up the good work!

****** Yup, that's me! And you're welcome, you deserve it. I'll probably bump up my pledge eventually, I'm just still trying to figure out what a reasonable monthly budget is for me to spend on supporting the various authors and translators whose work I read.

About how I found it, I'd known about it for a while, just from having seen the chapters posted here on [[/r/rational]], and I've been following your Rational Writing audio series. I had a long backlog of stuff to read though, so I just hadn't gotten around to it until recently. (btw, if you got a bunch of spelling/grammar reports in the last 48 hours, those were probably mostly me.)

Now it's gonna be torture having to wait a month between updates because I'm so into it! But I followed HPMOR from the time the very first chapter was posted on LW, so I'll manage somehow. Planning on starting on /Mother of Learning/ tomorrow.

(As a random thought, have you considered setting a Patreon goal for more frequent updates? Like once you reach $X/mo, posting a chapter every 3 weeks instead of every month? I know a few fan translators for Japanese light novels who do something similar, but I'm not sure how extensible that is to original writing, or for your personal situation. Might help bring in more patrons and/or increase the pledged amounts, so just figured I'd bring it up.)

Yeah, this is something a lot of people have requested, but unfortunately there's no realistic pledge amount that would free up time to write that much more. So much of my time is spent researching and revising that it's too inconsistent to promise three weeks instead of four, but I'm still thinking over ways to expedite the process so that maybe, with some reader assistance, I'll be able to get through those parts faster.

Well, I said a "bunch", but it was more like 5 or 6, spread across all 35 chapters, so not a huge deal if you missed my feedback specifically. The only spelling mistake I remember is in the second(?) interlude where you said "Was" instead of "Wax". The others were just minor subject/verb plurality or conjugation agreement and a missing preposition (a "to" I think) somewhere. But yeah, worth taking a look. I actually thought that plugin was one of the coolest things I'd seen in a while, so would be nice if it worked properly, though if a comment/explanation field could be added to it, it'd be even better, as I sometimes had trouble trying to figure out what to highlight to convey the issue when it wasn't just a spelling mistake.

Yeah, I figured after reading your FAQ. Just wishful thinking on my part. :) When I've had to make similar work-time vs money tradeoffs in the past, I started using pickup-dropoff laundry service instead of going to the laundromat myself, paying for a house-cleaner instead of doing it myself, and having a Virtual Assistant take care of some of the more tedious aspects of running my business.

Well, if you ever feel like test-driving anything, I'm open to giving it a shot. I can do near-professional-level editing of academic and business writing (so sentence structure, phraseology, & spelling/grammar) and probably slightly above average content & storytelling editing/feedback from a literary perspective (I used to be involved in some creative writing feedback groups on sffworld), and I'm a seasoned LessWrong veteran for all that's worth. Feel free to give me a shout if you want to run anything by me, even if just as an experiment.

Cheers!
