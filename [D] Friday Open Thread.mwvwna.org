Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.


** So a Random Omnipotent Being (ROB) plucks you out of reality, and has you choose a world to be put into. The ROB allows you to choose the story type, but not the specific setting. What would you choose?

- time loop

  - single reset only, /or/
  - reset upon death or time limit (Groundhog Day, Edge of Tomorrow)
  - no powers or magic ("real world" -ish), /or/
  - straight-up historical (Connecticut Yankee), /or/
  - one of the below settings

- isekai

  - SI into an existing fictional setting you are familiar with

    - fantasy
    - SF
    - historical
    - horror
    - superhero

  - setting you are not familiar with / brand new system
  - generic RPG (D&D, Pathfinder, etc.)

- a standard fantasy, SF, or horror setting (not based on anything, no LitRPG elements)

  - where you are not human or humanoid

The time loop which allows resets upon death are implied to be "hard" and that you will die a lot, with a specific exit condition. A single reset scenario implies that it won't be quite so deadly and you just live out your best life.

My personal top choice would be a single-reset time loop in the real world in modern times. I should be able to develop molecular nanotechnology, achieve biological immortality, and have a grand old time.

My bottom choice would be a superhero setting, Marvel and DC seem to have world or universe-ending threats every year. Not sure I'd want most SF settings (besides Ian Banks' The Culture) because of the same. Ditto for video games like Divinity: Original Sin with universe-ending void coming for us all.

*** I mean, can I just pick "SI into Hamilton's Commonwealth" or "SI into a pealed world in Alicorn's Effulgence" or "SI into Erogamer with over && of %"? I may be dodging the spirit of the question here, but one of these options seems vastly more munchkinable than the others.

(No, not the Culture. That's a /sad/ civilization whatever the depicted tech level. I'll go someplace where people are /happy/ thank you very much.)

Yes, definitely. The question is more about who is risk adverse / adventuresome. Or learning about other decision criteria like munchkin-ability that override survival concerns.

It is also interesting to see what people like to see others go through vs what they are willing to go through themselves.

I can set why being considered an occasional amusing pet by the Minds of the Culture might not be appealing.

But none of the other Involved civilizations appeal to you either? I'm not the type that would enjoy living with the Affront, but there might be others that have broad appeal. The Gzilt were very meh.

**** I'd go with "SI into Duane's /Young Wizards/ universe, with an option to peal".

The metaphysics are /actually good for people/, the moral arc of the universe literally exists and is bending in the good direction; options for inter-{planetary,stellar,light-cone,continuity} travel, etc. And the Mobiles constitute aligned superintelligence with a personal interest in Earth!

The only downside would be twinges about the opportunity cost of my chocolate consumption.

*** First thoughts: I wonder if I should choose a fantasy setting for the novelty or stay realistic for uplift power/initial understanding? I also love so many settings that I would do literally anything to avoid getting put into (40k, WtC, Worm etc).

Next and last thought: Pick The Culture every time. It's the most utopian setting I know of.

*** It's hard for me to justify picking anything other than The Culture. Admittedly you're only looking at ~300 years of living in as close to heaven as is possible for sufficiently advanced technology to construct, but that's a lot longer than any of us is going to live.

I'm at least a little bit insane, but as a Graydon Saunders fan I would be tempted to pick "SI into the Second Commonweal as a low-to-mid-range Independent". I could plausibly expect a lifespan in the many-centuries, and I think the work and life might be agreeable. But like, would I pick that over the Culture? Aw hell naw.

There's that Mass Effect fanfic where humanity goes the upload route. That could be good too. Not as utopian and wonderful as the Culture, but unbounded lifespan (unlike the Culture).

Some will upload, some will become drones, some will still live as biologicals. But most choose to pass on after a while.

*** Picking The Culture seems like choosing a specific setting so I'm not rolling the dice on maybe getting 40k instead, unless 'utopian sci fi' is its own genre.

Isekai Fantasy seems seems like the best roll of the dice, as it's fairly conventional to have fantastical powers on insert and only a handful of awful settings compared to paradise settings.

Also, I feel like I'm misinterpreting what single reset means. Isn't it just one reset only? Eg, a one time rewinding of the clock. Because if so, you'd have to already have molecular nanotech right now if you could develop it in a reset and you should totally share.

Yes, I mean just a single jump back in time for one person. And I would totally share the tech. I don't have the power / resources to just develop MNT right now, but going back in time would give me more time / leverage to do so.

** Hi I've just discovered the genre and I'm curious about the definition. I mean - "Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear." " the fictional world follows known, consistent rules" - doesn't most good writing try to achieve this? I haven't started a RF story yet.

I'm curious as to - what would be famous examples of a character acting irrationally because of tropes? In some big piece of pop culture like Star Wars or Harry Potter say?

#+end_quote

Yes and no. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index#wiki_characteristics_of_rationalist_fiction][The "rational" this sub strives for]] isn't the same thing as good storytelling: most of the world's literature, including all of its best-known and highest-regarded works, are not "rational," and there are stories within the umbrella of "rational fiction" that most people here would accept as being fairly rational while also acknowledging that the storytelling isn't very good.

Something important to note but which is not made very explicit by the sidebar and wiki is that, insofar as "rational fiction" is a genre, that genre is more or less defined as "whatever this community likes." It originally sprang up around Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, but the makeup of the sub has evolved significantly in the intervening decade, distancing itself somewhat from the self-identified "rationalists" and gravitating more towards [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index#wiki_defining_works][stories with certain themes]].

#+begin_quote

Sure. A couple of easy answers off the bat include Dumbledore's decision to hide the Philosopher's Stone at Hogwarts-- (Why? Why would you store the valuable immortality McGuffin at a /school?/) and Obi-Wan's decision to hide Luke, out of all the worlds in the galaxy... on the planet Vader grew up on... with Vader's only surviving family (great hiding spot.)

Now, these are plot holes, but rational fanfiction is less about sneering at the badness of the holes in the original, and more about exploring /what if that wasn't a plot hole./ It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I tend to find things I enjoy here more than anywhere else these days.

Edit: Here's a few of my favorite selections:

- /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time][Branches on the Tree of Time]]/ (Terminator fanfiction) is one of my favorite time travel stories ever.
- /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13451176/1/Chili-and-the-Chocolate-Factory-Fudge-Revelation][Chili and the Chocolate Factory]]/ is a love letter to Roald Dahl and satire that also manages to hit on just about all of this sub's major buttons.
- /[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/antimemetics-division-hub][There Is No Antimemetics Division]]/ is the SCP Foundation at its very best.
- /[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868][Cordyceps: Too clever for their own good]]/ has some lovely subversions of tropes near to this sub's heart.
- /[[https://unsongbook.com/][UNSONG]]/ is an example of what's often called "rational-adjacent" around here. A delightfully original romp.

Beyond webfiction, I'd also recommend the [[https://www.amazon.com/Laundry-Files/dp/B078JHPNDV][Laundry Files]] by Charles Stross (who has also written other fiction that qualifies in my opinion.)

*** I've tried a couple approaches but nothing really satisfies. Current tech can generate audio that is basically indistinguishable from something a human could theoretically produce, but it can't create what I'd call "narration" without a ton of extra effort. Notably:

- Punctuation, flow, and timing are still very difficult
- Speech inflection is extremely complex. The best models can pronounce question-marked or exclamatory sentences, but that's mostly it

Any current publicly available classical TTS or AI-TTS read provided text like a dry user manual. This is fine if you're having it read wikipedia pages aloud, but falls apart when story, particularly dialogue in any form, is present. My guess is that we're between two and five years away from 99%+ automated story narration.

Right now the cutting edge can do it, but it requires extensive work and tuning. You need to manually go in and tell the computer to pronounce a specific sentence [angrily] or indicate exactly when it should pause.
