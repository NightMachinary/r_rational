** For fun, here's another bundle deal on books from [[https://storybundle.com/ai][Story Bundle]] with a theme on Artificial Intelligence. However, I haven't bought and read those books yet, so I don't know if they are good enough for a recommendation here. So try them at your own (monetary) risk.

**** You must have read my comment too quickly. I wasn't talking about Sanderson's books, but rather about the books included in the Artificial Intelligence bundle.

*** Sanderson's Laws of Magic:

1. An author's ability to solve conflict with magic is DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL to how well the reader understands said magic.
2. The limitations of a magic system are more interesting than its capabilities. What the magic can't do is more interesting than what it can.
3. A brilliant magic system for a book is less often one with a thousand different powers and abilities -- and is more often a magic system with relatively few powers that the author has considered in depth.

*** Not so much magical science, as a dedication to magic as an element of worldbuilding rather than an arbitrary tool to drive along the plot.

** I'm kind of disappointed that nobody who has read his books has showed up and given their input on how good and/or rational they tend to be.

*** Brandon Sanderson is amazing. His books are better. The characters are deep, all with their own motives, and the worlds that he builds just make sense. His magic systems are gamed pretty well by his world's inhabitants, and their full features are mostly explained in an appendix at the end of each of his books. I started with his stormlight archives series, and have started his mistborn series. Both contain epic fantasy plots that don't involve the idiot ball. All in all, I'd highly recommend them to anyone.

**** Seconded. While not perfect examples of rational fiction, they do a pretty good job of making characters follow through on intelligent decisions.

See above regarding Sanderson's laws.

If you are old enough to have read/heard of the wheel of time; he's the guy Robert Jordan hired to write his last two books after he knew he'd die before he would finish. This speaks to characterization and writing skill.

In Mistborn Sanderson makes an evil empire and then takes three books [[#s][minor spoiler book 1]] to show how the evil emperor [[#s][bigger spoiler for the series]] i.e. he was bad but not just trying to be evil.

Elantris is among other things about the rediscovery of a magic system after it's catastrophic loss through dedicated practice and a "that's funny" moment.

Perfect State is a Trans-humanist nightmare/dream on a level with Friendship is optimal, though it doesn't make that much sense at the second level if you ask me.

There's a lot of shorts here and a lot of filler. That said Snapshot, Legion, Emperors Soul, and Perfect State alone are worth 15 if you ask me. The only full length Novels I see are Elantris and Warbreaker.

If you like the fantasy here you'll probably like these and end up reading the rest of Sanderson's Canon [[#s][spoiler explaining how most of Sanderson's fantasy is in the same universe]] the excepted stories are SF shorts.

Post formatting edit: Disclaimer, Obviously I'm a big Sanderson fan
