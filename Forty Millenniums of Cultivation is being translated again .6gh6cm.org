*** I learned about it in this subreddit so I thought other people from here were in the same boat as me.

That said I don't really feel it's irrational, I don't remember having the feeling of "well this is obviously stupid". Sure, so far the main character has won basically every encounter but hey, survivorship happens in the real world too.. I don't think there's a lot wrong with a story like this.
