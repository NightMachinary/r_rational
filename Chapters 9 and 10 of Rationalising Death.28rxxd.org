Now I'm going to run away before I'm spoilered, because I could do with rereading from the beginning to remind myself what's going on...

** I posted this in my review but will do so again here. Minor spoilers for those who have not read past chapter 10 I guess.

I have trouble keeping characters in my head, they all end up like Misa in chapter 10 as aware of being a character within the mind of someone else and then become puppets. I can't stop them from having the thought and just stop acting out the stories in my mind. I put to much of myself into the characters for I can not abide by someone not thinking every once in a while their existence and what they can do about their life.

This makes it really hard to write stories for any length of time for me. Perhaps I am just being silly, and this is just me drifting away from the topic I want to write. Anyway, I just want to hear if anyone else has that same sort of trouble as myself when it comes to writing.

*** [Spoilers for chapter 10]

I don't have that problem because I generally don't virtualise characters as smart as I am (or smarter, in the case of Misa), and even when I do, I cripple them in that front. Mostly. People think in different ways, and not everyone smart makes all the necessary leaps to reach that conclusion, and even when they do they might do it in different ways. Light and Misa reacted in wildly different manners to the existence of the death notes, and L himself, in spite of not knowing explicitly about the DN, has his own ways of dealing with the knowledge.

That said, it's a thing that's been... /irking/ me in most rationalist fiction, especially fanfiction, or all fiction that has supposedly ultra-smart characters, that /no one notices/ that they're obviously in a Dark Lord (or god) world. So you can imagine how happy I was at having a character /finally/ realise it.

And as Yudkowsky once said, realising that nothing exists, or that everything is a dream, or that reality is a simulation, none of that really solves any problem. Sure, reality is a simulation; what /then/? What new predictions does this allow me to make? What kind of simulation is reality? What are its rules, how does it work? Those are all things that can be explored and exploited, and in the end, they all make for a good story.

And of course, if a character focuses too much on the fact that they're not in a "natural" world, they might lose focus on the world they can /actually/ affect, and achieve nothing.

So what I'd say is: if all your characters end up realising they're fictional, /what then/? What happens? How do they react? What do they do? That can be /awesome/ fiction to read! I'd love to see where you take a story where all characters know they're in a DL world and how they use that knowledge.

**** It isn't exactly rationalist fiction, but [[http://www.undefined.net/1/0/][1/0]] sounds similar to what you're looking for. The author features directly in the story though, so it's pretty different from what you would get if there is no line of information to outside the Matrix.

If you realise you could be in a fictional world, not just a simulated one, but a work of fiction, you can in principle become genre savvy. Try to figure out what the author wants or how they think and how you can use that to your advantage. Misa can reasonably establish that, being one of only two known humans with access to supernatural artefacts, she is a main character.

That means her atypical properties are probably intentional, such as her humanity, Japanese nationality, intelligence, her habit of carefully checking her conclusions, her rationalist knowledge, and her discovery that the world might be fictional. Combine these, and you find that if it's a fictional world, it's one written by humans, with near-baseline intelligence, with a major theme of "what you do if..." - both about the death note and the discovery of the fictional nature of herself.

Given this, she would have to answer what the moral value of herself and other fictional characters is. Her instincts are designed to mirror those of a real human, so empathy may be a case of undue anthropomorphisation. And sure, she might think she feels, but that's exactly what fictional characters who are nothing more than a basic simulation in the mind of baseline human authors and readers thinks it thinks: "Maybe this is what being read feels like?"

I don't know how this can be discovered by people inside the matrix, but the moral consequences are massive. If the author is human, then the people of her world are not even sentient, and her goals should focus exclusively on affecting the real world. It might be that the best she can do is to shut up and be a main character, but that seems unlikely. For one thing, the real world is probably notably lacking of /her/, so if she's even slightly selfish, she would support the notion of being made real (by making people remember her and create a sapient being in her likeness after the singularity). Also, the readers are morally important, so she should be invested in making a good story.

If it is a simulation or fiction of a different sort, it is possible that her world does have moral value. That she and perhaps even the other people can't be neglected. In that case, she should care about the state of the world she lives in, and try to steer it to a good result. That may be as simple as proving to her author that her world is morally significant and begging them to improve it, but the author might not be so kind. Escaping the matrix is nice, but more complex.

To summarise, depending on her ideas, some good ideas for what she could do are:

1. Continue to test and think about world status.

2. Check moral status of herself (or protagonists in general) and the rest of the world given likely scenarios.

3. Try to break out of the box, or create something similar to her outside the box.

4. Fourth wall breaking stuff. Tell the author to talk to her if she's being uninteresting, make jokes at the fourth wall, try to make a good story, etc.

5. Make sure her world ends up well. Not likely to be important, but who knows.

***** Well well. I thought [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_and_George][Bob and George]] was the first online comic (or first I'd seen, anyway) that had the author hirself appearing in the strip, but I checked the date and B&G started a few months after 1/0. Totally going to read that.

  */Bob and George/* was a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_comic][sprite-based]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webcomic][webcomic]] which parodied the fictional universe of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_(series)][Mega Man]]. It is written by David Anez, a physics instructor who lives in the American [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States][Midwest]]. The comic first appeared on April 1, 2000 and ran until July 28, 2007. It was updated daily, with there being only 29 days without a comic in its seven years of production and with 2568 comics being made altogether.

  Most /Bob and George/ strips are still images. The initial strips were mostly done in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF][GIF]] format (occasionally using [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG][JPEG]] for more graphic-intensive comics) before converting to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics][PNG]] in May 2004. In addition, occasional comics are animated using either animated GIFs or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromedia_Flash][Macromedia Flash]]. Some of the Flash comics have the characters speaking, voiced by Anez and others (often forum members). Animated comics are generally used for the annual week-long anniversary parties (usually culminating in a brief animated comic that recaps the events of the past year in a matter of seconds), for especially climactic scenes, and for a series of videos depicting an in-comic event known as "the Cataclysm".

  The comic's plot is mostly made up of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_arc][story arcs]] of varying lengths. Amongst past story arcs there have been retellings of various Mega Man games (which often play out quite differently from the originals), as well as battles against powerful foes. In addition, many of the story arcs involve either [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel][time travel]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_universe_(fiction)][dimensional]] travel, and villains who want to kill all the characters.

**** Then they start acting out-of-character to test the boundaries, and all your fans stop reading the fiction because it lost its consistency.

***** Mostly it goes into a recursion cycle as the characters in my head split out into everything I could think of doing while knowing I was a fictional character. All the way from shutting down to trying to stage a takeover and become me, which we would not be able to tell if they succeed seeing as they already are me given that I am the host simulator... thing. Others become commentators and debaters much like HPMOR!Harry. /Shrug/
