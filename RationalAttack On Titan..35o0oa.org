Honestly, I've never gotten into this show- I couldn't, The background was just too depressing for me. Therefore, I'm not an expert in any sort of way.

Humanity, the most warlike species on planet earth, is handed an enemy where the only option is total eradication, and instead of a cold war of technology, they just sit with their thumbs jammed in their asses for a hundred years. At least, this is what I've gathered, feel free to correct me.

So, obviously, that would be the first thing to change. The spiderman-cables-thing is a nice first step, but really. Does anyone actually familiar with the show have an idea of how a rational, or at least more realistic society would have reacted to the events of the backstory, leading to a better starting point?


** AoT has a recently crapsacked world. Tech stagnation isn't really their fault, as they get stomped down to almost nothing and have only 100 years to recover. If anything, them being able to make those huge walls and maintain gunpowder and complex pneumatics at all is what is unrealistic. It is hinted that humanity surviving was intentionally allowed by some intelligent agency, in fact.

What with all the magical, physics defying stuff going on in the plot and world building, I'd just invent a new titan-esque thing to base a rational plot around for a rational fic. I'm not familiar enough with the story to give other than obvious ideas, but it seems to me that the usual flesh-only supercomputing, high-energy exploits, and a universe that plays fast and loose with mad-science chemistry would be a good place to start.

*** I agree with your post's points about the magical, physics-defying things that happen in the world being strange, but I don't think that precludes a rationalfic!AoT story. As long as the author has a good set of offstage rules governing the events, it's possible to have rational characters and irrational NPCs interacting to create a rationalist or rational story.

Remember, just because it's rational doesn't mean it has to obey our interpretation of physics. In the as-yet-unwritten rational!Gurren Lagann, Simon still goes beyond the impossible and punches reason to the curb. Simon's irrationality was cultivated by Kamina, who saw that irrational thought gave Simon power. Sometimes, the rational course of action is to be irrational.

**** Building those rules would be interesting. And that's sort of what I was suggesting: decide on something as the "reason" things are the way they are, make a new "thing" to focus on, then turn on the story progression and see what happens.

I don't think rational AoT works when you just put in rational actors discussing how absurd titans are, was my main point. That's how a lot of rational fics go.

A better comparison might be, speedrunning a platformer versus speedrunning a racing game. In most games, minimizing time isn't the explicit goal, so there's usually easy exploits around saving time because the developers weren't thinking in terms of preventing that. Racing games, meanwhile, were designed around a zero-sum time-based competition, so there's (usually) no low-hanging time-saving fruit.

Likewise, military settings already assume that everyone is sensibly using decent tactics and strategy and maintaining decent OPSEC/COMSEC and running an R&D department and doing siege and trench and guerilla warfare where appropriate and performing espionage and trying to sway the locals with propaganda, etc etc. So there's no low-hanging killing-the-other-guys fruit in a military setting. (So when there /is/ a shortcut, it's usually more an intersection of military with diplomatic or economic interests. All the Vorkosigan total-war-is-imminent scenarios resolve this way.)

I think that's where a new MacGuffin comes in. It doesn't need to be the solution to all the world's problems (and shouldn't be), but if it can just get the mad science chemistry or the weird teleporting mass thing within reach early on it would make for a story with actors who had some agency.

If you are the first guy on an engineering project to put together a tank in WWI, what you do suddenly matters a whole lot, even if the first tank out is kinda shit. Same with the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._L._Hunley_%28submarine%29][American Civil War and the first sub]]. That's an interesting story even if it doesn't swing the tide by itself, with only a half dozen or so decision makers.

And hey, it would be nice to read a rational fanfic where that /wasn't/ enough to win the day and people still died, like happens in AoT all the time.

*** Agreed, I find the 100 years cowering behind the wall to be entirely believable. 99.9% of the population of earth appears to have been wiped out - that's more than enough to usher in a new dark age. We had 1,000 years in europe without developing much military tech to boast of. Also, yes, in large populations, you always have a core of ambitious competent people who move the important levers, but in a single city, there's no guarantee you'll get people competent and ambitious and motivated and who actually succeed at getting a large amount of peasants to follow them.

How they maintained as much technology as they did? That is a little more tenuous, but there clearly was an organized effort (or otherwise an act of "god") to build those walls and set up the society, so the military was almost certainly in place from day 1. The only highish-tech items you see are pneumatics, gunpowder, and railroads - all very important strategic tech. If there's any knowledge that'll survive a dark age, it'll be knowledge of religious or military significance.

******* I don't think [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws][Clarke's Thid Law]] is meant as a statement of fact so much as more of a way of explaining outside-context problems to the layperson. It is so outside everyday experience that thinking of it as "magic" comes naturally to the untrained. The threshold for "sufficiently advanced" is too subjective and too general to be useful as anything beyond a starting point. Much like the concept of "magic".

** Timelooped is right, there's a lot of background wonkiness and secret reasons going on in the background of the manga that make it a bit early for this kind of criticism.

That aside, generally speaking I would expect humans to make underground tunnel systems, unless titans showed both the ability to sense humans underground and the capability and intelligence to dig well. You might even see a slightly gurren lagann-esque underground human expansion thing going on.

The only possible easy answer to the titan problem as a whole is some kind of plague or bioweapon. Again, wonky physiology magical stuff going on with the titans might nullify this in the canon, but if titans were just huge, dumb, predatory animals, it could work extremely well. You'd need to develop it in a sect of humanity completely separated from the rest and in secret (potential to wipe all of humanity out significant), but it's certainly feasible.

** The titans as portrayed in the series are very stupid. Stupid enough to walk into a wall of spikes to try to get at the humans above it.

After the fall of the outer wall, there were 250,000 people who could not be fed, and were sent out to be eaten by Titans. 250,000 people killed in the most brutal fashion of the series. The most elite warriors in the army tend to have killed an average of 10 titans, for perhaps 1000 titan kills in the entire army.

This means we have 250,000 people who could have been used as fishing bait - humans attached to hooks of sufficient size to suspend a titan from - and killed 200,000 titans instead of 1,000, without being any more cruel than the leadership in the series. Given how stupid the titans are, there are probably ways to do this which aren't 100% fatal to the humans being used.

--------------

The area around the gates is the worst defensible place in the city: a large, flat open terrain where the titans can roam free and humans are bound to the ground. That makes no sense: the gates are a bottleneck and a known weak point (after the fall of the outer wall, but also because common sense) and should therefore be designed to be the most easily defensible.

The entire city should be designed to be inconvenient for Titans. In the series all the rooftops seem to be conveniently at arm height. Buildings should be too high for Titans to see over, removing tactical information and allowing them to be more easily attacked from high ground.

Underground tunnels should also be commonplace, too narrow for Titans to enter and too deep for them to break into.

Use giant tree forest wood in construction. There's enough of it to go around.

--------------

tl;dr: AoT is running on rule of cool, at the cost of making leaders tactically incompetent.

** (Spoilers below)

As far as wall design, it would change every few decades. There would be pockets of Titans within the city that were sealed off and exterminated in the process of reconstruction and likewise there would be instances of individual towns getting isolated and surrounded.

The 3D gear has to change, but not as much as most people are thinking. The very specific weakness of the Titans means the gear as shown is in fact almost optimized, given the tech we know human society has. It's mentioned that projectile blades don't have enough power to penetrate the neck, even when aimed perfectly. The Titans burn hot, making ropes or even chains not viable for more than a few seconds, especially when combined with their strength. If you dig a trench, it will fill with living Titans and the next wave will walk over their heads.

The Titan-shifters complicate things, as usual. If you can't get rid of it, roll with it. Titans don't get their mass from our universe, but rather an adjacent hell-dimension. That's why they burn hot. The heat is leftover from the punch between realities. That's also how the shifters can grow fifty meters in height and why they leave their Titan bodies behind when they change back. This makes the walls being made of abandoned shifter husks especially practical, as its a fast and seemingly infinite building material that can be molded by the intent of the architect in a matter of minutes instead of months.

That's all I've got right now.

** The Mobility Gear is, by far, the coolest part of the show - *cutting out the spiderman cables would be like writing HPMOR in a non-magical world.* Yuck. I say take their existence as given, then analyze /how/ they might work, and ask what sorts of clever tricks /and/ clever challenges might these mechanics present!

As for intelligence of the characters: the true bad guys and their motives still have much to be revealed. The government and some military officials are off to save their own skin, and are content to let the rest of the world burn - this is despicable, but quite realistic. It's even rational, according to the problem of collective action - they can let someone else save the world while they stay safe. Meanwhile, among the heroes and villains we see so far, no one holds the idiot ball to my notice. Heroes take their job very seriously, and don't take stupid risks. So points there.

Honestly, there's not a glaring hole to correct in a Rational AoT, as far as I can see. Have more fun with the 3D Mobility Gear, replace cowardly government officials with ruthless and forward-thinking individuals, have the humans better prepared, and step up the threat from the baddies accordingly.

Also, if you're on the fence, watch it. I never watch TV anymore, but my word, that show is amazing, and it was all I could do not to binge it.
