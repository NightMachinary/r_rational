I'm looking for a ratfic based on Atlantis. It could have aimed to complete HpMor's Atlantis Arc, or have a completely different standalone storyline.

I have this mild OCD that makes my brain itch thinking about incomplete structures. So, I guess I'm kind of trying to placate that.

All recommendations are welcome. Thanks.

:D


** I think the talk of Atlanta in hpmor is inspired by (or even a reference to) another fanfic. I think "Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time". I had read it a little before I read hpmor because it's in Yudkowskys favorites list. I don't thinking that fic is especially rational, though. And I think it's not finished.

It's complete actually. It's been complete since 2010. You might be thinking of Harry Potter and the Heartlands of Time which is the sequel and was completed just last year (it took 8 years to be finished).

*** It's not rational, but it does have the satisfying catchphrase "Because I'm Harry /fucking/ Potter", by a genuinely dangerous incarnation of the character. After the waffley disarm-spamming of canon, it was a pleasant change.

****** I'm not sure if I still get your Waffley disarm-spamming thingy reference.

But to this:

"Hi, I'm Harry Potter. At this moment, I'm being chased by genocidal terrorists who are actively trying to kill me and all my friends. I know! I'll use a spell that temporarily disarms them, assuming no one has a backup wand, or could ever recover their own! Brilliant tactics!"

I couldn't really contend your response.

********* Well, also, what bugs me is expelliarmus is a spell taught to 11 year olds.

We teach 11 year olds basic ways to fight - from karate, while some kids hunt with rifles.

​

Yet it's still nothing like the kind of heavy firepower you'd use in a real battle. Even the kids using rifles aren't using them like you'd use a military assault rifle, or using the supporting fire and explosives you'd actually use.

​

So it just felt weak when Harry faces armed assailants with basically just a kid's spell. Even though it worked, the victory didn't feel earned.

** Sam Hughes' [[https://qntm.org/ra][ra]] could scratch a similar itch. It's not HP, and the magic system is pretty different, but the logic and origin of the magic system are explored and explained.

** Not an exact match but if you are looking for a continuation there is Following the Phoenix which is a continuation of hpmor from chapter 81. It doesn't feature Atlantis itself but closes off part of the story arc in a way.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10636246/1/]]

There is also significant digits which is another continuation of hpmor.
