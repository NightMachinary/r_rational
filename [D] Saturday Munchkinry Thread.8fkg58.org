Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind!

Guidelines:

- Ideally any power to be munchkined should have /consistent/ and /clearly defined/ rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
- The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
- Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something /powerful/.
- We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!


** A reader of my story /Delphic/ suggested I present Hector's situation for munchkining. Minor (not major) spoilers ahead.

Hector lives in Detroit in a modern superhero setting. Technology is roughly equivalent to our Earth. Hector has the ability to View any time in the past between 1950 and the present, in any location on the Earth's surface (upper mantle to low Earth orbit). He can widely control the angle, position, and "playback speed" of what he sees. He is limited to a normal optical vantage: visible (and very near UV) light. He can freeze and carefully observe a particular "instant" (approximately 8 ms minimum resolution).

Super powers exist, but are mostly physical. A power like Hector's is not publicly known. No powers are known to break timelike causality (there is a lightspeed delay when Hector Views a distant 'present').

In Book 1 of my story, Hector has been making money by taking FBI bounties and providing information to super teams. What else should he be doing?

***** I do not believe that lip-reading actually works with any accuracy. My assessment of what I have seen/read is that it is mostly using body cues and situational awareness to infer meaning, and in any case where the info is not already known (such as names or addresses the person is not already cued for) the accuracy level is 'educated guess.'

If anyone has done reading/research on the subject, my mind can be easily changed.

However, Delphic has an advantage the humans in the last, most realistic, test (that had an accuracy of 12%) does not have - he can change the angle and speed of his viewing, repeat it as many times as he likes, and compare with the other participants of the conversation, written notes, powerpoint slides etc. that are present.

Unless it is important for the plot that he does not "hear" anything, I think that he would want to address a clear weakness in his power in some way.

******* Thank you; I will continue to look into it.

Although I haven't brought this up in the story, the idea is that Hector made some very costly mistakes early on relying on lip-reading, and came to the conclusion that it is more likely to give him false information than actual new information. He deliberately avoids doing it so as not to bias his conclusions.

As the story progresses, it would make sense that he would continue to make efforts to resolve this limitation, because adding the ability to understand what people are saying would be a /significant/ power upgrade. I do not intend to limit it arbitrarily for story reasons.

******** Lip reading is at best only 30 to 40% accurate. It's because there are too many sounds that form the same lip shape when speaking. Try looking in a mirror and silently sounding out 'pat', 'bat', and 'mat'. Lip reading is only used in situations when one can know fairly easily what the other person is likely to say such as speaking to a cash register at a grocery store. My source is American Sign Language classes in college which taught how poor lip reading actually is.

Any type of forensics becomes almost trivially easy. (Oh look a dead body. A wonder what killed them. A sniper bullet fired by that guy who was hired a week earlier by that other person.)

Diagnosis of machine problems is also easy. Did you know that it takes tens of thousands of dollars to ship out workers, rent a lift, etc. to inspect a wind turbine? If he can do it while it's running, all the better.

Search and rescue, Amber Alerts, missing persons, etc. are all of mixed value, but also easy.

Check if he can see 68 lightyears away (at "present" time), or if there's some other strange interaction. Do astronomical research.

Coordinate with a satellite monitoring system, and get him to focus on things they notice. This would massively increase their utility and his.

*** How long does the mental processing for the ability (i.e. deciding what to view, selecting a place and time, etc.) take? How long/often can he use the ability?

Since it works up until the "present," he can just choose to view "the time from X+1ms ago until 1ms ago" (where X is however many milliseconds it takes to use the ability) repeatedly to give him effectively-current vision from any spot on Earth.

Even if repeated usage causes mental fatigue, or if the "processing" takes enough concentration to preclude training himself to repeatedly select the same location as soon as a 'video' ends; he could still use it that way intermittently to get the equivalent of "bursts" of omnivision X seconds long that are 'out-of-date' by X seconds.

I'm assuming that by "until the present" you mean "until the /beginning/ of the playback" - if you meant "he can only view things that have already happened /by the time he views them/" then his 'omnivision' wouldn't even have to be delayed: He'd just have to start an X-millisecond-long viewing at some location from (1ms before the mental 'start' command is given) until (X-1 ms after the command is given). Then, at every point during the viewing, he's still technically seeing 'the past,' but the net effect is that he effectively just sees what's currently happening.

The last one might be a bit too OP though, so if you'd rather avoid it just clarify that whatever 'video' he wants to view has to 'end' at some point before he starts to view it. Even then, though, he could still just continuously start new, extremely short 'videos' (as in the previous paragraph) as quickly and for as long as he could.

Honestly, unless it takes a notable amount of time or concentration to 'focus' on a particular 'video' there's nothing else that I can see really stopping him from doing this. Even if there is, though, a slightly 'out-of-date' version of "X-Ray Vision, but as far away as you want" is still super OP and much more obviously munchkinable.

I haven't yet read your story, so I don't know what Hector's goals are, but when you say most known powers are 'physical' I'm guessing super-senses aren't unknown. So if he wanted to moonlight as a 'conventional superhero' he could use the above technique (or variations along the same general lines of Viewing things from an extremely short time ago until the present) to fake 'standard' X-ray vision, or a 'human/object sense', or really almost any number of enhanced senses.

Or, considering he's already working with the FBI, I can imagine they'd find someone who could spy on anyone, anywhere, in nearly real-time incredibly useful. Depending on how high his 'security clearance' is, the CIA would love to have him, too.

TL;DR: The power as written could effectively be used as if it was a "See arbitrarily far away with a delay" power; the utility and munchkinability of which I probably don't need to point out.

Then, ask for your yes/no question: "Is the [number] digit of pi the digit where the sum of all useful human knowledge..." etc.

Additionally, the answer to your question is almost certainly too deep into pi to compute the numbers, probably so large that you won't be able to actually say the digit because it's so long, and maybe even so large that the amount of information needed to remember the number is more than can fit in a volume of space the size of a human brain.

However, I like your approach of using the answer as a formality and the question to store data. You could just ask "Sorting all humanly useful knowledge from most to least useful, what's the longest statement I can remember?" then "Is [that statement] true?"

** You have a time travel device where you can get information from the future. It will answer only yes or no to any question you ask. However, it can only answer questions about a hypothetical future where the device doesn't exist.

So you can ask 'will it rain today?' or 'is the number I wrote down the winning numbers of tomorrow's lotto?' and get accurate answers. However, questions like 'will I lose the device tomorrow' or 'will I be alive tomorrow' would most likely give wrong answers or no answers at all, because the question is only answering about a hypothetical future where you don't have the device and it isn't influencing your actions. So questions about your future actions will only be about a version of you who suddenly doesn't have the device.

How would you use it to make money in the shortest amount of time? The device's fuel will only last for a week before it dies and you need to make a million dollars or more to buy more of the fuel within the next week before it breaks down permanently. The device can answer questions beyond the week of its battery life if needed.

For hard-mode, the device can only tell information of the future within the next week.

For nightmare-mode, you have earn a million within 24 hours instead.

For abyss-mode, you need a million within 24 hours and the device can only tell you about the future within the next 24 hours.

*** With this machine, you can break any cryptographic challenge. For example, here's how you would exploit bitcoin.

The size of the nonce for bitcoin is 32 bits. Find an appropriate nonce, and you get a mining reward. Now, everybody else is doing this by brute force. Test a nonce, and if it fails, increment and try again. With this time travel device, you could solve the problem much quicker.

- Get a bitcoin miner whose nonce can be manually specified.
- "If the first bit in the nonce is set to 1, will the program terminate sooner than it would have had the first bit been set to 0?"
- Set the first bit according to the answer given.
- "If the second bit in the nonce is set to 1, will the program terminate sooner than it would have had the second bit been set to 0?"
- Set the second bit according to the answer given.
- Repeat.

On average, there is a new block found every 10 minutes. So long as you can repeat this process in under 10 minutes, you'll win, on average. Each time you win, you get 12.5 bitcoins, or about $125,000. Do it 8 times, and you have your million dollars.

Heck, if the querying to the device could be automated, the bigger problem would be making sure that you don't leave it running and crash the bitcoin economy. Bitcoin is based on the idea that no one entity could perform the majority of the mining. With this time travel device, you could easily outperform the rest of the miners combined. If this fact became known, bitcoin would immediately lose all value.

So what are the restrictions on the information gathering ability of this device? If I ask the device: "One hour in the future, does god exist?", will the device know the right answer? What about "One hour in the future, does P = NP?"

Or what about information I normally cannot get? Like finding out who murdered someone: "One hour in the future, has suspect X ever committed murder before?"

Or better yet, use the device for research and inventions. "Do the laws of physics one hour in the future allow me to build a super profitable invention within a day using what I have now?" Then play twenty questions to narrow down what this invention is and what steps you need to take to make the invention.

So the knowledge gained with the machine is limited to what you yourself will be able to figure out in the intervening time without any answer from the machine.

Don't ask "is the number I wrote down the winning value?" That takes too long. You need binary search. Ask questions like "Is the winning number greater than 20?" If yes ask if it is greater than 30, if no ask if it is greater than 10. This will let you determine the winning numbers really quickly.

Go to the casino with 772 dollars and put all on the correct roulette number twice. The casino probably won't evict you until that second win. The downside is that if you become known to have that device, the casino owners might be angry at you. Also, if it becomes known that someone must have such a device, then this plan cost you a number of bits of anonymity.

Contact a Lawful entity such as a notary via Tor and pay them 3000 dollars to execute the above plan and give you the winnings, without telling them where you got the numbers. This makes it more likely that the existence of the device becomes known and less likely that you will be found. Using Tor, and having downloaded it shortly before this event, cost you a number of bits of anonymity.

What counts as a question about the future? If the device has read access to its near future light cone, natural language processing and arbitrary computational power, I could ask: "What would a friendly AI with your powers set as the answer to this question?" and start writing down bits to be interpreted as ASCII.

You can't ask such a question because the device is just 'looking' into the future. Not asking some AI to guide you towards some desired future.

You /could/ get some computer program of an AI from the future by asking, 'For the Nth bit of the first provably friendly AI to be made in the future, is it a 0?' and just ask that question n times for however many 1s and 0s there are in the computer program with every yes being 0 and every no being a 1. Just remember that there's 8 billion bits in just one gigabyte. Also, how would you be able to be sure of how the device 'knows' what makes an AI Friendly?

EDIT: I just looked up some stuff about casinos and it turns out that casinos share info about possible cheaters with each other, so it's probably not sufficient to go to different casinos for each 'win'. Better to just save time by winning multiple times in one casino.

True, there are 36 numbers on which one can bet (1-36), but there is also 0, for a total of 37 possible outcomes. However, typically the house will only pay out at 1:35 odds. Therefore, if one wants to have $1 million after winning twice at the roulette wheel, the starting bet should be $817.

***** 772*36*36 is 1000512.

I guessed the device might have arbitrary computational power because it must have some way of finding the molecules that correspond to the words "roulette table at the local casino". I'll try to find solutions that don't need to peek behind this curtain.

No need to copy source code. Simply ask for any fact about the world after a singularity - any superintelligence within the hypothetical world that does not contain my device will notice that there used to be a human that remembers having such a device until it stopped working, infer that it's in the hypothetical, and be able to engineer its world such that the device's answers optimize the real world in the eyes of the superintelligence. You can even make it easy and ask for the bits within the envelope adressed to you.

Your readers might have less trouble with the butterfly effect not changing answers between asking for bits if you allow to ask for multiple bits at once at the cost of taking proportionally more time.

Whether the device's definition of friendliness is friendly is of course another matter. An unfriendly AI might simply notice your gaze, code up a provably friendly AI, and have its source code start with comments that enthrall you.

Of course, we haven't even gotten into the shenanigans you can do through the version of you in the hypothetical knowing where it is, and spending its ressources and anonymity on optimizing for the last question you asked. "What is the most upvoted suggestion in my reddit thread about the device?" "What is Yudkowsky's answer to my question of what would convince him of my story?" "What advice has my future self written into an envelope adressed to me?"

For safety reasons, you should probably preface all relevant questions with "Is the answer to that question determined within <lower bound on AI emergence>?" and "Is the answer to that question determined before I let go of this marble?".

**** So you would use your amazingly useful time travel device to make money from casinos?

How would you disguise your amazing winning streak without giving away the fact that you are using a strange machine at the same time? Unless you are a professional cheater, the casino will very likely notice after a short while before you manage to make the million. I could be wrong on this though, since I don't know how casinos look for cheaters.

***** Well if your goal is just to make money then yeah, of course. With games like keno you only need to play once to win a few million, so no need to care about winning streaks. And sure the casino will scrutinize you, but they'll be looking for things like connections with insiders and things like that, not time travel device. Also they're not really going to care much about a couple million.

I guess the blockchain dice games are probably a better way though, more anonymous.

Is one of the non-Powerball balls drawn on the next Powerball lottery drawing "1"?

Is one of the non-Powerball balls drawn on the next Powerball lottery drawing "2"?

...and so on.

There's probably a multi-million dollar lottery drawing somewhere in the world in the next 24 hours.

**** Yes, you can win the lottery quickly. The issue is that lotteries take 4 to 6 weeks to pay out. The challenge is to have the money ready to be spent in a very short period of time.

Someone who also thought of the lottery solution said that they would get the money immediately through loans first and use the lottery winnings to pay off the loans.

*** When asking your questions, can you specify at what point the device stopped 'existing' in the hypothetical universe?

If so, ending any "will X happen/not happen/happen in a certain way/etc." question with "......in a universe where this device was lost /immediately/ before X happened/didn't happen/etc." should give you an answer unaffected by the change in your actions after losing it.

If not, prefacing your question with "If I had /not/ lost this device, what would the answer have been if I asked it....." should accomplish the same result. You're essentially asking it "Within a universe where I've already lost this device, what would it say if I hadn't lost it?"

#+begin_quote
  In more detail: The true state of any universe (as well as the state of anything in that universe) is irrelevant to any questions asked within that universe regarding a elements of a separate hypothetical universe that are inherently inconsistent with the original universe. In other words, if I ask you "what would happen if humans had 2 legs?" your answer would be the same even if humans did not have 2 legs - my question makes the true number of legs on humans irrelevant, since I specify that I'm asking about a universe in which they have 2.

  So, in this particular case, compare the following:

  #+begin_quote
    Within a hypothetical universe in which the device /does/ exist, I ask "In another hypothetical universe, where the device exists, what would be its answer to X?"

    Within a hypothetical universe in which the device /does not/ exist, I ask "In another hypothetical universe, where the device exists, what would be its answer to X?"
  #+end_quote

  In both cases, X is being asked within a hypothetical universe where the device exists. In other words, the speaker's question is specifically about a universe in which the device exists, and so the answer - "what would be the device's answer to X" - is the same in either case.

  Going up one more level of abstraction back to the 'real' universe, ^{although from my point of view the entire thought experiment is itself hypothetical, but that's a different story} the device would answer "Within a universe where this device is lost, the answer to the question 'in a universe where this device was not lost, X?' is 'Y'." And then you have that Y is the answer for X in a universe in which the device was not lost, effectively bypassing your restriction.
#+end_quote

So, now that Sir Munchkin has sidestepped your inaccuracy clause, he has an effectively perfect future-reading device. Furthermore, the 'increased difficulty' clauses can be sidestepped in a similar manner:

To see 2 weeks/days ahead, just ask "If I asked 'will X happen in a week' one week from now, what would the answer be", but within the appropriate framework as explained above. For 3 weeks/days, ask "If I asked 'If I asked 'will X happen in a week' one week from now' one week from now, what would the answer be", within the same framework; etc.

For the money, using a similar train of logic as above, ask "If I had not lost this device, and if I had managed to make 1M$ in the way that I would judge optimal, how did I do it?" I would prove this, but it's similar enough to the previous that I'm just going to call it 'trivial' (like all of the /best/ math teachers do, of course.....) and move on with my life.

*** Well going by the description (though ignoring the testing logs which seem to be flawed as a result of the authors knowledge) I'm like 50% sure you could figure out a way to use the chamber as an antitelephone by sticking a robot in it and changing the speed of causality.

If that didn't work (and we're assuming the rest of the SCP canon doesn't exist) then the item would still be extremely useful because it can generate free energy through many different means, so post-singularity civilization won't ever have to fear the heat death with this thing around.

**** I'm not sure how useful it would be as a power source. Energy out of the system is bounded to 1 keV packets from a 50cm square window.

You could defeat heat death with it, for a very specific definition of heat death. Stopping entropy doesn't only depend on having a power source, but also the bandwidth. Else you're just slowing it down until you reach equilibrium between energy from the box and entropic decay of the entire universe. You'd also eventually end up with the ambient energy level rising until the box fails.

I...think you could make an antitelephone, but it still wouldn't be useful except as a physics experiment. If you're stuck to only using the 50cm window, then you're bound to a 50cm time differential between input/output which is only 1.668×10^{-9} lightseconds /at most/. The only result would be an observer being able to see a laser shone out from the box picoseconds before it was shone in. You can't signal electronics that fast, so even if you did come up with something clever there's not much you can use it for.

***** I'm not talking about relying on energy being put out through the window, ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qam5BkXIEhQ][though with very efficient technology in a very cold universe it could still power a civilization]]) rather I'm talking about the fact that if you can generate massive amounts of energy inside the chamber then that's still going to be released when you open it, even if that causes the physics there to revert back to normal it still won't undo the extra energy created.

Also while the energy of a photon leaving the chamber may be limited it can still put out an unlimited number of them potentially (though realistically somewhat limited by the creation of kugelblitz black holes).

Given the box produces free energy and the universe shows all signs of expanding forever you effectively have both an unlimited source of power and an unlimited heat sink to run heat pumps into.
