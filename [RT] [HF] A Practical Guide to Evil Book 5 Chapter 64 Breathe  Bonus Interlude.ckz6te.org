** Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Cordelia The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Heroes would tell you. It's a Villainous legend. Darth Cordelia was a First Prince of Procer, so powerful and so wise she could wield diplomacy to influence the story to create peace... She had such a knowledge of politics, she could even keep the Highest Assembly from fighting itself. She became so powerful... the only thing she was afraid of was losing her power, which eventually, of course, she did. Unfortunately, she negociated with everyone to create a Grand Alliance, then the Grand Alliance pushed her to take over Procer. Ironic. She could save others from tyranny, but not herself.

** So that's Black's original goal: to reform the Empire. Not scoring a victory against the Heavens, but making Praes into something that can function.

Edit: I wouldn't necessarily say that Black was right: Malicia /did/ succeed in making the High Lords irrelevant. Although they /are/ making a comeback, and afaik she never reinstated the Reforms, which likely was a strong factor in the goblin rebellion. So Malicia hasn't won yet.

**** We havent exactly reached the end yet. Her plan took an unacceptable ammount of time, true, but it was succeding. iirc she just defeated the most significant landed opposition in praes, and if she can survive this crusade she would be in a position to effetuate most if not all of the changes she set ou to do.

That's a big if, at this point. She hasn't defeated her internal opposition, which is significant, she doesn't have enough legion muscle to deal with it, and her only saving grace is that the rest of the Calernians don't know it was her who unleashed the Dead King. If they know without a doubt, which is just a matter of time with the Bard still around, they will be out for her head, and no amount of political manipulation will be worth anything.

****** Yeah, even if Black doesn't end up launching a bid for the tower, the only situation where Malicia wins is one where the Dead King brutally mauls the armies of Procer, the Dominion, and Callow (And probably the Drow as well). Her peace with Callow is only being maintained by the imminent threat of Keter, and if that is resolved without crippling every other major power outside the league, she's done for.

** Man it's wierd that Black is Cat's diplomatic partner after he was the muscle side of his partnership with Malicia. Also that his positions on most things haven't changed a bit.

I wonder how much of Cat's personal relationship with Amadeus is known to Cordelia? I mean even for an Evil Villain it's kind of asking a lot for someone to sell out their own father figure. Like can you imagine if Cat was more emotional and less able to take in the bigger picture? I mean Masego would have burnt down as much of Procer as he could have if had been asked while his Father's were still alive. Or hell if Scribe gets notice that about the trade and kills the First Prince just because she relatively indirectly threatened Amadeus?

Also Archer probably knows calculus for those long shots that take gravity into account. Wait is Creation flat?

****** Cordelia knows the two has meet only a half dozen times since Black went to the League after book two. Before then they spent the majority of their time separate and we don't even know how much they spoke between the scenes we saw, possibly they haven't spent more than a few weeks together /in total/ after book one since Black had a very hands off form of mentoring, only protecting her and handling her blunders from a distance.

She's likely unaware of the nature of the conversations they had since it'd be hard for a spy to listen in, with the notable exception of the time after second Liesse when Black walked away with a stab wound...

She probably doesn't have a rose tinted view of the Damneds relationship.

These used to get their own posts, but now that I'm the one posting for APGtE, I've decided that it's better to make one post when multiple chapters drop at the same time.

*** I think Black looked early/mid thirties while he had this name, but has physically aged ~10-15 years since losing it. I believe he's like 55 chronologically. (~Late teens at the start of his adventures, mid-late 20s by the start of the conquest, 20 years after the conquest itself, then the 3-4 years of the story.
