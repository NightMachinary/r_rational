The story can be read [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7742563?view_full_work=true][here]]. Three chapters have been written so far; the whole story will probably run to eight or so.

You don't need any familiarity with The Witcher universe to read it (though some parenthetical remarks won't be all that amusing to you if you haven't played the games); just keep in mind that the events take place in a version of the usual medieval-europe-with-magic setup based heavily on Polish and Eastern European lore. Witchers are humans who have been purposefully mutated to make them better at hunting monsters.

The story is more rationalist-adjacent than full-on rational (i.e., while there will be a little bit of munchkinry, it won't be the main focus).

  "As every graduate from the School of the Wolf, you may take a steed from our stables," he began again. "You will also find there a bag with all you need to begin your new life. Provisions for a week of travel, a few coins. A chest of books: Ritual Plants, Physiologus, Ghouls and Alghouls..."

That sounds extremely generous. I doubt that even before the massacre of Kaer Morhen witchers were so wealthy. Especially since Thyssen doesn't even intend to become a witcher.

  He had spent a happy childhood at Kaer Morhan and was not glad to leave

Seriously?

  For a few moments the situation seemed grim indeed but he soon settled on a perfectly acceptable plan: he would become a troubadour.
#+end_quote

I fail to see how man, whose most of the life consisted of physical training and swordmanship would so randomly choose to become a troubadour.

Overall, from lecture of the first chapter it seems, that author is not very familiar with the Witcher universe, while Thyssen is anything but rational.

** I'm really excited to get more of your writing.

Have you read the books from which Witcher was adapted?

*** Thanks! I've read 5/8 of the Witcher books (Sword of Destiny, The Last Wish, Blood of Elves, Lady of The Lake, Season of Storms). The story collections are the best IMHO, and Lady of the Lake was great too; the rest I felt were merely decent.
