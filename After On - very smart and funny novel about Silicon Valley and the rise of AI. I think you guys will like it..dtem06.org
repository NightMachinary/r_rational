I'm only a third of the way through the book, but so far its amazing.

Very funny, very well written. It has startups, AI, neuroscience, and secret special agents in it. [[https://www.audible.com/pd/After-On-Audiobook/B06ZZXC8VJ][Audiobook]] is voice acted incredibly well.

So far it's too early to tell how "rational" it is, but I bet people in this sub will enjoy it.


** I don't know about this book, but from the authors TED talk and the trailer for his book "Year Zero" it seems he tries to hard to be funny.

*** No clue about the trailer, but I actually really like year zero. It's both good and actually pretty funny.
