My next story ill be a superhero story, and will not be purely rational, but rationality in any story adds solidity. The main character will have a plastic body, much like Plastic Man or Mr. Fantastic. However, he will not have the same degree of fine control. For example, he can give himself the rough outline of a human body, but he will require an artificial endoskeleton in order to fool anyone up close, and close observation by a perceptive normal person in decent light will make it obvious he's not flesh and blood. At best, he'll look like a wax dummy.

He gained powers when he was consumed by a vat of plastic polymer, a nearly-complete project to develop an method to reclaim organics in landfills.

His body is entirely various polymers. He is always hungry. He has no limit on his physical size, but as he grows larger, his mental processes slow down, and he has less control over his reactions to hunger.

He does have a need to respire and spends energy to act. He can get oxygen from water. His body is carbon-based, but the chemistry is completely different. He can consume anything based on hydrocarbons. Diesel fuel, rubber bands, meat, vegetables.

He can generate a nonreactive sheath to protect people touching him from his digestive processes.

He can separate his body, to reduce his size, but it takes time and he only has a single consciousness. If he is forcibly split or splits himself too fast, he can lose memories. He cannot reproduce by division.

He's a reluctant hero. He's afraid of losing control. He's going to be an exploration of a plastic-based superhero that is NOT comic relief. He also tends to be very harsh when he is forced into a fight, using his body strangeness as a psychological weapon whenever possible.

What do you folks think about the initial concept?

** He can give himself the rough outline of a human body implies he doesn't start with the rough outline of a human body. Mr Fantastic's base form is human, can this character just shift around his base form? He sounds almost more like a plastic ooze.

When you say, he has loose control is that as in broad control? He just lacks the detail work? He can still stretch limbs? Go under doors? Flatten himself and pretend to be the carpet only to rise up and devour whoever stands on him?

Is he essentially !superhero [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blob][The Blob]]? Cause I'd totally read that.

*** You understand correctly. He cannot manage human form well enough to fool humans without an artificial endoskeleton.

Carpet would be hard, but rubber mats like gymnasium floors or the rubber foot mats in front of doors (large ones) would be doable. Nothing would stop him from getting underneath the carpet though, after tearing up one edge along a wall or something.

Am I misinterpreting, or is there the potential for a vicious feedback loop here, where growing larger makes him less able to control the urge to eat, making him grow larger and thus even /less/ able to control the urge?

I'm imagining a tipping point where his mental processes are slowed to the point where they are no longer an effective brake on the situation, and then he just mindlessly grows and consumes like an outbreak of grey goo.

*** It sounds like there is a lower bound implied that he loses memory if he is cut into smaller pieces without time to properly organize.

So I suspect there is a lower size bound before his memories become unstore-able or perhaps just un-accessible.

*** To some degree, yes, but there's a lower bound for effective control and thought. Adolescent human would probably be the smallest mass he could manage without problems, and the improvement of speed and hunger control would be marginal over a normal adult human size. That's my current take, anyway.

My instinctual reaction is "eehhhhhh". That's a tough one to make work.

The difficulty of damaging him makes it a complex proposition to put him in meaningful danger against a range of different opponents. It seems more likely that he'll alternately steamroll against people with no way of damaging him, and then in turn get steamrolled right back by people whose power hard counters his own, or end up in pointless fights where neither can harm the other. Tension would be very hard to make happen in either case. There is a reason why some of the best stories are about heroes who could theoretically get taken out by a lucky shot, for example in Worm or your story Symbiote a high powered round to the skull would have been all it would take.

I would suggest building in a core, a series of organs or something else that are vital to him and cannot be easily regenerated. Perhaps this is the part of him that turns food into plastic.

I am interested in the various horrifying ways a plastic body that dissolves people could be abused in combat. That seems like solid ground for munchkinry.

*** I have been considering weaknesses and limitations for him. Heat, for instance, weakens him greatly. Solvents can kill him in sufficient quantity. Sufficiently intelligent and prepared normal humans could give him a hard time. That's not to say normal humans will normally be a challenge to him, but it's very plausible. I had considered him as an amoeba body with enough control to appear human. The idea of organs that are important and susceptible to injury is definitely worth thinking about.

*** Farmerbob1 has written and submitted some extremely good rational fiction so far, (ever read Symbiote?) I'm inclined towards giving him the benefit of the doubt. I think it's far more likely than baseline that a thing he proposes will end up existing.

Edit: That, and he should have an exemption ready for his last published chapter.

*** Firstly, I understand your concern, but I believe you are reading the rules too strictly here. You are suggesting an irrational approach to story writing. Almost every successful writer will happily tell you that starting to write before brainstorming leads to writing garbage at worst, or taking a MUCH longer time to write something good at best.

There is a section under posting tags [BST] and I used it. I have been musing about this story in my head for more than a year. It will be happening. After 'Set In Stone' is edited. The editing of that book has been delayed due to my leaving the house for two months, and bringing a Scrivener file with me that was not the correct version. I have about three or four weeks before I can do anything except brainstorm.

Please excuse missing letters - I'm using a horrible laptop.
