Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** I've lately come to the conclusion that reversing (or upending) cached thoughts can make for some really good speculative fiction. If you take something that people /know/ but don't actually think about, then turn it on its head somehow. This pretty cheaply forces the brain to recompute all the things that it had previously cached in order to fit with the new counterfactual world.

This is my hypothesis, anyway. What I'd really like is a way to test it, but I fear that it's far too qualitative to do that, because you'd have to define both "cached thought" and "compelling". I also don't have the resources (or education) necessary to run a study which actually finds out whether my hypothesis is right or not. I also think the (or a) general principle of what makes a compelling idea might be how much it disrupts the cache, but I don't know how to tell whether that's actually right.

If we're talking about cognitive theories of humor, the dominant one seems to be that we get a sort of reward for bumping up against a wrong cached thought and having it corrected (and jokes are just a superstimulus). But I don't really know why this revelation causes /humor/ instead of something like /epiphany/, which is different but seems to work on similar principles.

*** I had a thought similar to this just the other day.

...Which, now that I think about it, is very similar to Yudkowsky's advice "being original is simple, don't do things that have been done before".

My thinking was "here's a good source of ideas: find a way to mix up a humongous mecha series". Maybe you could make a humongous mecha series and run it around a romance plot. Or a slice-of-life series about people who are /ex/-pilots of mecha. Or the mecha only exist as background features/easter eggs/scenery porn, and everything happens "in front" of them, they're never used by the main characters on-screen. Basically anything that, when people think of the series, would overshadow (or replace!) "monster of the week"/"world at war" elements, but still think of the mecha.

(...I've heard of FLCL, and now I'm wondering if it counts as having mecha elements.)

**** Playing devil's advocate: In NZ we have the Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) system of voting, which gives Parties a number of seats in parliament based on the number of votes they receive. Its designed to give them voting power in parliament relative to the % of votes they received in the last general election, thereby making it useful to vote for the party you prefer. Even if they aren't likely to lead the next government it gives them a say and makes them more attractive to bigger Parties looking to form a coalition.

The is some dissatisfaction from people who view it as a system that doesn't result in strong leadership because, after a general election, the leading Party has always had to form coalitions with smaller Parties in order to create the majority needed to govern. In the words of my boss (a "project leader" from the UK, which still uses first-past-the-post): its too many voices diluting effective leadership.

***** No voting system is perfect, some are just better at expressing preference than others. The problem with first-past-the-post is that it's not even at the level where you're making trade-offs; it's just /bad/ in in ways that can be shored up.

Proportional systems do have the perceived disadvantage of requiring coalitions and being "weaker", but if you thought that single-winner was the way to go, you could still do better than first-past-the-post and all of the problems that it has. (For example, doing instant-runoff within the Smith set.)

***** Honestly, I am of the general opinion that laws that can't get broad support from more than one group are very often likely to be laws I don't actually want passed, so I am usually pretty OK with this. At least, within my present political context - Minority governments in Canada have not exactly ruined the country when they occurred, that I've noticed. And in Canada we have had first-past-the-post voting and it's resulted in both minorities and majorities in the past, so fptp is not empiricallly perfect protection against minority governments.

I also agree very much with alexanderwales points that the present voting systems are flawed. The voting system we have here in Canada is one of the very best that the 19th century created. That doesn't mean it's good at anything or for anything - it's the 21st century now. We can rebuild the system better, we have the technology. No matter what your goals are, there are systems better for it than our present voting system.

Meh. I'm not optimistic. The problem is that the best systems are a bit more involved than just counting the votes. As a result, nobody but [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method#Users][the nerds]] understands what's going on inside [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method][Schulze method]]. People are not keen on using a black box they don't understand to elect the governing authorities.

Sure, getting rid of the first-past-the-post is possible. Getting a worthwhile system to replace it? I'm not holding my breath.

***** We've been trying to get ranked choice voting implemented in my home town (just for local elections like school board, city council, mayor, etc.) and there's definitely a trade-off between what the average person will understand, what can be implemented, and what hits the most voting system criteria. Unfortunately, once you've changed voting systems, changing it again is harder, because people feel like they've already switched to something new and shouldn't have to switch again. There are also people who look at any change in voting laws as inherently suspicious, and sometimes those people just let that be their attitude without really thinking about whether it's correct.

****** So it's impossible to incrementally improve voting systems, since each time the resistance to change will be higher. And it's impossible to go with optimal system right away, since almost everyone will think that you're trying to take advantage of them with some magical math malarkey.

I have a feeling that the only way to change it is to forcefully beat the flaws with the current system into everyone's heads. That's only the first part, though. The second is somehow motivating people to learn how alternative systems work. I have no idea how to do that, but traditional school education is clearly not working.

******* I think it's possible to do incremental change, you just need long enough between changes. So for example, we had to fight to get an imperfect ranked choice option on the ballot, and assuming it passes in something like a week's time, I don't expect that the current crop of city councilors will be amenable to changing it again.

But in ten or twenty years, when there are new city council members and the less ideal system has been (hopefully) working for a decade or two, then maybe we can get another, better voting system on the ballot. Voting machines are another big issue that might become less of a big issue as time passes, especially if machines which support different voting systems become the norm, which they will if voting systems keep getting changed around the country.

The funny thing here is that your statement is absolutely true where abstract voting systems (Schultze, FPP) are concerned, but not when people are talking about electronic voting machines like Diebold. People are literally using black boxes they don't understand to elect their highest officials.

It's exactly backwards from what would be good.

*** I think strategic voting might be some kind of Tragedy of the Commons. Sure, if you vote strategically, it might help enforce your preferences /in this particular election/, but over the long term, it seems to distort the signal that elections provide /in the first place/, as officials come to assume that increasingly large portions of the vote are strategic, and therefore manipulable via means other than appealing to what voters want.

** I've figured out a (hopefully) intuitive way to explain the very nebulous and strange (at least to me) concept of "If you can explain all outcomes equally, you have no knowledge." I'd like to run it by you guys for feedback/improvement.

Imagine you have a co-worker who always knows everything, and you tell him that the economy went up last week. He then states several plausible-sounding reasons why of course the economy went up, it only makes sense.

Then you reveal that you lied to him, and the economy went down, and now he starts to make some very plausible-sounding arguments about why THAT made sense all along.

This triggers your bullshit detector. Clearly, he's talking crap. If he genuinely expected the economy to go up, he should have been shocked when you told him you lied. If he expected it to go down, he should have been shocked when you told him it hadn't. If you can come up with an argument for everything, you don't have a GOOD argument for anything.

And that's how, if someone can explain anything, they don't really know anything.
