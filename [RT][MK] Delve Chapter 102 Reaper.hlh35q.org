******* I doubt it's that bad, because places like the City of Lights exist, and IIRC you can get Guild people to help raise your level with enough money.

I think it's more that crafters are valued above their rank, with a Silver crafter being rare enough that the only ones with a shot of buying their products are goldplates, and Silvers having to buy stuff from Bronze crafters, and Bronzeplates only being able to pick up the scraps.

So Tallheart's gear would be /level-appropriate/ for a Silver, but in the current state of the world are fit for a Gold.

******** And because of the atomised, feudal, might-makes-right societal situation, being a crafter is taking on relatively high risks to yourself. You're forgoing personal power for in return for making yourself an attractive slave, who can be chained to an anvil and pump out gear till you drop dead. So crafters are rare in part because nobody wants to be one.

(Add in that the lone-wolf mentality and lack of efficient parties means it's even harder to raise your cap as a crafter.)

********* I'm somewhat skeptical that 'slave' is the common outcome to high-level crafters. 'Patron' seems more likely, as in the crafter reaching an agreement with some Goldplate to settle down in their domain and make what they want, in exchange for protection and a comfortable life. After all, a high-level crafter is a goose laying golden eggs, and keeping them happy with their arrangement means they don't cheap out on your gear or try to escape to a rival or something.

Sure, a clueless crafter without a support network who happens across a merciless Gold might just get fully enslaved, but I figure most crafters would angle to either find a patron or join a group like the Guild who'll stick up for them if push comes to shove.

********** Seems like a very bad idea to enslave someone like Tallheart. They're making the gear that your life will depend on, so what's to stop them from building in something with a vulnerability -- maybe when they say a command word your armor shrinks to doll size and crushes you.

And that's leaving aside the whole "in a cave with a box of scraps" potential, where they simply make gear for themselves while you aren't looking and murderize their way out.

Definitely a good idea for a Gold to hire a high-level crafter but absolutely vital that they be happy to work for you and not feel taken advantage of, enslaved, or threatened.

He wouldn't be able to use aura compression the way he did without the armor and the stat ring, without which he'd be dead 2 seconds after coming close enough to use the aura compression the way he did.

Very few people would have gear of this quality at level 18, so for most people, so this sort of min-maxing build just isn't worth it for most prospective awakened, because you'll never be effective enough to acquire the funds to become effective, you see?
