*** The world building and writing in general have been excellent quality, and I've been enjoying the story so far quite a bit.

The "game" side of the quest has been much more difficult for me to enjoy so far. I think the latest changes to how we are constructing plans may help somewhat with that, and you've been better about setting expectations after the latest plan.

I think my biggest issue is that we have been running into a lot of disagreements between players about the fundamentals of how game mechanics work, and I think that ultimately comes down to the mechanics themselves being vague and open ended. I get the impression that your intent is for us to gradually learn more about the mechanics along with the story and setting through testing, but my observation thus far has been that these ambiguities in core mechanics are not fun for players to explore - they're just needlessly confusing and annoying.

There are a couple levels to these vague mechanics. Some of them are clearly deliberate, like the unknown costs for applying marks and performing spell research.

The other level are things like the descriptions of the spells we already have being unclear, such as how Sacrifice didn't work anything like how the players were reading it.

I would advise you to address at /least/ the second issue - vague tooltip for things we already can do. Personally, I consider it to be poor game design to give players abilities that are functionally very different from what their description implies. Similarly, I would advise adding use cases, especially for Research Magic.

I don't think things like the unknown costs for marks are fun, either, but I suspect those are more of a conscious design decision that I simply disagree with. Perhaps a middle ground of giving us a clear mark cost if we spend a reasonable and clear void point amount would be a good middle ground.

The "black box" style of approach to how things work doesn't appeal to me as a player - I prefer clear rules systems in general - so I have some biases here. That said, I think that other players are running into similar difficulties, and those difficulties are contributing toward making the game more confusing and less fun overall.

I would like to thank you again for running the quest. Your writing is excellent, and your world has been fun to explore.

**** Thanks for your feedback, and I'm glad you've enjoyed it (though the writing is all Vecht :) )

Some of this is due to starting quest issues and a bit of communication issues on our end for which I apologize, and I believe will clear up as the story goes on (e.g. I hadn't fully stress tested Sacrifice at quest start). This should also be cleared up as we don't really intend to provide additional tooltips moving forward -- we expect the players to track the results of what they try and learn from them. If they want documented use cases, they can experiment with them to generate use cases.

I suspect that the crux of the matter here is a difference of goals. Vecht and I are out to write a collaborative story with interesting characters, decisions, and planning which is supported by reasonable mechanics. We are not trying to make a set of clearly defined rules and ask people to find edge cases to hit the win button. If people want that sort of thing, they should play a video game instead of a quest -- computers track that sort of thing better, and a full team of developers will probably make a more robust set of rules than two people in their spare time. At the end of the day, we don't think the world works via video game logic and exploits, and we don't want that to dominate our story (which necessitates either being smart enough to remove literally every unintended edge case upfront (we've certainly tried, but are confident we've missed spots), or "black boxing" the mechanics so that the edge cases can be dealt with without significantly impact the story or player expectations).

As an example of why we're doing it this way: In Marked for Death, explicit mechanics were written to explain how substitution worked. The QMs worked on it, and I discovered that this meant every ninja should be able to set off atomic scale warheads by the time they've got ~1 year of experience. This meant that we as players had it as a goal to go for that, but, when the QMs got around to modeling it, decided to change the mechanics so that this didn't happen. If substitution had been black boxed, the players wouldn't have pursued it, and there never would have been the disappointment, the feeling of being cheated out of something, or a disruption of the story due to issues in the way the game was set up. As another example, Marked for Death needed to revise their mechanics systems a few times. Ultimately, each time, players were very cognizant of relative increases and decreases in power, which were (at least to me) disruptive to the story and planning. By Black boxing these things, we limit player understanding of their power to what is viewed on screen, so the backend mechanics need only match up to what is shown, not what is extrapolated into edge cases. This, we believe, leads towards a more stable quest.

I don't think clearly defined rules automatically necessitates a push toward exploits. You can have a game with clear rules and simply explain to your players up front the style of game you're looking for. Setting expectations is important.

You can also discuss this type of thing with your players and come to a middle ground if desired - Jesse Heinig (a professional game dev) wrote a good article on this subject, where he calls it [[https://trekhead.livejournal.com/92619.html][table negotiation]].

Ah. I think part of the disconnect here is because I don't think of Quests as resembling video games - I consider them to be more reminiscent of tabletop games, forum RPGs, and play-by-email games. In all these cases, it's absolutely feasible to have a rules set, and simply explain to players the style of game you're working on, that you're not going to allow certain types of exploits, etc.

I can see the problem you're trying to address here, but honestly, I find going into a game with the mechanics hidden /vastly/ more frustrating than simply dealing with the fact that there are going to have to be some rules that need to be adjusted over time.

I think we're just going to have a philosophical disagreement here.

I absolutely think that rules changes are fine, and should be expected in a game with any significant number of players.

We've also already run into rules changes and clarifications multiple times in Legacy of the Goddess, so I don't think hiding the rules is preventing that.

If Marked for Death had too many exploitable rules issues, I would have probably addressed that with a longer phase of rules playtesting before deploying the game if that's an issue that you wanted to prevent. Ultimately, though, I think we're looking for different experiences in a Quest, and I respect that.

**** I spoke with Radvic on this one. Our main feedback is that we're primarily writing a collaborative story, which the mechanics are intended to facilitate as your (the players') tendrils of agency within the world -- as opposed to running a game with a set of mechanics that the narrative is supposed to support.

If you want a detailed set of clearly defined rules to exploit, that's what video games are for. If instead you want to participate in a simulation of a real world (insofar as it is possible to do that with fiction), it just doesn't work that way. You don't have access to the rules of physics underlying reality in real life, and almost all of the knowledge we take for granted has been earned through centuries of extremely intelligent people bashing their heads against a natural world that is wholly unmoved by their frustration. That isn't to say we want you to be frustrated, or that we're expecting that level of commitment to unearthing hidden secrets; only that you're going to have to work a lot harder than you have been if you want to be rewarded with deeper knowledge of how magic works.

To be fair, the first infopost says explicitly at the very top: "Note: just as you do not have explicit access to the mechanics which govern real life, you will not have explicit access to the mechanics which govern events in the story -- you will need to determine what works, what doesn't, and how to improve based on your own experimentation, progress, and ingenuity." I'll grant that we could probably be clearer on this front so as to avoid misunderstandings and frustration. Some of this is on us. But to be fair, I've said as much on multiple occasions (which you yourself have correctly pointed out in thread).

I think most of this might be bourne from some kind of perception on some of the players' part that the world is much more shallow than it actually is, coupled with a general aversion to being openly /wrong/ about things when there is so much uncertainty -- that is, judging by a few responses I've seen in the thread. It certainly isn't the case across the board. One or two players have made extremely accurate and astute observations in theorycrafting posts (even if most of the same theorycrafting has been wrong -- which is to be expected). I'm not sure what else I can say on that front besides "no -- there's a reason it took me and Radvic over 2 years of working on and off behind the scenes before I was comfortable starting the quest."

Additionally: while we certainly don't /not/ want our players to have fun, ensuring every possible method of interaction with the quest is fun isn't exactly on the top of our priorities. We /absolutely do want/ player interaction to be deeply rewarding and engaging. But that's only going to happen if you actually engage with the story on a deeper level, rather than dragging your heels and expecting spoon-fed results from pulling the mechanics levers in the right way. I half-expect to get downvoted for saying this, but I'm not going to own the mistakes of my players if they believe they can interact with the story in a shallow and confused fashion and expect anything but shallow and confusing results in response. Think of it this way. If I gave you a budget of $10k and said "go figure out the fliglebloog effect from the gargablag artifact which you only know about from a description in a story that might not even be based on anything real," how much progress are you going to make on that?

With Research Magic in particular, you (the players) have thus far chose to spend your limited VP in very shallow ways (that is, directing Fi to research something out of folklore and legend and giving her a small, fixed budget). As has been communicated (and again, perhaps this should have been made clearer), Fi isn't going to be able to make much progress on research without (1) a /really/ solid idea of how the magic is supposed to work, including its mechanisms of action and limitations, or (2) a working example to draw from. A lot of stuff just isn't going to be possible -- and further, the players haven't seem to even acknowledge that fact despite me saying so on multiple occasions. Direct quote shortly after Chapter 3: "Oh also, some of those legends Zelda referenced may or may not be pure bunk. Or they might all contain the barest nuggets of truth. Or they could all just be fanciful stories and scary tales. Or maybe I just want to screw with you and you should disregard this message. Or maybe it's all 100% real. Who knows." I think there's even been an IC response from Fi (though I might be confusing things) to the effect of saying that any VP spent on research isn't guaranteed to result in anything at all.

The ability is there, and you may use it. That doesn't mean you have to, or that you're expected to, or that you'll need to right away if you want to make progress. Ultimately, figuring all this out is up to you (the players).

All that said, I want to thank you for your honest and open feedback. Unless it isn't absolutely clear: both I and Radvic are heavily committed to making this quest a rewarding and engaging experience for our players, and we care very much about fixing and addressing problems that crop up. We've talked about these issues and if nothing else we'll certainly keep them in mind as we move forward.

I think the difficulty here is that we're having trouble understanding how our own means of interaction with the world work. This is getting somewhat clearer over time, though.

I think you're operating under a false premise here - I'm not looking for playing something that's automated like a video game. I'm used to quests being structured more like a tabletop game, with relatively clear rules and mechanics, at least for the things players are capable of doing.

A more minimalist approach is fine, even if it's not to my personal tastes. The thing I'm having difficulty with is when we're presented with information that looks like gameplay rules (e.g. spell descriptions), but that information is unclear or unreliable.

#+end_quote

I'm all about exploring how magic works, and I do a ton of exploring that when I'm running games or writing books. The problem that I'm running into isn't that it's difficult to learn about the intricate details of magic.

I'm struggling with the fact that the rules on "how to use Research Magic" are unclear.

For example, for a LARP that I run, spell research requests come in with a specific template. This includes things like the name of the spell, the expected mana cost, the expected function, how the research is being performed, the types of magic it uses, etc. That's the type of thing I'd like the QMs to be clear about: How do we play your game?

Absolutely. I get what you're going for here - I just think that there's a distinction between being vague about things like in-world physics and being vague about things like how to format posts, requests, etc. in the format that you want.

Basically, I'd like for you to give us some templates for things like how you'd want action plans to be structured, how to utilize each individual spell, etc.

I haven't been having any issues with thinking that the world is shallow, personally, or anything along those lines. The depth of the setting seems very solid. My problems come with from how player interaction with the game works, not the setting.

#+end_quote

In my opinion, this is a game design issue, not a player issue.

If you're repeatedly seeing players interacting with the game in ways that don't make sense to you - for example, making vague statements like "go figure out the fliglebloog effect from the gargablag artifact", then there need to be instructions on what your /expected/ posts look like.

We also have some conflicting design elements:

- There are a lot of things that feel like they /need/ to be addressed quickly.
- You seem to want more detail than we've been giving.
- The two points above conflict with the fact that we have a very low (200) word count maximum.
- The end result is fractured sentences and hard-to-read instructions.

I've attempted to guess what you're looking for and write things out in a clearer way, but while I do appreciate you saying things like "Salaris is closer to the mark" on spell research, that's still extremely open-ended. What elements of my research suggestion are what you were looking for? What aren't? What would be helpful for you as a QM for us to include?

That kind of information should be in the spell descriptions, too, not something that people are going to have to dig through a bunch of posts to find information on. Putting it right in the ability descriptions helps new players that might catch up by checking things in Reader Mode, as well as existing players who may not catch every single reply, etc.

I think the players as a whole understand this part, we're just spending VP to try to figure out more details. I've personally pushed for gathering more physical items through things like the Order of Sages, that just hasn't actually made it into a winning plan yet.

Yeah, we know that, but there are differing opinions in the player base on how to approach that issue. Some people want to go with the bare minimum VP spend and assume that spending any VP at all will get us an answer on if something is viable. Some people feel like a higher investment is more likely to get us usable data, but with disagreements on what a viable VP range would be. Others think we should just be saving our VP for marks, or waiting until we get physical items to study, etc.

I'm going to fall back on what I've stated previously. It simply isn't the case that I intend to give players an easy and intuitive channel to do research. The real world doesn't work like that. The fact that this is ostensibly "a game" does not mean I am bound by having to follow anything that looks like "proper game design."

I intend for players to figure this out the hard way (including what types of approaches are more fruitful and which are less so). And when/if they make progress I expect it will be appropriately rewarding. I also appreciate it might be frustrating working with an open-ended system like this, and appreciate you may rightly judge it to be "poor game design." I even appreciate that you might not want to participate in the process. But none of that changes my perspective on the issue.

I understand that you're trying to go for something that more closely resembles the real world, but I still think that should mean the problems with magic research should come from difficulties that are encountered on the in-character side.

I can get there being ambiguities about how much it helps to have things like example spells, or physical examples of a magic type to study, or whatever. My problem lies with there being ambiguities about what we're supposed to include in a post. In-character difficulties are great. Meta-game difficulties because we don't know what you want in a post are just frustrating.

I honestly might just have to bow out at some point, then. I don't really want to, because I respect your writing and the world itself, but dealing with problems on the level of "How do I format a magic research post?" is extremely frustrating.

I don't think there's anything to be gained on the player side or the QM side from having formatting a post be part of the challenge of the game.

I've said this before in other contexts, but it's just as applicable here: there are no magic answers. We aren't looking for you to guess our passwords. There simply isn't any predefined way you're "supposed" to do this.

We know roughly what magic can and cannot do (though there may be patches or holes in our own understanding of the system). All we're "looking for" is observing how players approach the problem and then conveying what we believe the results of the efforts to be.

#+end_quote

The details of formatting aren't and haven't ever been an issue. What I'm trying to get at is that there's a large gap between the space you're pointing towards with your formatting proposals and a one-line bullet point saying "put 10 VP towards researching the Lens of Truth effect." So far, what's been put into plans is the latter.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that most of your gripe has been in frustration stemming from trying and failing to convince other players to do it differently. But what you're asking for (detailed guidelines on how to present research directives) is at odds with how we intend research to be done, full stop. It might serve the purpose of allowing you to sidestep the frustration by holding it up and saying "see? QM says do it this way", but that doesn't mean it is the only solution, or even necessarily a good one.

There's a larger set of issues this touches on, pertaining to navigating coordination issues with other players given the quest constraints in particular and forum-style communication in general. I presently don't think it's worth getting into that, as I'm hopeful most of the roughness will clear up with time, and also with better constraints on plans.

What I'm trying to get at is that there's a large gap between the space you're pointing towards with your formatting proposals and a one-line bullet point saying "put 10 VP towards researching the Lens of Truth effect." So far, what's been put into plans is the latter.
#+end_quote

Sure, absolutely. I think the issue is that none of the players are clear on how close approaches like my own are to acceptable, or what the difference in effectiveness would be between one of my lower-detail plans and one of my higher detail ones.

I recognize that you seem to be of the opinion that players should try plans with varying degrees of complexity and see what happens, but that doesn't appear to be a natural play pattern with your player base.

#+begin_quote
  Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that most of your gripe has been in frustration stemming from trying and failing to convince other players to do it differently.
#+end_quote

No, that's incorrect. While I'd certainly like it if more people would vote for my plans, that's absolutely not the main issue here, as I see it.

My main problem is that we don't have a good idea of what you, as QMs, are looking for - and as a result, everyone is just shotgunning out submissions in their own personal styles.

When each chapter is posted, the main thing people are voting on in the aftermath is the plan of action. Formatting is, from a player standpoint, secondary to that - even if it's something that is, from a QM perspective, extremely relevant.

While we see that there are VP bonuses for things like brevity and clarity, we do not have large enough sample sizes to compare results across plans, nor do those point scores have clear enough breakdowns for us to currently understand /why/ those specific point values are being awarded. More clarity on that front might help improve this issue as well, at least in the long-term.

#+begin_quote
  But what you're asking for (detailed guidelines on how to present research directives) is at odds with how we intend research to be done, full stop. It might serve the purpose of allowing you to sidestep the frustration by holding it up and saying "see? QM says do it this way", but that doesn't mean it is the only solution, or even necessarily a good one.
#+end_quote

Okay. I think we're just going to disagree about this, and that's fine. It's ultimately your game, and I respect that you'll make decisions that are different from my own.

#+begin_quote
  There's a larger set of issues this touches on, pertaining to navigating coordination issues with other players given the quest constraints in particular and forum-style communication in general. I presently don't think it's worth getting into that, as I'm hopeful most of the roughness will clear up with time, and also with better constraints on plans.
#+end_quote

Fair enough.

  It feels like you've decided some player approaches are "wrong", though, even if you don't have a "right" way. Perhaps that's just my perception
#+end_quote

Yes, that is correct. I don't have to know how to build a rocket engine to know that you don't start by building it out of wood, for example.

#+end_quote

Again: There are no magic answers. There are no passwords to guess. There isn't anything we "want" you to do. There is the simulated world, which we simulate to the best of our ability, and then there is what you relay to us that you want to do in that world. We write the results of your actions. To attribute to us as QMs "want" for what you do as players is incorrect. When the world slaps you down, it isn't the QMs doing that or trying to send you a message. It's the result of the system we've set up, as best we figure. When the world rewards you for your actions, it isn't the QMs doing that or rewarding you for good play. It's the result of the system we've set up, as best we figure. When NPCs are hostile to your actions, it isn't the QMs doing that. It's the result of those actors acting according to their desires in the system we've set up, as best we figure.

There are no problems with whatever approach you take, be that a highly rigid and well-defined format for plans, or people "shotgunning" styles. We don't care (insofar as it isn't a headache to read and parse plans for us and other players -- we do care about that). They're all valid, and we're going to do the exact same thing: write the results of whatever it is you try and do within the world, according to how we believe the world should unfold. This includes research. This includes /absolutely everything/ you do.

You keep asking me for clarity. I don't know how much clearer I can be on this topic.

Good luck ever convincing them of that. Obviously, any time anything bad happens it's because the QMs are giant meanies who are punishing the players. The idea of "following a simulation" is utterly foreign and you should expect to be semi-regularly accused of lying about that being your goal.

#+end_quote

I get what you're trying to say here, but the QMs are the ones who set up the start conditions, the variables for the simulation, the mechanics for things like the magic system etc.

I don't know exactly what you're doing under the hood (which is, of course, by design), but certain factors are always going to come down to the people writing the story.

To give you an example, Fi telling Zelda that Hylea is dead was a decision on the QM side, not a simulation. That's an area where player phrasing and formatting was relevant - if players had a better idea of how specific of detail we were supposed to give Fi in her communications with Zelda, it's likely we would have told her /not/ to approach the conversation from that standpoint. From a player perspective, that type of thing is extremely relevant.

#+begin_quote
  When the world rewards you for your actions, it isn't the QMs doing that or rewarding you for good play. It's the result of the system we've set up, as best we figure.
#+end_quote

The VP rewards/planning incentives are direct rewards from the QMs for how we write our plans, though.

#+begin_quote
  When NPCs are hostile to your actions, it isn't the QMs doing that. It's the result of those actors acting according to their desires in the system we've set up, as best we figure.
#+end_quote

QMs are still writing those NPCs, though. I don't think there's any way for QMs to be completely dispassionate executors of the simulation (nor do I think that would be a good idea even if it was possible).

I apologize if I'm coming across as needlessly contrary here, but I don't agree with your assessments about a lot of this.

#+begin_quote
  You keep asking me for clarity. I don't know how much clearer I can be on this topic.
#+end_quote

I believe I understand your philosophy a bit better now, it's just very different from my own, which poses challenges to my ability to participate in your game effectively. I will do my best to try to adapt to your style, and if I can't, I'll bow out as gracefully as possible.

Thank you again for taking the time to write these replies, as well as to run the game. I appreciate your time, and I hope understand that my detailed replies are due to my own interest and respect for your work, even if I have disagreements with you about certain elements of the game.

  We also have some conflicting design elements:

  There are a lot of things that feel like they need to be addressed quickly. You seem to want more detail than we've been giving. The two points above conflict with the fact that we have a very low (200) word count maximum. The end result is fractured sentences and hard-to-read instructions.
#+end_quote

I'm willing to up the word count limits, or try some other constraints. I'll discuss it with Radvic. The other thing we're trying to ensure is that people can interact with the quest without demanding too much from them in having to read through and parse megaplans with tons of multilayered bullet points. That just isn't fun for anyone. The ideal solution would be if players could /just not/, but for various reasons that doesn't work.

I think it might be more possible to get players to cut down their plan scope if we had clearer time allocations for specific tasks, like:

- Talk to a person at the castle: x hours
- Talk to someone elsewhere: x hours
- Travel to another location: x days
- Research a spell: x hours
- Assign people to a task: x hours
- Write a letter: x hours
- Cast a spell: x hours
- Etc.

That way, a plan that contains four bullet points would take up the same amount of in-world time as two plans that each have two of the bullet points, but with greater detail.

Alternatively, give us a limited number of "action points" or "time units" per turn and have specific types of actions take up a set number of action points or action points. This would be forcing the issue more, but it would also be the easiest way to get the kind of turns you want, imo.

***** Continued reply:

#+begin_quote
  The ability is there, and you may use it. That doesn't mean you have to, or that you're expected to, or that you'll need to right away if you want to make progress. Ultimately, figuring all this out is up to you (the players).
#+end_quote

Since this is one of our primary mechanisms for exploring the game world as a whole, I think some out-of-game clarity on how the expected use would be very helpful.

To give you an example, I mean something like:

*Research Magic*

This allows you to attempt to research a spell. This has a variable cost, and chances of success are modified by the following factors:

- Direct experiences with the magic being used.
- Items that already possess the magic.
- Detailed records of previous uses of the magic.
- Similar magic being used as a foundation in the research process.

Research magic requests should include the following elements:

- Spell Name
- VP Used on Research
- Methods used for research.
- Examples used for spell research (e.g. items, existing spells, legends, etc.)
- Expected results of the spell.
- Expected VP cost for casting the spell.
- Expected restrictions on using the spell.
- Expected time to cast.

*Example spell:*

- *Name:* Lesser Mark of Transference
- *VP Used on Research:* 100
- *Methods of Research:* Utilizing your knowledge of the Mark of Transference spell, attempt to create a mark on Link that emulates the VP collection function of the Mark of Transference, but without duplicating any of the other functionality of the original spell.
- *Examples for Research*: This is a reduced version of the existing Mark of Transference spell.
- *Expected Results for Spell*: If successful, this will create a limited-effect version of a Mark of Transference that collects VP based on the target's level of activity. It will also serve as a foundation that can later be upgraded to a full Mark of Transference spell. It has none of the other functions of a full Mark of Transference.
- *Expected VP Cost for Casting:* Variable by target, based on a portion of the cost of a full Mark of Transference. Due to significantly reduced functionality, expected cost is 25% of the cost of a "full" Mark.
- *Expected Restrictions*: This spell requires the consent of the target, just like a full Mark of Transference.
- *Expected Time to Cast*: 25% of the time of casting a Mark of Transference on the same target.

I'm not saying you should use my description - this is simply an example of the type of thing I think players would find useful. Please, give us examples like this.

#+begin_quote
  All that said, I want to thank you for your honest and open feedback. Unless it isn't absolutely clear: both I and Radvic are heavily committed to making this quest a rewarding and engaging experience for our players, and we care very much about fixing and addressing problems that crop up. We've talked about these issues and if nothing else we'll certainly keep them in mind as we move forward.
#+end_quote
