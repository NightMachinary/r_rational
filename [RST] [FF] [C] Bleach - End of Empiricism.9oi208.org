** First of all: /sorry/ for delaying a bit more the new Optimised Wish Project chapter! I'm working on it, but now and then I need to do something new to get my inspiration running again. So here's a short Bleach story to compensate. Writing Bleach rational fanfiction is something I've been thinking about for a while - it's temping but also hard, since the story has plot holes large enough to drive a train through. This isn't that, really, but rather a short rationalist parable about the Problem of Induction as applied to the very real issue (for Bleach characters, at least) of fighting an absolutely perfect illusionist. Enjoy!

**** Aizen is a perfect example of what happens when you let yourself get away a bit too much with handing down powers to your characters... though by the end of the Soul Society arc, I think he was still salvageable. My way of writing a 'rational' Aizen that's dangerous but realistically defeatable would have been:

- not actually very strong physically, though skilled in kidou
- his Kyouka Suigetsu only projects illusions that /he/ pictures in his own mind, therefore can not show anything that he does not know, and require an effort of concentration that's greater when the illusion is more complex. This also puts a limit on how many people he can deceive at the same time
- never achieved bankai, as suggested by Urahara in this story.

Within these boundaries, Aizen could be an interesting 'trickster' villain, and Urahara his natural foil. Rational!Bleach would end up looking like a battle of two masterminds in which everyone else is mostly a pawn.

Another option would be for Ichigo to learn to fight him with his eyes closed. He never saw Kyouka Suigetsu and could keep that up, which would remove Aizen's main advantage over everyone else. In fact I always assumed while reading Bleach that /that/ would be the reason why the Gotei 13 would ask Ichigo's help in fighting him. Turns out Kubo didn't think that far at all.

** So there is a way to tell if you are in the illusion then: check whether the world is fair to you.

Because the real world is fair in its unfairness to everyone. Random accidents happen all the time for no reason other than the butterfly effects of random whims far in the past. Measure the rate of such accidents happening to strangers, then measure the rate of such accidents happening to the people you care about. If there is a statistically significant difference between the two, you're in an illusion that is catered to you.

*** I see a few problems with that. First, they don't know that for sure - Aizen states he's willing to give them "better" worlds but that's far from obvious. A more sadistic enemy could give them worse ones on purpose; others could simply try to go for realism. So you still have a layer of uncertainty - maybe you're just a lucky person? They surely do exist, not everyone happens to have a perfectly average amount of positive and negative outcomes. And on a human level, you're basically saying that you should prompt yourself to automatically detach yourself from the world if it's making you happy. People do that plenty IRL ("I don't deserve this", "it's too good for me", etc.), and usually it's not healthy.

Second, what if the world is simply produced by /their own/ expectations, and thus mirrors exactly their expectation of unfairness too? I think that makes more sense in this model because it lightens Aizen's otherwise rather excessive load by having everyone imagine their own world. But in that model, /by definition/, you can't ever notice anything off - because if you think it would be off, it won't happen in the first place.

That would also result in a statistically significant difference, letting you know that the world is an illusion catered to (hurting) you.

The problem then is: how? People are inherently terrible at being realistic. We consistently expect things of the world that end up being absurdly optimistic compared to reality, even when we're trying to be realistic. A demon like Descartes imagines could be intelligent enough to do that, but Aizen is still only human.

#+begin_quote

Which is why you have to apply statistics rather than just compare the difference. Sure among 7 billion humans there are going to be lucky ones, and then among those lucky ones there's going to be even luckier ones, and so on, but that hits a limit pretty quickly. If the difference in the two rates is small and your sample size is small, then sure, you could be just lucky. But if it is huge or stays statistically significant no matter how many samples you gather, that's a pretty big clue that either you're the most lucky person out of all 7 billion people on earth (which is incredibly unlikely), or you are in an illusion.

That would be even easier to determine is an illusion. After all, like you said: by definition, you can't ever notice anything off. In reality, people rarely notice things are off, but it /does/ happen from time to time. So the longer you never notice anything off (other than the fact that you still haven't noticed anything off), the more likely it is that you are in an illusion created by your expectations.

I'm not saying that. This is just a tool for figuring out whether you are in an illusion. Whether you should detach yourself from an illusory world is your own choice. Personally, I don't see the point in detaching since you are still stuck in the illusion anyway. A better method would be trying things to overload the illusion: like creating countless cameras, placing them everywhere, and having them all feed visual data to you all the time, forcing the illusion to constantly compute the data of every location you are filming. That way, if the illusion is being maintained by either you or the illusioner, it could break down from the fact that neither of you humans is capable of computing that much data at once. It's not guaranteed to work, but it's a start.

After that you could try even more desperate things like launching some of those cameras off into space to force the illusion to have to compute a larger fraction of the universe, or abusing special relativity by accelerating yourself to near light speeds, and so slow down your own time such that 1 second to you is X years for the rest of the world: X years that have to be computed by your illusion in the 1 second you experience.

The question is, what really /creates/ the illusion? Aizen, Kyouka Suigetsu itself (following more or less liberally its owner's instructions, like some sort of super artificial intelligence), or the victim? As I said above, if I wanted to write a /balanced/ Bleach, I would make it Aizen, and then all the vulnerabilities you bring up and more would indeed exist. However Kyouka Suigetsu /could/ be able to work out all the details, which would make this much harder. In canon, no such vulnerabilities are suggested, so I'm more inclined to go the "it's just magic, it always works" road (which is what I went with in this story).

But it comes at no expense for the system to just raise the general rate of luck. If you're not supposed to die of cancer, the illusion could just say "invented cure for cancer!". Boom, no cancer for anyone any more. Now the thing is, of course, a /pool/ of people with reliable information and no bias on average could still find a crack in this facade. But a /single/ person, with limited knowledge, specific biases, some of which they'll be unaware of, and no reliable pre-illusion knowledge (it's all just in their memory), /plus/ no certain knowledge of when the illusion even began? There's far too much uncertainty to draw any conclusions. I could easily rationalise the idea that /my/ world right now is an illusion, but most likely that would just me being psychotic.

Well, in Ichigo's case, he'd get paranoid about having been trapped and defeated by a dangerous enemy. So that would inevitably translate into basically sapping the joy out of the rest of his life. It's hard to detach the two things. If you worry about being in an illusion, it means you consider reality intrinsically superior (like Gin does). If you don't, you may be actually willing to step into one by yourself (like Tousen) and then wouldn't worry about it as long as you're satisfied.

I think the weak point in that is that ultimately all comes down to a bottleneck: you. Suppose I studied particle physics and sat down at the LHC, reading its outputs. The LHC produces several TB of data per second, much of which is automatically pruned out by algorithms, the rest is copied and stored in multiple servers. Now, when a scientist looks at this data, they /still/ can only take in as much as their senses can work with. So no illusion would need to /actually/ process all the quantum weirdness stuff and then produce TB of data and then refine that into the plots that he looks at on screen. It would just need to produce the plots. And by definition, those plots would fit the knowledge of the subject, so they would be good enough to fool them.

Sure, you could photograph or save them, and then go study nuclear physics /better/, and see if they still match your expectations. But you'd be looking at illusions, again. Why should the copies stay the same? And in this scenario, Infinite Mirror can even manipulate your memory. So your own memory of them would be unreliable. Any attempts to uncover the illusion will only lead to further, subtler manipulations.

Fair enough, the author of Bleach probably also figured the Zanpakutou could just handle the illusion itself. But when you think about it, that makes no sense either: we have seen plenty of sentient Zanpakutou throughout the series and all of them seem to only have human-level intelligence. Thus Kyouka Suigetsu can't be like a superintelligent AI and work out all the details.

I suppose if the illusion somehow makes it so everyone has the same amount of luck, even if it doesn't match reality's amount of luck you wouldn't be able to tell unless you measured reality's rate beforehand.

Then that raises a very interesting paradox for the illusion. For example, if I had a very unfair coin that is far more likely to land on heads than on tails (this is easy to make, just glue a heavy coin to a light one), I would still expect it to eventually land on tails if I keep flipping it over and over. But I would never expect the next particular flip to land on tails, since each flip still has a far higher probability of landing on heads than on tails. So what would the illusion do? If it obeys my expectation of the current flip, the current flip should land on heads. But if it obeys my expectation of all the flips, one should eventually land on tails. But it can't just wait until I expect that the next coin flip has to be tails, because I would always expect that the next coin flip should be heads since the flips are independent of my past flips.

And the same would be true for my everyday life in the illusion. I would expect that if I was in reality, really bad things would happen every once in a while. But I would never expect a really bad thing to happen on precisely the day I'm currently experiencing. So the illusion would have to somehow handle these two contradictory expectations.

Eh, Ichigo is a standard shonen MC that never gives up no matter how bad things get. If being trapped in an illusion is enough to make him give up and be unhappy for the rest of his life, he should have given up long long ago near the start of the story.

True. That's why I said it wasn't guaranteed to work. And so you would keep trying different things until you find one that does. The possibilities are endless, and there's no way to be sure that there is absolutely no way to break the illusion, so you can choose to keep on fighting forever.

*/Ah but that becomes very interesting now doesn't it?/*

Who is controlling your memory wipes? Your memory isn't automatically manipulated every time you suspect you are in an illusion, otherwise Ichigo wouldn't have been able to ask the question of whether he is in an illusion. And you certainly don't expect your own memory to be wiped, since you wouldn't remember any previous instance of your memory being wiped and so wouldn't recall any data to suggest your memory would be wiped. You also wouldn't expect a copy you wrote a value X on to read a different value Y later.

Which strongly suggests that if the copies (or your memories) don't stay the same, someone other than yourself, either the Kyouka Suigetsu or Aizen himself, has to actively review your memory and manipulate it every time you gain some memories that suggest you are in an illusion. Which presents a weakness in the illusion: as Aizen increases the number of illusionees, more and more of them would keep on gaining memories he or his Zanpakutou has to actively review and manipulate, and it could reach a point where they can't keep up if the illusionees don't give up on checking whether they are in an illusion.

Most of those were in anime-only filler though. The only canon Zanpakutou spirits we see are Zangetsu and Zabimaru, and both tend to just be enigmatic and give hints to their owners. Maybe Kyouka Suigetsu is special - but either way, you're pointing at inconsistencies in side stuff written for a source material that was /already/ some of the most inconsistent, plot-hole ridden stuff out there. It's kind of a losing battle.

Well, it would as long as it felt feasible. Most illnesses are rare enough that you can be reasonably expected not to catch them. Living healthy up to 80 or so is a possibility. Plus Ichigo is a Death God anyway, he /knows/ he's special and immortal, so his own mortal body can die and the illusion can simply go on.

More like, he'd try to break out all the time and fail, which would be frustrating. Unless you consider an eternal struggle the ideal condition for him as a shounen MC which... fair enough. That gets interestingly meta.

Also, if he was /wrong/, he'd be rightfully seen by everyone else as a schizophrenic, paranoid, tinfoil-hat wearing madman.

Sure, so why don't you do it right now? It's not like /you/ have any evidence that you're not trapped in an illusion either. Knowing that Aizen exists doesn't change the balance much in practice - even if you did not know of his existence, he /still/ may exist. You're as likely to stumble upon an inconsistency while simply living your life as you are doing anything else, since you have no idea what it could possibly end up being anyway.

Again, this hits on that "computational limit" thing. First: does the illusion power all come from the same source, or does it subsidise part of the victim's own brain power to parallelize its job? In the latter case, scaling is irrelevant, but perhaps differences in intelligence among victims could make a difference (though the ones providing less computational power could also be the ones less apt to notice anything wrong). Second: is that source limited at all, or is it just infinite magic that works?

These are all actually pretty interesting questions - as I said, if I had to write a full Rational!Bleach story /this/ is definitely the way I'd go to treat Aizen's power and give it reasonable limits and his opponents a fair shot at victory. However since this story was more about the Problem of Induction in general, the "Kyouka Suigetsu is basically absolutely omnipotent" approach worked better for me in this case.

******** Fair enough. I did enjoy the story, it just annoys me when people give up on finding the truth because they think it is impossible to determine. Even if Kyouka Suigetsu is truly omnipotent, there is no way for Ichigo to know that, so it is too hasty to give up.

​

As for why I personally don't bother to find out whether reality is an illusion: it's because I don't have courage. I don't think it is impossible for me to find out whether I live in an illusion. Nor is it impossible to break out. The problem is what comes after:

Considering my personality, I wouldn't have voluntarily placed myself under an illusion that wipes out all my memories of my pre-illusion self, so if reality is an illusion, then I have clearly been placed under it against my will by someone who doesn't particularly care about my wishes. So if I somehow break the illusion, I would still face the problem of having to defeat whoever placed me under the illusion, whether that's Aizen or a horde of machines guarding the matrix.

But seeing as my pre-illusion self's memories are gone, I don't remember anything about how I was defeated the first time and so cannot improve my chances of victory, whereas the illusioners probably remember that and have probably monopolized any resources I might have had. I don't even know if the laws of physics in actual reality are the same as in the illusionary reality I'm under, and so cannot make any plans whatsoever. It wouldn't be absolutely impossible to win, but the illusioners would have an obscenely massive advantage over me in any fight. And this time, they may not be so lenient as to place me in "reality". They could be angered by the mess I caused from breaking the illusion, and decide to put me under some illusionary hell instead, which is absolutely terrifying.

Ichigo may have the courage to fight Aizen again, but I do not.

I think my viewpoint comes across pretty clearly from the story, in the sense that with regards to the more abstract concept of "am I in an illusion?" - as in, is there an objective reality, am I a Boltzmann brain, etc. - all of those paths simply lead to fruitless and unfalsifiable conclusions that don't enhance my condition by one iota. If I had significant reason to believe I may have been put under an extremely accurate but imperfect illusion I could consider trying to find out / break out of it, if I have reason to believe it is worth it (since as you point out, anyone who put me into it would surely be vastly more powerful and knowledgeable than me, and has done so either for good but unfathomable reasons or out of hostility, and in either case breaking out isn't necessarily that great of an idea). But as it is, it's just one insignificant possibility among far more pressing and likely concerns, so to pursue it wouldn't be different from a weird form of religious belief, something I'm not keen on.

Of course Ichigo has a bit more to go on there - Aizen had the ability and the motive - but he's still speculating when imagining Kyouka Suigetsu's bankai. When you consider what he /knows/, he can be sure he's not the victim of an illusion: he didn't see Kyouka's shikai, ever. Even if Aizen did have a bankai, there's no guarantee it'd be a more powerful version of the same ability. Not all bankai are. Soi Fon's shikai is a stealthy two-hit kill stinging weapon - and her bankai is a /motherfucking bazooka/. So he has some more reason than me to suspect that possibility, but no real way to check his own reasoning and confirm it's grounded in reality and not sheer paranoia without going to frankly unreasonable extents.

Then again, the follow up of this story might as well be a paranoid Ichigo that lives in constant fear of Aizen watching him while everyone around him considers him crazy.
