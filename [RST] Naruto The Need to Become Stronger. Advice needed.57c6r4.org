Story Synopsys: Even with the world's most powerful daemon in your stomach, saving the world is not that easy. Any young ninja wishing to survive to fulfil his ambitions must first learn that some problems can't be solved with chakra alone, and that battles are decided by the time swords are drawn, not when they are sheathed. And just as the most important skill is the ability to remain hidden, the most frightening foe is one with the wisdom to hide in Darkness...\\
 

The prologue can be found [[https://needtobecomestronger.wordpress.com/2016/10/12/the-need-to-become-stronger/][here]].\\
 

Hey all! I have now written the first 300 pages of The Need to Become Stronger, an ambitious rationalist Naruto fanfic that aims to create a more rational version of the Naruto universe in the same way that HPMoR did for Harry Potter. I personally think it might be really good, but I'm not quite sure how to go about promoting this and making it available to as many readers as possible, so I would love some advice!\\
• Which sites should I post it to? Fanfiction.net and space battles are both popular, but are there any limits to what I can post where or should I just put it up all over the place?\\
• How does the website look? Any advice on customizing it?\\
• Are there any people, especially other writers, who'd like to help me out by giving feedback? I'm not quite satisfied with chapters 2-5 especially, which I'm using as an excuse to procrastinate, so I'd be very grateful to anyone who wants to beta-read those chapters!\\
• How is the Prologue? Please do let me know if it does not flow well or if it's boring or...anything!\\
 

The story is written to be accessible even for those with very little knowledge of the Naruto lore.\\
 

Here is the first paragraph of the story, just to tempt lazy people into downloading the prologue:\\
 

#+begin_quote
  Konoha burned.\\
   

  There was an inferno raging in the heart of the Leaf Village, a fire and yet more than fire, a conflagration that burned with more than heat alone. A creature of living flame was rampaging there, a force of nature shaped like a gigantic fox that dwarfed even the tallest building. Its breath was like the fumes of a furnace that scorched the air itself, and with each sweep of its nine smouldering tails wooden structures were scattered to the winds like burning matchsticks. Ash and smoke and crimson embers filled the acrid air, and the light of its flames outshone that of the full moon above, basking the once-peaceful village in an orange glow like a setting sun. The name given to this monster of legends was Kyūbi, the Nine-tailed Daemon Fox, and it was the greatest and most dreaded of the nine Tailed Beasts that had ravaged the world since time immemorial...
#+end_quote


** Going to be very critical because that's generally better than being nice.

My thoughts:

Starting off with the Kyuubi attack-- not a good sign. In general, lots of things are sticking out as meh or pretentious:

"Far above and away from the inferno, facing this most terrible of monsters was Namikaze Minato, hero of the Third Ninja World War and current leader of the Village hidden in the Leaves. Said to be the kind of genius that is born only once a generation, he was known around the world as the Yellow Flash, for blond was his hair and his speed was unmatched."

You're trying to come off as epic or mythic, but it doesn't work. That kind of style is very hard to pull off-- in general, try erring on the side of subdued rather than over the top.

"Well over a thousand ninja were engaged with the daemon, hurling explosives and throwing up barriers to make the beast pay for every inch it advanced into the village, yet advance it did all the same. "

Show, not tell. Why don't you describe what kinds of techniques people are using? Something like:

"Distantly, he saw Akimichi members engage the fox, bodies swelling as they briefly matched the fox's strength and pinned its tails. Another group rushed through handseals, and the ground under the fox softened to mud, trapping its paws. As the last group withdrew, 2 ninja slammed their hands on the ground in unison, and two enormous Rashomon gates slammed down on the beast's head and neck. He felt a brief swell of hope-- and then, with a roar that collapsed buildings around it, the fox broke free. " "To their quarries, it served to send a simple message: The Anbu have come for you. Your future is death."

Your prose is very dramatic. Fiction is not anime. Dramatic lines come off as pretentious, not scary.

"Through the still-burning streets of Konoha walked Namikaze Minato, who was said to be the kind of genius that is born only once a generation. The writing on the back of his white haori was covered in ash and dust, and his features were obscured but for his distinctive blond hair, yet none could have failed to recognize him now: For he was the only one in the village who did not seem to heed the flames, whose thoughts were elsewhere despite the daemon before him, whose eyes looked past the Nine-tails and beyond."

More overly dramatic prose.

"And if the Uchiha are the only ones possessing the Sharingan, then why don't you lift up those bandages and show us that right eye of yours... Danzō?”"

Basically no one in canon except Itachi, Tobi, and Orochimaru knew Danzo had the Sharingan in his right eye. It surprised Shisui when he confronted him, and Shisui was a high-ranked ANBU who had Danzo's confidence. Why would Ibiki know? If he did, why doesn't the Hokage just demand Danzo reveal it?

The entire prologue changes nothing. Almost the same result as canon, with nothing different except a battle scene with Minato, that is, frankly, not too exciting.

*** I guess this is a case of Your Mileage May Vary. I actually quite liked the prologue for its style, as well as the fact that Ibiki knew about Danzo's right eye. In a village where the Hyuga lived, I never quite understood how he managed to keep all his enhancements so secret.

The style of the story is, to me, refreshing. The dramatic prose is different from what I'm used to reading on this sub, in a nice way. The lines, dialogue, the descriptions... it gives the distinct impression that I'm reading a Naruto rational fanfic, not just any old rational story. It's unique, and it would be shame for it got away.

As for starting with the Kyubi attack; I think that's pretty much fine , as long as you follow up on the changes to the story we've seen here. The higher ups have known what Danzo's been doing for a while now it seems; the Third has also been alerted to the fact that the Kyubi's attack was not a natural event and, perhaps more important to the next few chapters, the Fourth sealed the Fox into Naruto in secret.

The only way I could really see this prologue disapoint me is if in chapter one we get to see the classic scenario of all the villager's hating Naruto because of the fox. Why would they know? Why would the Third tell people, after the Fourth went through all that trouble?

And also, of course, people know about Danzo, and the Third knows about The Enemy. I'm interested in how you'll show how the village is different from canon, given these changes.

**** Danzo keeps his arm sealed in a special brace and his right eye closed. His arm eyes are also closed until activates. So he'd look deformed under the Byukagun but might be able to hide the Sharingan. He also has Shisui's eye that can do very good genjutsu. So I think it's reasonable.

Good news - only the prologue is written in this style, so the rest of the story should be more enjoyable for you.

Anyway, other people have said the exact opposite, so I'm guessing this is a case of personal preference. Still, I do worry that maybe I'm scaring off potential readers by having the first chapter with such thick prose. I'll probably just tone it down a bit here and there...

This is a much more worrisome criticism! The chapter certainly should not be boring, and I thought it did change a few relevant things. I'll have to see if anyone else feels the same way before I make any radical changes.

So, yes, definitely avoid the words "rational" or "rationalist" on SpaceBattles. More generally though, I would suggest just avoiding SpaceBattles. The community has not impressed me and they've got hair-trigger mods with no sense of humor and no willingness to back down / lose face if they make a mistake. SufficientVelocity.com, on the other hand, has been the exact opposite. We've been over there almost a year now and I've been reading a fair amount of other fic on the site. I've seen mod text exactly once and it was applied very appropriately and minimally -- just a "hey, everyone cool down" instead of banhammers and infraction points.

**** They don't, entirely, but there's a bad stigma attached because most of the initially-posted rationalist stories were shit, because people tried to use rationality as an excuse to avoid writing well. For most people its not an immediate hatred, but it's sadly become something of a warning sign. This story isn't anywhere near as bad as they were, but it's not good enough that people will overcome their bias.

** My first few comments:

Writing 300 pages is really impressive, especially when the prologue shows good writing quality. Big kudos for that. That said, writing 300 pages and THEN asking for concrit is going to be much less effective than asking earlier, and comes off as a bit disingenuous. I doubt you will get nearly as much response as you might have gotten otherwise.

Speaking of disingenuous, it seems incongruous when you make comments about "where should I post this" in which you suggest you're going to post it everywhere, immediately followed by "can someone help motivate me to post it?" If you actually are serious about needing help, then simply put the whole thing in a zip file and put the link up. Fewer people will go to the trouble of downloading, unzipping, and reading, but some will and the response should help push you into posting individual chapters.

When you advertise your story, avoid saying things like "it has intelligent characters and ... awesome fight scenes" and "I suspect it of being amazing." That's for the reader to decide, and it sounds like you're bragging. The kind of authors who brag on their work don't tend to be the kind that produce high quality work. (Actually, in my experience that's true of people in general, not just authors.)

The rest is written as I'm reading through the story:

The mythic tone at the beginning was pretty over the top, but it worked well for a few paragraphs of introduction, and the story steadied down quickly after that. Overall, nice effect.

You're very clearly writing anime; the dialogue has that style ("why don't you lift up that bandage and show us your right eye?") and the giant ball of explosion was very obviously modeled on an anime trope image. This isn't a bad thing, but you should be aware that it's visible.

For a story that claims to be rational, there seems to be some ball-dropping going on. For example:

- Danzo says "the Uchiha can control the Beast with their Sharingan", then Ibiki announces that Danzo has a Sharingan...and no one reacts at all. The entire issue is just instantly dropped, and not even Ibiki continues to push it. I would have expected something like "hang on, you have a Sharingan? Leaving aside how the hell you have a Sharingan, can you control that monster and make it stop killing everyone?"

- This bit: "Minato frowned. His first instinct had been to check on the location of Uchiha Fugaku, head of the Uchiha clan and leader of the Konoha Military Police Force, but that was meaningless since the shrewd man was able to use Shadow clones; they would find him with the refugees either way." Distinguishing between a shadow clone and a real person is trivial: punch them. If they pop, they were a clone.

A couple of minor points: - In canon, Minato summons toads, not frogs. Is that a deliberate change? - "irresponsive" is a word, but I had to look it up to know that. I have literally never heard it before and assumed that it was a mistake and you meant "unresponsive". Word choice matters, and it's typically better to choose more standard usage, as doing otherwise knocks the reader out of the flow of the story. I say this out of personal experience -- I've gotten a large number of reviews telling me that I obviously meant "the army /infested/ the town", not "...invested..." or "the genin /polished/ up the weapons their teacher had thrown" instead of "...policed up...."

I was confused by the ending. The Third tells us that when Minato and his Anbu attacked they scared off the person who was controlling the Kyuubi and the Beast had been "irresponsive ever since". We are then shown the Kyuubi tied down, controlled by hundreds of genjutsu, etc. That makes it sound like the ninja defeated it. I guess maybe what happened is that the thing froze and then everyone tied it down?

On that subject, you state at the end that "a hundred different genjutsu effects left [the Kyuubi] helpless", yet then immediately tell us that genjutsu hadn't worked on it during the battle because Kushina was dead. Which is it?

Given that your ending is "This is the story of Naruto Uzumaki" I find myself not holding out a lot of hope that the dangling plot threads (Danzo, the investigation into Madara, etc) will be resolved. I would have liked it if you'd continued straight ahead and showed us the fallout from the attack -- the Third resuming office, the cleanup, etc. That wouldn't be Naruto's story, though. My expectation based on the fact that it is named as such is that the next chapter is going to start with canon -- that Danzo is still around, everyone has dropped the ball on looking into who caused the attack, etc. If you actually have people behave sensibly based on the information you've allowed them to deduce then the world will be completely different. Canon was shaped the way it was because everyone thought the Kyuubi assault was a natural disaster, not a targeted attack. Given that you've let Minato deduce what actually happened, everything should look different. No more Danzo, no more Root, no Uchiha massacre, probably no kidnapping of Hinata and death of Hizashi. That would be a bold and exciting choice, and I hope it's what you do.

With all of the above said, I'll read more if you put it up. I'm curious to see where you go with it.

The shadow clone poke wouldn't work, because Fugaku would leave his real body where it's supposed to be, and send the clone to control the Nine tails.

There will be major changes to canon, but maybe not enough? That's one of the things I'm hoping to get feedback on. My general goal when writing the story was to keep the Naruto world similar on the surface, but with different underlying logic and consistent explanations. So you'll see many familiar elements, but with a different twist.

Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a long review!

You're conflating two different story approaches.

Approach 1): Everything is the same as canon, but you've come up with explanations that make everyone's behavior consistent with their goals, making the story rational. This approach may require slight tweaks to canon for things or inconsistencies you can't explain. You can then start the story whenever you like, but divergences might arise. It'd be very hard to keep the plot the same and everyone acting in a manner consistent with their goals. I think this might be also called a deconstruction, but am not sure.

Approach 2): Change things. If you change even a single important thing, e.g. Danzo being found out, then if you start the story when canon begins the world will not even appear similar. Either Danzo is dead, and the whole village looks different, or Ibiki and everyone who heard his claim are dead or slaves of Danzo. The Uchiha would settle for nothing less, and the village would rather have the Uchiha than Danzo; either way, the issue would be settled decisively immediately following the Kyuubi's defeat or capture.

I already said to someone else I would change the Danzo thing. However, even if I didn't, it's a bit quick to assume that rational!Danzo would do everything the same as canon Danzo. In canon he did quite a few idiotic things that he would not do here, so people would not see him as an obvious villain.
