** 1. Per the comments you've already gotten, this is the subreddit for /rational fiction/, not general rationality.
2. Per the sidebar, no discussion whatsoever of US politics.

I've removed this post; good luck finding somewhere else to post this. I would second [[/r/slatestarcodex]], since AKAIK, there's no general rationality subreddit.

** "*A place for discussion of rational fiction*" --Inscribed on the doorway to /rational

Think your post is likely to get moved or re-moved, friend. Good luck to you.

*** To be fair, naming it [[/r/rationalfiction][r/rationalfiction]] or something would have been better SEO. I assumed for the longest time that this would basically be general rationality/lesswrongy stuff.

** I don't know what your post was about other than what I can guess from the title, but if you really want to discuss about politics on this subreddit, then I'd suggest posting about it as a top-level comment on Monday's or Friday's threads. They are a lot more accepting of discussing real world topics than having it as a separate post.

I forgot about that rule being put on the sidebar. It's not there anymore and I think that sentence got removed when Reddit updated the site design or when the community rewrote the definition of ration fiction. I think you should put it back in under:

#+begin_quote

  1. Only post rational fiction links or discussion.\\

  If we're not on-topic, what's the point? If you just want to talk to likeminded people, we have a variety of weekly threads for that :)

  See the sidebar for a definition of rational fiction.
#+end_quote

Somewhere in there might be best.

***** It's in the sidebar, just not in the sidebar on the redesign, because they're in two different places that have to be edited independently and are in totally different sections of the mod UI, one part of which is hard to reach without switching between the two (grumble grumble).

I've updated that now, thanks.
