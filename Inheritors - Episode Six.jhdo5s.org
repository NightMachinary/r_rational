Normally, I post a narration of my episode on YouTube alongside the actual text, but I had to work my day job 8am to 9pm this week. The narration will be posted tomorrow!

A side note, I've initiated discussion on my discord about switching to a batch posting schedule instead of once a week. My thought is it might be better, every month and a half to two months, to post a larger batch of episodes across the span of a week. Does anyone have any thoughts on which method is better: once per week posting of a single episode, or lots of episodes every blue moon or so?


** Hey, thanks for the update :)

I really enjoyed the audio narration last week, so I'll wait for Sunday before reading alongside it.

As for the update schedule, I'd say whichever works best for you. Weekly updates probably mean more viewers, as it'll get attention more frequently on the subreddit. But whichever process makes it less likely you'll burn out and have to abandon the project is infinitely preferable in my opinion.
