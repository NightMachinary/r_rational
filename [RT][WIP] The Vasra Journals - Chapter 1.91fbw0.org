** I would love to receive some feed back since this is the first time I've ever published something online and my confidense of a writer is that of a cat scruyying away from a vacuum machine. Having read WORM, Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, Pracitcal Guide to Evil... I've gotten tired of waiting for my favorite stories to churn out a new chapter, so, having been inspired by these titans of the underworld in literature, I decided to start my own story which I hope that people will enjoy (and find rational).

*** Alright; brackets, parenthesis, whatever you want to call them, use them '-' is not a substitute, it is vary jarring to leave the context of the sentence entirely like that, and brackets help. Otherwise it seems like an interesting read, even if I just skimmed the beginning and end, I'll try it some more once you have more available.

**** thanks,

I think I've had to edit the story in its published format four times now, I think there's a lesson to be learned here.

edit: My respect for the authors of Mother of Learning and Aeromancer have increased ten-fold. Christ on a flaming bike, leaving out details after publishing is torture.

****** Edit and sleep on it before posting, I suppose is the lesson.

I think, the most important part of writing is that you have to keep writing everyday and make a habit of it, even if it's not good. Otherwise, you won't have anything at all. I encourage you to post, the idea that people, someday might take a liking to our stories and bother us about the next update, is a fantastic extrinstic motivator. Of course there's the stress of it, but hey, nothing beats stress harder than alchol!

** Disclaimer: I have written very little narrated fiction and most of it sucked.

I think you need to work on your writing, on a sentence structure level. I picked a lot of weird sentence flows, but here's an example:

#+begin_quote
  I nodded, getting the materials to make it had been hard. Though only one ingredient had been only obtainable through the black market
#+end_quote

You're trying to pack way too much subtext in a single sentence, and as a result, you end up with a really weird-sounding line. (you have 'only' nested twice in the same clause)

I think what you're trying to say is "The character acquired ingredients for his gift through the black market, which means the gift is valuable, and he's being very cavalier about it because he's used to breaking the law and getting stuff from the black market". The thing is, you're trying to cram that information in a forced "after the fact" fashion that sounds really annoying after a while.

More generally, you're trying to imply way too many things at once, where explicitely saying them would be easier to read (Practical Guide also has that problem).

A better sentence structure would be:

"I nodded. He had reason to be impressed: gathering the ingredients to make that bread had been hard. Some of them you could only get through the black market."

Overall, I'd give the same verdict to the whole first chapter: you're trying way too hard to be witty, you're trying to cram way too much information at once, and you're not giving enough weight to what you're writing.

Also, you need to get way better at using commas and periods.

*** Thank you for the criticism! It doesn't really matter if somebody has written narrative fiction, you can still point out flaws in something, being able to write allows one to sympathize, but isn't necessary to be able to point out flaws.

I think the excessive subtext is a result of reading bad writing where characters didn't both hiding anything from the reader/other characeters and the result was no drama.

There's a certain 'rush' that I feel to get to the meat of the story, and this is what some other writers suffer from too. I have to keep in mind that I can always spread info in later chapters.

I reckon that a lot of what the main character is implying is stuff that he and other people already know in the world. For example, in our world, we don't think about getting into a car and describe every last thing we do, we sorta glaze over it? Not sure how to phrase it? But stating some things outright would help cement the story and the world.

There's a picture of me in the Geneva Conventions underneath the title, "Comma and Period Atrocities." It's an issue one of my professors pointed out too, lots of run ons and just long winded sentences---complex sentences, too many, you know, just awful; one of my long-running weaknesses in writing in general.

I'll keep this in mind, thank you. The general hope is with the amount of time I'm spending writing along with criticism from readers, I'll become a better writer. There's several other stories I've been dying to put into text, but my lack of skill and work ethic is deterring.

** I like the style! I'm not 100% sure why you'd seal someone in a book, but did they just do this yesterday? Because if Nyx can still see, speak, and manipulate objects, and knows exactly the magic needed to escape, one day is about how long I'd expect escape to take.

*** It's a dark fantasy, the protagonist gets stuck with a morally reprehensible sorceress and the two clash over their different agendas.

I'm a pretty slow writer with only 600 words an hour, an hour a day (probably more if I don't get distracted with college), with updates every Sunday.

I recommend sidelining it for now until I gain some momentum since it's rather dry right now.

If you are looking for a good read, allow me to direct you to, WORM or Pact by Wildbow. Practical Guide to Evil, The Gods are Bastards, Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, Overlord (which can be found on skythewood's blog, and vol's 10-13 someplace else, I think [[/r/overlord][r/overlord]] has got the links)
