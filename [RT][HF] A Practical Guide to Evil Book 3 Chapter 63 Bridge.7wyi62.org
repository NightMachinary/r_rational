** Hey, looks like you've taken over my chapter posting duties :P

Decent chapter, though I do feel like the impact of Akua breaking the news to Cat is muted, as we saw exactly what happened with the battle. There's probably a better structure that could've been implemented there.

Poor Thief. Her entire appearance in the story so far is getting blown up/burnt/maimed/beat.

I didn't realize that Cat and Black had split up. Was that mentioned at all?

Also, thoughts on whose silhouette that was?

Midway through the last Cat chapter. It was overshadowed by Cat and Black's conversation.

Malicia, Black, and Diabolist are my first thoughts, and maybe Warlock or Masego. Not sure at this point.

**** I'd say that, given that we weren't actually told what the silhouette said, it's something related to the plan or changes therein. It also is a last-minute message that risks attracting the attention of Diabolist, so it's someone's personal message, not a note prepared in advance.

We don't know yet whether this is actually happening during the beginning of the third Interlude or Akua's being selective in her assessment of the situation as usual, but the both actual mage-Names are probably out of the picture. Thief probably survived but none of her powers lend themselves to remote controlling magical constructs: she's more about bypassing magic entirely. Given that it's called a silhouette in the text, I'd expect Black to sneak a message in, but discreetly taking her enemy's magical construct sounds more like Malicia's doing. Perhaps she left long-term commands in the minds of Akua's henchmen, and they gave her the controls?

** Well, Akua is boned. Cat is now very firmly in the role of a hero: her mentor is captured, her army will be defeated without her intervention and her friend is possibly dead. She even gets a "we're not so different" speech from the main villain!

Time for some divine intervention from Gods Below? It would be interesting if, like in Book 2, Cat was offered a new name but this time from an agent of the Gods Below. The conflict is even taking place in a demonic version of Liesse.

#+end_quote

Historically, acting as a hero ends with her powers weakened. Narrative power notwithstanding, it's a square peg/round hole situation. She's not a heroine, and even if the story wants her to be, the mantle of her power gets shaken loose if she tries to do it. It worked with the fae because they're not really part of Creation/Names, and because they were bound to the narrative and thus able to be manipulated. Ubua is not, and they're in Creation again where Names reign over narrative.

Cat could theoretically inherit a new Name, even a heroic one; but doing so would still leave her weak. Names very rarely inherit more than a single Aspect from the start; it takes weeks or months to learn them all. If the Gods Below decide to grant her a new Name, I can only see it working if Ubua's already on the ropes (eg, has already used all three Aspects). But even that's... boring. Too much of a trope. I feel like if Cat's going to get a new Name, it's going to be in an unexpected way, like Ubua controlling her soul, forcing her to kill Black, and her inheriting his title. It would turn the trope on its head, power up Cat, and be horrific.

Good guys that aren't William are the viewpoint that this story sorely needs. I get that setting up the positions in the debate so they have a chance of winning is Cat's and Black's (and in longer term, Bard's) thing, but the warped narrative that ensues sometimes gets as uncomfortable to read as the sequence that leads to Captain's offscreen death (if not as explicitly deliberate).

** Fall is a rather strange choice for an opening move. Certainly, there's nothing she could Take yet, Break should be held back to match Bind, and she moved close to Diabolist's forces before waiting for them to move in for a fight, so she'll be able to freeze everything on sight, but the downsides are nothing short of disastrous.

Akua has just implied that she's seen the defeat of Princess of High Noon in detail, which means that her dimension-scrying artifact isn't affected by Fae-induced lens flare, and so she's likely seen what Fall can do and prepared for it. If entering her domain is as brief and tiring for Cat as it was last time, she'll have reinforcements moving in as soon as it goes away, when Squire is at her weakest.

The only way this will be of any longer tactical significance is if Cat will blackout the whole Liesse like she did with Sulia's crippled domain, but given that Liesse is Diabolist's home turf, I wouldn't bet on it. I honestly expected Cat to get into a fight or bait Akua before using an Aspect first.

*** Fall is also her only "anti-army" aspect. She can use it to clear a path through the horde and she can't use it on Akua anyway. Akua is Diabolist, a mage who's messing with other dimension as a hobby, not some Summer noble with an allergy to Winter magic. Also, she can't use Break or Take anyway. Akua is right, there's no way for the Squire to win that fight.

That's the thing though. Cat is getting pushed toward taking a stance on her past action and redefining her path, her objectives and the method to support both. Her story, in a way. Cat isn't going to stay the Squire for much longer.
