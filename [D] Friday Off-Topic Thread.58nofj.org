Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** One idea I haven't been able to get out of my head recently is the idea of a world in which musical numbers have tangible effects on the world, much like they appear to in movies and other media. So if you start playing an instrument and sing, everyone who starts singing along will all join in with the same lyrics, assembled out of the intent behind the song, and for the duration of the song all activities will be more efficient or successful. Construction workers could place beams of wood in a single stroke and hammer each nail completely into the beam with a single swing apiece, all in tune with the song and at the same precision they'd get if they spent time measuring. The better the music, the more potent the musical, and some musicals would, instead of increasing efficiency, lead up to a climactic finish in which one extraordinary feat is accomplished, anything from finally sticking the landing on your gymnastic routine to figuring out the solution to the complex mathematical problem that you've been agonizing over for days, if the musical is good enough.

What I'm trying to piece together is the repercussions of a world like this. Of course, the field of war would be noticeably different with generals conscripting musicians, with the intent to assemble orchestras on the battlefield so that the musical would magnify the strength of the troops' attack. Companies would form with the purpose of hiring musicians and sending them to clients who need a one-time productivity boost, and places like hospitals with vital time-sensitive tasks would try to keep a musician on hand in case the surgeon needs a musical to save the patient. But apart from that, how else would society change as a result of this power?

*** This is ridiculously awesome. What would a Montage be?

There would be a huge social stigma against singing out of tune. Large projects would spend time vetting people for tone deafness. It would take a genius to solve that issue in someone with a musical, because every time the "star" joins in it saps some of the power of the song.

A lot of the war music (and any competitive music in general with two sides that want a different outcome) would be about incorporating the other side's tune and making it look like /they/ are the bit piece in /our/ song. See the Song of the Ainur in the Silmarillion, where Eru manages to make Melkor's cacophony sound like punctuation to his own song.

There would be a pretty funny inversion of college degrees: the "real" degrees would all be liberal arts, while STEM would be this special snowflake "I just want to understand the world" kind of thing that only idiot kids get into.

Hmm, there would be a certain amount of sabatoges, professionals who ruin a harmony in just the wrong way to ensure a song doesn't go as right. Getting caught with a kazoo is asking for it.

And of course since so much of music is cultural, learning different worldwide styles is kind of a catch 22, in that they're only effective in your native land if they're popularly understood, but only enter the cultural consciousness if they're used.

**** A Montage, I guess, would be a series of musicals in close sequence, from the same musician(s) and sharing the same intent. The effect would then accumulate so that at the end of the montage potency has significantly increased.

With singing out of tone, I expect the supermajority of the population would be taught how to sing from a young age, with the express intent of making sure they can at least participate in musicals. Given how career-affecting that would be, I expect a lot of research and effort would go into reliable methods to teach proper singing. Similarly, vocal tutoring would become much bigger business and music would be a core part of school curriculum (The kids would love the concept of musicals because of how magical they are).

Of course, that doesn't rule out sabatoge, but I expect governments would consider intentionally interfering with a musical illegal, as long as the musical has official documentation behind it (such as being hired to produce musicals for desperate surgeons or the contract between a music company and a client). The world would also develop with a cultural appreciation of musicals, so the idea of intentionally ruining one would be reprehensible at the very least.

They love the idea of just being able to do whatever they want with music, but then they discover just how much work to takes to be good at it and lose interest. They'll go in expecting that you can just magically whip out a tune and warp reality, only to be disappointed when they need to learn sheet music, scales, aesthetic standards, and more AND have to constantly practice. It's not that different from learning science.

**** Tone deafness isn't quite as common as people think. Most of the time the people who think they're tone deaf haven't had any sort of training besides the little self-taught ability they have. In this fiction, tone deafness might be equivalent to having to get physical therapy for a torn muscle. It'll take anywhere from a few months to a year or two, but most everybody can be trained. There is medically diagnosable tone deafness (congenital amusia), but that is pretty rare and isn't treatable.

Kodaly (and Orff) instructors would also be beyond valuable. Kodaly is one of the prominent methods used to teach music to children. These instructors would at the very least have the same social status as coaches for the NFL, with opera and choir singers being the players.

Speaking of which, singing competitions would take the place of sports. Not like American Idol mind you, it would be 1v1 or team competitions kinda like the Songs of the Ainur you mentioned, just with lots of improvising. What effect would singing opera have? I have no idea but it's probably different than a musical number.

Something else to think about would be the affect of modality on music. The two most prevalent modes are Ionian (major keys) and Aeolian (minor keys). There are five other modes (Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, and Locrian) that aren't used outside of the classical music word, and even then they're hardly used. Locrian by far is the hardest mode to sing in because it's so strange to western ears. Music in those modes would probably have a strange effect.

A big question would be how popular opinion influence musical effects. Music has changed a lot over the part 400ish years, sometimes due to composers like Beethoven rejecting the "meta" and other times because the public opinion has an effect on the evolution of music, such as vaudeville in the early 1900's.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aobVs-HfsCI]]

The seagull's atrociously off-key singing doesn't do anything and just draws a sarcastic comment from Eric. While Sebastian (who's earlier established as a famous conductor) can create a specific mood he's aiming for on-demand.

*** Hmmm.

There would have to be limits. If you're getting more energy out of your song than you're putting in, then you have a free-energy society, which is even /more/ different to our world. So, let's assume that the musical simply makes things happen in the /most efficient/ way, while at the same time getting anyone who gets caught up in the tune to help out to the best of their ability.

- Major construction projects would be accompanied by music; and, in fact, construction equipment would be designed to produce musical sounds (so a bulldozer would double as a musical instrument)

- Factories, mines, and sweatshops would play suitable music on a loop at all times while people are expected to be working.

- During war, if an enemy soldier is captured, he would be interrogated by surrounding him with large numbers of allied soldiers, who would all then start a song about spilling secrets. Some of the allied soldiers would mention their secrets (generally personal - no-one with really dangerous secrets would be in this song) and thus trigger the prisoner to spill all he knows. (To counter this, high-ranking military personnel might intentionally deafen themselves).

- Versebreakers would be an accepted but not exactly prestigious job - probably much like rodent exterminators. You know society needs them, but the average private citizen doesn't exactly ever want to need them personally.

- High-end scientific laboratories would all include an on-call orchestra. Large laboratories (like the Large Hadron Collider) would incorporate an excellent sound system, allowing the same song to be heard all around the accelerator ring.

- Anyone wanting to pursue a serious personal project would have even more reason to collect a few friends and do so as a team.

**** One of the things I worked out from the other replies is that musicals are only started with the actual musician who makes the music recognizing it as music. They can't declare something like regular speech as a kind of music and start a musical that way, and they also can't take something like ambient bird calls and declare that a song either. On top of that, the musical loses potency the more interfering sounds there are.

So speakers wouldn't count as an instrument, I think. You could make the argument that it's no more of a black box, as far as producing sound goes, than any other instrument, but it's not something the musician plays, and thus would be just sounds from a piece of technology. You could still propagate songs across large areas, but that would be more a matter of amplification of an existing song.

I'm not too concerned about the free-energy thing, as well. Since you can't pull off a musical without a physical musician present to play music (which would be a costly thing), even if you /could/ get free energy in some way from the increased productivity I don't think it would be comparable to other forms of energy production, which can be upscaled. Maybe it'd be important at the end of the universe with entropy and heat death, but that's not in the timeframe of the setting.

That interrogation song is a perfect mental image, though. You've got the soldier tied to a chair, surrounded by enemy soldiers, and they break out into boisterous song about interrogating him while interrogating him. By the end of the song, the soldier's given out all of the info and doesn't know exactly how they managed it. Turning construction equipment into musical instruments is a good idea too, as long as you can make sure your construction workers are good enough to play them properly and won't just interfere with the musical. In such cases, I expect the equipment would come with a mute function to just try and run silently.

Hmmmm. Can they start a musical with nothing but a well-sung song, or do they actually need an external instrument?

Because I can hum a tune, and recognise it as music; and there are ways for a human, with zero equipment, to at least approximate the sound of a guitar...

****** I think the angle I'm going with is that singing does count as a musical instrument for the purposes of a musical, but everyone knows you'll get better results by singing /and/ playing an instrument. The difference between speech and singing is that one is 'obviously' musical and the other is 'obviously' not. We see things that way, so the effect takes hold for singing but not speaking. Chanting would work too, I assume.

I imagine sweatshops would be all about getting someone with decent musical talent to work for them, given how a musical is a productivity amplifier for all of the workers. But other than that, yeah, hire someone to force all the workers to sing along in a never-ending musical about making T-shirts.

And for free-energy machines, I'll just phrase this as musicals can do the 'impossible', but the regular rules of the universe only do not hold when a musical is actively interfering. I could maybe use a musical to lift a heavy object with less energy than I'm giving it potential energy, but I couldn't make a machine that does the same in silence. Obvious follow-up is the idea of having an efficient, scaled up free-energy machine that you keep fueled with a musical. And, well, maybe? I mean, I still can't see it usurping real energy sources, but maybe there's a power plant somewhere that works like this?

The interrogated soldier would know, logically, how they got the info, but at the same time he would have been steeling himself to not let anything slip, to make sure he didn't betray his country, and then the music starts and all of that fell apart. It would be disturbing, on a level.

I'm getting the feeling now that most industries would be trying to 'music-optimize' the workflow so that every worker can count as playing a musical instrument. The musicals would be that much more potent from it, of course, and it produces the requirement for people to know how to make music as well as sing along.

I'm also interested in the implications on using musicals to help teach music. I mentioned having a musical build up to one extraordinary feat, right? So a kid who has trouble singing or playing an instrument could have a professional musical made with the purpose of a climactic moment in which they surpass their major roadblock.

Okay, that's reasonably sensible.

So the sweatshop workers would all be singing about making T-shirts, led by one guy with a musical instrument, to get most of the effect for minimal capital outlay.

And your average office block would be sound-proofed to prevent interfering with the neighbouring office block.

Hmmmm... one way to sabotage a factory, then, would be by introducing a discordant note. A "screech bomb", perhaps, could be a tool with which a saboteur could really mess with the bottom line.

But there's also the psychological aspect to consider. Can Villain McEvil persuade the hero to pilot Villain McEvil's giant robot on a deathly rampage through the streets by means of a sufficiently catchy tune? This could easily become borderline mind control.

******** Villain McEvil, assuming in-universe movie where this would happen, would possibly be able to sway the hero with a musical at the right timing. Like, if the hero's feeling unsure about his convictions because of something that happened half-way through the story, Villain McEvil could arrange for a musical to culminate with a decision to join Villain McEvil. Of course, the counterpoint musical from the friends of the hero would convince him to be a hero again. (This would work best with non-black-and-white morality, but it'll happen a lot with black-and-white morality anyways.)

More realistically, I expect musicals during debates to be considered horribly rude if only one-sided. So if both sides start going back and forth, with dramatic proclamations in tune with the high points of the song, that's fine, but you don't go and start a musical if your opponent doesn't.

Your version requires musicians to be present in-universe to construct a narrative that the universe itself obeys, which has a whole different set of implications. Is there anything that can prevent a song from taking effect? If songs conflict, does one dominate or do they cancel each other out and why?

**** Well, one of the things that I mentioned is that the lyrics that everyone follows would form from the intent behind the song. So you could argue that when a musician starts making music, the effect of a musical starts because the musician recognizes it as music, and the people who join in the singing reinforce the effect when they recognize it as singing. From there you could say that the song's intent involves an objective or set of objectives that the musical not only optimizes behaviour for, adjusting the angle the construction worker positions his arm at or manipulating the lines of thought of the mathematician, but also produces lyrics befitting the intent and the people involved in the song.

For songs cancelling out, well, a musical works best when the song itself is loud, clear, and uninterrupted. The more immersive it is, in a word. So if you take two separate musicals next to each other, the external sounds from the other musical would diminish the 'purity' of the first, and vice versa. If the people trying to sing along start having a hard time making out the music, they stop being able to produce the same lyrics and the extra productivity leaves them. So I suppose a good way of cancelling a musical is to simply drown it out with other sound, and if you make your musical loud and powerful enough it would disturb a musical with quieter notes or a weaker sound.

** Weekly update on my rational pokemon game, including work on the data creation tool Bill's PC. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUSMDHdRdbvQJii5uoSezbjtvJpxdF6Da8zqvuW42bg/edit?usp=sharing][Handy discussion links and previous threads here]].

--------------

This week was a lot of preparation work.  I have not yet pulled together the project to start prototyping the grid system, but I needed to get some of the ground work laid down for the game in general, so I don't feel particularly bad.  Need a good foundation to build off of, after all.

First off, I spent the weekend categorizing the Discord chat logs.  For those of you still too shy to pull the trigger, we'd love to have you [[https://discord.gg/sM99CF3][on the #pokengineering channel of the /r/rational Discord server]], where we spend our time brainstorming and +carefully thinking through the mechanics+ arguing over Giovanni's bakery (seriously).  

But the learning curve of such a dedicated channel can be a bit unnerving, I can imagine. I do [[https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B0LYycfi-K18Z21BeDZXVWVpOFE][record the chat log]] every night, but this clocks in at about 40k lines of chat and is a /lot/ of stuff to sift through just to get a bit of context. To help aid that a little bit (and to produce a reference for my own use), I have put together a [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-BBPJoGaMDwAsxP9lYNLyARKCGI9pZGLXf2x-IgWbfs/edit#heading=h.80njbegesyuj][Table of Contents]] for the channel as a whole.  This is updated every night (or every other night) with the latest and greatest, and has the major on-topic discussions from every day clearly marked. Browse through it at your leisure, and take a look at the discussion topics that interest you.  

Nevertheless even if you /don't/ put in the time to read that massive novel of a log, we don't mind answering questions, so come on in anyway! The more the merrier.  The community has been invaluable in helping me shape the vision for this game, and I can't thank them enough.

--------------

Part of the reason I started the log categorization project was so that I could produce a /formal/ design document to replace the schizophrenic one in the link at the top of this post.  This is greatly served by having the reference handy, and over the next couple of weeks I will try and get that put together.

I also pulled my old, dry, dusty book on software engineering for game developers off the shelf, and while skimming it again was reminded at how much of a boon having a concrete to-do list really is, so the game proper also needs a Software Requirements document.

The idea is to take the [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/13e4bMBgsvshUBFShes2bG3RGXIzVYh16EPboqDTdpfA/edit][roughly 450 features in the informal feature request document]] and cut them up into bite-sized chunks. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hCan6A4qIUYbEt0nTRpDhDfTDCJc_D1aUm2wpc4jdRk/edit][This in-progress document is started here]], and so far has about a dozen systems inflated into ~90 specific software requirements.

Some of those informal features are actually story ideas or worldbuilding, but even after filtering those out, this is a /shit ton/.  There is no getting around that fact.  I don't doubt that it will eventually resolve into somewhere around ~2000 specific requirements.  

As I create this massive list, though, I will pare it down somewhat to be more sane.  I'm a maniac but I'm not /crazy/. After it's complete, I will sit down and group those requirements into related “stripes”, and then order those stripes into a roadmap that makes sense.  Each stripe will represent a coherent system, and, if done properly, will stand alone from an interaction and fun perspective.  This list will also pull double duty as a git branch outline and a unit test list, or at least the starting point of one.  

--------------

The above lists and documents will be an ongoing project.  I aim to have them in a more-or-less complete state around the new year.

Main two projects involve 1) expanding upon existing model-based methods of inferring phylogeny using continuous and discrete morphological traits while borrowing heavily from the quantitative genetics literature, testing everything extensively in simulation and against "assumed" trees obtained from nucleotide sequence alignments and more established methods, and applying the new methods to fossil taxa (for which aDNA is unretrievable; most paleontologists don't really go in for model-based inference of phylogeny), and 2) exploring popular questions of human biological adaptation using particular sorts of phylogenetic comparative methods where you model trait evolution "explicitly" instead of just "correcting" for phylogenetic "confounding" (probably just fitting a buncha models with rjMCMC and reading the relative fit off directly -- generally people like using information criteria or LRTs or w/e for model comparison, they have been shown via simulation to be biased in a phylogenetic context).

** You are a writer who wants to write about a protagonist who can manipulate probabilities. However as a dedicated commentator on this subreddit, you want to be able to give some pseudo-scientific BS about how the power works to best detail how it functions and interacts with the world. What sort of explanations/hypotheses would you give for this power?

It can be something overpowered like being able to see all possible futures and selecting the desired future. This would be possible due to the fact that all possibilities are true and all universes simultaneously exist, you're simply 'choosing' which universe to exist in.

Or being able to manipulate parts of the world that people can't observe as long as the change is plausible. such as being able to change a face-down card from an Ace of Spades to a King of Hearts as long as those two cards have not been drawn from the deck. The power would not allow a card with the image of an elephant on it to be drawn since no such card exists. This would be a macro-level instance of the observer effect in quantum physics where a hidden object exists in all possible states simultaneously before being observed.

Yet another one would be the ability to be lucky as long as you do good deeds to balance out the scales, because Karma is an actual scientific force in the world like electromagnetism and gravity.

What sort of probability manipulating powers can you come up with, and how would you explain why it works at all if your character is an inquiring scientist investigating it?

*** Fundamentally, luck is when the result of a situation is determined, to one extent or another, by variables the person has no access to. So rolling a die is a matter of luck because not only is it hard to control the exact motion of our hand upon rolling it, but we also can't predict or, more importantly, manipulate or account for other factors like the motion of air and slight imperfections in the die or the table.

Manipulating luck is all about taking the variables other people cannot see, and manipulating them to your own ends. You could control the result of a roll of the dice by telekinetically adjusting the /exact/ motion of the hand that rolls it. When shuffling a deck of cards, you can control which card ends up where by telekinetically adjusting the precise motion of the cards and have them end up in a different spot.

The key to this is that it is all very minor-scale, and subconscious. You cannot use this telekinetic power to shove someone around, since people are far too large to be meaningfully affected. But you can use it to make a die land on a 6 each time. As well, the power is subconscious, so it operates only knowing what you want it to do, or perhaps even what you would want it to do. You cannot by yourself track which card is being shuffled where, and decide how much force to apply to change that, but if your power knows what you want on top, it can apply the relevant telekinesis. Regarding it doing what you would want it to do, this lets you do things like 'improbably' be missed by a gunshot, because your power knew you would not want to be shot by it and telekinetically adjusted the aim of the gunman to make sure they just barely missed.

*** There are a number of possibilities.

Terry Pratchett, in /The Dark Side of the Sun/, postulated Probability Math - a mathematical system which could be used to make extremely accurate predictions of the future, given sufficient processing power. And then he included one character - a robot - who was deliberately /designed/, using Probability Math, to be "lucky". (The specifics of how that worked, under the hood, were never elaborated on beyond that - and never needed to be. The effects were obvious; a gun fired at him would jam, a blaster fired at him suffered a highly unlikely field inversion and disintegrated the user instead).

--------------

But, if you want to actually know how it works, there are a few major possibilities.

- The character is somehow able to affect small, hidden movements telekinetically and subconsciously. This will work when rolling a dice, but is less likely to help make someone pull out your number from a hat in a lucky draw if you don't know where in the hat your number is.

- The character is able to select an outcome, and make universes containing that outcome more probable. This will work for both the dice and the lucky draw mentioned above.

- The character is simply able to observe possible futures (consciously or subconsciously). He can win the lottery by seeing the numbers that will be drawn, and then picking those numbers. He can't force a die to land on a six, but he can very successfully make a bet on which number will be thrown.

- The character does not, in fact, have any luck-based powers at all. However, another character has extremely strong luck-based powers of the "only universes that match my selected outcome can exist" type, and her selected outcome requires that the protagonist survive and be reasonably happy until such time as he performs some task for her. (This luck-based power will abruptly and unexpectedly vanish once he has performed this task, which could be anything).

- The protagonist has an ally (possibly unknown to him) who is invisible and/or able to affect the world at long range. And possibly intangible. (Fae, ghosts, demons, and genies are popular examples). This ally wants the best for the protagonist (at least for the moment), and can do things like grab a die in mid-air and turn it so it lands showing a six. In this case, the protagonist will be luckiest when he is vocal about what he wants to happen.

** I have oscillated between about 4 different projects over the last 6 months or so. None of them are reaching public status quite yet, but one thing that I have been fascinated in since a child has been games and game programming, especially low power systems such as consoles. My favorite console since I was a child is the Nintendo 64. Recently, discovered that the N64 developers kit is available online, and work in a 32bit winXP environment. Since then, on the off weekend, while taking a break from school work I worked on doing various things using the official software/libraries. ([[/r/n64homebrew]])

Recently received help from someone on [[/r/gcc]] to get nearly the entire build process working in windows 64 bit. (windows 7, 8, 10) Now we have to recreate the effects of a program called mild from 1997.

Once we do that, people will be able to run the whole process without requiring a 32 bit system! The day that happens, I will be a very happy computer nerd!

In contemplation of what to do afterwards, I have considered (thanks to [[/u/ketura]] and their paper on rational game design) following the ideas behind the rational video game essay and implementing those in my own minecraft-style N64 game. The very system itself requires significant planning due to limited resources (4 mb without memory expansion!), but with modern cartridge tech like the 64drive or everdrive, I can insert an SD card (>8 GB!) and use some of that for swapfile.

Anyway, the idea is to either make a game directly (Let's call the hypothetical project 64craft) or find a suitably slim (or configurable) 3D game engine with public source code and port it over to the N64. If my goal is to kind of jump start the homebrew N64 development scene, which do you think would get the most media attention to attract developers?

Doom on the N64 is old news at this point so I'll probably go for something else. Thoughts?

** I'm still doing some planning for my rational Doctor Who fanfic. I've settled on what I think is an acceptable time-travel (henceforth TT) mechanic, but it doesn't totally line up with canon (which is extremely inconsistent on the topic).

Ultimately, this question is a little academic, so feel free to ignore this whole comment. Doctor Who, despite being about a man and his companion(s) as they travel through time and space, mainly uses TT to, well, travel. For the most part it isn't a problem-solving device. I intend to stick to that premise (and possibly explain why the Doctor might end up behaving like that, story permitting).

As a long-running soft sci-fi show, Doctor Who canon is somewhat flexible on the topic of TT. Sometimes changing the past creates a paradox that causes monsters to appear to devour the affected people. Other times it has no noticeable effect at all, even when a gigantic robot is defeated by a man in a hot air balloon in the middle of 19th century London. Sometimes the future is fixed, and what has been seen to occur must occur. Other times the future is in flux.

A lot of the time there's an excuse that means you can't use the Tardis to TT while part of events, but then that gets ignored when the plot demands it. Sometimes they neglect to use the Tardis as a regular space-craft, even though they use it like that in other episodes.

I'm hoping to make that a little more consistent. If there's a reason the Tardis can't save the day, the reader should expect this.

The premise of my mechanic is this: when you travel in time, the temporal relationship of the passenger before and after the trip is severed. I.e. the fate of pre-travel!you does not affect the fate of post-travel!you. Pre-travel!you will cease to exist at the moment of travel, even if in this new timeline you don't end up TTing. Effectively, TT creates deletion event for pre-travel!you and a creation event for post-travel!you. The terminology I use for this is that pre-travel!you is truncated and post-travel!you is affixed.

So if you went back in time and killed your grandfather then truncated!you would never be born, but affixed!you would continue to exist unchanged. Likewise, if you went back in time on your 25th birthday and rescued your parents from a fire, then truncated!you would grow up with both parents alive and at age 25 (when you TTed in the original timeline) would cease to exist. Affixed!you would not receive any new memories or relationships as a result.

This sidesteps the problem of paradoxes---if you travel back in time and destroy your time machine it doesn't matter. Otherwise, virtually any trip into the past where the light cones overlap would result in a paradox.

It also enables what I think is an interesting technique: you can repurpose a trunctated version of yourself for a new task at the cost of undoing your truncated self's actions. So if you spend 10 years building hospitals for orphans then TT, if a war breaks out you /can/ bring along two or more yous to the fighting, but those hospitals won't get built. And if you try to build up lots of "useless" time to spend on duplicates, your TTing enemies will have free reign to reshape the universe and/or assassinate you.

The other main paradox-free TT mechanics are "single consistent timeline" (see HPMoR), "self-correcting timeline" (used now and again in Doctor Who canon), and "branching universes" (see Branches on the Tree of Time). Briefly, why I didn't use them:

- A single consistent timeline doesn't fit with canon at all. They routinely change the future, something which is impossible with this mechanic. Creating a single consistent timeline with anything even close to the quantity and impact of TT in Doctor Who canon would be impossible.
- The self-correcting timeline would work, but it devalues the characters' choices. I /could/ save the world from a Dalek invasion, but since that never happened in the future the universe would just correct it out of existence (or wouldn't, if author fiat says so). It adds an unwanted element of fatalism. Also, again, it's inconsistent with large parts of canon (e.g. entire races being wiped from existence).
- Branching universes dilutes the impact of characters' actions. It works really well in Branches on the Tree of Time where engineering the perfect timeline is literally the goal, but I don't think it's a good fit for the story I want to tell. It's certainly not an element of canon at all, except when alternate universes come up (and it's never implied such universes are created by TT).

In this framework reality is deterministic and there's no such thing as the present. If I TT to the past, kill Hitler, and TT back to 2016, the world will have instantly updated---no time ripples or fluctuating timelines.

The big flaws I can see with my version are these:

1. There need to be additional limits on the utility of TT to make the story entertaining. I have some in mind, but nothing concrete. Currently, the solution to virtually every problem ought to be "TT and do it better". This is mostly the same in canon, except with inconsistently obeyed rules of "can't interfere with our own timeline" and "some events are fixed".
2. With multiple TTing agents there needs to be a clear explanation for who TTs when. My current solution is basically a meta-time queue; if I TT once and then again a year later, every other TTer gets a year of meta-time. This could be very confusing for readers, which is partly why I suspect Doctor Who avoids TT-abusing enemies (they mostly travel to a time, enact their evil plan, escape, repeat). I'm going to try to avoid a situation where this is important.
3. When a past version of you ceases to exist at the point when you TTed, the definition of "you" is based on human reasoning, not physical concepts. I.e. if Bob TTs, it's new-timeline!Bob that will disappear, not old-timeline!Bob's component quarks/atoms/molecules (take your pick). The alternatives within this TT framework are (a) it /is/ the physical components that disappear, with disastrous results, or (b) nothing disappears, leading to permanent duplication.

*** I'm not sure that I see a functional difference between this and the standard paradox-free version, the "rewind mechanic". Essentially whenever you go back in time, all of the stuff in between gets erased and starts re-recording from the spot you emerge, with the change being that you seem to appear out of thin air in the timeline. Whenever you go forward in time the universe just keeps recording without you until it eventually reaches the time that you wanted to show up. It's not really consistent with multiple travelers, but other than that it's pretty much the same as yours.

**** It is very similar. The main difference, which I didn't touch on in my comment due to its complexity, is that all the "affixed" versions of you are true copies (apart from all but one of them being doomed to stop existing).

So if I travel to 1935 and kill Hitler before WW2, my other copies after 1935 will make a completely different set of decisions (all according to my knowledge and preferences at the time in my life they are affixed to).

Similarly, if I travel to 5 minutes before a major mission and give my past self a note saying "no go", they would abort the mission and spend the time doing else (perhaps try a different tack, or just make the most of their limited remaining life).

The idea is to enable some of the plots that canon took part in, like multiple versions of the Doctor cooperating in a new endeavour.

*** Hmmm. This "affixed" mechanic leads to some interesting results.

Let us say that John has a time machine. John wants to go back in time and kill Hitler. But John is aware that there are other time travellers; if he just goes back in time and shoots Hitler /before/ the Holocaust, then some other well-meaning time traveller might turn up with a forcefield to save some poor innocent boy from the time-travelling assassin.

So, instead of personally travelling back and shooting Hitler, he time-sends a bullet to coordinates that overlap with Hitler's heart. So, a bullet appears in Hitler's heart, and he dies.

--------------

Sam is a time traveller. Sam has found out that a time-travelling assassin very successfully killed a young boy by the name of Adolf Hitler. Sam wishes to prevent this.

Sam cannot prevent the original bullet from appearing, because it is affixed. In fact, in this new timeline, Sam cannot even figure out which bullet it is. (There's a man at a shooting range, in the new timeline, who is a little surprised when his bullet vanishes halfway to the target). However, Sam can save the poor little Austrian boy, by preventing him from being present when the bullet appears. He sends back a stone, which appears just under young Hitler's foot,and causes him to stumble and not be present when the bullet appears.

--------------

John wants to go back in time and kill Hitler...

--------------

After several iterations of this, people in 1920s Germany notice bullets and stones appearing, apparently at random. Many of them have badly bruised feet, and those who are unlucky enough to stand where young Adolf stood in another timeline may have fairly grevious internal injuries. The theory that this is a weapon, invented by former Allied sides to punish Germany for their role in WW1, is easily believed by many Germans. Later historians blame the bullets from nowhere as being a major cause for WW2. Future time travellers cannot prevent the bullets from appearing, and cannot understand why anyone would want to deliberately instigate WW2. The more thoughtful ones wonder what could be so bad in the future that triggering WW2 looked like the /preferable/ option.

I go back to twenty seconds after I dropped him off, and pick him up again. I give him the notes to read through, and leave him back in the present (by which I mean, the time he was taken from).

The Daleks, canon's most recognisable antagonist race, were created by/from the Kaleds (not the show's greatest naming effort). My take on it is that this development took the Time Lords by surprise because they acquired a basic time-travel device and used that to iterate on their tech and, later, to create an enormous army. They became a galactic superpower in the span of about 80 external years.

The breeding program is a particularly interesting use of the mechanic. If A and B create C, when C matures you send C back in time and use them to breed. But you /also/ reallocate A and B into different pairs, since they don't actually need to produce C anymore (or otherwise manipulate them to produce D instead of C). So provided your supply of resources is sufficient (including the exorbitant energy cost of non-Tardis time-travel) you can effectively grow several orders of magnitude faster than without this strategy.

** My first pokemon died in a Nuzlocke, during a sky battle against an emolga.

RIP Flip Flapper, lvl5-lvl36.

At least it was only a pidgeotto, and I hate normal types anyways. But on the other hand, I'd probably dumped an hour into EV training it, so I'm not exactly what you'd call happy...

*** My first Nuzlocke death was well into my Sapphire game, when my Claydol got hit by Self-destruct from the Eletrode in Team Aqua's base. I had even bent the encounter rules a little with the Repel trick to make sure I got that Baltoy.

Sometimes it's just harder than others. My Sapphire game went with only two deaths the entire time. I tried Platinum afterwards and got about twenty. Most memorable out of that is my almost team wipe against Candice's Froslass. The key, though, is that when my Gastrodon won when four other of my Pokemon had died, it was such an amazing experience. I never expected a Gastrodon to be the MVP of my game, but that's what the Nuzlocke brings.

Keep at it. Take chances, and see if you'll find your game unfolding into a proper /narrative/. Even among the pain of losing team members along the way, it makes the whole experience worth it.

** While browsing 4chan's "/m/ - Mecha" board, I stumbled across [[http://i.imgur.com/Qht0vjJ.png][this hilarious screenshot]]. You can tell from the format (multiple images per comment) that its original source is 8chan rather than 4chan (I can't tell with certainty the specific board, though "/pol/ - Politically Incorrect" seems likely, given the topic), but someone posted it (maybe by accident) on an entirely-different site and in [[http://archive.is/mKzed#selection-2497.0-2501.20][a thread]] to which it was totally off-topic. Seeing such a diffusion of ideas between vastly-different locations (from Less Wrong [to FanFiction.net?] to 8chan['s /pol/?] to 4chan's /m/) is interesting, I think.

--------------

On the topic of anonymous-imageboard screenshots, I find it somewhat interesting that I'm rather bad at predicting the popularity of 4chan screenshots that I submit to [[/r/4chan][r/4chan]].\\
- I found [[http://i.imgur.com/DsZktli.png][this image]] moderately funny--and [[http://np.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/585f0u][it received 1000 upvotes]], which was a little higher than my expectations but not at all outlandish.\\
- I found [[http://i.imgur.com/Dr1Zvya.png][this image]] barely funny--but [[http://np.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/565123][it somehow received 5000 upvotes]]!\\
- I found [[http://i.imgur.com/8s4lpd0.png][this image]] absolutely hilarious--but [[http://np.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/52tdo2][it received only 100 upvotes]]. Maybe [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/49403][the /A Wrinkle in Time/ series]] and the [[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=CPT][colored-]]/[[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bpt][black-people-time]] joke aren't as well-known as I assume they are. (I read the first four /Time Quintet/ books about a decade ago, and my father--of African descent--has made many black-people-time jokes while running late to family gatherings.)\\
- I found [[http://i.imgur.com/0BV0Hgq.png][this image]] moderately interesting, though only barely funny--and [[http://np.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/54im6v][it received only 20 upvotes]]. I expected that outcome, however, since [[/r/4chan][r/4chan]] is mostly focused on humor, and neither /[[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Mobile_Suit_Zeta_Gundam][Zeta Gundam]]/ nor /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who%27s_on_First%3F][Who's on First?]]/ is particularly popular nowadays.

*** So much of reddit's system is reliant on time posted and whether or not a few early up votes were received--ten upvotes in the first ten minutes do more for its ranking than 50 upvotes in the following 50 minutes. And then once something is high up, the bandwagon effect kicks in. And on top of /that/, redditors follow the 100:10:1 rule, where for every 100 people who view a link, 10 will vote on it and 1 will comment, which can introduce a huge disconnect between popularity and people who enjoyed the content.

And in spite of all this, it's /still/ probably one of the better systems out there, which isn't saying much.

*** With regards to the first screenshot, the answer is "whoever's tribe has more money," so the guy on the left for all four entries.

People like to get all edgy and talk like there's ever been a political or philosophical issue that came down to who could win in a fistfight, but if a libertarian policy backfired and as a result a lowlife gangster could rape an upper class white woman, murder her upper class white husband, steal their house, and get away with it, the society would just become more authoritarian and massacre, torture, and/or imprison all the gangsters, along with anyone who looks like them, plus anyone else the majority thinks ought to die while they have the guillotine out. Violence only works in the long run if the people-like-you can build more tanks and neutron bombs than the people-like-your-victim. That's why liberal/democratic societies always win in the end; if you optimize for being a strong thug, I just optimize for having a million tanks and crush you.
