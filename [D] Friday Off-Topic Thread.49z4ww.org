Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** Does anybody here get annoyed by scenes in a fiction where the smart guy or computer says there is a 1 in a million chance of winning the day and that they should do the [some unpalatable alternative action]....and the the heroes risk it all anyway to win anyway?

mini-rant/

I mean it's one thing to try anyway, because if they don't then world will end, but if the alternative is to concede to the villain, then they can allow others to eventually try forming a resistance movement or something similar later. Risking even worse consequences to win instead of properly conceding to fight another day *isn't* heroism.

It was a brilliant, climatic idea for a trope when the first writer used it, but not when it's so commonly used nowadays that I consider it lazy writing if someone tries writing in some low odds to "stop" the hero from trying. It's one thing if the hero is trying to win against improbable odds, but it's another thing to actually state it directly to show off the hero's resolve, when we can already see it for ourselves.

*** I'd argue that risking worse consequences to win instead of conceding the fight is almost the definition of heroism. Then I'd argue that the world has got too many heroes and [[http://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/poems_martha.htm][not enough engineers.]]

Heroes are reactive, they respond to crisis by rising to the call. Almost everybody will do this, especially when they're part of a group or are given direction by an authority... but they don't like to make hard choices: Save everyone, leave none behind, sacrifice yourself first.

Engineers are proactive, they analyze the situation and propose long-term solutions to potential problems at great expense, and no matter how many problems never materialize because of their efforts they still get blamed when the one they didn't foresee pops up.

We reward heroes, as a society and as a species, because their heroic actions are right out in the open. Something terrible was happening right then and there and somebody walked in and dealt with it.

We do reward engineers, but as a business or as a civilization. Society and species don't need that sort of foresight as often. What they see is the extra costs (in time, money, labor, or comfort) that they have to bear to build the engineers' reinforcements, and those rare mad disasters that slip through nonetheless.

Heroes look good in the super-charged moment, engineers only look good in aggregate and in the long view.

Now there are people who run into a burning building and die for no reason. We don't tell stories about them. There are leaders who end up losing more lives because they were unwilling to surrender a few. We don't celebrate them. That dark side of the heroic enterprise is depressing and makes for lousy legends and crappy movies.

To be fair, it's not that I see heroes as a bad thing, but I just think too many writers see them as reckless characters who always choose the 'right' thing to do even when the right thing is only chosen due to story logic instead of rational/sane reasons.

I have a long, /long/ rant about how the true meaning of heroism is to be a symbol to do better for a people and that to be a hero is to push past fear, always strive to become a better person, and to accept one's failures when it happens.

When you say "I think there's a 50% chance of this event", you're not necessarily saying "I think this event happens in 50% of the branches". Not unless you're in a Shroedinger's Cat scenario where you know all the facts except the outcome of some future quantum events.

You could instead be saying something like "in 99% of the branches, the event happens. Or in 99% of the branches, the event does not happen. It depends on some piece of information I don't have, which (recursively based on other information I have - and, in the end, priors) has a 50% chance of going one way." The 50% is still in the map, not in the territory.

If you're interested in practicing rationality, one fun way to do so is in a competitive game environment. I do this by playing Forum Mafia on Teamliquid.net [[http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/mafia/][here]]. We have a game open for a mixture of new players and experienced players so that new people can get involved [[http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/mafia/505275-newbie-student-mafia-xx][here]].

I consider it one of the most intellectually stimulating things I do. It's exciting, requires thinking in lots of ways. You will think in terms of puzzling out possibilities for the game state, making decisions to determine if people are lying or telling the truth, and trying to be convincing and displaying your own logic to others. People talk about evidence, heuristics, and even things that turn out to actually be Bayesian analysis ("Although you'd expect people who do X to be mafia, there are 3x as many good players as mafia players, so...").

It's a lot of fun! [[http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/mafia/][Come check us out.]]

Ask me any questions you have. I'm Blazinghand on Teamliquid. This community ([[/r/rational][r/rational]]) is one of the most thoughtful communities I know. I think you would have a lot of fun playing TL Mafia, and I'm always eager to welcome new intelligent players into our group. Right now there are probably 20 or 30 people who play fairly regularly, and another 30 or 40 who play rarely.

**** What is Mafia?
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: what-is-mafia
     :END:
To put very simply, Mafia is a game of lying. There is a group of people, some of them are lying and some are telling the truth. Your job is to figure out who is lying, or if you are lying to convince the rest of the group that you are telling the truth.

To elaborate, the game is divided into two teams: the town and mafia. Mafia know who each other are and can coordinate their actions privately. Townies on the other hand don't know anything other than their own role. To compensate, there are many more townies than mafia; usually the ratio is 1 mafia for every 4 townies. In other words, Mafia is a game of an informed minority against an uninformed majority. Can the mafia use its superior organization and knowledge to lead the town astray? Or can the town figure out the mafia and kill them before their numbers advantage runs out?

At the beginning of the game you are PM'ed your role. The game is divided into two repeating phases: day and night. Days last 48 hours and revolve around deciding a lynch target by means of voting. Every player in the game gets one vote, and each player must argue and convince the others to lynch their target. At the end of the day the person with the most votes is lynched; their alignment and role are revealed and they are removed from the game. The majority of the action in the game takes place during the day phase.

Night is 24 hours long and is reserved for private actions. Any player in the game that has an ability (such as mafia kills, detective checks, medic protections, etc.) can use their power in this phase. Usually during the night everyone discusses the results of the lynch and makes plans for the next day. It serves as downtime from the emotionally charged days. After the night ends, a day post comes up with the results of who dies. After the day post, the discussion for lynch begins anew.

Once there is a winner, everyone will typically weigh in on the game with their thought process and advice. Many times the hosts or observers will contribute their thoughts as well.

**** Why play Mafia? What is required to play?
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: why-play-mafia-what-is-required-to-play
     :END:
Mafia is a game of *logic*, *intuition*, *persuasiveness*, *reading ability*, *emotion*, and *will*. In short, *it's a thinker's game*. There are many different ways to approach the game and every game is a very different experience. Whether you are looking to test and improve your intelligence or have a unique, fun experience, Mafia is the right game for you.

Be warned: Mafia requires a time commitment. This generally depends on the player, but at minimum 1 to 2 hours a day of solid effort is required. Some players spend as much as 8 or 10 hours a day playing Mafia. More time spent gives you a better chance at making the right decisions, but you can do a very acceptable job with just 1 to 2 hours a day. Mafia games typically last between 1 and 2 weeks, but usually you will die at some point before it ends.

As part of the time commitment, mafia requires a great deal of reading. Most people actually are very poor at reading comprehension and playing Mafia is a great way at improving your reading ability. As you also must be posting each cycle, Mafia is a good way to improve your writing and ability to think and argue logically.

In addition, mafia is not for the faint-hearted or overly emotional. While not occurring every game, sometimes people can get into very heated arguments with one another. People can get very emotional playing Mafia, as it is a high-intensity endeavour. That being said, playing Mafia is an excellent way for developing thick skin, improving your patience, and making yourself a stronger person mentally. In addition, there's an unspoken rule that arguments are kept in the game. After the game is over and everyone cools down, there is rarely any bad blood. Some people may be harsher than others, but almost everyone is here to help each other learn and improve.

**** Why forum Mafia? Why play on TL?
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: why-forum-mafia-why-play-on-tl
     :END:
Many people have played mafia in real life and wonder how you can play it online. After all, real life games are in a much shorter period, with no accurate information logging, and let you interact in a more informative medium than text. To put it simply, yes you can play mafia online without any problems. No, it is not quite the same and you will need to adjust your approach and play slightly.

In forum mafia, you have the ability to view logs over a period of days instead of relying on memory during a chaotic 20 minutes. You find mafia by analyzing motives, objectives for posting, and closely scrutinizing what people write. Naturally arguments are more sterile as it is based solely on cold text.

Think of the difference between forum and real life mafia as this: for the former, imagine a detective hard at work, pouring over reports, speeches, and witnesses trying to solve a murder; in the latter case, a detective grills someone in an interrogation room and tries to outwit or break them. Both have their perks and while the overall goal is the same, both require different skill sets to master.

As a magnified version of TL, this is a tight-knit community. Many players are long-time members, and you'll frequently be playing games with the same people. Like a real mafia, we watch out for our own.

     :PROPERTIES:

     :END:
If you want to join a game, just wait until the next game is unveiled and type /in. Usually if you check the forum once every other day or so you won't miss out on anything coming up. You can check the active mafia games list at at the top of the forum to see what games are coming up soon. Be warned: some games, especially by certain hosts, are very popular and tend to fill up fast.

The amount of games going on depends on activity, but the goal is to have between two or three games simultaneously happening. Do your part and help make this happen!

There are three different types of games: normal, themed, and mini. Normal games are the mainstay of the forum. They typically have 20 to 30 players, and the rule sets only differ slightly between games. If you sign up for a normal game, you know what you're getting into. Setups will almost always have a good degree of balance and you can expect to have a fair shot at winning no matter which side you are on. Normal games are where the highest level of play and activity is. If you want competition, this is where it's at.

Themed games encompass a wide variety of types. Usually they have unique roles, flavor, and game mechanics. Many hosts like to try their pet setups or whatever kooky idea they came up with. As such, theme games tend to hit or miss. There have been some very good ones, and some complete busts. Since the setups can be strange, there are usually opportunities to win by thinking outside the box and developing unique strategies.

Mini games are special 9 to 15 player setups which may be normal or themed. Since there are a smaller number of players, there is generally less to read and fewer players you will have to analyze. However this means that there is more pressure on you to fulfill your role, as one person represents a higher percentage of the total players than in a normal game.

Over the course of 48 hours, people (town, and mafia pretending to be town) discuss and cast votes to kill someone as an election in the name of the town. Then, during 24 hours, the mafia meet in secret and kill one member of the town. This cycle repeats a few times, 2 people dying each cycle. A game can be over quickly, or it can take as many as 5 cycles (to kill 10 people in a 13-player game and send it to the final round), which is 15 days, or just over 2 weeks.

** I've started reading the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Stross#The_Laundry_Files][Laundry Files]] (have gotten to book 3) and it's really quite good.

It's an lovecraftian urban fantasy / cold war spy thriller style series. The main character is basically a computer geek / hacker-ish type working for a occult British spy agency as a tech-support / IT maintenance kind of guy who applied for active duty right before start of the first book. It's worth noting that doing computer maintenance is a bit more dangerous in this world than in ours, the deamon messing things up might be a literal supernatural one who'll hack its way into you brain via your optic nerve if you look at the wrong thing on the screen, computational demonology is a thing. The writing style reminds the somewhat of the Dresden Files, easy read, somewhat sarcastic main character, can get really quite dark at times, biggest difference is that the main character is not a badass wizard (or badass of any kind really, well most of the time).

From an [[/r/rational]] point of view I'd say that the magic system probably could've been defined better (compared to the Dresden Files at least), it's mainly based on the idea that there is a "leaky" multiverse (many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics and eternal inflation type stuff) and that it is possible to exchange information (and even open portals) by pointing the right mathematical computations at them. Later books expanded upon this a little bit (at least so far) but I still don't quite know what the limits are. Having said that most of the protagonists and antagonists are quite rational when it comes to exploiting magic for their own benefit. And so far I haven't spotted any real idiot balls.

Rational fiction presents solveable, clockwork worlds. The game is fair, and all the pieces are out in the open. Turns out the mechanisms of our real world are unfair, largely invisible, and every solution has its own set of complications.

Hope is a powerful thing, but it wasn't kept in Pandora's Box as a mercy. It belongs in there with all the other memetic monsters. Turns out ideas are cheap. The hard part isn't in imagining what needs to be done, it's in actually doing it.

Lying to yourself for hopeful reasons is the single best ways to do the impossible. Our susceptibility to hope is a feature, not a bug, and losing that susceptibility harms your chances of success in almost every arena in life.

** I'm slowly learning to code. Very slowly, since I'm only spending an hour or two per day on it. At the moment, almost half of what I learn is coming from breaking things I didn't mean to and then figuring out what went wrong.

Also, it turns out scripts don't care about common sense. I know this is coding 101, but it's one thing to hear other people talk about it and quite another to have your browser crash because your random choice picker keeps looping and looking for something that doesn't exist.

*** If by "In Media" you include books that have been published, google says there have been 129 million books published in the traditional manner. In a typical book, you can expect there to be at least 10 characters (but sometimes many more). Assuming 100M of the 129M books are fictional, a reasonable lower bound is 1 Billion fictional characters. There are plenty of other sources for fictional characters, like movies, periodicals, unpublished books, fanfiction, and people just posting stories online or published for free on kindle.

** I've been reading a lot of xianxia (Sort of like Chinese high-fantasy) recently. It scratches a few itches that I wasn't really getting anywhere else, and I think more people should read the genre just to see if it's their thing. So here's some recommendations.

[[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/cdindex-html/][Coiling Dragon]] - One of the most popular xianxia stories. It's about Linley Baruch, a child from a once-great clan, and his struggle to become strong enough to restore the clan and protect those he cares about. The translation is complete.

[[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/st-index/][Stellar Transformations]] - By the same author as Coiling Dragon, this one is set in a world more similar to our own when compared to Coiling Dragon. Noteably, Stellar Transformations has stars, planets and an entire cosmos for Qin Yu to roam about in. Qin Yu starts as a boy who's body's condition prevents him from training in the way everyone else does, leaving only the most difficult and painful way that no-one has ever truly succeeded in. After finishing the books on wuxiaworld, you have to go to translation nations to find the rest.

[[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/][I Shall Seal the Heavens]] - My favourite novel currently being translated. A deep world with many factions and ways of life to explore, and many mysteries to be uncovered. The story follows Meng Hao, a failed scholar who is abducted into the Reliance Sect, as he journeys throughout the nine mountains and seas(the universe in the buddhist faith) to uncover mysteries, amass strength, and build a great fortune.

[[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/atg-index/][Against The Gods]] - The One Punch Man of xianxia, it takes common tropes and pushes them as far as they can go. And does it better than most. Yun Che, a man hated across his home continent, is reborn into the body of a crippled child with the same name as him. He uses his past life's memories, and more than a little luck, to forge a path to become as strong as he can be, and to build a harem.

*** I /want/ to get into reading translated light novels and wuxia, but as I've ranted about before, I hate how stilted the writing becomes due to the translations. Weird grammar choices being repeated, uncommon words that always seem a bit out of place, and naming conventions that always seem a little ridiculous. And that's on top of the fact that most of these stories have webnovel origins, which leads to the same problems fanfics have, and I'm pretty intolerant of harems overall (there are a few notable exceptions, but not many).

I'll be trying out coiling dragon, though. Hopefully it's greater relative fame leads to a higher quality translation.

** I have too many ideas for (original) serial rational web fiction, and I'm not sure which to work on, since I keep editing and re-editing and am never satisfied on the final product.

Current ideas:

*[[http://eniteris.com/tempiii][Future Horismos]]*

Two chapters completed, although haven't touched it in a while. Stylized like Sam Hughes, the plot is to span multiple levels of reality, starting with the discovery of teleportation.

*Two Points of Contact*

A first/second contact novel, borrowing from Peter Watts. The main character is a ship forced into a human-normal body after returning from a first contact mission where the alien probe was destroyed, the rest of the crew killed, and the ship returning after wiping its own memory. Another crew is assembled, and sent to intercept a second alien ship, following on the tail of the first.

Would probably explore what occurs during both the first and second contacts. Crew consists of human personalities implanted into various bodily (or non-bodily) forms, sometimes with multiple personalities.

*Intergalactic*

A hard-sf intergalactic odyssey. Starts a little after halfway through the journey, with civilization having developed over a million years under a starless sky, having forgotten why their ancestors launched them into space.

Not sure if it's going to be an O'Neill Cylinder or an entire star system. Also, if anyone can tell me if the flux of the cosmic background radiation can substitute for sunlight at near-lightspeed, that would be appreciated.

*[[http://eniteris.com/gsb][Gratuitous Space Battles]]*

Attempting to explain how, in any rational universe, space battles will ever occur with small fighters. Hard science fiction space battles and ship designs, under the assumption that battles will ever occur in space.

Any thoughts? Any recommendations on which idea to develop more?

*** Future Horismos: I like what you've got so far, feels like reading Fine Structure all over again. If anything, it hews a bit too close to Fine Structure specifically - good artists copy, great artists steal.

Two Points of Contact: If I wanted to re-read Blindsight, I'd re-read Blindsight. Again, acknowledge your inspirations but don't forget to take the story in your own direction. Secondly, amnesia as a plot device is overused, self-induced amnesia especially. Other than that, it's a promising outline.

Intergalactic: While I think [[/u/Transfuturist]]'s comment below is a bit harsh, I agree with the main thrust of it. Intergalactic travel is ridiculously difficult. I also have my doubts that you can make the halfway point of a megayear journey in any way meaningful to your characters. But! I'd love to hear more about the sort of technological society that can survive for ten million years (look at all the crises we've faced in the last century and then multiply those by a hundred thousand) and still accomplish their mission when they arrive.

Gratuituous Space Battles: This is the only one that I don't like. It's not a story, it's brainstorming for a story. "What will 22nd-century space battles actually look like" is a question for NASA engineers and the military, not science-fiction writers. And it's one thing to start from "my protagonist is going to be an ace pilot, so I need a world where ace pilots can exist" when you have a specific story in mind, but if you just want cool spaceships for the sake of cool spaceships... well, by all means write it if that sounds fun to you, but I have no interest in reading it.

In short, they're all good inspirations for stories. But to misquote someone-or-other, writing is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. The ideas aren't worth anything until you build them into a story. So if you want my recommendation, I'd say to keep writing Future Horismos, because it's the one you've already started and you'll get nowhere if you keep throwing out your unfinished work.

**** Two Points of Contact: The aliens encountered were meant to be memetic in nature, requiring a memory wipe to prevent them from being spread. But yeah, I think the concept boils down to "I want to re-read Blindsight". I should do that next week.

Intergalactic: After a million years, I think evolution would begin to take its toll on the body, with its cycles of technology and barbarism. The halfway point would be the beginning of deceleration; the plot was to be the rediscovery of purpose (which has been forgotten over the past million of years or so), and the awakening of mostly broken/destroyed constructs who try to prepare the civilization(s) for the changes to come.

I'll keep working on Future Horismos. Current plot line is quite the Sam Hughes-smorgasbord: a version of Oul appears, a version of Tanako's World as well. I also tried to make the Anomalies antimemetic as well, but I can't actually think of any ways antimemes would work except by magic.

(on a related note, memetics is really the only think I find scary nowadays. Only when something can invade your mind and change your behaviour without you realizing it does it seems scary)

Near-lightspeed will [[http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperInformation.aspx?paperID=23913][kill everyone with X-rays and sparse hydrogen gas,]] so no, the blueshifted CMB cannot be used as sunlight, even if it /were/ energetic enough. Everyone will be behind a ton of shielding. Have you actually calculated any of this, the distance, times, and energies required? The sheer difference in mass and volume between an O'Neill Cylinder and /a solar system?/ The actual energy budget of the thing, and how you're getting this energy? What reasons do you have for making it a generation ship instead of preserving energy with cryonics or genetic storage or /anything else/ and making the whole thing /as small as possible,/ other than as a hook for the same old politics and ontological mystery? /What reasons do you even have for traveling intergalactically?/

The only feasible way you can sustain an entire civilization intergalactically is with a star, and using a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_engine][Shkadov thruster]] on our sun for one million years yields a delta-V of /twenty meters per second./

You either need to work on your science and setting, or give up on hard-SF for intergalactic travel.

**** I just /really/ like the idea of intergalactic space as a setting. The only reason to travel intergalactically is to avoid a galactic catastrophe, of which I can think of none except for a vacuum metastability event.

Intergalactic space is orders of magnitude less dense than interstellar space (the average density of the universe is 1 proton per 4 cubic metres). But I'll read the paper in more depth to see if I can calculate how dangerous those stray protons would be. Of course, exiting and entering galaxies would be problematic, but (if it's a entire system) they have entire planets worth of shielding, as long as they can point it in the right direction.

I was considering a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_starship][Black Hole Starship]] at the centre of the system, where the planets used the blueshifted CBR as their "sun". Alternatively, the system could have been ejected during a galactic collision event, which is possible but unlikely (fastest moving star is 0.1c).

The ship (or system, as it's seems to have shifted to) would have genetic storage, but even I'm not convinced that a small Von Neumann machine filled with genetic information and social norms could survive the millions to billions of years in intergalactic space. Whereas "life (er) finds a way" because it has the resources to self-replicate and evolve during the journey.

If you sent a ball of Von Neumann machines they might make it.

Precognitive psychic powers that are common enough and operate with a precision and timescale that makes it favorable to put psychic pilots into your star-fighters. Note that psychics need to be common enough/easy enough to train to make this economical, and their powers can't see too far into the future, otherwise you could have them pilot remotely and compensate for lag with their precognition, yet the powers need to be general enough and accurate enough that the drone AIs still don't have an advantage due to speed and mathematical processing ability.

If they aren't actually fighters, but some other craft being improvised as fighters for a single scene... The enemy has a limited number of nukes, by launching all your atmospheric shuttles they can't eliminate all of them, using the shuttles as suicidal kinetic kill vehicles or having them release payload as KKV or otherwise improvising an attack.

Weird cultural imperatives. Maybe a treaty bans automated and weaponized ships over a certain size? So to get around it, each side build a bunch of really small piloted fighters.

Worse, the outcomes of arranged marriages for genetic fitness aren't always too wonderful. And breeding more involves serious risks to the power structure.

I think what I'd really like is a pure breeding game, probably with animals instead of humans to avoid any potential political issues. But every time I've seen it done, it's really shallow; there's barely even a Punnett square, let alone epigenetics, co-dominance, etc.
