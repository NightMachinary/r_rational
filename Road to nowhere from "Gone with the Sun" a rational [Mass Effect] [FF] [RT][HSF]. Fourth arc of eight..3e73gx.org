** Mass Effect 3 came out some time back, following which I wrote a 'rationalist' novel exploring the aftermath, later removed (title conflict). It explored consequences of ME3's 'red flash' from the point of view of certain characters. As it happens, the closing lines of the last arc had survivors heading for Andromeda.

Following the recent E3 2015 trailer, "Mass Effect: Andromeda" was issued, showing an N7 in Andromeda, which has prompted re-posting of this story under a new title.

"Road to nowhere" is Arc 4 of that story, dealing with development of teams and systems.
