** Maybe I'm reading this wrong, but I'm finding it pretty hard to follow at points if I just read the threadmarked posts. Things like not showing the votes in the post and having posts that jump around (eg. [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/page-156#post-5250204]]) make this hard to follow if as a non-participant. I'd reference anonkun as a site that has a better experience for catching up to a story - though it has a much worse discussion.

*** Thanks for the info. We did actually try Anonkun briefly, but it didn't have the features we needed and there were problems with the discussion format.
