What are your favorite Time Loop stories? It is one of my favorite plot devices, both in original fiction and in fanfiction. The potential for munchkinry and optimization is big. There are many that I have enjoyed, such as Mother of Learning or Edge of Tomorrow, but my favorite remains Groundhog Day. Bill Murray really nails it, and the story is excellent. It's a fun movie and probably one of the best explorations of the idea in popular media. Let's not just restrict ourselves to what's popular though. Hit me with your favs, across media and popularity! Extra points for works in which the main character really explores what can be done with the loop, in a way fitting of [[/r/rational][r/rational]].

** There's a couple relatively obscure ones that I wouldn't call /great/ but are probably good enough to be a fix for fellow time-loop addicts.

Right Moments is a Ranma 1/2 time loop fic where Ranma gets cursed to repeat the day until he's perfectly satisfied with how it went. Ranma being who he is, that means he'll only be satisfied if he can accomplish a bunch of tasks with really high bars like fairly defeat the grandmaster of his fighting style (who is monstrously powerful) and resolve his series-long romantic crisis. It does a good job exploring the premise in sufficient depth to satisfy my time loop urges, though I'm not a skilled enough reader to judge how good it is apart from that, other than that it didn't repulse me or blow me out of the water.

Getting the Hang of Thursdays is a Harry Potter time loop fic where Hermione's Time Turner breaks and casts Hogwarts into a day-long time loop. It's probably not that unknown, but I bet there's still a bunch of people here who haven't heard of it. Snape is the main character and looper, and the story as a whole trends more to feelings of claustrophobia and low-grade cosmic horror than power fantasy. It's got some... less than comfortable events in it, but as a time loop story I think it does its premise justice.

On the more open-ended community side of things there's The Infinite Loops, a collaborative project spanning a lot of fictional universes to create an opening for authors to write small snippets in a flexible time loop universe. Basically, the world tree computer thing running the multiverse (From Ah My Goddess) takes a ton of damage from an unknown attack, and in a desperate attempt to stabilize things the admins start setting universes to loop, with an Anchor who remembers each loop and other characters close to the anchor looping occasionally. The universes will have to loop for billions of years or some other 'large enough' timeframe, so with loopers sometimes showing up in other universes or other variants on their universe authors have a lot of flexibility to write whatever catches their fancy. There's threads and compilations out there if you look.

*** Slight spoiler, but if you're interested in Getting the Hang of Thursdays, be warned, it turns into a really creepy HermioneXSnape fic. The spoiler here is indeed a spoiler, but if you'd want to know about something /now/ that might ruin your enjoyment of a fic when you learn about it once you're already invested, then it may be worth revealing. Discussion follows, spoilered. If it weren't for that there's a lot I really like about it; it's not your typical time loop fic where the protagonist uses the time loop to become obscenely strong; the fic focuses much more on the hopelessness of the situation, along with some moderate existential horror towards the end. But the creepy romance ruins it for me, and if I had known about that I probably wouldn't have started it (that said, I did finish it, because I was too invested by that point and the writing is pretty good).

*** Hard Reset is phenomenal. What makes it special is how the time loop itself is only the first third or so of the story, but the lingering psychological effects are explored in a way I haven't seen in other time loop fiction. Plus, there are two complete sequels which aren't time loops, but involve time travel.

Hard Reset 2 is a fork by a different author, and it's fun rationality-porn, but sadly incomplete.

The preamble in which the author happily admits that his story is 3.5 million words and it takes almost 60k for something plot-relevant to actually happen, alongside a dozen "unique" grammar conventions is extremely scary.

**** As someone who made it through all 3.5 million words, there is a decent story in there, but it is in serious need of editing. The crazy girlfriend is extremely cringe inducing for the first 3rd at least. And the middle section moves incredibly slowly until the author suddenly decides to end it and accelerates the plot 1000%. Ultimately I'd say I enjoyed it, but it took me 3 attempts to get into it and I had to brute force my way through several sections. If the concept doesn't super intrigue you and you aren't desperate for something to read, it's probably not worth the effort.

** I'm not sure whether you'd count it as a /loop/, exactly, but The Many Deaths of Harry Potter has him resetting to an earlier point each time he dies. Which is often, because apart from his reset ability, he doesn't wear any plot armour. Run down the wrong street when being chased by Dudley? Death Eaters take him to Quirrelmort and he gets stabbed. Walk down the Hogwarts Express alone? He gets shoved onto the track and crushed. Fight the troll on Halloween? This one's easy to guess.

And the reset point keeps jumping forward, without him having any control over it nor identifying a pattern except that there's a good chance that it will be too late to prevent tragedies other than his own death.

All in all, I found it quite a good take on, "what would it really be like to be the Chosen One?" (hint: there is a substantial bounty on his head)

**** I had to agree on Purple Days. Really didn't enjoy it and gave up.

I think part of the problem is that it started in medias res. We are introduced to a Joffrey who's already nice. He likes everyone the audience likes, hates (almost) everyone the audience wants him him to hate. I think that was a massive mistake for a Time Loop story. Time loops are about the development of a character - skills, yes, but more importantly emotion. By jumping straight into the end point, it skipped the point of the timeloop.

And yes, it then jumped back and started showing stuff in order but by them it was too late for me.

This ties into the "likes everyone the audience likes" bit I mentioned. It just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Maybe if we saw him get there step by step, it would be different, but by opening with that end state it lost me. It just tasted too damn saccharine.

***** Starting in medias res is fine. Giving the reader a preview of what is to come is important in fanfiction especially, since the audience doesn't have a lot of patience. You can see it as a pilot episode if you like. I'm even fine with the blatant wish fulfilment and power fantasies. It's not like I'm trying to be a snob.

But you're right that the story affirms everything the author believes, and that is just bad writing. There's a whole segment where he riffs on Catelyn Stark and then all the characters go "hahaha that is so true she does suck". Ugh. It's not just annoying, it means that his characters don't have any life or experiences of their own.

But what gets me the most is that he obviously hasn't read his own writing even once. One read-through is all it would take to fix 95% of the spelling and grammar errors, and he can't even be bothered to do that. That kind of disrespect towards one's own story... I cannot comprehend it.

**** Hmm, I like Purple Days a lot. You don't like the pacing?

(Many have said that some arcs have been a bit long, especially the Yi-Ti one.)

There's also the problem of the decision leading to the final arc being a bit stupid, with Jofrey taking a big risk on something rather than come back in another loop

**** If you skip over Joffery's speeches and read it with the effects his meddling has on the wider world in mind I think it's pretty good. And in truth, Purple Days nails the painful and hypocritical process of becoming a better person in a way that few things I've ever read could. You don't go from a gleeful torturer to the promised savior without a /lot/ of back and forth in between.

Personally, I found the final message of the Deep Ones deeply moving on an existential level.

*** The -expression- of the main character in the second movie, during the first loop of the movie, was pretty much my highlight from the film.

Imagine going through the movie Groundhog Day, becoming a better person, making friends with everyone you met in the loop, escaping the time loop, having several weeks or months of life, and then suddenly ENDING UP BACK AT THE START OF THE LOOP AGAIN. She's -pissed- at everyone and everything and all that character growth? Not on display that particular loop.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/18087/the-best-night-ever][The Best Night Ever by Capn_Chryssalid]] is really good. The standout element is the emotional and narrative arc. Through the intersession of a time loop Prince Blueblood, a snobbish manchild in the series, must grow up and become a man (well stallion ;). Very well written and in the style of the original Groundhog Day in that the primary journey is emotional rather than grinding skills.

**** Don't get me started on that series.

First there's the totally unheroic protagonist, with a sense of empathy so local that it borders on object impermanence; committing shocking acts and not suffering any lasting guilt or consequences, let alone making any attempt to atone or make amends.

Then there's the twist, with no (or all the wrong kind of) foreshadowing, that the whole first story was actually an elaborately framed coming-out story; and an almost comically generic one, seemingly imported wholesale from the real world without regard for pony society.

Then there's the entire first two thirds of the trilogy being part of a predestination loop, which the characters deliberately adhere to; and the rest of the story revolving around the predestined events' consequences. Related to that is the incoherent metaphysics; seeming to employ the /X-Files/ technique of "if you repeat something enough, people will believe it makes sense". How did Celly know that her particular timeline was the one that Star Swirl would be summoned to? What does it mean to "tie off" timelines? Why do the Regalia split timelines? What did/do the apparent ultimate antagonists, the forces of Time and Destiny, actually want? Did they achieve it, and if not, why not?

Then there's the dropped plot threads. What happens to the untransformed changelings? Why couldn't Star Swirl perfect the loop spell? What are the secrets Luna won't tell? Who altered Star Swirl's letter, how, and why?

For a huge plot hole (or plot-induced stupidity), why didn't the trapped Twilight just follow the "Perfect Run" and /not/ use the Regalia? And later on, if she was always planning to betray her other self, why did the spell she gave her ultimately work perfectly?

At the end, why (besides more object impermanence) doesn't Star Swirl jump further into the future, in order to be with both of his wives? What will happen to Shooting Star's timeline, especially given the previously stated consequences of altering established history?

Glad other people enjoyed it, at least. It was certainly a page-turner in parts.

Also, "the changelings win and kill everyone in Canterlot" is false or misleading in a number of ways.

*** It's an acknowledged fandom classic, but it blurs the line between "in the style of" and a straight port of the movie into Equestria. Some lines and scenes are copied verbatim.

Personally, I made the mistake of leaving a long gap between reading chapters 4 and 5, which may have contributed to not finding the ending as satisfying as others did. I didn't feel like I had a clear sense of why, exactly, the loop ended when it did and not after the first "perfect" run.

Also, it was sad how even at the end he wasn't willing to tell Rares the truth. I assume that that happens in the sequel.

I don't know if it properly qualifies as a time loop, though it has many of its characteristic, but the Doctor Who episode [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_Sent_%28Doctor_Who%29][Heaven Sent]] is great, achieving the impressive feat of giving you temporal vertigo with a story that literally spans billions of years, something rather unusual in mainstream fiction.
