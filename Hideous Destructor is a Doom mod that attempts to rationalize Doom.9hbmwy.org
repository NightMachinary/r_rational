*** What about the bullets that are affected by gravity, recoil that makes the gun jump up a bit, and magazines for reloading that aren't some magical pool of ammo that goes into your gun when your reload?

**** That is a deconstruction of the standard assumptions of the shooters genre, yes.

I didn't get the impression that the story itself, with demon invasion on Mars, was altered

****** I don't know, adding them to Doom might be. Seems to me to depend on just how rigorous a definition we are using. Google's first hit tells me deconstruction is:

/"a method of critical analysis of philosophical and literary language that emphasizes the internal workings of language and conceptual systems, the relational quality of meaning, and the assumptions implicit in forms of expression. "/

I assume doom won't have those mechanics, but I am not sure that quite qualifies as an assumption implicit in the form of expression. Might depend on if Doom is the form of expression or shooters are.

****** They're standard game elements because they're added to make the game more realistic. The fact that they're standard in some other games is incidental.
