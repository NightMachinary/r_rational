Both of these receive a fairly large amount of praise from people who love the same fics I do, and I just don't find them rational, nor compelling. Has anyone else read the first 40 or so updates of either of these and been left with a bitter taste? Why?

Alternately, what do you like about them? They're better than a lot of books in the shop, but to me don't seem to compare to the truly exceptional fics out there.

EDIT: I created this mainly in the hope that I'd encounter some analyses that would change my mind, not because I want to dislike these, or have great faith in my sometimes poorly worded objections. If I could dig these that would be a ton of writing to enjoy.


** Worm isn't really intended to be rational. The characters/protagonist are smart about some things, like power use and immediate problem solving, but not about other things like morality or introspection. Taylor is a very flawed person, and that's very much intended. I don't think anyone on this sub looks at her ruminations on the morality of what she's doing and goes "Yes, that's smart, that's the type of thinking everyone should have". It's a popular book on this sub because the world has fairly consistent rules, because it deconstructs or examines aspects of superhero fiction in a way that little else does, and because people win by thinking through things instead of via Deus ex Machina or because their powers are naturally stronger than others'.

Characters applying values differently to other people than to themselves is a recurring theme, and it's pretty realistic in that way. From a rationalist perspective, it's more of an examination of the biases people have and why they have them than how people can reject and overcome those biases.

*** Worm's definitely in the category of novels that become a vastly more enjoyable once you realize the author is in on it.

A lot of Taylor's scenes take on deeper nuance and meaning once you realize that she is not always right or even rational, and that this is a deliberate choice made by the author.

I don't particularly think it matters whether Worm is "rational fiction" or not, because it is amazing and thematically rich fiction that explores humanity in ways that a lot of my favorite rational authors would not be able to.

Edit: [[/u/slinkinator]] if you're still having trouble, consider the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/5yfs9d/weve_got_worm_podcast_episode_1_arc_1_gestation/?st=ja74s1v5&sh=73ec3102][We've Got Worm]] podcast, it does a /great/ job of recontextualizing a lot of interactions in the story and explaining in a really direct what this says about the characters, themes, etc of the work. Worm is an incredibly rich narrative work that goes out of its way to not present itself as such, and I think reading it only on the surface level is missing out.

*** /indicates the sidebar

There is a difference between rational fiction and rationalist fiction. Worm is, I think, considered to be something like the former, but nothing like the latter.

Specifically, Worm is very satisfying to people who like their stories to be... "closed-world automatons"? It's the quality that Tragedies have, and good Mysteries have: that the characters and the setting are /consistent/ in ways that let you predict a lot of what is going to happen. The characters might be irrational, but they're irrational in precise, predictable ways that let you ask yourself "what conclusion would a perfectly rational agent---but for [this known set of flaws]---draw in this situation" and end up coming up with the right answer as to what's going to happen.

** I don't like A Practical Guide to Evil.

I like Worm's emphasis on... I'm not sure how to put it. Logistics? Mechanics? Worm talks about heroism in a practical way. A lot of thought goes into equipment, power utilization, power function, etc. It's not a how-to book, but it's closer to a how-to book than the average novel about people with powers. People use powers for mundane utility, or in conjunction with ordinary tools, or for creative applications, in a way that feels very real.

There's also a feeling of empowerment with reading Worm, because of this mechanical focus. Almost every problem can be solved, with enough advance preparation and cleverness and willingness to run away, and when problems are solved it does not feel artificial because the details are done so well. Threats escalate over time to force character growth in capabilities, but the difficulty of pulling off solutions always increases relative to the level of escalation.

*** Yup. Worm feels less like standard superhero fiction and more like Reality Ensues - people who practise things get better at them, hard work pays off, sometimes luck goes the wrong way, and there's less of a mindset - at least with Taylor - that powers are something which must only be used when in costume, or that fights must adhere to Queensbury Rules, or that people are either super-boy-scout Heroes or cackling mustache-twiddling Villains, and never the twain shall meet. It feels a bit more like the Whateley Academy universe, where smart minor supervillains work under the radar, there /are/ supers who have been both villain and hero at times, and one of the central original story concepts is that heroes can and do often have deep secrets.

Worm's capes are flawed. They're /people/ - they have their own individual mindsets and ways of going about things, and sometimes those blur or straddle the lines between Hero and Villain. Particularly when there are Endbringer fights, which force everyone with powers to work (and often die) together. That tends to break down the artificial "us vs them" barriers, and introduce more of a "human vs Unknowable God-Thing" distinction which is always lurking the background, corroding the standard tropes.

**** Unfortunately, Worm didn't have this feel for me. Just for instance, there is actually a huge emphasis on the Queensbury rules: after being told that capes never use guns because of potential escalation, there are literally only two instances in the story where capes use guns in a plot-relevant manner. I think there's a supervillain who uses a sniper rifle who has one appearance. While the characters who are powerful enough that guns are pointless get a pass (as does Miss Militia) I can't see any reason the main characters never get them. Not after their city is turned into a flooded war zone, not after they're invaded by marauding serial killers, etc.

Even non capes do dumb things, somehow. When the Undersides rob a bank, why don't the police have snipers on every roof around the bank... like at all? I'm pretty sure the robbery was long enough for that to go down. Stuff like that. And any explanation that has the words "Contessa" or "Shard" in it misses the point, because a) those are the idiot ball personified and it's unsatisfying because it's a cop out, and b) we don't know about those until the end, so the reader is left scratching their head for a million plus words.

***** It's the Endbringers. If heroes do things like set sniper rifles on villains who aren't killing people a la the Slaughterhouse Nine, the villains stop being willing to show up at the Endbringer fights. If you look at how Endbringers get defeated, sometimes it is just Eidolon stalls until Scion shows up, but other times you have people like Lung who carry the day, and they wouldn't do that if not for the "unwritten rules" that you don't sniper rifle the average villain.

***** Even though this was 5 months ago, I feel like I should mention that the lack of guns is completely deliberate. Lethal force is almost never employed against parahumans, because there's a great fear of escalation (for example, if you start shooting at Taylor maybe she'll decide to just bite everyone in a several block radius with black widows). It's only used against parahumans who have repeatedly shown themselves willing to kill, like the Slaughterhouse 9. Otherwise, parahumans generally fight "with their gloves on" in most situations, because things would become chaotic very quickly otherwise. Cauldron also manipulates things behind the scenes to discourage killing strong parahumans, since they want as many possible for the conflict with Scion. In the sequel, Ward, guns are brought to a parahuman fight and it has a big impact (because most parahumans are actually vulnerable to guns). Victoria (Glory Girl) is the protagonist, and guns are a big problem for her, because a single bullet will knock out her shields for several seconds.

I don't remember the challenges and solutions building very well, but I'm down to accept that I might just not appreciate it. What really gets me down is the idiotic and not particularly consistent social strength of the characters. They seem to hold certain values close to heart, but only until they talk to someone else, or in the case of the main character until she's has a few minutes to think, where on she decides that she should roll back any character development that would lead her to being a badass.

I guess my issue with aPGtE is a little bit of both. Weakly represented intercharacter relations, in addition to weak problems and weak problem solving, with a extra large dose of Deus ex machina.

***** Characters get a wholly undeserved bad rap in the Worm fandom. Taylor is phenomenal if you pay attention to the writing. Theo is a fantastic contrast to her, later in the serial when he gets the focus. Armsmaster's development is easily some of the best Wildbow's ever written. The interactions between the characters past the halfway point are incredible. Defiant and Saint, Taylor and Bitch. Worm fanfiction only suffers because it's forced to retread the start of the story, when those interactions weren't fully developed.

Before that, it's not that the chatachters are god-awful unreadable garbage: it's that they're really not anything that great. And to get to the point where they're actually good, you need to read through more than /700,000/ words, which is the length of seven novels.

And honestly? Taylor isn't that great, though I think this is primarily a matter of opinion as opposed to technique. I personally found her emotions to be muted and flat throughout the series, which is not a small flaw, and not one limited to Taylor (you see this in most interludes as well, though the epilogues are better). On the other hand, lots of people did enjoy Taylor, probably because she's one of (if not the most) sympathetic super-power since Spiderman.

I guess what I'm getting at is that the time it takes to get to the really good stuff in Worm is, in fact, a reasonable criticism to level at it. That and this work is basically the definition of YMMV, due to choices made by the creator that lead to many 'matter of opinion' cases.

#+end_quote

Reading through this thread though, I get the feeling you aren't picking up on a lot of less explicit characterization in Worm, which would explain why you felt the characterization wasn't /there/.

I don't think Taylor's compartmentalization and rationalization is something that can be missed if you're dissecting the work at any level of depth. It's a very explicit part of who she is.

She puts people into boxes. She takes bad thoughts and feelings, locks them away, throws away the key, and forces herself to not think about them. This is in stark contrast to other viewpoint characters, who don't do this.

This isn't minor detail stuff. You cannot understand this character without being aware of this. Taylor's attempt to segregate her feelings into boxes is the driving flaw behind most of her actions in the early novel, and a point of reflection and personal growth in the later half.

I'm going to show you some examples of how Wildbow expertly does characterization, using two separate chapters as examples.

--------------

[[[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2012/11/17/colony-15-10/][15.10]]]

At this point in the story, Taylor's rationalized a lot of morally questionable things in her pursuit of rescuing Dinah.

This is the chapter where the neat little boxes Taylor's been building up finally fall down. Notice the disparity between Taylor's thoughts and involuntary actions.

#+begin_quote
  I passed the invisible boundary between the neatly manicured lawn of the mayor's expansive backyard to the tall grass at the glade's edge. My hands were shaking and my breathing was heavy. I hadn't done anything more strenuous in the past few minutes than talking to the mayor and walking at a good pace, */but my body was reacting like I'd just sprinted halfway across the mayor's property./*
#+end_quote

She can't continue ignoring this. She physically has to face what she's done.

Powerful imagery.

#+begin_quote
  I put a hand on a tree as I walked, as if it could steady me and keep me from falling. */I wasn't in any danger of falling that I was aware of,/* but it was reassuring nonetheless.
#+end_quote

Taylor's barely standing upright, but in her head she's still trying to keep her feelings separate from her thoughts to ignore the reality of what she's done.

#+begin_quote
  Damn. How big was his property? And he could still afford to hire someone to cut his grass? Eat a nice dinner on a huge wooden table, complete with courses? Blithely ignoring what was going on in the rest of the city with his superhero son and superheroine date?
#+end_quote

Taylor reflexively tries to judge or hate the Christners in a weak attempt to justify what she's done. With that having failed...

#+begin_quote
  No, try as I might, I couldn't bring myself to get angry. Couldn't blame him for what I'd done.
#+end_quote

...the walls come down. This is a pretty big moment of character growth for Taylor.

Just weeks before, she wouldn't have been capable of doing this. It's only after ignoring increasingly horrific actions that Taylor's coping mechanism breaks down.

#+begin_quote
  I couldn't afford to dwell.
#+end_quote

However, people don't change in an instant. Taylor finds new reasons to ignore Triumph.

Taylor says she /can't afford to take time/ to think about this.

Let's look at what Wildbow does immediately after.

#+begin_quote
  I directed her to me with my bugs, drawing arrows in the air. /A minute or two passed before she caught up./
#+end_quote

So in the two minutes Taylor spent standing there, waiting alone, she has avoided thinking about Rory once.

Worm is explicitly first person. When a character thinks about something or notices a thing, it's supposed to be /that character/ doing it. When they don't narrate something that we would ordinarily expect them to narrate, the same rule applies. Worm uses this as a literary technique often, informing personality traits via what things a character does or does not pick up on.

This is deliberate, indirect, and interesting characterization.

Do you think the emotion of the scene is being mishandled?

From later in the chapter:

#+begin_quote
  It was times like this that I felt less normal, less human. It was dark, the foliage overhead dense, branches blocked my way and the ground was riddled with roots, stones and uneven footing. It barely mattered. My bugs flowed ahead of me to check surfaces, clinging to branches and carpeting the ground. I passed through the trees as though I'd spent my life among them, memorizing where everything was. I extended my foot just a bit further to accommodate the slope ahead of me, ducked a branch with wickedly pointed tips and found a handhold on another branch to help myself hop over a spot where water had pooled.
#+end_quote

Okay. Taylor's going pretty in depth with her description of the local flora.

Kinda weird, yeah?

#+begin_quote
  I liked running. For months, I'd used running as a way to forget about whatever was plaguing me. Before, it had been the bullying. Then it had been the pressures of dealing with the Undersiders, my undercover ruse. Separating from my dad. Dinah. The fallout from the Endbringer attack. Coil.
#+end_quote

Running? Taylor, what on Earth does running have to do with-

Ah. I think I see where this is going.

#+begin_quote
  The times I hadn't run, I'd felt like I was losing my mind. Did correlation equal causation, there? Or was it just that the moments I was unable to run were the same moments I was under the most stress? When the Slaughterhouse Nine had been in town, when I'd been living in the shelters after Leviathan hit the city, before I rejoined the Undersiders?
#+end_quote

She's thinking about literally anything except Rory Christner and what she did to him. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmentalization][Compartmentalization.]]

#+begin_quote
  Either way, it was good to break free of my thoughts on Triumph and what I'd done to him. I could focus on breathing, on putting each foot exactly where it needed to be, keeping my balance and letting my subconscious guide me through the woods.
#+end_quote

And then, Wildbow comes out and more explicitly states that Taylor is avoiding her problems and putting them in a box. Since another one of Taylor's character traits is a lack of self-awareness, she chooses to phrase this in possibly the most flowery and positive way you could phrase such a thing.

********** *(Part 2)*

The following contains *HEAVY SPOILERS* up to Arc 25.

[[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2013/06/18/crushed-24-4/][[24.4]]]

#+begin_quote
  “Hey Shitcrumb!” Regent hollered, backing away from cover. “Easy-”

  Behemoth dropped the flame attack. I could see Yàngban members raising forcefields as he reached out, casting a bolt of lightning in Regent's direction. The forcefields did nothing, not even softening the blow in any measurable way.

  Regent was snuffed out, dead.

  A small sound escaped my mouth.

  */But there was no time to react./* Reeling, grieving, it would cost us. He'd done what he did for a reason. The antigrav on the flight pack kicked in, I waited until it started to drag me, then let it go. It skidded across the gap, across the road, to Imp. She caught it, and I controlled the motion of it to drag her away.
#+end_quote

Justified in the moment or not, you can't ignore that Taylor is once again trying to box up and throw away feelings that are hurting her.

This is how Taylor systematically deals with issues. She doesn't. When something bothers her, it no longer gets mentioned in her narration.

Let's see how long she can keep that up for, though. Much later in the chapter:

#+begin_quote
  Silence, stillness. The buzz of my power at the periphery of my consciousness was a fraction of what it might otherwise be, limited to the bugs that crawled in the recesses of my costume. There was only the press of bodies, two dogs and all of the rest of us in an area smaller than my jail cell.

  I tried to speak, and emotion caught my voice. */It threw me, as if it didn't match how I felt, didn't match the composure I felt like I had./*
#+end_quote

Taylor still tries to ignore the reality of how this is making her feel. It's safely tucked away in its compartment so clearly it can't be affecting her emotionally.

This is a /really/ good characterization beat, imo.

#+begin_quote
  /Think, think./

  “Sorry about your pal,” Tecton said.

  I shook my head. A denial? He was important to me, but... what, then? Was I wanting to focus on the situation?
#+end_quote

In a previous example, I showed Taylor using flowery language when talking about her awful coping mechanisms to make them sound better, something that I think is a very believable and human touch.

Here, she's rebranding her coping mechanism to do the same thing. Clearly, she's just doing what she can to focus on the mission, and certainly not trying to put off dealing with something traumatic because that sort of thing has been consistently hard for her.

This is /wonderfully/ indirect characterization.

I don't really get how someone can go through Worm with any semblance of literary analysis and come away thinking the characterization is "lackluster," or how these very deliberate character beats can be misinterpreted by someone as the author "not being great at writing emotion."

Dude, I get it. [[https://i.imgur.com/QWGrU.jpg][Sometimes the curtains are just fucking blue.]] But I think you can go too far in the opposite direction, and end up wilfully ignoring a lot of things that are pretty clearly intentional.

*Edit:* Worm is an incredibly heavy novel.

By dissecting such a stereotypical villain, WarBoar actually forces depth upon him, showing the how and why such a person could exist. Much in the same way Skitter uses breadth of power to make depth (turning a Master power into Tinker/Shaker/Thinker ratings), Jack Slash uses breadth of horror to create the illusion depth (so many different types of death from the Nine make people unsure as to what he's going to do next, and conceal the fact that he's a murderhobo). Meanwhile, the rest of the cast of Worm have clear, defined goals that inform their every action. Jack's the odd man out, until he isn't and thus you /feel/ as if his character developed, even though he's the most childish person in the entire serial.

Catherine looks and acts like someone who was pushed well beyond what she could bare and kept herself together by convincing herself it was for the greater good. Problem is, she actually *is* willing to do what that entails, and as time goes on her solutions are more and more pragmatic in the HPMOR!Dark Side version of pragmatism IE "I don't have time to redeem every motherfucker I come across, they either die or fall in line because I don't can't spare them any more thought."

This leads to her to becoming very good at her chosen field IE murdering those who disagree and getting the survivors to fall in line, hell, just look the Gallowborne. Unfortunately for her (and some of her agency) she has put no points into diplomacy, she honestly has neither the time nor the inclination. This leads to her getting screwed over by Heiress or Malicia or the First Prince or whoever in the long run because she just ignored politics as a thing-I-don't-have-time-for. This can leave a bad taste in your mouth, especially as the amazingness of Malicia and Cordelia Hasenbach becomes evident.

In the end though, I find the whole thing rather satisfying, especially the outside-view chapters where everyone is all "how the fuck did she do all this and how the fuck is she still alive? WHAT DO YOU FUCKING MEAN SHE MUGGED A FUCKING ANGEL?" etc etc.

Of course, I like deconstruction in general and the characters were just what put it above the rest for me.

******* For the record, I did not get that vibe at all. Yes, Molly is described as very attractive once she's grown up. Yes, she's got a huge crush on Dresden. No, Dresden is never remotely tempted.

As an example, there's one scene where she makes a play for him by walking into his living room in a towel after taking a shower and then drops it. His response is to dump a pitcher of ice water on her head and say "That will never happen." Yes, when she drops her towel his internal monologue recognizes that she's attractive and is willing. No, he's not seriously moved by it.

As to misogyny...I don't really see it. Karrin Murphy is a badass, very honorable, and smart. Molly is a complex character but very positively shown and I wouldn't describe her as a "bad girl" unless the definition of "bad girl" is simply "woman who is in command of her own sexuality". Dresden's girlfriends are both badasses, mentally and physically, who have serious agency and don't need to be rescued more often than any other character. There are villainous women, but there are villainous men, too. Offhand, I can't think of a single Distress Damsel or Overbearing Shrew or Subservient Housewife in the series. I see that others are saying this was mostly an issue in the first couple books; it's been a long time since I started the series, so maybe I'm not thinking of something from the start of the series.

This was kind of set up a lot along the way. She has admitted a lot of times that she is not a good person, and is okay with that. She is willing to become a monster for the sake of the people of Callow. She didn't quite /get/ that until she was faced with the screaming voices of the heavens inside her *demanding* she regret what she did. Then she finds that she really doesn't, even if she should. She is a monster, heart and soul, and has done everything for a greater purpose which she does not regret. Angels are bound by stories, they are not..... creative. They do a thing and that's it. Contrition finds your sins and makes you contrite with them, but they can't really change you if they're not actually sins (at least to you), which is, admittedly, rather unique so far. Evil acknowledges they commit sins, that they are, in fact, Evil. Catherine proclaims herself a monster for a greater purpose, and that her sins and all the blood she has shed is worth it for the greater /good/.

The problem that's going to bite her now is the fact that, okay, she's a monster and she's been doing what's pragmatic not what's ethical for a while now. Has she accomplished anything? Has it been worth it? Saying it's for a greater cause is a great thing to say, but does it actually end up being for a greater cause? She now faces the Choir of Judgement, and is going to be faced with the fact that she hasn't really improved the quality of life of the people of Callow. She's going to face judgement incarnate with the blood of thousands on her hand and they're going to ask her "Was it worth it?"

I'm not really surprised that you wouldn't have enjoyed it, if you didn't enjoy what came up to it. Why would you expect to enjoy the celebration if you didn't like what was being celebrated?

They were forced to interact with her in the manner they did because she managed to set herself up as the narrative protagonist for that short period of time. She won because she was able to use a narrative structure to make herself 'the protagonist who gets resurrected'. Her later ploy with the Winter Court makes this entire concept much more explicit, but this isn't a thing you can just do with a whim and a prayer. You've got to play the part, fit the role.

Fundamentally, in PGTE, the more primeval a character is (barring demons), the more they must bend to narrative causality. There is nothing at all suspect about angels (second only to gods in narrative causal binding) being forced to act in certain ways in keeping with a narrative for no other reason than the narrative the character asserts demands it.

If that doesn't seem appealing to you, then yeah, I don't know what would make you enjoy the series.

** With the Practical guide to evil, I'm starting to sour on it.

Mainly because I found the Calamities compelling in the way that they hacked the story conventions and worked around them.

With them, it always seemed very careful and discussed and tactical. They seemed like focused adults who very well knew that they were pushing against the forces of all creation.

As the story has gone on... Cat has become more powerful, but also much more cavalier. The Calamities had to overcome other people's plot armor which they did through careful study and planning.. In book 3, Cat seems to have her own plot armor.

I remember in one of the recent ones, Cat purposefully surprised Masego during the middle of a supposedly critical combat. That took me totally out of the story as she wasn't treating it as "we are one mistake away from total catastrophe." instead it seemed like "I trust my plot armor to protect me from pulling stupid stuff in a critical battle."

Archer's one of the strongest forces in Cat's army - why in the world would she risk letting her get seriously injured!?

That's exactly what was worrying me about it! Recently she's been relying on story tropes to play the system - which works OK in Arcadia, where all the fae are literally bound by tropes - but not so much in Creation, where the tropes always end with the villains losing. Granted she's fighting fae now, and another villain later... but if she keeps relying on narrative to see her through, she's screwed when she goes up against heroes again.

Hoping that as of today's chapter, Winter's influence on her will be significantly lessened or ended, and she'll stop making these kinds of choices in future conflicts.

** I have... mixed feelings on Worm and Practical Guide. You know what? Practical Guide review time!

--------------

I think /A Practical Guide to Evil/ is a mix of three genres: young adult anti-hero epic, political intrigue, and meta-story telling. I tolerate the first, love the second and hate the third.

Catherine is basically the archetypal female young adult character. She's grown up in a difficult environment, seen suffering and misery, learned to fend for herself, she's the Chosen One but she's building her own destiny. She's baaaasically Katniss Everdeen with more agency, and a rationalist spin ("most heroes try to do X, X doesn't work, I'm going to try Y instead"). So if you don't find this type of character compelling... yeah, ain't gonna work out.

Personally, I love the worldbuilding and the political elements. Stuff like the idea that Amadeus made the Imperial Legion more popular by having it patrol areas controlled by corrupt nobles and corrupt police forces, or the idea that Callow and Praes are doomed to fight because Praes has a constant overpopulation problem and needs to invade Callow to either cull its population or import food (which was also a theme in OotS).

On the other hand, if you forget the big picture plan of "unifying Callow and Praes through common enemies" for a moment, the day to day reality is pretty grim. Catherine is working for an Empire that has consistently been an oppressive Tyranny for centuries, and just happens to currently be getting more progressive. Her plan to unify the region entails a lot dying, suffering, and civil-war-ing. The story doesn't pull punches on the fact that every battle has casualties, and every manoeuver requires sending soldiers to their deaths. Maybe you don't like the frequent reminders that a lot of people are dying in the depicted conflicts.

The meta story-telling is when a character goes "I'm a villain and he's a hero, that means he's going to win because stories!". I don't have much to say on that except I don't like it. It's another thing that drawn from /Order of the Stick/ (Black is basically a cross between OotS' Tarquin and Darth Vader), and... I dunno, it's not very interesting to me. I'm not really a fan of 4th-wall breaking, unless it's used sparingly in comedies, so the whole idea of "We know we're in a story, so let's use strategies that will work because we're in a story" doesn't really appeal to me. I prefer the parts about logistics and politics.

Also, I know that "Evil" is in the title, but I don't really like the parts where they start to discuss Good and Evil. Despite what Star Wars would like you to believe, there's no ideology of Evil. There are weird Satanist cults, and philosophies of rationalizing why it's okay to be selfish, and you can always use some variation of individualism and "The only virtue is being strong because Darwin / because good and bad are subjective / whatever", but essentially, everyone either believe themselves to be "Good", feel like they're not "Good" but would like to be, or don't care and think the idea of "Good" is pointless.

So while I understand that the setting has a whole divine eternal war between order and individualism and how they basically map to Good and Evil in human societies, I still find it weird when the protagonist goes "We are the villains!" even though she has a pretty strong sense of ethics. Same thing for Worm, I have trouble taking someone seriously when he's saying "This person is a villain!" Who does that? If you want to use labels, use "criminal" or "murderer" or "scumbag", but having cops talk about "villains" is just silly.

--------------

So that's my take. If you maybe have more specific feedback on Practical Guide and Worm, maybe we could help you figure out what you like better?

This isn't fourth-wall breaking. From the perspective of the characters in the story, the fact that the universe partly runs on tropes is as much a law of reality as physics. It's the author's perogative to set up the rules of the universe however they want, so long as they are consistent.

Like Philip K. Dick said, "reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away." It doesn't matter how bullshit the rules may seem to the reader, they're the reality the characters have to deal with. If the characters said "that's really stupid" and tried to ignore the tropes, their actions would likely be highly sub-optimal. Remember, rationality is systemized winning.

In some ways these sorts of situations where the rules are unclear (and bullshit) can be more interesting than those where the rules can be systematically pinned down through rigorous experimentation and used to formulate complex solutions to problems. Making decisions from very limited information is a /really/ hard problem. As an analogy, contrast a hard science (e.g physics) with a soft science (e.g economics). Physicists may look down on economists, but in many ways the economists have the harder problem: there aren't any nice, neat mathematical models that almost perfectly descibe everything down to a ridiculous degree of precision. The best economists may be able to produce is a bunch of ad-hoc models that rely on dubious assumptions and frequently fail catastrophically, but that doesn't make their work any less valid or important.

My point is that being able to draw useful conclusions from limited information when the rules are messy and complex is an important skill, and more challenging to the characters than a world with "sensible" rules. Characters may not be able to come up with as complex or intelligent-looking solutions, but the solutions they manage to produce are that much harder earned. This can be less satisfying for readers, though (i.e. Sanderson's First Rule of Magic), and can enable the author to "cheat" by arbitrarily introducing solutions or challenges in a manner utterly opaque to the reader.

*** I agree with pretty much every point you made. The meta story elements are probably the weakest bit of the story because they don't feel predictable (like the conclusion of book 2). Maybe if the rules of manipulating the meta-fiction setting were explained in more depth it would help it feel more like sufficiently understood magic. But as is, only really the rule of threes seems to be fully outlined and even that feels arbitrary concerning what is considered a win, loss, or draw.

I still like the story despite this, but that's probably my biggest complaint with it.

Also, I don't think it's fair to compare Worm using the term "villain" to Practical Guide having people call themselves Evil. In Worm it's explained that the system of Heroes and Villains isn't something that exactly sprung up naturally, but is rather a calculated thing to control public perception. And a lot of the Villains wouldn't actually call themselves villains either, like Kaiser and other people who are pushing an ideology.

My problem with this line of thinking is that it tries to make opinions into objective truths. What you consider "mature tastes" is probably not what many other people consider "mature tastes" and it's not really fair to say that one person is right or wrong.

The closest you can get to defining an objective opinion would be to say that "the most popular opinions are the right ones and all other ones are the wrong ones", but I don't think anyone really believes that when taken to its logical conclusions.

Also even if it was an objective fact that OPs tastes were not mature, I don't think knowing that helps OP. They can't force themselves to like things they don't like. So at best you've only made them aware that their tastes are atypical (something that they likely already knew given the fact that they made this thread in the first place). At worse, you make them feel bad about themselves for not having good/mature tastes.

But just to be clear, I'm not saying it's a bad thing for you to voice your opinion and say "I don't think some of the things you listed are classics *in my opinion* and here's why...". That could be an interesting conversation starter. But the way you stated your opinion makes it sound as if you believe your opinion is some universal truth, instead of an opinion. And you never really elaborated on why you don't think those stories are worthy of being classics or list stories that you consider classics, so it just feels like you're trashing OPs opinion without explaining how your opinion differs.

I don't believe something can be inherently good or bad. Especially when we're talking about entertainment value. It's not a fact that He-man isn't good. In fact your definitions are completely backwards.

"Fact: I enjoyed He-Man when I was young. Opinion: He-man isn't good" would be the correct way to say this. Your personal enjoyment of something is a fact. Any rating that you give to it is the opinion.

Sure you can argue by certain metrics certain things are good or bad, but you first have to define those metrics and not everyone is going to agree on what they should be.

For example someone might say "A game that runs at less than 60 fps is bad", but other people might say "As long as I have fun playing the game it doesn't matter what the frame rate is." The metrics that you're using to judge are just as subjective as your overall opinion of something. So unless you can get everyone in the world to agree to the same metrics as you, any assessment you make based on those metrics are still opinions.

** Brave of you to post that here!

While I wouldn't say that either story you mentioned is strictly rational fiction, what I personally like about them, Worm especially, is their high level of realism within the established boundaries of the story. For the most part, the characters behave like real people would if they got powers, and to the extent that they don't, there is a satisfying in-universe explanation as to why. This is in contrast to most other super hero and fantasy stories (super hero stories especially) where characters often do things that make little sense from their perspective, just because it's necessary to move the plot along.

I would even suggest that the prevalence of this issue in these genres is the source of much of the enthusiasm for the stories you mentioned. People who love these genres but are still bothered by that they often suffer from this issue, are understandably very excited when they discover great stories like Worm or PGtE that avoid this problem.

**** I agree that neither story is Rational/ist/ at all. I said that neither story is /strictly/ Rational Fiction. I would say that for a story to be strictly Rational Fiction, it should never or almost never break any of the rules of Rational Fiction.

According to the sidebar definition, I would say that Worm is mostly Rational Fiction, and PGTE is somewhat Rational Fiction.

- Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.

Worm and PGTE follow this rule for the most part.

- Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".

Again, Worm follows this for the most part (e.g., the S9).

On the other hand, in PGTE, being "Good" or "Evil" is an explicit motivation for almost all of the characters and factions, with the Black Knight and the Dread Empress and the MC being the notable exceptions. Since there are good in-story reasons for this, I can see how it could fit within this rule. But still, it's even more overt than LoTR, and I can't think of another story where so many characters base their actions on their identity as Good or Evil, so I wouldn't say that PGTE is strictly Rational.

- The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.

Both fics follow this rule, with very few exceptions (e.g., in Worm, after Regent takes control of Shatterbird, he uses her power to transport their team on top of a door with glass shards embedded in it, because if they just took a car, it might break down. I guess powers influence users to use them, but it would probably still be better just to drive).

- The fictional world has consistent rules, and sticks to them.

I'm not sure exactly how to apply this rule, since in both stories, the reader becomes aware of new rules well into the story, but those rules aren't ever inconsistent with what happened before (e.g., second trigger events).

What do you think?

***** Oh hey, do I recognize you from [[/r/wormfanfic]]?

I would challenge the S9 being evil for the sake of evil. Jack has skewed motivations to leave a mark on the world. He brainwashes and shard-manipulates members into following his plans, though most of their motivations can be similarly explored, especially when shard-induced behaviors are taken into account. They are no more inexplicable or unbelievable than real world school shooters, terrorists, and unethical scientists.

I very much disagree with your rationale for disqualifying PGTE. Good and Evil are fixtures of the world, and do not (as has been remarked upon many times) strictly correspond to our moral ideas of them. Good is known for mind-raping cities into perfect utilitarians, and Evil is now creating public schooling and freeing its once-slaves. It's much more of a Lawful vs Chaotic ideation, as Black and others have discussed (though they may not be the most unbiased sources). Even if it were more strictly good and evil, the characters still very much are driven by their beliefs and values, perhaps even moreso on the side of Evil than Good, though, this is again a lampshaded concept within the world. This is like saying Eliezer's /Sword of Good/ isn't Rational for the same reason.

The Regent example is meh. They're in a war-torn feudalistic city. Finding cars more reliable than powers is of non-negligible difficulty, and certainly isn't a strong point in your favor, even if it could be argued. Plus, intimidation has non-zero value, and this is definitely that.

It is true that the consistent rules in both are revealed in an ongoing fashion, but frankly, there are simply too many to be easily info-dumped near the beginning for our benefit. The general premises of each were established early on, and in Worm, they come as important spoilers later, and in PGTE, they are not known to the perspective character any more than to us.

While I will agree that more foreshadowing could be done in either case (Brandon Sanderson comes to mind), it's still well above average, and well above the standard for what gets characterized and labelled as rational fiction on this subreddit and elsewhere on the internet.

#+end_quote

Even the most cliched villain almost always has some motivations or past trauma that made him "evil." If the bar for being "evil" (as opposed to being driven by a core belief) is that low, then virtually all villains would meet this standard. Sauron had his reasons for doing what he did, and so did the Green Goblin. I still wouldn't classify those aspects of LoTR and Spiderman as "Rational" in the way we use it in this sub. I can't even think of a story where the villain is evil for no reason at all. Even Marvel's Thanos wants to destroy all life because he wants to impress the avatar/goddess of death.

I think that a better example of a Rational explanation for evil behavior would be the Entities. They are destroying the Earth as part of a science experiment in an attempt to reverse entropy and stop the heat death of the universe, a noble goal for any Rationalist that even HPJEV would approve of. [Side note: what I really love about that aspect of them, is that it takes this idea of utilitarianism and the question of, "what /isn't/ justified to avert an existential threat?" to the absolute extreme, because the Entities are just doing what Cauldron is doing, but on a broader scale, just as Cauldron is doing what Taylor is doing, but on a broader scale.]

I do agree with you about the rest of the S9 having a Rational explanation for their evilness, but the Rationality of "An evil character made them" as a motivation, IMO, depends entirely on the Rationality of the evil character's motivations, and here, Jack's aren't particularly Rational.

#+begin_quote
  They are no more inexplicable or unbelievable than real world school shooters, terrorists, and unethical scientists.
#+end_quote

Hmm.. I thought a while about this because it's a really good point. I think that in a piece of Rational Fiction, a school shooter or a terrorist would be a poor choice for an antagonist. Think of it this way, if Jack were the main antagonist for all of Worm, wouldn't that make it less of a Rational work? Rational Fiction is different from other fiction, in that characters have motivations other than being evil for evil's sake. Just because some people /are/ in fact evil for evil's sake doesn't mean that they should feature in a Rational work.

And not to get too lawyerly on you, but the language I was addressing says, "Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil". Jack is defined by, and driven into conflict by, his value of being evil, which is not meaningfully different from just being evil. I don't know if I would go as far as claiming that characters like Jack or a terrorist have no place in Rational Fiction, but it was an example of a part of Worm that didn't abide by that "rule."

#+begin_quote
  Good and Evil are fixtures of the world

This point convinced me. I was going to say that they choose to go out of their way to be Good or Evil for the sake of being Good or Evil, but in their world, reality works in such a way that that behavior makes the most sense, since acting Good or Evil beneficial.

I haven't read /Sword of Good/, so I don't know the reference.

I used that example because it stuck out to me as an example of the author just looking for an excuse to use the new power (of course, as I write this, it occurs to me that Regent would probably also look for such an excuse), rather than the characters just doing what makes the most sense. If their car breaks down, they can make a glass-door-float then. And I'm not sure that a handful of people all trying to balance on a floating door is that intimidating. They could just stride down the street surrounded by a hurricane of glass if they wanted to go that route.

Please tell me if I have this wrong, but my understanding of the Entities' plan is:

1. Find people who are traumatized and psychologically damaged
2. Put worms in their heads that give them superpowers
3. Have the worms mind control their hosts into punching each other instead of doing science / improving everyone's quality of life / anything useful
4. After they've punched each other enough, blow up the planet and take back all the worms
5. ???
6. Stop the heat death of the universe.

Do I have that right? If so, that is literally the least productive route to the goal that I can imagine. Maybe talking to humans and recruiting them as research partners would be a better plan?

******** Lol that's not how I would phrase it exactly, but you've got the basics. I agree that from our view, doing science might seem more productive than fighting, but keep in mind that these creatures are utterly alien to us because they evolved in totally different circumstances and think in different ways. They're obviously extremely advanced, and it seems likely that most of their advancement was centered around conflict, so that's what they consider to be the best way to get new ideas and technology. They would probably scoff at the idea of doing science to make progress as much as you do at the idea of punching each other. They certainly don't have any reason to be interested in humans improving their quality of life. Humans are like little processors to them. They have enough self-awareness to realize that their minds are probably not capable of finding the solution, but not enough to realize that conflict may not be the most efficient way for all species to maximize innovation. Their logic isn't completely horrible, though, because it is true that war tends to lead to technological advancement, and they're careful to not let anyone get too destructive to the point of interfering with the overall experiment. Not only that, they probably tried lots of different strategies on various planets, and determined that conflict was the optimal path to getting the most useful information.

I disagree that the conflict with the entities is diabolous ex machina, and I also think it's more productive to interpret Worm through the proper lens. I think that the purpose of Worm is to take the crazy, irrational, often silly world of superheroes and comic book villains, and come up with the most realistic explanation that could justify all of that existing, and I think it does a great job at that. How would you suggest changing the story to fix the flaws you see in it, without altering the essential aspects of the setting? In other words, if you change the story so that the entities are peaceful and people aren't going around using superpowers to stop crime and fight each other, it's not really a superhero story anymore, and you've totally changed the story to something completely different, and neatly sidestepped the problem of writing a realistic, mostly rational story that incorporates all of the traditional elements of the superhero genre. If you think he failed at writing a rational story in which all these elements can reasonably exist, but you can't think of a better way to accomplish that, then maybe your point should be that the superhero genre is inherently irrational, rather than that the author failed at writing a (mostly) rational story.

I didn't care about the demon arc and I care even less about the fae arc, so... been a while since I actually gave a shit about anything that was happening in the main story. The snark is more grating and silly than endearing to me, "the woe" is a stupid name, Cat's victories don't seem particularly earned, the overarching plot is very much Worm with a fresh coat of paint, and the aspect system...

Well, that's gonna require a whole separate paragraph because I hate, hate, HATE the aspect system. What could have been a cool, interesting way for villains with the same name to distinguish and differentiate themselves is... super lame. They've become superattacks /activated by saying the name of the aspect ffs/ and that's never something I wanted from the aspect system. When they were first introduced, I thought they'd fit into this whole theme of getting powerful by following the story vs. gaining advantage by subverting it but that's a theme that has been largely wasted.

(Also I think I was doomed to dislike the story regardless because I've never been a fan of elaborate settings with pages of exposition on each minor principality. But that at least I can see being a strength for others).

Worm, on the other hand... I liked it. Up until the S9 redux arc. If one of the S9 clones had been a shark-man and Taylor had jumped over it, it would have been strangely fitting. The story got better again once that was finished, but the damage was done. Also, admittedly, my eyes kind of glazed past most of the action scenes past the halfway point. There were too many of them and not enough were plot-important enough to justify their existence.

Still, I really did like Worm, for many reasons already articulated in this thread! If I had to pick between reading PGtE for the first time or Worm for a second, I'd go with Worm.

It's interesting, because the story overflows with hyper-focused details on how the empire is run, the structures of principalities, etc...yet the whole 4th-wall, genre-following/bending/breaking system upon which the world is built, is /extremely/ ill-defined, and so much of the power interaction/development feels pulled from thin air and then rationalized after the fact.

The author gives us an overflow of information for one major part of the story, but very little for another major part, and I think it ends up pushing out both categories of fans.

We see the people getting wiped out by immense powers but we don't always see the babies being born and grown to sustain the destruction. The glass is often too empty to seem rational.

However I enjoyed Worm and PGTE. Worm manages the post-endbringer struggle of Brockton Bay with some semblance of balance up to a point. PGTE's good versus evil motif seems less developed what with the artificial famines and mass ritual massacres on the evil side and the good suffering from near constant depredations.

I suppose I like these stories because it helps that the protagonists are more ably depicted as damaged (yet functioning) products of their respective worlds. They become what they oppose. That's not conducive to forming an emotional attachment with the reader though. Bad things are expected to happen to the protagonists and I often concede they were deserved or shrug it off cuz shit happens in a crapsack world.

But I don't see it. What I see is extended middle school interactions between highly similar characters with cosmetic differences in place of real divergence. Repeatedly the Undersider members express or come to a resolution to do what needs to be done, but insist on either inefficient or erratic behaviour, justified by the moral compunctions they just foreswore, or by the adolescent and basically uninteresting extended arguments they get into.

A practical guide to evil seems to suffer from the same thing shadows of the limelight does, recursive narrative dependent worlds that lose sight of character development (here I am referring to both of them running into the same issue, creating world's where power is dependent on being genre savvy, and then having your characters do stuff like debate what will be genre savvy before they act). Sometimes it introduces new characters that are superficially distinct from the people we've seen so far (I'm thinking of the Tyrant), but it seems like every auxiliary character checks their actions and decptions against what the protagonist can deal with. Also there's really no evil to speak of, just modes of management with varying levels of effectiveness.

** I finally gave up shortly after the Leviathan fight. Now that I have enjoyed a lot of worm fanfiction I might try again. I've been on the fence pretty much from the first chapter on, though, and I think many of my complaints are still valid, even after reading spoilers that might explain them in-universe.

Please note that the following is based on recollections from years ago. It summarizes my impression, nothing more.

--------------

Every single fight I can remember felt incredibly narratively convenient to me, to the point of being unbelievable. It started with Lung. Taylor managed to narrowly avoid an experienced superhuman melee-fighter a few too many times for me to really be invested in the fight. Even after he grew too much for the pepper spray and bug-bites to really affect him, he just stumbled around. This started my belief that Taylor has plot-armor, which solidified throughout the next few arcs. In turn, this lowered my emotional investment significantly. I semi-fondly recall playing the yackety sax theme in my head while Bakuda and her goons chase the Undersiders with machine-guns and grenade launchers. Not really what imagine wildbow was going for.

Barely succeeding against impossible odds once is exciting. Doing it routinely is boring.

--------------

At the same time, Taylors life was designed to be as soul-crushing as possible. So many things happened /just so/ in order for her life to suck, that I didn't even care anymore. After having read some spoilers, I'm convinced Taylor's life has been a Simurgh plot to get her in the right mindset for killing Scion by thinking depressing thoughts at him. (That's roughly what happened, right?)

--------------

The setting was vaguely unbelievable. This is later revealed to have been engineered by Cauldron, but Contessa inducing world-wide learned helplessness in regards to snipers vs. parahumans does not make a compelling setting. This is mostly a number of miniscule subjective things that vaguely irritated me in the background. The one thing that bothered my had been that mundane humans were completely side-lined when parahumans were involved.

--------------

For me to enjoy grimdark settings I have to either take the seriously, or laugh at it. I could do neither fully here.

--------------

Tl;dr: Worm felt like each action had two possible outcomes: 1) Failing as inconveniently as possible; 2) Barely succeeding against all odds.

** I could only read Worm once, because the main appeal of the story is seeing how powers interact. If you're not into that, the story isn't actually that special.

I'm also frosty on a Practical Guide to Evil. This is more because the update time is so long, but more than that the main characters are simply too cavalier for me. It never feels like bad shit will ever stick, which drains tension from it like a /motherfucker/.

If you're looking for something else, the Legacy series of FanFiction for Worm is much more character driven, in many ways surpassing the source material. Or you could read The Metropolitan Man for the fifth time.

** I can't speak for A Practical Guide to Evil, but a big part of Worm is that the protagonist is biased and is not socially healthy. It's considered rational because the world-building is a more realistic look at superhero tropes and how they might come about, things don't happen for no reason, and the characters all make sense as people and do their best to solve problems like an intelligent person. But if you compare it to explicitly rational fiction, there's a big lack of scientific methodology and it doesn't do a good job of teaching rationalism, not to mention how the main character is clearly biased against authority. So you can definitely make a case for it not being rational; something being compelling is more a personal thing, and without knowing more about your tastes we can't really guess why. It also might help to know where you stopped reading, because there /is/ a quality drop later that a lot of people stopped at.

TLDR: Don't look at Worm as a rational fic, I would say that it isn't. It's a constant roller-coaster with no brakes, some people just don't like that.

** Speaking as someone who's a fan of Worm but ranges from to okay with to actively annoyed by Practical Guide I feel that both these stories have a common surface throughline but are highly divergent on a deeper level.

Both of them work very well as power fantasies. You have moderately clever young protagonists with a ruthless streak getting into fights with people who generally represent some ideology the reader is led to find either ineffectual and distateful and coming out on top because they're harder and smarter. Fights are constructed to feel like they have a layer of mechanics to them that the characters can exploit so they seem smarter and more calculating than they are. These are stories that are very good at getting an audience of disaffected and often geeky young people to root for the protagonist.

But on the deeper level things diverge. Worm is at it's core a character journey from the perspective of someone who is highly intelligent but weighed down by trauma and a biased perspective. She sees problems as simpler as they really are, and favours simple, violent solutions, but the world fails to bend to her expectations. Things are not that simple, the people she fights are people, and her violence and lone wolf attitude hurt herself as much as her enemies and don't do much good in the end. At the end of the day Worm is self aware of the fact that it's a power fantasy and delivers a story in which acting on the power fantasy only makes thing worse.

Practical Guide, by contrast, is much simpler and shallower. The authoritarian power fantasy is accepted as a truly effective way of dealing with the world. Catherine is on surface level has just as much depth as Taylor but her conception of the world as a place where might makes right solutions and hard man decisions can fix the world is validated. She solves all her problems with over the top violence and domination and things just kinda... work out for her and she doesn't have to deal with the negative consequences for those decisions.

Conflicts are far less ambiguous as well. Catherine always has a clear idea of who her friends and enemies are, people within her monkeysphere are deliberately written to be more likeable and three dimensional than those who are not, her adversaries are often either much worse or much less likeable and unlike Taylor for whom the less savoury aspects of her friends is a source of internal conflict Catherine just accepts them for the most part unless it directly affects her.

It also hides it's lack of moral introspection by clothing itself in deconstruction of stock fantasy, which seems impressive to people who see fantasy in terms of tropes and cliches and have more limited reference pools, but falls flat to people who have a deeper, more varied, and more literary understanding of the genre.

The messy part of it is that on a writing level Practical Guide is the more tightly written and effective story compared to Worm which is very uneven in it's pacing and storytelling. To sum up, I think that Worm is a story that's compelling because it indulges in the power fantasies people crave while at the same time examining them, whereas Practical guide is enjoyable to people because it distills the elements that make Worm appealing and gets rid of the parts that make Worm less comforting to the reader.

** I think both of them resort to "magic" and "fate" to resolve problems, which is likely why they don't really feel rational to me. The characters don't plan and find smart solutions to problems, they kind of just blunder on driven by the momentum of their role and environment.

They also both feature protagonists that have an ethical core but are pushed into being archetypical villains, and this feels a bit forced at times. Rationality is a lot about morality and effective pursuit of values, and the villain trope sometimes feels forced and in contradiction with their aims.

I enjoy reading both but have stalled out several times and have yet to finish either for the above reasons

** Huh. I've seen a lot of people talking about how Taylor escalated and her decisions weren't healthy. And maybe it's the rose colored glasses of nostalgia (it's been over two years since I read Worm in full) but I don't really understand why this is such a popular opinion.

As far as I can tell, Taylor made the sort of ruthless decisions she made because she had to. I don't recall her ever using excessive force for no good reason and escalating when a calmer, more peaceful solution would have worked.

However, it has been some time, and I've seen enough people talk about how she's mentally unstable (which she definitely is) and prone to escalation that I'm just curious; anyone want to give me a quick concise summary on why so many people regard Taylor's choices as irrational/too escalation filled?

The thing is, her definition of a "solution" is total victory over her enemies and accomplishing all of her goals without compromise. There are probably a lot of ways in which she could have done things without so much escalation.

For example, in the bank robbery, Taylor gets the Undersiders to change the plan to incorporate more direct confrontation, and she puts venomous spiders on everybody. She could have stuck with the original plan, or decided that it was too risky and backed out.

How many times does Taylor ever retreat? I can't remember any. Even her "arrest" and surrender happen on her own terms. Whether she's fighting against Endbringers or the S9, she keeps fighting until the threat is driven out of her city. The only way to accomplish this is to escalate.
