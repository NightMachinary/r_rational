Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** Without wading too deep into the political waters of what Donald Trump *should or should not* be doing, I'd like to get people's take on what he actually *is* doing and what level people think he's operating on. Specifically, or as an example, the Sean Spicer/Inauguration Crowd incident.

I've heard at least three different theories as to how/why it happened. From most to least cunning, I'll call them 5D Chess, Dead Cat, and PR Dominance.

--------------

*5D Chess:*

This theory posits, as basically they all do that Donald Trump directly ordered Sean Spicer to lie about the inauguration crowds, and did so with a deliberate intention of having it be recognized as a lie in at attempt to signal different things to different groups.

To all executive branch staff, it signals that they'll be expected to lie on behalf of the administration, and that such orders can and will come down from the very top.

To the press it makes it clear that the administration will be presenting its own set of facts regarding /everything/ and that access/information, etc. will depend on reporting of those facts either as accurate or at least as credible alternatives to other sources.

To Trump supporters it puts them in the bind of either having to either internalize and go along with the administration's narrative, recognize it as a lie but defend it to opponents, or else remove themselves from the political discourse.

To Trump opponents, it signals that the administration is completely willing to disregard facts, and so disarms much of their plans to lobby and conduct PR campaigns based on evidence, knowing they'll get no concessions, and forcing them to play Trump's game of emotional populist appeal which he prefers.

To those in the middle or disinterested in politics, it just makes everyone look like they're arguing about nothing, and pushes them further away from the "negotiating table".

*Dead Cat:*

"If you don't like the conversation, throw a dead cat on the table, and suddenly the conversation becomes about a dead cat."

This theory is that the order was given with the intention of it being recognized as a lie, but rather than for signalling purposes, it was merely with the intent of distracting the media from reporting something else. Specifically /what/ it's supposed to distract from people differ on, from simply minimizing reporting and scrutiny on cabinet appointments and executive orders, to the more conspiratorial theory that Russia's sale of ~20% of one of the state owned oil companies to a mix of disclosed and undisclosed buyers was a payoff to Trump or one of his inner circle, and which Reuters published a story about around the same time.

*PR Dominance*

This theory is similar to 5D Chess, but lacking any intention to signal to the press, Trump's opponents, or the in-betweeners, just Trump's supporters and staff.

This theory is that the statement was ordered as part of a continuing populist PR campaign by Trump, expecting that his supporters would take the statements and use them as ammunition to gainsay or "refute" negative press about the event, even if only to themselves.

To his staff it again signals that he can and will issue direct orders requires lying or compromising their positions and relationships, and that these are expected to be followed.

--------------

Of the 3, PR Dominance reflects the lowest level of savvy on Trump's part, and I think is mostly put forth as an attempt to portray him as vain and desperate for a measure of popular support and respect, even if only from a dedicated cohort, and liken him to the kind of bad boss that most people have or think they have experience with at work.

I'll note, however, that a desire to pursue and maintain that kind of populist support is about the only thing that seems to explain the nature of his inauguration speech, and maintaining his own narrative of "facts" was a significant part of his campaign strategy.

Dead Cat to me feels most likely in terms of savvy, and I get the impression that while much of Trump's own campaign speeches and rhetoric were based on creating a narrative of "facts", he's proved time and time again that he'll reach for some kind of big, headline grabbing outburst to drive media coverage whenever his opponents were beginning to gain traction.

My objection to this theory is that while it probably has done some to muddy the waters, the fact that is was so easily disprovable has raised a lot of suspicion and caused a lot of scrutiny, so if it was meant to distract from some of the recent executive orders, it may have backfired.

5D Chess was based on a discussion I heard on NPR last week with a Poli. Sci. professor IIRC, but frankly it seems like an overreach to me. Every press outlet in the WHPC jumped on how easily disprovable the administration's numbers were, so they seem to have had the exact opposite reaction intended if there was an intention. Conway's "alternative facts" line gave Trump's opponents all the ammo they needed to discredit the administration's narrative rather than having to pivot towards emotional appeals, and Trump's supporters haven't been pushing the view that the administration's narrative was actually correct AFAIK (though I don't get nearly as much exposure to his supporters, so that may be a sampling or availability bias issue)

*tl;dr:* Is Trump a populist still trying to drum up support and a CEO trying to get his employees in line, a media manipulator deflecting attention and scrutiny, or a signalling mastermind who overplayed his hand? Something else?

*** You forgot another model that is in some ways scarier. Trump refused to accept reality and then pressured everyone under him to push his alternate reality. Trump's narcissistic tendency to lie to himself and then communicate his false belief as absolute fact enabled him to succeed at building his brand despite setbacks and failures, and it even got him elected, but it makes him a serious liability in terms of ability to actually make rational decisions.

So in the case of crowd size, Trump refused to accept that Obama did better than him, to the point of positing a conspiracy by the media and making everyone underneath him agree with him.

**** I dunno. That one seems to posit a level of mental impairment or personality disorder that seems unlikely. I don't know what specific disorders could cause such behavior or what their incidence is among the general population, but I would guess that it's small enough to require strong and specific evidence to make that a competing or reasonably likely theory. Trump has certainly shown a bullying, egotistical, narcissistic personality in the past but /actual/ internal denial of reality in the face of this level of evidence I would think would indicate sever paranoia at the least in the case that he thinks everyone is saying all these things just to sabotage him, or else outright schizoaffective disorder if there's some other rationalization at work.

IIRC, there's some metadata associated with Trump's tweets showing the angrier, more negative, more personal tweets are actually coming from him, and with apparently little filter through his staff. If he were actually suffering from some paranoid delusions, I'd have expected some specific element of those delusions to have made it out through that avenue if no where else.

It might be that his focus on China as a global bully attacking the US, Mexicans as a horde of rapists and thieves flooding across the border, and Muslims as nightmare boogeymen out to kill us all /are/ indicative of paranoid delusion, but if so they're curiously well timed and politically salient for a guy who was running for office, and I lack the psychological expertise to judge if they actually hint at disorder.

***** Narcissism is actually all that's needed, really. Narcissists aren't pretending to think they're better than everyone, or pretending to be upset when others are getting more attention than them, or pretending to be insulted when they aren't considered better than others. They just are. That's how they feel. Paranoia kind of just goes along for the ride at that point, because a narcissist has to explain the contradictions in reality and their worldview somehow.

I try not to diagnose people I've never met as a matter of professionalism, but he really does fit the diagnosis to a T. If he was always a politician I would be more likely to think he just does it as a cover, but he was like this as a private citizen for decades.

I usually appreciate discussions that try to make people seem more 3 dimensional and nuanced, but it takes a huge amount of benefit-of-the-doubt to think that Trump is not exactly what he presents as, especially when so many people have come forward and said "This is who Trump is, in private and in public."

There are people that use Breitbart for their news and believe it seriously. There are the slightly prejudiced, but not bad enough for you to call out over Christmas dinner, grandpas that that hold view along the lines of Trump. A lot of those grandpas, and probably plenty of edgy teenagers, have ideas for government policy that would be unworkable to implement and would really suck if they were actually implemented. There are plenty of people with inflated egos. If Trump really is delusional, it isn't that unusual, what is unusual is that he got elected in spite of, or perhaps because of, his delusions.

And now I have started to get irritated that I have to explain this... the media has reported on the fact that he has hard these crazy views for a while now... He tweeted in 2012 that Global Warming was a Chinese hoax. He was one of the driving voices involved in the Birtherism Movement in 2012, where he also tried to get elected. A few of Donald Trump's "views" are obvious fabrications, yes, his Christianity for example. But a lot of his vies are just racist old man stuff that happened to gain traction because a decent portion of the population is actually way more tolerant of racism (yes I will use the r word and defend its usage as valid in this case) and rudeness than politicians previously suspected.

Donald Trump has tried to run in both 2000 and 2012, he just got lucky this time around with getting the snowball going on a never ending cycle of publicity and controversy to take down a divided Republican field. Its not that he chose his views, circumstances lined up for his views to get him attention, and then he tweaked a few views he didn't care about (Christianity, abortion, etc.).

The media has occasionally published speculation about him having some type of narcissistic disorder. The metadata about his tweets you mentioned, for example. Tweeting at 3am in the morning to strike back at a beauty pageant winner is probably not indicative of healthy sleep patterns at least.

However, a lot of the complex speculation falls apart when looking at the details of Trump's actions... 3am tweets attacking a Gold Star Family or a beauty pageant winner seem pointless by even the standard of raising media attention.

I think we can add to this model. Taking the outside view, /Steve Bannon/ got someone with a narcissistic personality disorder elected, based on the candidate's own previous fame and media savvy.

The new president himself doesn't necessarily /care/ about the details of public policy, but Bannon cares very deeply. This explains many of their moves: make some big noise in the media sphere, while Bannon quietly gets into seats of greater and greater actual power in the background.

Even then, I think Bannon has to be either totalitarian-level evil (my top pick right now) or a complete idiot to start throwing experienced intelligence and security officials /off/ the National Security Council. Like, how the /fuck/ are you supposed to implement a successful fascist dictatorship if you don't have your own paramilitary, the security state doesn't want to cooperate with you (largely because you've called an enemy in view of the public), and you start /throwing away expertise/ in how to /run/ the security state yourself?

If we want to go full 5D Space Chess on it, Bannon is trying to /disable/ the security state so that Russians or terrorists or /someone/ can attack the USA, which he thinks will be his Reichstag Fire. Then he and his team get dictatorial emergency powers, and he can move on to what he really wants.

Mind, I haven't read any news yet today (Tuesday), so let's go see how well these predictions have been born out.

Having an ourguy (Bannon/Barron) in this position could prove very valuable as they deconstruct and dethrone the progressive-humanist narrative in the public view.

I firmly believe that in the end, the only thing that the eternal normie respects is power, and the Trump administration knows it too. People buy the progressive-humanist narrative because all the famous and powerful people parrot it ceaselessly. As the most powerful person on Earth forcefully comes out for its polar opposite, hearts and minds will change, willingly or otherwise.

We're entering week 3, and Trump is well on his way to completing the system of German idealism and ending the age of vice.

Nothing super special to report.

My !Pokemon fic is coming along nicely. I need to plan out the story in more detail and whatnot, but I have been plugging away on a few scenes which interested me as the author.

I'm also writing modestly out of order. It lets me understand characters and who they are as they progress in the story, and keep people from being completely static, unchanging cardboards.

--------------

We as a community, I have found, are as prone to irrationality as anyone else. We're /only human/, and so I think that for those who are actively promoting rationality for raising the waterline, should be seeking at applying rational methods in more cases than they currently are.

I have seen a massive amount of unqualified irrationality lately from a community that espouses it, and it makes me sad. That said, I still stand by my original heartless point that I personally don't care about raising the sanity waterline. I'm just here for the fiction, and the people.

*** I think in general people prefer world-building to writing, which is why there's a limit on the amount of brainstorming posts you're allowed to make unless you are regularly writing. So I think it's going to be hard to find someone who wants to essentially do all the /hard parts/ of writing a story (characters, plot, making the words flow, proofreading, etc), would be good at it, and doesn't already have an idea they want to pursue. As we've seen on the worldbuilding wednesday threads, people love to come up with ideas for worlds, but much fewer of them actually post chapters, because daydreaming about how magic would work is /fun/, but sitting down and figuring out how to describe the taste of coffee when you don't drink the stuff (what I did last night: turns out there's like coffee taste wheels so it isn't that hard), or trying to work out logistically how civillians could travel between cities during WW2, or any number of "chores" that comes with /actual writing/, is not fun in the same way.

Basically, you'd need to be a popular person (e.g. webcomic artist) who could give people /actual Exposure//who people would be happy just getting attention from because you're a celebrity, or your setting would have to be /astronomically good/ so actual accomplished writers would be intrigued by it, and probably you'd need to only want a short story rather than a full novel since novels take /forever/.

Not sure what your setting's like, or how famous you are, or what exactly you want in terms of length and style. But to be honest I think your best hope would be to commission it from a ghostwriter, but I'm sure that wouldn't be cheap. Alternatively, if you have some other skill, you might be able to trade that for writing (e.g. I might trade time writing for time someone else spends doing art of my characters).

*** If you want to do world building with minimal writing... have you considered [[/r/makeyourchoice]] ? People post CYOAs with pictures and text that describe options that players can take, using a variety of systems, sometimes there are point build systems with bonus points for disadvantages and point costs for perks, others are just a single choice, some with mystery box choices, etc. Many CYOAs are just a single choice with little setup, but sometimes quite a bit of world building goes into just the choices alone. A few like Crossworld or Jumpchain, may have a sprawling loosely connected narrative. I've been experimenting with doing CYOAs all set in a single setting with a more tightly connected narrative, (only about halfway through with the main story, a fourth if I count all the side stories I want to do, I'll let you know how it worked out as a world building exercise when I finish)

So anyway, if you wrote your world as a CYOA, you would get some players that just treated it as a min-maxing exercise, some that try to build a character with a specific flavor, and some that just make the choices that fit them. Some will write the bare minimum of just picking their choices, others will write short justifications, and other will write full narratives. Some CYOAs will bribe players with extra points or choices if they write up narratives to go with their choices.

Anyway a few good examples of CYOA with heavy worldbuilding:

It tells you how to hold true beliefs about the world (epistemic rationality) and how to achieve whatever goals you happen to have (instrumental rationality). Doesn't matter if the goal is to save the planet or get rich or sort pebble into prime-numbered heaps.

(Arguably, part of epistemic rationality is figuring out one's own goals, because the human motivation system is so hopelessly tangled up that they may not be obvious even to oneself. But that still puts all goals identified in this way on an equal footing.)

***** Hansen's GCMII would be a good choice then - it already includes ocean currents and basic sea ice simulation :)

Things to consider:

- It's designed for Earth. You'll need to generate and feed in alternative parameters for terrain and bathymetry, atmospheric composition, solar radiation, etc. Nonspherical settings are right out.

- What programming language are you using for this? What file formats? (If you haven't chosen yet, Python is good for this kind of sim and NetCDF is the best gridded file format)

- It will take quite a long model run to converge from best-guess initial conditions to a stable state. How will you tell when this has happened? Do you even care? Do you have the compute resources? Consider running a lower-resolution or lower-dimensional model to refine the initial conditions - but also check that this actually helps (GCMs are often intuitive)

But hey, it supposedly works, even though I can't get it to compile.

The terrain will be randomly generated initially, and I'll figure out a sea level and process that heightmap until it's in a format that would work. I think I'll stick with earth's atmospheric and solar conditions because I don't know enough about that. I need to work more with spherical grids, and convert my erosion model to use them.

My goal is to port a "good enough" model to C, and then parallelize it with OpenCL. I've already got an erosion model working on a random fractal heightmap, and that's doing 1024*1024 grids in ~250ms per frame while poorly parallelized on my laptop, so I think I'll be able to do a low resolution GCM fine, especially if I can get most of the computations working on the GPU. My desktop is very beefy, so I'm sure it will be able to handle what I need. If not, I've always wanted to build a cluster. :D

I haven't thought much about file formats. I'll look into NetCDF.

I hadn't really thought too much about the initial convergence. How have GCMs done this historically? (Or do you even have the background to answer that?) An idea just off the top of my head would be to compute the variance in some quality (velocity, temperature, precipitation, etc) and figure out when the multi-year rolling average starts to settle down. That or just try the good ol' guess and check method.

Thanks for the help, I really appreciate it!

******* Sounds like a solid plan to me!

Remember that GCMII is 3D and has some fractional-cell features - it may be substantially slower than your erosion model. However you should be fine with an overnight run on a desktop; I was mostly concerned about interactive use.

It's your choice of course, but using C would make me worry that substantial changes will be harder than they need to be. Scientific Python is very fast too, as most of the work happens in C or Fortran libraries (eg Numpy) and tools like Dask and Xarray make out-of-memory or cluster-level data work a cinch.

Since you can't try to replicate historical observations or other models, the usual technique is to wait until long-term averages stabilise. Eg 'seasonal mean $variable for 30-60 years'. Plus, yeah, guess - you can probably assume that gross ocean temperatures will be similar to Earth for similar solar conditions for instance and just set the whole deep ocean to ~4C to start with, or air temp to a depth of ~200m. But this turns into earth systems science pretty quickly!

And I must admit that I've had similar ideas (mostly simulating exoplanets for scifi stories) for a while, and I'm tempted to port/update the model myself :)

No, I don't think that argument works for non-fascists. Jews, progressives, and even Bolsheviks simply don't consider truth and morality to be /defined by/ tribal membership. That's a fairly unique feature of fascism.

Anarchists can be /very/ tribal and violent on all the wrong occasions, too, but I've never heard them say that anarchists and non-anarchists simply have "different truths".

There's a specific feature being targeted here, and it's the willingness to engage in one-sided moral and epistemic relativism, where someone uses the threat of violence or overt violence to simply kill away any evidence that their desired worldview is incorrect. That is a violent way to think, and the rest of us have to defend ourselves against it.

I again implore you to operate in a consequentialist mode rather than a deontological one.

/Is/ hateful speech a legitimate reason for violence? Well, let's break the question down into separate questions. We'll have beliefs about those questions, and beliefs can be tested or discussed:

- Does hateful speech /cause/ violence /against its targets/, rather than merely against the speaker?

- Does violence against hate-speakers actually make them stop, or at least counteract the tendency of what they say to cause hate-violence?

- Is such violence larger or smaller than the amount of violence unleashed by the hate-speakers themselves?

- In the background, how strong, and how fair, do we think the basic social fabric is?

- Do we think we can call the lawful authorities to protect people who are threatened with violence, no matter what sort of opinions they hold, who they are, or who threatens them?

I have some beliefs about all of these questions, but I think to resolve the conversation, it's more useful to explore /your/ beliefs about these questions.

** */Towards a Pragmatic System of Morality/*

 

I decided some time ago, to forego conventional morality. I realised it was limiting, an view it as an unnecessary hindrance. I needed a new system of morality, and thought about developing one. I subscribe to a whole lot of philosophical systems, and dislike a few. I dislike idealism. I strongly loathe egalitarianism. I'm neutral on communism/socialism and marxism(read don't know enough to come to a more objective conclusion). I subscribe to consequentialism, naturalism, realism, utilitarianism, rationalism, pragmatism and hedonism. For my system of morality, I decided to choose one which would not serve as a goal limiter, but rather a goal enabler. Something which will empower me to achieve my goals. For my system of morality, I decided to make it simple, and came up with these few statements:

"Right" is any decision which has a positive payoff. I.e the consequences of that decision were positive. As opposed to: "right is any decision which is rational" Thus buying a lottery ticket and winning is a right decision. "Wrong" is any decision which has a negative payoff. I.e the consequences of that decision were negative. As opposed to: "wrong is any decision which is irrational" Thus buying a lottery ticket and losing is a wrong decision. "Do insomuch as you do not regret".

Point "3" is merely a bit of personal wisdom. If one lives like that it allows them to maximise their happiness(which is a form of utility), and allows them to die with pride. I think it will let one live a "good" life. The morality of an action can only be evaluated in hindsight; an inherent limitation, but I still think it serves me best. We do not worship rationality, and what is rational is not always "right". I believe strongly in results. Results take precedence, if irrationality produces the best results, then sticking stubbornly to our own rationality is 'sunk cost bias' or worse simply unscientific. Science after all holds empiricism as king. And I am nothing, if not a scientist. It is quite possible(not probable, merely possible) that there is an individual of such exceeding luck that conventional probability theory does not apply to them, and thus the methods of rationality are not the best decision making tools for them. If they produce results, they're decisions are "right". Fortunately or unfortunately, I do not consider myself such an individual, and am not sure I entirely wish to(for such a scenario, seems to be bound to the whims of fate, making one a slave to another and not a master themselves). I do not believe in predestination or determinism, and believe that at T-1, there are a vast array of possible futures for T. Giving such a situation, it is merely natural that I try to maximise my probability of making a right decision. As such, bayesian decision making seems suited to me. I think my proposed system of morality, is a sensible one; Letting the results speak for themselves, as opposed to stubbornly sticking to a way of thought. I think it is a scientific system of morality. Indeed, I think it is a rational moral system. Discuss other systems of morality, propose changes to mine, point out faults with mine, etc.

Obviously if we were all gods, we'd just do whatever ends best. But we're not. So systems of morality, in the context of human behaviors, are largely about /how you estimate that./ What approximations are acceptable, what heuristics do you use, how do you account for chaotic indirect ripple effects? How would you /actually use/ this alleged system of morality?

** Is it rational to be opportunistic.

Jumping at an opportunity, comes with many unknown and unaccounted dangers.

For people who like to make plans and strategise, isn't it needless risk.

Due to my experiences, I've decided to completely forego opportunistic crime. The risk is just too much for my taste.

If I planned to assassinate someone, I won't take an opportunity, that came up, but proceed as planned. I might miss a valid chance, but the risk is much less than my plan. The opportunity might be a hoax, I might be unlucky etc.

Being opportunistic, seems way too reliant on luck for my tastes.

I like movements that don't rely on luck, and reduce accompanied risk.

For endeavours with less risk, I think I might consider being opportunistic, worse case I lose invested resources.

I'll reduce my investment appropriately for such situations.

*** For any action which has a result determined by chance, the value of taking that action is just the expected value: the average of the values of possible results weighted by their probability of occurring.

So you have to weigh how likely every risk is with how much gain or loss will occur if it does happen. The rationality of a choice doesn't depend on its actual outcome, but on how good of a choice it is when you make it. This is why playing the lottery is bad choice, and even people who have won the lottery still made a bad choice when they chose to play.

The difficulty is you don't actually know the exact probabilities so you have to guess. If your guesses are more accurate you'll make better choices more often. But choosing not to take an unexpected opportunity is still a choice, and might be good or bad depending on how good the opportunity was.

So ultimately, it depends on the situation. Some opportunities are good to take, some are bad, and you should judge it on a case by case basis.

In the two examples you bring up it's almost always correct to not take it. Crime has disproportionately high costs if you get caught (deliberately so in order to disincentive doing it) and opportunistic crimes will usually have very low gain. Additionally, if you are not a psychopath you will have a nonzero altruism and thus lose value due to the victim's loss. And having a reputation as someone who never commits crimes can be valuable socially.

For the assassination (assuming you're already in a situation where you value their death even with all the costs involved) it's mostly just an issue of probabilities. Most possibilities involve them not dying, and your plan is an attempt to funnel all of those worlds into a small section where you kill them. Any introduction of randomness favors the more likely future of them not being assassinated, and makes it more likely for you to get caught. Nevertheless there are some hypothetical opportunities that it would be wise to take. What is rational depends on a case by case basis.
