Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** (Headspace stuff, including an attempt to figure out how normal this is or isn't, because maybe other people are just describing the same stuff but in different terms)

Sometimes I think that I'm rarely happy, and the best that I usually get is "alright, or not bad."

Other times, I think that I'm overthinking it all and that this is just how everyone normally is.

The impression that I get regarding how life is /supposed/ to work: If happiness is graded from -10 to 10, a normal person ought to experience -10 about as often as 10, 5 about as often as 5, and so on, and that if this isn't true then something abnormal is going on. I'm not entirely confident that this is actually true but that's a large part of why I'm making this post, to compare experiences and try to figure out what's actually going on with other people.

My best experiences are when I'm in a flow state, but subjectively that feels less "How other people seem to describe happiness" and more "Loss of sense of self."

Does any of this sound familiar to anyone else?

*** I believe this is closely tied to how emotional you are in general. The more so, the more dramatic are the sadness/happiness oscillations. As somebody who spends about 98% of the time somewhere between 'mild annoyance' and 'mild amusement/contentment' I hestiate to describe myself as 'truly happy', but likewise I am certainly not upset/sad/depressed either. Most things that would upset/cheer up a more emotional person are just kind of 'eeh, whatever', and more dramatic stuff is muted.

No idea what 'loss of sense of self' is.

What I'm meaning is that there's no self-reflection or self-consciousness or, um, sense of "I." There's a loss of sense of time. "Being in the zone" is another (possibly insufficient) term for it.

There's just doing/experiencing what I'm doing/experiencing (usually, writing, but also sometimes gaming), and when I look back on the experience it's usually hard to say that there was any real emotional content to my experiences. It's what I would expect meditation to be like, but I haven't meditated so I'm just going off of what other people say about meditation.

I have definitely had periods of very calm, emotionally stable, mostly neutral mood, which is good in some ways but a little frustrating in other ways because I do wish I had stronger feelings for people/stuff sometimes. Metta meditation seems to open me up to that a good bit.

**** I can't easily measure on a -10 to 10 scale of human experiences because I'm not sure what other people experience, but I can comparing my happiness levels at different times. Of course, this is all subject to the inaccuracy of memory.

At a wild (yet specific) guess, if a -10 is the worst /I've/ ever felt, and +10 is defined as being as good as -10 is bad, then I guess I've never passed +8. I exceed 3 maybe three of four times a month, now, and go below -3 about half as often. I don't go past 0.3 either way on most days, I'd say. If my memory is even vaguely reliable, though, this has varied a lot over time!: During the best part of my life, the extremes were pretty similar to now, but ordinary was closer to +0.6. During the worst part of my life, I spend some time below -3 more days than not. The average over my whole life is maybe +0.1 and the average in the last year close to +0.5.

This seems like a very small range compared to [[/u/eaturbrainz][u/eaturbrainz]], which is interesting, but I'm not quite sure what to make of it.

Edit: I don't know if it's a smaller range in an absolute sense, since there's no way to compare; I mean the range of an average day compared to the range of my most extreme experiences.

*** Let's suppose that the average person only experiences happiness within the range -10 to 10, where having more than 10 requires you to be drugged, and having less than -10 requires you to be actually under torture.

Then I would say that having more than 5 happiness requires you to be delusional. To have the kind of mindset that thinks the world is beautiful, that society is just, or that a wise benevolent omnipotent being is watching over us. Because that's the kind of thinking you need in order to feel things like "true friendship", "true love", "true happiness", and "spiritual fulfillment", whatever the hell those are.

Personally, I fluctuate between -1 and 3 in my daily life. 3 is really my maximum because I never forget that my state of happiness is an artificial construct that I keep up to avoid the health issues associated with depression. I reach that level by being so engrossed in a story or video game that I temporarily forget about the cruel reality I live in.

Whenever I drop the pretense and think about reality, about how natural selection is a nigh inescapable law of logic that is trying and succeeding at killing us all in exchange for more progeny, about how sheer random chance can and eventually will ruin absolutely anyone for no reason at all, about how any powerful being watching over us is clearly horribly incompetent or malicious, about how most of the sentient beings in this world are so delusional that they will pursue strange concepts of happiness even at the cost of screwing over the rest of us, and about how even being depressed about it will hurt my health cause natural selection thinks unhappy people aren't fucking enough to be worth keeping alive, I sit pretty firmly at about -7 to -5. Which is definitely not healthy and so I quickly put back up my bubble of denial.

On a happier note, I have never had issues about "loss of sense of self". The concept of some kind of "ideal self", like notions of "I'm supposed to do this with my life", or "this is what god designed for me", or "this is the meaning of my life" are essentially the delusions of delusional people who are so happy that they are inventing problems for themselves. Like when you beat a video game and then decide to try for a high score or a no-damage run or to complete every single achievement. You are artificially increasing the difficulty so you can find more challenge. But seeing as we live in a world where there are already countless life-threatening problems, why would you want to increase the difficulty more by insisting on completing the optional quests like finding out your "true self" or your "meaning of existence"? And those optional quests don't even have good rewards. It's not like finding out the meaning of life gives you +10 int or makes you immune to hunger.

***** Though there are biological components, it can't be purely biological, otherwise you wouldn't be able to change your happiness by thinking stuff, which you clearly can. Read a funny joke, your happiness spikes (temporarily). I suppose it is possible for someone to continue feeling blessed and blissful even as the world falls into ruins around them, but I have yet to meet one.

As for similar views, if you are referring the views expressed in that comic, they are rather different from my views. Humanity isn't basically good or evil. They are far, far worse than that. They are basically [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar][knight templars]]. If you ask around, most people have their own ideas of what morality is, of what good and evil is, of what is right and wrong, yet they don't agree with one another. Clearly, among all of these contradictory versions of morality, at most one is right. So the odds of any one person's idea of morality being correct is horribly horribly small. Yet rather than doubting their own ability to comprehend morality, plenty of them just dig their heels into their specific beliefs and demonize the disagreers. They aren't basically good or evil, they are evil people who think they are good, which is far worse.

An evil person can at least be stopped (relatively) easily: they are either impulsive evil, in which case they are ineffective and easy to deal with, or long-term evil, in which case you can control them with incentives and carefully constructed social systems that make it easier for them to achieve their goals by acting good rather than evil at all times. And either way, if an evil person dies, that's it, they're gone, problem solved (unless you reunite in some afterlife or something).

A knight templar never stops. As far as he is concerned, he is the force of good, and no sacrifice is too great for his cause. Threaten them with imprisonment or penalties for his acts of aggression, and that just adds more fuel for his belief that you are an evil that needs to be purged at any cost. Offer rewards to correct his behavior, and he just brushes off the "temptation" and continues his crusade. You can't even kill a knight templar, because then he becomes a martyr and inspires countless more to follow in his footsteps of knight templar-hood. And because they are knight templars, they often act like good people, which (a) camoflages them, and (b) gives them tons of support to commit more evils.

Want proof? Look at human history. The signs of knight templars are everywhere, banding together to form witch hunts, persecuting the different, waging bloody holy wars and conducting inquisitions against those they deem evil, all in the name of good. Why? Because natural selections wills it. Knight templars produce more progeny than either good or evil. While good people have to work hard to produce their own wealth and court their spouses, knight templars get to deem large groups of people as evil, then proceed to rob them, enslave them, and even rape them, allowing them to gain tons more wealth and children than good people. Then, while evil people would selfishly hoard the wealth and abuse their children, knight templars would be nice to their friends and families, those of the same country or race or religion, boosting their well-being far better than evil people would and hence allowing their children to produce more grandchildren.

******* Note: Since this may be a point of confusion, I'll clarify what I mean by knight templar. A knight templar doesn't have to go all RPG warrior murder spree with a sword, or go on a religious crusade, it just has to do two things:

- Perform acts of evil (like hurting innocents) while believing it is morally good or even morally required for it to do so.
- Continue sticking to those beliefs even when confronted.

Also, I have a general "things suck a lot more than cynics think they suck" type of cynicism. :(

That's what I mean when I say they are camouflaged. Most of the time, knight templars are perfectly good people. Upstanding members of the community even. But put them near the people they deem as evil, and their actions change. For example, slave owners can be perfectly nice to their friends and families, while seeing nothing morally wrong with whipping disobedient slaves to death, and would gladly help their friends put down any rebellious slaves while thinking it is the right thing to do. For another example, an abusive husband could be a perfectly respectable businessman in public, even donating vast sums of money in public, while still beating up his wife and kids at home, and be all knight templar about it claiming that it is only right for the husband to properly discipline them.

I mean, just look at all the incidents of racism or sexism today. Or people who are homophobic or against specific religions. Most of them, I suspect, are knight templars. They don't see their actions as wrong, and can be perfectly nice and friendly while surrounded by members of their in-group. Even when you tell them their actions are immoral they just don't agree, and continue to take shots at minorities because they think it is just to do so. Or that they are morally obligated or commanded by god to hurt minorities.

Plenty of people just don't see their own actions as wrong in any way, even as they take steps to make themselves rich while screwing over tons of people, or make judgments on who to hire/fire, who to vote for, who to marry, who to suspect of criminal activity, etc. based on corrupt or discriminatory practices, or spread horrible unverified rumors about other people that could cause them a lifetime of harassment and isolation, or even when they directly hurt people they "think" are guilty as some kind of vigilante justice. And when you try to confront them about their wrongdoings, like telling them to stop spreading rumors, you could very well get deemed evil by association, for if you are defending people they think are evil, then surely you're evil as well. At which point they may see no problem with making attacks on you, since you are an evil that deserves it.

#+begin_quote

Knight templars can and usually are great parents, that's the whole point. They are good to their in-group, which typically includes their families. Who they feed and cloth using wealth derived from the suffering of others. From the lands stolen by war and deliberate spreading of plagues. From the backs of slaves and serfs.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Historically, you are just wrong on this one. I mean, I wish that was true, but it just isn't. Throughout the millenniums of human history, most of the famous societies that lasted thousands of years /are/ formed by *horrible horrible* people. Slavery has been around all the way back to even ancient Egyptian times. War and conquest has been lauded as great acts of honor and glory by countries all over the globe all the way up until the 1900s, with conquerers rampaging across the land, looting and pillaging and raping and enslaving, being praised as heroes. Monarchies, where a single often horrible king has full dictatorial powers to do whatever he wishes, has been more or less the only form of government since the dawn of civilization. They aren't sociopaths, they are just knight templars: people who are convinced that they are good even as they commit all kinds of heinous crimes against humanity.

If good people truly made better societies, you would expect them to form a long lasting civilization, and their evil neighbors to just self-implode from their evil practices, or weaken into non-existence over time. Or you would expect that good people would cooperate with each other better, and thus form strategic defensive alliances with superior technological and economic prosperity allowing them to hold their more evil neighbors at bay until they crumble from within. But that just isn't what happened. Historically, the people who prospered and spread across the lands have always been the knight templars, the people who saw nothing wrong with, and often even felt morally obligated to conquer other countries, loot their wealth, enslave their population, etc. etc.

Personally, I subscribe to the "(almost) everyone is a knight templar or evil, (almost) everything is broken, but (almost) everyone behaves normal in public" theory.

******** To be honest, I'm not sure how meaningful your idea of a knight templar is. Basically, a knight templar as you describe it:

- Does things you don't like (i.e. morally evil) while thinking that these things are actually good.
- Keeps doing those things even when you argue with them.

As far as I can tell, you're basically dividing the world up into Evil People, Good People, and Seemingly Good People Who Reveal Their Rottenness By Not Following My Values All The Time.

This seems like a framing issue, though?

Just as accurately, but more healthily, I think we could divide the world into Evil People, Good People, and Some More Good People Who Just Have Some Mistaken Beliefs And (Like Basically All People) Have Some Trouble With Changing Their Beliefs On A Dime.

Like, this isn't some complex issue that you have to come up with a special label for. Most people are basically good, most people have mistaken views about the world, and most people are bad at changing their minds unless you approach the discussion in a particular way.

You can even say "The world sucks because of [people in this group]," but describing rather than labeling them has the handy benefit of showing that this is a solvable problem.

You're a knight templar. So am I, for that matter. I certainly have at least one moral position that I would consider abhorrent if only I were wiser, and it'd be hell and a handful to argue me out of it under most circumstances. In other words, there's just evil people and knight templars, no good people among them, and there probably aren't any evil people either, just more knight templars and maybe some broken people.

I'll leave the historical stuff alone, because I really ought to be studying and not redditing. >.>

It seems to me that what these people are doing and what you are doing isn't that different. They are comparing reality to their concepts of the "ideal self" and the "ideal life", it falls short and as a result, they are unhappy. Similarly, you seem to be comparing reality to your concept of the "ideal world" and of course you get the same results.

I don't think denial will lead to anything good here, it is nothing more than a temporary solution to the problem. Trying to change your view of the world also isn't likely to work because even though your model seems to be quite more pessimistic than mine, there definitely are problems in the world and it will always fall short of the "ideal world" that you want it to be.

It seems to me that the real problem in all cases above is the comparison itself, the expectation or hope for something to be better than it actually is. We can also go one level deeper and try to eliminate the "goodness/badness" judgement itself but this seems really hard to do and not such a good idea, these are useful.

I have only my own experience to base this on, so you might need some other approach but perhaps it might be helpful anyway. What works for me is to fix my expectations to my model of reality, which includes acceptance (or you would wish it were better => sadness). The other thing is to get rid of the standards that "should" be reached, just take the model as the baseline from which things can only get better (because if they get worse, the baseline gets updated and you're back to neutral/fine). In practice this leads to something like this - notice something good => happiness because good things are nice; notice something bad => neutral because it was as expected ("well, that's just how things are"). Probably acceptance here is the hardest part but the mindset to aim for might be something like "it sucks, but it's fine because that's what it is, no point in wishing it were different (as it is not)." It is still possible to accept it as the current state of affairs and then try to make it better, of course.

"Ideals" are like a list of quest objectives you want to complete. In that sense, yes, I do have an ideal world that I want to complete, just like some people have ideal selves and ideal lives. But, at the risk of sounding like a giant ass, their objectives seem so utterly frivolous compared to mine (x.x). Like I said earlier, discovering the meaning of life isn't going to give you a +10 int boost or an immunity to hunger. So aiming for those quest objectives is simply increasing the difficulty without really changing the rewards. My ideals are generally along the lines of reducing pain and suffering, which are kinda important since enough pain and suffering DOES give you -10 int: you can't exactly think straight when you're being tortured (by disease/poverty/villains/hunger/whatever). Not to mention the various other horrible penalties.

It is kinda hard to do both. Typically if you want to avoid wishing for things to be better, you should avoid thinking about how things could be better. But if you don't think about how things could be better, how would you try to make things better :x? You wouldn't even know what direction "better" is towards, since you don't think about it. Yet if you do think about it, wishing for it becomes nigh inevitable.

'Beauty' is a measure of how pleasant it is to observe something. If a person has the option between observing (a) and (b), then the one that he would most like to observe (out of that set) is the more beautiful (to that person). So it's a scale, not a binary on/off state.

For the sake of having a defined zero point for the scale, I would also define 'zero beauty' as 'no sensory input at all'. (It is therefore possible to have negative beauty; this is assigned to anything that the person does not want to see).

************* Well while I can't (or don't want to put in the significant effort to) pin down the exact boundaries of beauty there's some things you could probably say about it.

Firstly is that the amount of valence from looking at something with "beauty" can't /just/ be non-zero it has to meet some higher valence threshold than that. So something just being slightly nice to look at wouldn't be sufficient here.\\
Secondly and perhaps more importantly is that beauty only refers to /specific types of positive valence responses/. So for instance most people would feel a bit weird about seriously saying a really good looking piece of food is beautiful (well they might want to be deliberately hyperbolic) unless it was say arranged in a sort of artistic way and didn't derive most of it's aesthetic value from looking tasty.\\
Similarly and more extremely videos of earwax removal and zit popping can be somewhat satisfying to watch despite also being gross, but of course nearly nobody would ever call that beautiful.

You're fundamentally missing that there is a /distinctive feeling/ associated with the word here that people are referring to, not just the fact it's sufficiently positive valence.

I was thinking about Eliezer Yudkowsky and HP:MoR the other day and I had this vague impression about them. I'm going to try putting it into words, and I'd appreciate if anyone can help me figure out what I mean.

I feel like Eliezer Yudkowsky and MoR have this unique property, that I would call *incompressibility*, for lack of a better word. That property would be: they are not perfect, and someone can do better than them, but the only way to do better than them is to be more complex... or more smart, in some abstract sense.

I'm really not sure how to put it. Basically, you can criticize MoR, but the only criticism that is valid is criticism that has /more thought/ put into it than MoR itself? No, that doesn't sound right; you can put less though, but focus it more.

A counter-example to that property would be a car without wheels. It can be an item of tremendous complexity, with immense thought put into it, but you only need non-immense thought to realize that the car won't be able to function very well.

I guess a similar concept would be Pareto efficiency, but that's not it either.

Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land is an "idea" sci-fi story. The characters do things. But, the point of the book is seeing where Heinlein goes with his conceit.

A romance novel might be about that moment where the male lead realizes he's utterly devoted the the female lead. A horror story might be about capturing a feeling of creeping-dread that will stick with you long after you put it down.

HPMoR's payoff was that it made me notice things. The plot was OK. The dialogue was often bad. The impact was reading a story where the characters thought like actual people. And, by extension, realizing how many stories relied on contrivance and stupidity to drive their plots.

That feeling of reading worlds with actually-intelligent characters is the thing that makes me read rational fiction.

Books written around a "payoff" need to nail their 1 outstanding aspect. The rest of the writing can be anywhere from good to merely serviceable. I think this is why the books seems "incompressible".

1) You could be talking about how there is no low-hanging fruit when it comes to quality. HPMOR has so much thought and detail put into it that there is no part of it which can be easily improved. Any improvements would require an author who is just as good or better at writing and explaining rationality concepts as Eliezer.

2) Another thing you might be getting at is how every single bit of the story is essential. Remove any chapter and there will be holes in the plot. It's like how every word written is a crucial hint which are only obvious in hindsight. If someone tried to write the exact same story but shorter, they would find it very difficult. An accurate summary is very difficult (fortunately a good summary doesn't really need to convey everything that happened in HPMOR) and even readers who are given spoilers will still end up surprised. You can't describe the story very well without just telling the story itself.

I think we may be over-glorifying HPMOR a bit here. No matter how much you like it, it's reasonable to admit that (a) it has (at least a few) flaws, and (b) it has (at least a little) unnecessary cruft.

Removing parts of the story may result in a /less enjoyable/ story for you, but there are certainly small parts here and there which are not "crucial hints", and which wouldn't leave "holes in the plot" if removed. Eliezer even talks in his notes about how he thought parts of the story were awkward, or didn't like certain parts.

I can't speak for him, but I wouldn't be surprised if there were parts he would remove/change, if he were to conduct a thorough edit of the work (similar to what Wildbow's been doing with Worm1)

The whole debacle about the Star Trek transporter problem is actually down to a failure to consider [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing][Level 1+ intelligent characters.]]

For a Transporter clone to have a Tomato In The Mirror moment, would be tantamount to Thorin throwing down the key. Because if you lived in a world where you had been 'recreated' or 'transported' you would do a mental inventory using your introspective empathy and conclude you were not a 'meaningless copy of a dead guy, and not the real thing.' Much like what informs you /right now/ that you are indeed the genuine article.

*** That rests on the assumption that the Transporter clone doesn't have particular theological or philosophical beliefs that would contradict the idea that you are the genuine article. For example:

- Souls exist, the only version of me with a soul (i.e. the original me) is dead, and I am a soulless version of the person who died. If souls have anything to do with the afterlife, as we might reasonably surmise, then I (the clone) will not have an afterlife, because I have no soul to outlive this body of mine, while the original me is in Heaven (or Hell, maybe...).
- What matters to my sense of identity is physical continuity: not that all of the planks in my personal Ship of Theseus have been there the whole time, but that there has always been a more-or-less complete ship the whole time. Going through the transporter deconstructs the ship, however, creating a moment when there is no ship, and the ship that appears later has a different line of continuity.
- I can accept that the version of me that is created by the transporter is the genuine article, but if we could just set up the transporter to create a version of me at my destination before the departing version is destroyed (or, perhaps, create two versions of me at my destination), we would see that there are actually multiple instances of me in existence, albeit not at the same time (unless we run this thought experiment for real). In other words, while I might be me, so was the original me, so there's a me that was alive and is now dead, and this is kind of weird for me to think about.

(The third one is the closest to my actual position on the matter, but I've been suicidal often enough that the idea that I'm killing myself with the transporter would probably be a relief at times, and if I had easy access to one then I might use it more often than actually required).

**** The first listed example is where I disagree. While it would certainly present a philosophical quandary, no sane human being would conclude "woe is me, I am without a soul" because we already know that only certain kinds of brain damage do that. A non-brain-damaged clone would feel just as 'ensouled' as the original, and ultimately people who believe in the existence of souls in the first place are prone to put a lot of stock in emotional introspection.

The second one throws a spanner in the works w.r.t. the gestalt information hypothesis, namely that everything that makes you /you/ is the information contained in your brain (hard to argue with) and the fact that there is no such thing as distinguishable atoms (EY argued at length for this in the infamously technically flawed QM sequence.) If you have a problem with a process so minimally disruptive as perfect replication of what can only be a sub-microsecond-long snapshot of your physiology, then I can only imagine the moral horror you must suffer from, say, general anesthesia, traumatic amputation and replacement by prosthetic limb, domoic acid intoxication, or cybernetic memory manipulation.

The third one is epistemologically correct. There are no clones, there are two originals. Trippy! But then so is the fact that almost everyone was once pushed naked and screaming through someone's birth canal.

Thought experiment:

Imagine for a moment that someone puts you under general anesthesia and when you wake up a very credible-looking person informs you that your entire body has been broken down and built up again, atom-by-atom. What is different about this thought experiment is that that is a lie: you were put under and woken up normally. However, everyone you meet for the rest of your life will insist that you were indeed transported.

You are, in this hypothetical, still you, 100%. No transporter clone shenanigans. Yet, all the data you have access to suggests otherwise.

I might not /feel/ that way, but feelings are bunk in the face of cold logic. >:P

(Again, I don't endorse that thinking. I'm just arguing that it isn't impossible, or even implausible, to think in these ways, because I know or have been people who think in these or similar ways.)

********* Yep! It's usually called Pre-Earth Life or Preexistence.

I guess you could argue that a transporter clone could receive a preexistent soul that had not yet been born, but Mormonism puts a lot of weight on the importance of being born with a more or less blank slate and it would be really messy, theologically. At the very least, you would probably have to be re-baptized (or just baptized, since the point is that this soul has never been baptized, because it has never had a body before).

You would also still expect to meet copies of yourself in Heaven (unless you just ignored anything complicated/weird about your religion's beliefs, which I have to admit Mormons have been doing increasingly often over the past few generations).

  The second one throws a spanner in the works w.r.t. the gestalt information hypothesis, namely that everything that makes you you is the information contained in your brain (hard to argue with) and the fact that there is no such thing as distinguishable atoms (EY argued at length for this in the infamously technically flawed QM sequence.) If you have a problem with a process so minimally disruptive as perfect replication of what can only be a sub-microsecond-long snapshot of your physiology, then I can only imagine the moral horror you must suffer from, say, general anesthesia, traumatic amputation and replacement by prosthetic limb, domoic acid intoxication, or cybernetic memory manipulation.
#+end_quote

As someone who does actually hold to physical continuity (well continuity of the physical process that is your mind) determining your identity (for the sort of identity that predicts experience) none of your objections here are actually an issue. I think a lot of the reason for that is that if you care about continous mental process then you don't actually care about specific atoms, nor do you actually consider "you" to be the information stored in your brain, instead you're the process or a subset of it.

As for sleep I simply don't think you actually cease having experiences during any portion of it. After all I and many people don't feel as though they simply lost time when they woke up, they get a sense of time having passed in relation to how long they've been out. In addition no matter when I'm woken up I always vaguely remember being woken up /from/ something even if it was extremely simple in terms of complexity.

Still there's at least some doubt that things like anesthesia (that are from what I remember like suddenly being thrown forward in time to the point you wake up), could actually be death. Though it seems just as likely that you simply don't remember those sorts of experiences.

Of course none of this means I would suffer an identity crisis if I found out I was transported, since while I feel bad the other version of me I'm more concerned with making sure nobody tries to transport /me/.

And that's the crux of my post, really. People experience identity crises when they have an emotional reason to, and from the perspective of the clone, there is no reason.

So, how much money would you want me to pay your ‘clone' before you'd let yourself be transported? Remember: your friends and family will still have ‘you' alive, all the causes you care about will be furthered by ‘you' and in addition ‘you' will have a lot of money to help with. A million? A billion? What's the price of your conviction that transportation is death?

I'd pay money to be transported, mind. I see it as just that: transportation. A really fast, really advanced car.

I mean while I might not be particularly distraught, other people of my position might reasonably be rather affected by the death of their doppelganger.\\
Plus if they were transported against there will then the fear from that is going to carry over into the clone.

I think perhaps you underestimate the degree to which I actually believe being transported is death. So no there's basically no threat or bribe that would get me to enter a transporter because I don't really have anything in the world I value more than my own life. The only possible way I'd get into a transporter is if the alternative is a fate worse than death (in which case I might just try to kill myself so as not to likely screw over my clone, since in a scenario where i'm being transported against my will my clone is probably not in for a great fate upon creation).

My view is that I am a (bio)chemical reaction that is sometimes aware of itself. That reaction is still continuous through sleep, general anesthesia and even a deep coma.

So a transporter would be the final end for me, and construct a new instance of me at the destination. In the fake transportation scenario I would be upset that there was a murder, but would still consider myself me (I do not believe in souls).

Although I would be very worried that the rebuilding process was flawed in some way, and possibly have mental issues trying to examine my own internal state for flaws (real or imagined).

And I would be /extremely/ pissed that it was done without my consent.

****** Yes, of course. The fidelity of the process need to be unimpeachable. Would it suffice to see a --- say --- 10000 person double blind study of the long-term effects confirming that there is nothing to be afraid of? You've taken drugs with horrible side effects that have been less rigorously studied.

Also, the transporter would be the final end for you, maybe, but I don't think your next of kin would care. Nor would the charities you habitually donate to, or all the causes you care about. You would still leave just as large a footprint on reality, transported or not.

I don't see why this is relevant for my decision. With this line of reasoning I could accept death as long as a sufficiently skilled (and similar looking) hollywood actor dedicates their life to convincing everyone that I'm still alive.

The key here is that it could be someone that is definitely /not me/, even an AI with no real self awareness, and it would be possible to leave the same "footprint" (or a better one, "I" could be awesome and make the lives of my friends much better!).

********** Okay, so. What do I mean by "comparable ranking in your particular preference ordering."

Consider the sum total impacts your existence will have on the universe. Now consider how "much" these impacts "make the world a better place."

I want to specify that I am thinking of "impact" and "make the world a better place" in the /most comprehensive sense possible/.

You having a pleasant, fleeting thought which is forgotten and never again thought, never committed to paper, entirely and wholly ephemeral; that thought makes the world a better place --- just a little. That you have the hopes and dreams you have and exercise your personal freedom and that you feel the way you feel, that is a net good on the universe.

Donating to charities alleviates some of the worlds suffering, fighting for a political cause you believe in, etc.

Hugging your mom/dad/next of kin as a show of affection makes the world a better place, saying a kind word to a service worker, posting a kitten picture on the net, etc.

Now imagine that you were replaced by an identical transporter-clone who proceeded to have impacts on the universe and "made the world a better place" more or less just as much.

There would be somebody to have the thoughts and experiences you would have, give or take; feel in the same ways and with the same intensities, like the same things, dream the same dreams, more or less.

There would be somebody to donate to the charities you care about, around as much as you would. There would be somebody to fight for the political causes you care about, around as much as you do.

There would be someone to hug your next of kin, someone to say kind words to service workers (and roughly the same words too,) and someone to curate internet cat videos just as much as you.

In essence, /your comprehensive gestalt behavior/ would be preserved in the universe. No actor can do that. No AI can do that without simulating something that is /consciously/ you.

ETA: The fake-clone being "better" than you would not have a "comparable footprint" it would have an entirely different one.

This is more relevant, but I feel we use different definitions of "you".

I am a chemical process. Another chemical process, albeit identical, is /another instance of me/. Unless there is a sudden reveal that /surprise!/ the religions were right - there is a soul and it can jump between bodies and other shenanigans.

My objection becomes more clear if you use a non-destructive scan in the teleporter scenario. Once the instance at the destination has been verified, you drag the original out to the back yard (begging and screaming) and shoot them.

The shorter you wait, and the more humane you make the execution, the closer to Star Trek we get. But it is still the termination of a perfectly viable instance of a person.

I see no reason to stop experiencing things, so that another instance of me can experience things.
