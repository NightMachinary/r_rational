Cryopreservation sees a lot of play in mass-market science fiction, but it's rarely in a serious form; instead, you get /Encino Man/, /Demolition Man/, /Sleeper/, /Futurama/, /Austin Powers/, etc. The concept is great for setting up a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfTemporalWater][Fish Out of Temporal Water]] story, but it's rarely taken beyond that; it's just a way to get someone from the past into the present, or someone from the present into the future, without asking a lot of questions that don't have that premise as their center.

The other common scifi trope is the sleeper ship, where cryopreservation is used to put people into "storage" for dozens or hundreds of years so that slower-than-light travel across interstellar distances is possible. That form of cryopreservation is usually distinct from /cryonics/ because it assumes that a healthy person at the beginning and end.

Cryonics, meaning the freezing of the dead or dying in hopes of returning them to life with advanced technology in the future, sees a lot less play. [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Cryonics][See here]] for more, but I think in general it boils down to cultural norms; mass media is averse to the idea of people "cheating death" and/or living forever, so this shouldn't be surprising. I should note that cryonics is a /real thing/ that you can /currently sign up for/, at a cost of something like $300 a year, which shouldn't be surprising to members of this subreddit (but you never know).

Anyway, this is the companion thread for the weekly challenge. Found a story that seems like it fits? Have some insight into the challenge topic? Post it here.


** I read [[http://chronopause.com/chronopause.com/index.php/2011/05/29/a-visit-to-alcor/index.html][A Visit to Alcor]] by Mike Darwin a week or so ago, which is pretty (ahem) chilling, even if it's four years old. I think the strongest takeaway I had was that cryonics in its current form is not at all feedback driven. If I wanted to buy a television, I would go look at reviews on Amazon, talk to my friends, or listen what experts had to say. If I want to buy a soda, I not only have the FDA to guard against the worst issues, but there's feedback at every single level from manufacture to distribution to me, the consumer. This isn't to say that feedback-driven structures are perfect, especially those that are profit motivated, but compare this to cryonics and you'll see that there's virtually zero feedback, mostly because there's little way to evaluate results. If the cryopreservation fails catastrophically, the patient is still frozen and there is no feedback (and the cryopreservation organization has every incentive not to relay negative information to prospective patients).

I would cynically expect an organization with no feedback mechanisms to become better at /selling/ their product than /providing/ their product. In other words, if people were somehow buying soda for its taste /without being able to taste it/, I would expect soda manufacturers to put lots of money into convincing people that their soda tasted great instead of putting money into actually changing the taste of their soda. It's the same reason vaporware happens; a startup focuses on getting investment by producing ever-better presentations rather than making the actual product. This also helps explain why the TSA engages in security theater rather than actual security. Darwin makes the argument that cryonics must necessarily be a different sort of organization given this lack of feedback, because if they're chasing profit (or status) improvements to process are inefficient.

(This is an especially concerning failure mode given that the argument in favor of cryonics is derived from "shut up and multiply". Many of the chained probabilities revolve around the cryonics organization's ability to properly do their job and to persist into the future.)

Worse, they operate best under Ponzi conditions: Paying long term, incremental costs with fund injections in the present. [[http://www.alcor.org/Library/html/CostOfCryonics.html][ALCOR's own assessment]] of their economics is chaotic and unstable.

A long economic collapse which ends the fund influx, or a few weeks of civil disturbances which disrupt electric power, and even theoretically perfect crypreservation will fail. Our past is full of such disasters, why should our future be any different?

To take analogy of a soda company selling great-tasting soda to people who cannot taste it a bit further, the executives within the company can choose to devote their time and money to the theoretical basis for taste, they can employ people who have expertise in the field of chemical analysis, etc. They wouldn't /actually/ know how it tastes, but they might be able to do some cogent analysis and come to an approximation.

/Or/ they could see that the only real income that this provides them with is from people who are willing to /also/ undertake the self-education necessary to understand their theoretical results, which means that while they might get closer to "good flavor" it doesn't really get them good income. They can spend money on research which they then use in marketing, or they can just (more efficiently) spend money on marketing.

The company might do this without knowing that they're doing it, or they might do it with the full knowledge that far future outcomes don't really matter for the health of their organization or the security of their jobs. That's a very realistic failure mode for any organization that's divorced from feedback of its products.

Writing prompt: What sort of society has to exist in order that raising children is more difficult and less desired than raising the dead?

So far as I can tell it requires the same sort of economic situations that encourages slavery. Regular citizens are unwilling to work a particular class of job or in a particular location. They and their children have the ability to refuse subsistence wages, possibly because an equivalent lifestyle is available to them from the state.

Which means that even a post-scarcity dystopia isn't going to raise the dead unless there's no other source of cheap labor: A legally oppressed caste, illegal immigrants, foreigners overseas, robots.

What would ever make it more worthwhile to spend resources raising the dead than to spend those same resources enriching the lives of the living and their progeny?

For 'less desired', then you don't need /all/ of society to be part of the resurrection decision-making process.

***** I don't think I've had a reason to, thus far; in the case that I'm treating as the default, people are having children with 1) enough resources to raise them into adults, 2) the prediction that the children will be able to become productive members of society, and 3) an assumption of their own mortality. Ah, and narrowing it further 4) the intention of not having more than two children total. In other situations I might be doubtful of the policy taken (some cases more than others), but generally would not act to generate unnecessary hostility to myself through unnecessary criticism, preferring that meaningful approaches to population control be attempted on a wider scale. Regarding 3), note the desire to keep one's own genetic/memetic information in existence and the issues if underestimating how long biological immortality would take to develop. (That is, the risk of one's line (or humanity in the general case) dying out if not having children and then dying of old age anyway.) To summarise, having children is (at present, and mostly any situation where humans have finite lifespan) fairly easy to justify, within certain limits. If there are plentiful resources on Earth to both cure the sick and for people to have children, then both can be done. If it comes down to an either/or triage situation, then prioritising one's desire to have a(nother) baby over a stranger's life is ethically questionable, though there are circumstances in which it could be justified. Edit: As a note, 'stopping humanity from dying out' is an example of a valid justification for not pouring all baby-making resources of one mortal generation into health care for that generation.

Have you ever looked into what's involved with adoption? The incentives are stacked against it. It's time-consuming, it's expensive, there's invasive probing into your background, and there's a great deal of uncertainty involved. You can get some of the money back through a federal tax credit, assuming that your MAGI is low enough, but even with that you're asking someone to take a number of hits in the name of altruism, which is always a tough thing to ask. That's without even taking into account the fact that some people have biological children as a value all by itself, above and beyond merely raising children.

The CDC gives the [[http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/pmss.html][pregnancy related mortality ratio]] as 12.5 deaths per 100,000 live births for white women. (It's even less for women who are young and physically fit.) That means that childbirth carries a 0.0125% chance of death. The cost of surrogacy [[http://www.circlesurrogacy.com/costs][is something like $100,000]]. If I'm unwilling to pay $100,000 for a 0.0125% reduction in the chance of death for my wife, that would mean that I value her life at less than $800 million, which I think is true (especially given that I demonstrably value my own life less than that).

Surrogacy is just as bad in that case. That's perhaps more an argument for why the government should give money for adoption but people do care somewhat about society even if it is just social pressure.

Also that's a remarkably lower risk that I had found when I was researching though I do think you have to consider further complications than just death. I imagine surrogacy has insurance for failed births whereas the emotional cost of that on your wife is likely to be huge. I'm on my phone or I'd be quoting sources (will be at computer soon) but what I read some time ago was 10% under 35 and 25% until 45 irrc for miscarriages.

If you're suggesting that I use the value prior to insurance ... well, let's say that I want to install more energy efficient lighting in my house. I look at the cost and see that it's not worth the energy savings. Then I find that there's a government rebate that cuts the costs in half. Do you think it's rational to skip over doing a new cost-benefit analysis with that rebate in mind? After all, the government (and thus society) is revealing its own preferences by offering the rebate.

Or more to the point, if a birth costs $30,000 but I only have to pay for a fraction of it ... why would I pretend that I have to pay the full cost when I don't?

I was talking about the surrogacy for your own link. I put in that you want to be your own egg donor and yes to everything else. Again that's for US based surrogacy.

Regarding the other stuff, yes I agree you do not have high incentive to care about the cost of a new child on the world, I do not expect many people to be altruistic enough to care about that, however I do my duty as a citizen of the world to mention it. I think there is some social pressure to avoid costing the government hence living off of welfare is frowned upon.

I have real trouble finding total risk of medical complications from pregnancy which you would think would exist already from people who advocated adoption or have the thought that the world is overpopulated.

#+begin_quote
  In the immediate postpartum period, 87% to 94% of women report at least one health problem.[1][2] Long term health problems (persisting after 6 months postpartum) are reported by 31% of women.[3] Severe complications of pregnancy are present in 1.6% of mothers in the US[4] and in 1.5% of mothers in Canada [5]
#+end_quote

But what about child complications? They could be undesirable in ways you can select via adoption, at the very least adopted children will by viable. Then there's another 1.5% chance of getting more than one baby. Then what if you want multiple children? Adopting one and birthing another doesn't seem like the perfect solution when you can adopt siblings for a lot cheaper.

Obviously if your wife is perfect child rearing age then if you're going to do it you should go for it and actually IIRC I think you already said you went for it, but still.

While I may not act in my daily life as rational as I would like I think pregnancy due to its decision scale is something you can apply a $800m self evaluation too.

Let's say you and your wife want to avoid long term health problems. Give it a 30% chance. Assuming all births are otherwise perfect and the child is desirable and lives until adoption age (with a reasonable outlook for the future) and we go to a fairly cheap place for surrogacy but not like India cheap say $30k.

So to avoid long term health complications you're not only looking at a value of $100k (what a nice number), BUT, there are two of you, so you half that to $50k (assuming you both value your wife equally). Are you willing to pay $50k to avoid long term complications? (Ignoring all the costs of actually being pregnant, like physical deformation, etc)

And that's me with five minutes of googling on a subject that determines not only my partners future but mine as well for the next few years.

No human legally born after that mandate ever lacked for the basic needs of life, and none needed to find employment, though many still did to earn enough to pay for their own child, or to afford a slightly less shitty apartment. As humanity's population diminished on the backs of people who didn't care to or weren't able to afford the cost of living for their children, wealth condensed in the smaller remaining pool of people who were driven to succeed and reproduce and take jobs in order to afford children of their own.

And thus, it was their genes and moral values that propagated into the next generation, producing more hard-working people who now could not have their drive to succeed quelled simply by being born with a shitty hand and unable to secure the basic needs of life. Of course, some people didn't want their own biological children, and paying an entire life expectancy is troublesome. What to do if you can only afford sixty years of stipend instead of a hundred twenty?

Pay a diminished stipend, and thaw a middle-aged cryonic survivor.

**** Thaw a middle-aged survivor for what? For fun? Most people who can afford to be cryopreserved die at standard life expectancy. People in their 70's are unlikely to want to go back to work in order to live anywhere above subsistence... and, with the re-training they'd require, few people would be willing to hire them.

Let me ballpark something:

Right now the average lifetime earnings of an individual high school graduate in the US is $1.2 million and the poverty line for a single person is $13,550. Each additional person in the household adds $4780 to that assessment. I don't think $1130 per month is a bad guess at bare basement requirements housing, food, clothing, utilities, and health care and I would agree that, as things stand, housing is the biggest chunk of that so an additional $400 per month for everything else (including a bit of additional space and furniture in the home) isn't insane.

The average American household is 2.58 people, so $13,550 + $4780 + ($4780 x .58) ALL divided by 2.58 = $8179.22 per person per year.

$8179.22 x 120 = $981,506. Having a child would leave the average American with a little more than $200,000 or $2000 a year with which to pay their non-poverty expenses during the 100 or so years they're not living with their parents.

A couple could pool their earnings towards a single child and have $14,000 left over per year together: $7000 per year apiece.

Which assumes they can pay for their child in installments rather than as a lump sum. People tend to earn more money as they age, so the majority of that earning potential is in their adult years rather than their teens, 20s and 30s when (biologically) it's best to have children.

If they actually have to pay the whole million at once, they'll have to live like paupers well into their forties and probably have the child using a surrogate womb and a cryopreserved embryo from their twenties.

If the money can be paid in installments, what happens if parents lose their ability (or desire) to continue paying such a steep price year after year? What if they quit their jobs? Who forces them to pay?

Again, this is just a ballpark so the numbers are almost certainly somewhat inaccurate, but the principle stands. I can /imagine/ an authoritarian nightmare in which your mandatory reversible sterilization plan works, but I don't think I'd like to live there... "in the interest of human rights" or not.

***** Oh, did you want to take over my writing prompt assignment from me? Okay, have fun with that. I was planning on going the route where more resources being available due to underpopulation made things cheaper, where smarter people with more work ethic reproducing made things better. But if you want to write a dystopia instead, don't let me stop you.

*** Since my story prompt response was picked apart, I'll just drop back on the humanist reason to thaw someone.

#+begin_quote
  I'm full of sour grapes when it comes to pulling people up off a cliff, so the urge to write a short and depressing science fiction story about it is pretty tepid.

  That said, I love bald speculation.

  What is a human mind worth? There are billions of them available right now, and while producing new ones is energy and time intensive, people have been doing it casually and more-or-less by default for hundreds of thousands of years. There's such a glut of supply that demand only enters the equation in the rarest of circumstances. Outside of close friends, family, or (extremely rarely) loyal followers... who would want to pull up an adult hanging off a cliff (probably a fatal drop) when there's an enormous stock of children available instead? They're cuter and their brains have a lot more natural potential for neural plasticity.

  Writing prompt: What sort of society has to exist in order that raising children is more difficult and less desired than raising the cliffhangers?

  So far as I can tell it requires the same sort of economic situations that encourages slavery. Regular citizens are unwilling to work a particular class of job or in a particular location. They and their children have the ability to refuse subsistence wages, possibly because an equivalent lifestyle is available to them from the state.

  Which means that even a post-scarcity dystopia isn't going to raise the cliffhangers unless there's no other source of cheap labor: A legally oppressed caste, illegal immigrants, foreigners overseas, robots.

  What would ever make it more worthwhile to spend effort raising the cliffhanger than to spend those same resources enriching the lives of the living and their progeny?

So, different question.

How immoral do you have to be to watch someone struggle, trapped in a freezer, and not unlock the damn door for them? Is it better if they're gagged and paralyzed so they can't scream? Is it better if the death by freezing is happening slower, so you have more time to think about it?

******* Who knows. It just seems like an important distinction to make. I'm way more averse to already existing (even if inactive) intelligent minds being destroyed, than I'm to them never coming into being in the first place. In other words, while I'm quite fine with people not having children, not reviving the corpsicle, given the opportunity, seems like a pretty shady thing to do.

******** There are numerous differences, such as that person's specialized knowledge, living people who would value thawing, and contractual obligations of the policy. There is also the major obstacle of thawing, which is currently unboundedly more expensive than the return gained, due to current impossibility. When thawing becomes cheap enough, I would say it might become necessary to thaw corpsicles (once they are guaranteed to not die longer-term of complications and their various reasons for being frozen in the first place, in other words, when the treatment of those conditions are themselves cheap enough).

**** I am, at this very moment, ignoring the suffering of tens if not hundreds of millions of people whose screams I cannot hear. 15,000 people are born every hour, and 690 of them will die before the age of five.

Even if I felt like I had to help every single one of them on moral grounds, the corpses in freezers would still be last in line. They can wait. That's what they do best.

In fact, I'll go so far as to argue that it may be amoral to resurrect them. What if the freezing or thawing process is not 100% effective and, as a general rule, causes the equivalent of a stroke? Do we wait until we can replace those memories and functions with functional ones? Are we allowed to make those sorts of changes without their consent?

If we figure out how to reanimate the dead but haven't yet solved the problem of aging, a return to life may do irreparable damage to their brains just because they'll start getting older again. Should we resurrect them now, or wait until we can provide them with a perfect body? Or should we wait until we can simply upload their consciousness to a shared virtual reality? Should we "wake" them up to ask, even if there's a chance it will do additional damage now?

Is it legally acceptable to make an Em using their brain pattern and get permission from that simulation? Is it amoral to delete that Em afterwards?

If Ems can be made does the moral imperative to resurrect the meat brain go away?

What does "human rights" even mean?
