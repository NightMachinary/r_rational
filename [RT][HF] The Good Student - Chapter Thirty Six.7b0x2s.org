** Is it just me or is Dizzy about to save Nic's life out of spite?

*** or is she the host for the other demon (as Nic suspects exists at the very end) and being lured?

** I guess the demon loving mage sent from the Royal College is a prime candidate for demon host number two.

Not a big fan of the â€˜actually I kept tabs on every single thing Nic did for five years' reveal.

** Thanks for the chapter!

Two thoughts:

1) Dizzy strongly reminds me of Bakugo from My Hero Academia, for some reason.

2) Shit just got real!

** Finally...finally we're getting somewhere.

The setup is good in this fic, but...it takes way too long. If the author could figure out how to be more concise with the worldbuilding, this story would be a lot more popular than it is right now.

*** You'd think that, but every time I spend time on moving the plot forward I get a ton of complaints about not having more lessons about made up wars and where magic came from. The worldbuilding is by far the most popular thing in the story. People are weird.

**** Really? I'll admit, that takes me by surprise.

Though it could be because of new readers coming in and reading all your chapters at once. Reading your story all in one go is like reading a completely different book, in a good way. Worldbuilding chapters do not make for good web-serial type releases.

Hell, I think I'll do a reread of your story once this arc finished. I get the feeling I'm gonna like it a lot. Keep up the good work.

P.S. I /love/ the interactions between the Fanny, Davo, Nic, and even Brill. That is by far the favorite part of my whole story, keep it up!

***** I mean, the story is called "The Good Student". Nice solving problems by being a good student is what was so enticing about the early chapters. Adventuring and beating up demons can be gotten in plenty of other stories. People want to focus on what is unique about this story.
