** I love Fine Structure. It goes over a lot of the implications of superheros, has smart characters trying to figure out a puzzle, and features many cool things. Fine Structure was sort of bolted together from a lot of different short stories, and you can sometimes tell, but it's overall pretty great.

Edit: Man, I've been rereading this, and I'd firstly forgotten how much it jumps around, but secondly forgotten how awesome it is. The story [[#s][]]. The asynchronous storytelling works really well here, though I suppose I'd like a definitive guide to when all this takes place. Maybe I'll write one if I can't find one.

*** Oh god though, let me just say thought that when I read /Marooned/, one of the plausibly canonical deleted chapters in the Appendices -- oh gosh. [[#s][]]

/Fine Structure/ is truly a beautiful story, and I like it a lot lot lot better than /Ra/ (though I suppose it's not fair comparing a finished story to an in-progress one). I hope that he does the promised edits before he starts his next project.
