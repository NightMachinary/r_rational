Hey all. I finished Gardens of the Moon by Steven Erickson and was hoping to discuss some things about it with others here, as it was from this subreddit it was recommended.

Firstly, Circlebreaker is with Kal, Croakus, Absalom, and Fiddler in the epilogue. Is he Fiddler or was my brain just making connections due to the audiobook being a different format?

Was Circlebreaker ever mentioned by name in book one or is that in later books?

Was Parron's brush with Ascendency when he channeled the hounds or was it another time?

Ascendants are mortals that have become Gods? Has Ralick become an ascendant?

Is the goddess of darkness/shadow from another dimension? That's where the people of Anamander Rake (tister ande) are from right?

Who are your favorite characters from book 1?

Sorry for any spelling mistakes. I have read the book in a physical format. Just audiobook. I plan on going over the reread over at Tor sometime later this week.


** Trying hard to remember everything. Circle breaker is not fiddler, he's just a guy from darujistan. Ralick nom is definitely not an ascendant, and paran's brush with ascendancy starts with getting the blood of the hounds on him. Mother dark is from the realm of the tiste, just like all the other elves.

Ascendants aren't quite gods. Both are powerful and immortal but ascendants don't have a religion tied to them. There might be something else to it I can't remember though.

And I liked adjunct lorn the best, I wished she stuck around longer. Her journey with tool was my favourite part of the book.

*** I liked Gardens of the moon quite a bit, though it took me two tries to get through it, and after that I just couldn't handle book 2, assholes in a desert was too much for me I didn't like the prospect of continuing a book in with I liked /none/ of the characters.

***** The series jumps around a lot. It can be frustrating sometimes because you grow to love the ones you are with, but the sheer number of amazing characters makes it worth it as you get to the end.

** It has been over a year since I read MBoTF so my memory might be a bit hazy.

Circle breaker is not a major character as far as I can remember, I don't even remember the name.

Parans path did to Ascendancy did start with bathing/absorbing the blood of the Hounds of Shadows, this turned him into a soletaken, which are basically werebeasts as in they have a beast form.

Ascendants are those who have transcended mortality, as in they have hit the level cap if you think of it in game terms, they are the strongest players other than the gods and most of them are incredibly long lived or ridiculously powerful but not yet gods, they can probably turn into gods if they develop a religion and get enough worshippers. Also the Deck of Dragons plays a part in kind of selecting ascendants, as most of the powerful ascendants are tied to a card in the deck.

And yes the goddess of Darkness is from the realm of Tiste Andii

My favourite characters are Ganoes Paran and Rallick Nom
