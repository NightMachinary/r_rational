** It's a compelling story but deeply non [[/r/rational][r/rational]], i.e. the moral determined how the plot flowed which determined if the technobable worked.

** EY recommended the manga adaptation [[http://hpmor.com/notes/98/][back in August 2013]].

This has been available since October, but only recently did the ebook versions appear.

** I read the manga. I wasn't impressed. As I understand it, the author took high-level concepts and used them as fodder for new age technobabble, with poorly-understood quantum mechanics acting as plot handwavium. ("I don't have to explain anything. A quantum did it.")

*** As someone who used to believe in New Age pseudoscience, this manga has nothing to do with that. It's still super weird and utilizes quantum phenomena in absurd ways, but I didn't get the impression that the story was intentionally spreading nonsense ideas that it expected to be taken seriously. I think it just uses philosophical discussions related to quantum mechanics to tell a weird sci-fi story, though I thought it started going downhill after the major character death and never finished it.

*** Yup, that was my impression too. I first thought of delaying the read until I understood more of quantum interpretations, but then I said, whatever, I'll enjoy it right now. Given what you said, I don't regret my decision.

** My absolute favorite manga! Would definitely recommend this as at least rat-adjacent fiction.

** Would absolutely recommend, although I did not finish it because it wasn't finished. Really, very interesting.
