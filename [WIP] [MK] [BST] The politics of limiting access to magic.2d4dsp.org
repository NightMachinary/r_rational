I'm in the process of writing a Fantasy book, which will be the first in a series. It's going well. However, I have one aspect of the world building where I think it would be very advantageous to get the input of a few of you nice and useful people.

Anyone can learn magic in my world, and magic can get really powerful compared to most settings, and in particular it can all too easily be turned to very destructive ends. Important to the world history is a great war which almost ended in man made omnicide. In the wake of that war the nations of the world have grown extremely paranoid of anyone trying to learn too much magic (or science, which can lead to magical /research/, god forbid). It is now 300 years since the end of the magical world war, and every single country in the world very heavily regulates who is allowed to learn magic. There is some variation in how countries handle who is allowed to learn magic /within/ the country, but there very much also needs to be at least a continent wide treaty regulating how many new magicians each country is allowed to train each year, what they are allowed to learn, etcetera. This is where I would like your input. I suspect that I may leave my world politics open to munchkinry, and I want to make the little the reader is explicitly told about it is as realistic as possible. I have gotten largely as far as this, wrapped up in long words of course:

1) If anyone is found to train too many magicians, all the other countries will band together and eradicate the guilty party.

2) How many magicians a country is allowed to train in a year is not dependent on how many people live in that country, because that would allow large kingdoms to grow larger. Instead, every year the countries negotiate and determine a 'minimum' number of magicians which each country is allowed to train. Any country wishing to train more may do so, but for every extra magician they wish to train they have to pay compensation to all the other countries, and the cost goes up alarmingly quickly for every extra magician they wish to train.

3) Whether a magician dies old or young matters not; one trained magician is one trained magician. This means that if you go to war you are going to lose some of your very expensive to replace magicians.

4) Magicians captured must either be killed or paid for as though you had trained them yourself. Same for any magicians that you allow to migrate to your country.

5) Anyone who learns magic without permission must be killed or, if that is their only crime and you are feeling merciful, sent to live out the rest of their life in a monastery/prison colony, preferably in one of the other countries. Or you can pay for them. Which might be feasible if their family is incredibly rich.

6) Negotiations take place in a magical location where anyone who utters a lie immediately and unavoidably dies. Though the rulers of every nation do not have to personally attend the negotiations every year, the heads of noble families, sovereigns and other rich and powerful individuals are expected to attend at least every decade or so, and to explicitly state that they have not broken the treaty or suspected anyone else in their kingdom of doing so.

7) While the magical location /can/ be tricked, it will kill you the second you believe that what you utter is not as certain to be true as you state it to be. You could break the treaty the day after swearing on it, but you couldn't swear on it if you /expected/ that you would then go on to break it. In addition, the laws of nature are layered in my world, and it is not currently possible to use magic to fiddle with people's minds/implant/remove memories. This will change in later books, but by then everything is going to hell for other reasons.

8) While it's theoretically possible that new countries might form and join the treaty, the magical location is very useful for finding out if those seeking to lead the new country are too close to any of the old countries (Puppet regimes get shot).

9) Everyone knows that if the treaty breaks down and every country starts pumping out a hundred times as many magicians as before, everything is going to go to hell and whatever remains of their kingdoms at the end of the inevitable war, it is unlikely they themselves or anyone in their family survives, because walls and fortresses are about as useful against a legion of magicians as they would be against as many cannons and catapults.

*So. Dear [[/r/rational]], how would you go about shifting the balances of political power/training too many magicians/learning too much magic in this world?* Other than assassinating as many foreign magicians as you can get away with on pure principle and auctioning off 'your' rights to learn magic to the wealthy within your own country, I mean. Not every country is explicitly a signatory to the treaty, though every country on the main continent is, and other countries know that if they train too many themselves the main continent kingdoms (where the vast majority of my world's inhabitants live) will band together and wipe them out. Population density for the most part is lower than dark age Europe, and outlaws do sometimes form small societies in the wilderness. However, limited as the legal magicians are in number, there are enough of them to send armies to eradicate any group in the wilderness suspected of training themselves in magic, should they be perceived as a growing threat. Oh, and magicians can identify other magicians on sight, because they get a little magical glow around them that only magicians can see.

Thank you for your time. The plot is quite planned out; I'm simply trying to make sure that, before the events that get the plot balls rolling, the politics of my world look stable and without glaring exploitable holes.


** Hm. Interesting setting, I'll look forward to reading it.

Here are my thoughts:

- Magicians can identify each other /on sight/. How do they detect, at long range, when another country is training extra mages?
- How long does it take to train a mage?
- How do you capture a mage if they are as powerful as you say?
- Is there any reason that you can't hire/acquire enemy mages wholesale -- pay them, blackmail them, enchant them, whatever? Ideally, before the war officially starts -- bring their loyalty to your side, but leave them in place so that no one knows they are now yours. Also, this means they make great intelligence agents, assassins, and sleeper agents.
- What happens if a ruler can't show up at the moot? If he's sick, or too far away, or currently kidnapped, what happens?

Depending on the answers to the above, I suspect that there is a tipping point where, when a particular country gets enough mages, they can quickly conquer their largest neighbor, gobble up THEIR mages, and go on to conquer the next, etc. If the other nations are fast enough they could stop this march, but in practice it could happen within days -- attack every other nation at once, destabilize all of them so they cannot coordinate counterattacks, then go back and gobble them down at your leisure.

Personally, I would not use battlefield tactics for this. There would be no giant army marching up where you could shoot at my mages. I would use blitzkrieg decapitation strikes: [[http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?222007-The-Definitive-Guide-to-the-Tippyverse-By-Emperor-Tippy][teleport into their capital]], kill the rulers, poison the wells, use magic to spread disease, kill all the competent military leaders and leave the incompetent ones alive. While you're at it, be sure to kill off any very loyal special shock troops that might be a problem for you. (If this sounds exactly like what I had Albrecht in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9669819/39/The-Two-Year-Emperor][The Two Year Emperor]] threaten to do, it's because it is.)

As to how you train enough mages to get past the tipping point: a loyal and ambitious subminister sets up a training college way off in the woods somewhere without talking to the king about it. The place is probably in the Arctic or on another continent to make it harder for other nations to find; mages can teleport, so distance doesn't matter, only concealment. (If there is no range restriction on teleportation, then a moon colony or orbital platform is also an option.) The ruler never knows anything about it until his loyal consigliere comes to him and says "hey, boss, guess what? We have 100,000 mages over our limit and no one else knows about them." Once that happens, the ruler pretty much HAS to start conquering everything in sight -- he can't pay the fines for that many mages, he can't hide the fact that he has them once the next moot occurs, and the mages are apt to take offence if he starts trying to kill or banish all of them.

Your point #9 (people know that if they break the treaty everything goes to hell) is either sufficient or irrelevant. If everyone believes that, then there will never be a problem. If anyone fails to believe it, then they will seek the advantage. It's a Prisoner's Dilemna situation -- if everyone always cooperates, all is good. If anyone defects, things get nuts.

Alternatively, the under minister (Al) wants to be king, so he sets the current ruler (Bob) up as a patsy -- Al trains the mages and then starts using them against other countries. At first Bob looks like the guilty party and war breaks out. Someone might be rational enough to get Bob to the moot site and lie detector him, but someone won't be. Once fighting breaks out, you are likely to have a feud situation -- everyone would be better off if the fighting stopped, but there's too much bad blood.

*** I shall have to read The Two Year Emperor. I should have mentioned however that in my world teleportation does not exist, because if it did the last world war would have ended in a sea of nuclear fire.

Replies to bullet points:

1: Indirectly, by making leaders swear in the magical location that so far as they know, there are no extra magicians being trained. As long as all major leaders know they can't get away with cheating, any upstarts trying to build an army in secret can be dealt with as soon as found. And there are of course spies for all the usual reasons, and some of these are magicians.

2: A few years. You could train a very dangerous few trick pony in one year, but they wouldn't be very dangerous to someone who's been a magician for a few years more. Ten years will see them about as good with magic as they'll get, but that's in large part because all the really cool stuff is buried under three hundred years of paranoid blanket bans and religious prohibitions.

3: You mostly don't. You kill them. In a fight between anything near equals, it's much more likely that both die than that one manages to capture the other alive.

4: You could certainly subvert/bribe/blackmail enemy magicians. The problem would come if they became officially yours and you had to pay for them or if you conquered the enemy state and suddenly had to pay for all the magicians they had at once. Other countries would not let you get away with doubling your number of magicians, nor with installing a puppet regime.

5: Other countries would get really suspicious and start to investigate very thoroughly. Leaders do not have to come every year, but if you were supposed to come and you don't, all your neighbours are going to start trading intelligence with each other.

Blitzkrieg decapitation would indeed be the way to go. Unfortunately, in my world offense is so /very/ much stronger than defense that even if you have the military might to decapitate every country around you simultaneously there are going to be enough individuals and small groups left who are after your head that your seat of power is going to turn into slag. It's not /impossible/ to take over the world, but it's going to take more than a really sneaky, well educated ruler to do it. In the case of my final villains, what it takes is a few bat shit sociopath scientists willing to turn their soldiers into scientists and a /really/ good PR machine.

During the course of the plot some the layers of my laws of nature are peeld back, and we get magical plagues, mind control, resurrections, magical genetic engineering, cults, bending and breaking space, time manipulation (though no travelling backwards in time, good gods that would just break everything into little pieces), prophecies, weather manipulation, the destructon of souls, /actual/ magically binding oaths, etc etc.

Point 9 was mostly just to say that most leaders are sufficiently certain that they would lose in the long run if they chose to betray, though from time time someone tries to cheat and so far they have all been stopped long before they could take on the rest of the continent.

Phew, long reply. Thank you for making me formulate this.

Hang on though, this doesn't speak to my point. My suggestion was that an official one or two ranks below the king would start training mages /without telling the king/. That way the king can honestly swear at the moot that he is not training any extra mages, that his totals are within expected bounds. Once the nation has built up a decisive advantage, off you go.

Hm, ok, then you need to be a combination of Otto von Bismarck and Cardinal Richelieu -- you form alliances with other nations to keep people off /your/ back, and you trick other nations into going to war with each other. Arrange for the mages of other nations to be assassinated, preferably in ways that look like accidents. Failing the "accidents" route, cast the blame on one of your enemies. Once you've eliminated enough enemy mages, you decapitate /the mages/, not the political rulers.

Would they be good enough that an assassin trained with a couple of tricks could take out a more powerful mage? Transmute his wine into poison (or liquid gold, or whatever), conjure grease under his feet as he's going down a long, steep staircase, arrange for something heavy to fall on him...?

You've said that magical defense is not terribly strong, at least proportionately. Is that just against magical attacks? Vlad Taltos once remarked “No matter how subtle the wizard, a knife between the shoulder blades will seriously cramp his style.” Is that true? If so, poison or an arrow should do just fine and could be done by a mundane, so there's no 'mageglow' to give him away.

Both of the combatants estimate their position to be superior prior to battle and engage.

The same logic can be applied to medieval land battles. Why would you engage in a battle if you'd estimated you'll lose? You wouldn't (unless your goal is something other than victory of course). Battles happen when both sides feel confident in victory. Castles, on the other hand, can't run away when you bring a superior force against them, which might explain the ratio of sieges to land battles.

******** First line is correct. Damage over time can be inflicted, but is more often self inflicted. Duels tend to be fast, but in a large scale battle there is no point at which your body tells you "Boss, if you don't stop using magic now you'll die", but using and holding magic does damage the body, so if you go on fighting until you keel over from exhaustion you won't faint, you'll die. Think of holding magic like being pricked with a needle every few seconds. Slightly painful, but the blood loss is almost harmless. Only, if you keep taking that small damage all the time you'll eventually sustain so much damage that even though you can keep going right now, you have already passed the threshold where you may die from the injury.

******* There are two reasons why duels (which are rare as a result) tend to be mutually deadly. First, if both our shields crumble at the first attack, both our first attacks strike home. You can build up a fairly strong shield if you have time, but if you split your attention between attacking immediately and raising a bare bones defense at the same time and your opponent does the same, well then both of your shields will crumble and you'll both have a lightning bolt/ball of fire hot enough to melt armour thrown at you. Not always deadly, but pretty damn dangerous. Second, there's always the chance that your enemy hates you enough that they would be willing to die to kill you, and full attack will absolutely destroy the sort of defense you could set up while simultaneously attacking. Outside of a duel defense can be actually useful, but if you both go into a one on one with no shield up, the first attack can be deadly. To contrast - a mock duel would involve spending at least 20 seconds building up a shield before the fight starts, and whoever first scratches this (inner) shield wins.

That could work. There is the risk of discovery, but with a little luck or a lot of careful planning, this could actually be pulled off. It would still probably result in the death of anyone related to the ruler when enemy nations go into revenge mode, but it could certainly result in a very destructive war where you have the advantage.

This happens a lot. Rulers seldom take it as far as trying for world domination, but they certainly seek to indirectly decrease the number of enemy magician, the more so as magicians tend to be the rich, educated and powerful in every nation.

Yes. Assassination is the favoured way of getting rid of magicians, because although very powerful, they can't keep their defenses and enhanced senses up all day (magic is too draining for that), and when not wielding magic they are as vulnerable as anyone else. Transmutation is much weaker, slower and more limited than in HPMOR, but assassinations happen with frequency.

Correct. A very good healer may be able to guard against most poisons, but a knife in the back will kill them dead. You better hope you get them in the heart, though, because even if they are mortally wounded, a few seconds is all they would need to lash out at their assassin and murder them with fire.

Duels are pretty rare. In anything outside of a formal one on one battle, whoever strikes first usually wins. Like soldiers with rocket launchers and machine guns, a duel is going to get very ugly, but in the battlefield whoever first gets a shot in wins. Magicians do have /some/ chance of surviving attacks, but it's going to take several seconds to build up a shield that deflect an attack conjued in only one. On the other hand, it's easier to spend minutes building up a shield than it is to spend minutes building up a magical attack. In the heat of combat dodging is the way to go, but if you have much more experience than the opponent or you /greatly/ outnumber them, shields can work.

It depends on how well you can lie and dissemble afterwards, and how unsubtle you are about it. Destroying the reputation of the truth chamber -- or hell, destroying the chamber itself -- would be a good start.

I'd probably try to instigate unrest in countries I want to weaken, then insert magicians posing as rebels. Once everything goes to hell, I move in to "impose order". Depending on how much aggressive expansion I want to rack up, I'd either install a puppet government in my wake or seize territory directly. Probably the latter, since they'll get a legitimate bank of magicians that I could then call upon.

It's a good plan, but the minute you get a big war going everyone is going to rush to the location to assure each other that they are not involved, and let's cooperate to find out what happened. Unluckily (Luckily?) the location can't be destroyed without completing a long and difficult quest involving breaking an extremely powerful seal and then figuring out exactly what sort of fairytale logic the place is operating on. Merely breaking the seal would permanently upset the balance of power in the world and enable ungodly levels of munchkinry as more powerful magic became available.

This will of course happen in the course of the books, because seals are there to be broken.

** You've actually got an interesting balance going on between small and large countries there. The reason that the United States has a bicameral system is to balance the large states (favored by the House of Representatives because representation is proportional) against the small states (favored by the Senate because representation is based on statehood).

With an agreed-upon number of mages being static per country you're favoring the small countries, but assuming that the "pay-for-more-mages" rate is the same for every country you're favoring the large countries since the /n/th mage past the limit is going to require far less of a percentage of their GDP. A consequence of this is that large counties are going to have more mages unless they're broke, while small countries will probably still have more mages per capita, which seems like it would work out rather fairly. And obviously when it comes time to renegotiate the treaty, the two biggest numbers at the table are going to be the number of mages that each country gets /and/ the exponent used for determining the cost of the /n/th mage.

So with that said, here are some thoughts and questions:

- It's not clear from your rules whether we're allowed to go to war or not. So long as we're not violating the treaty in some way, war is still fair game, right? You would want to avoid it in the hopes that you didn't lose any mages, naturally, but I just want to be clear on that. (In theory, both sides could sign a war treaty that stated that they wouldn't use mages in the war, thereby setting up some game theory.)

- Since the limit is on "number of mages trained per year" and not "total number of mages", you would want to train mages from a very young age, ensure their happiness so they don't defect, and keep them in good health.

- There's also probably some trickery with the language to "trained" so that I could in theory train up a whole bunch of not-quite mages who have a very good grasp on the theory without actually knowing anything practical. That would allow pushing hundreds of people to become mages in a short period of time if someone else broke the treaty.

- How long does it take to train a mage to be battle-ready? That seems hugely important. Months? Years? Decades?

- Death by lies seems very harsh, and like something that you'd be able to abuse if you were clever. To kill someone, you only need to instill enough doubt in them that they don't want to say what they have to, or that the place kills them. It also seems to favor the sort of person who can doublethink or at least change their convictions on a dime.

- Amnesty programs aren't worth running if you need to pay for the mages that defect into your country or have been training illegally. That's probably the point, since otherwise you would have an incentive to encourage illegal training for later amnesty. Really, the limit isn't so much on "trained mages" it's on "newly acquired mages".

*** Interesting about the US. I'm from Sweden, so not entirely up on how that worked, but the comparison seems to work. There is indeed that interesting balance going on between the countries.

1: War is allowed. It's just that, if you do capture any significant amount of land all the other countries are going to start forcing you to declare just how many magicians you captured, and how you'll pay for them. In reality most magicians are wealthy nobility, and would much rather help you pay to keep them alive than have you be forced to execute them. Magician-less warfare does indeed happen, because common soldiers are much cheaper to replace.

2: You would indeed. My nobility has it pretty good. It's common to start training around age ten, though it can vary.

3: It's common to select the most intelligent and skilled soldiers to be trained in magical theory to gauge who might be more suited, but the amount of time you could save is not a lot, since growing in magical strength is as much about training your 'magic muscle' (Which is your whole body) as it is about specific knowledge. Still, they'll take 'a little' over 'nothing'.

4: Years. Ten years will get them as far as they'll go, one year is enough to make them clearly superior to any non-magician.

Impossible without first destroying five god made, almost indestructible locations which rely on fairytale logic: Destroying souls, breaking space (Portals - these are... extremely energy intensive, delicate and slow to make, so not very abusable anyway), creating new life from scratch, 'looking' through time, most transmutation, the most part of riding the winds of Destiny, scrying.

Impossible without first disabling one very powerful man-made seal: Mind control, most mind reading, raising the dead, creating new life through rape (Affects even non-magicians), bending space, bending time, prophecy, magical genetic engineering, most magical healing, basic transmutation, large scale weather control, the remaining influence of Destiny.

This leaves a force of nature that can be harnessed to do most things, and limits are more often legal or skill related than limitations on the magic itself. You can do basic mind reading, although it's very hard to get deeper than current physical sensations + conscious surface thoughts. You can chuck lightning, melt metal, chuck fire, do very slow and basic healing (no regrowing limbs). You can make illusions, but if the target is a magician as good as you, they'll easily make out that what they are seeing is magical and insubstantial. Still, a very light touch you might get away with - my main character changes his eye colour, and the magical touch is so light that it can't be made out against the background glow of his magical abilities. You can greatly enhance your senses, moderately enhance your physical prowess and stamina, you can disable your nerves (so shut down pain), you can manipulate and falsify physical sensation. You can manipulate temperature. You can create and manipulate local wind. You can delve the earth or other matter and gain some sense of what lies within (Though you couldn't use it to spy on a fellow magician without them sensing it). You can pull and push with great strength at a distance. You can create shields. Attacking is almost always stronger than defense, but then you may be able to just tilt the trajectory of the attack, making it easier for you to dodge it with your somewhat enhanced speed and agility. You can /somewhat/ speed up natural growth and healing, although there is a great taboo against speeding up the growth of even animals, let alone humans. Increasing crop yield is mostly accomplished by murdering insects and parasites and by making sure the plants get as much water and nutrition as they require. If you are desperate, you could also spend long hours creating artificial sunlight for them, but magicians tend to be far too rich and important to condescend to such work.

Anything else? I'm likely to have forgotten some. There aren't 'spells' in my world, simply a force of nature that can be harnessed, although /researching/ magic is what led to the almost omnicide 300 years ago, so that's a good way to get yourself assassinated by your countrymen.

******* While the man made seal stands, that is correct. Rape by deception can still lead to pregnancy, but the people who put the seal together went out of their way to prevent the most insanely evil leaders from just kidnapping people and breeding them. I don't think this part of the seal will ever come up in the book, it will just be implied. The protection ceases when the seal falls.

The terms: 'destroying reality' simply means that in order to completely shut down 'normal physics' etc you would have to obliterate the world of humans. Short of that you might fiddle with it temporarily and locally, but it will tend to revert to how it was first set.

The winds of destiny is just... Well, the world itself seems to /want/ certain things. Chance subtly conspires to encourage certain developments. Mostly what destiny seems to want is large empires and larger wars. The gods when they were alive tried to limit this influence as much as possible, and in their death laid down a seal that very much weakened its influence. The human made seal eventually shut down what little influence remained. The more these seals were to weaken, the more fate would become a real concern. 'Riding the winds of Destiny' simply means abusing the hell out of this in order to make sure that the best way for destiny to accomplish what it wants is to help you with your ambitions.

Bending space and time would be speeding up/slowing down local time and stretching space. Both of these are incredibly powerful and not currently possible, although they both become possible and extremely exploitable over the course of the series.

Huh.

My definition of rape is "sex where one party did not consent" (which I think is nearly the same as "one party does not want it to be happening" but also includes elements of "one party is not /able/ to consent, due to underage / mental deficiency / drunk / drugged, etc, as well as elements of "would not have consented if they'd had all the information")

It seems to me that this seal must have some sort of judgement -- it must be able to analyze the mental state of everyone who is having sex, determine if one of them is unwilling and then determine if one of them is too young for good judgement / under the influence / mentally deficient. It would also need to determine if one of the people was being tricked into having sex. If it finds a person like that, it prevents the pregnancy.

That seems to require a consciousness to me -- is the seal self-aware in your world? That would be really cool if it were -- a conversation with something like that would be fascinating. Although it would also meancould a rapist try to talk to the seal and convince it that this wasn't rape. Which is a bit grimdark, but would be an interesting story event.

An unconscious or unwilling participant does not reach out with their soul to touch the other, while a naive child being tricked by flattery and lies does. Similarly, if I'm a magician and I make myself look like someone's husband, well the wife may be deceived and act as though I was the husband. Thus, the seal does not protect the deceived or the too young, but it does prevent an unwilling soul from being /forced/ to take part in the fusion.

But this aspect of the seal is mainly in place because it seemed to make sense when I decided on the rest of what it did, and while my books get pretty dark eventually, there will be little need for my characters to worry about any of this.

***** My apologies - duels between anything near equals are often mutually lethal because you are not allowed to prepare beforehand, but outside of those a magician with a clear advantage can usually kill an inferior with only moderate danger to themselves. A (young) teenager going up against their parent (Likely with 15+ years more experience) is going to get one of three results:

1) They chicken out, because their parent is so strong that they can't beat them without making it very obvious that they are trying to murder their liege and parent.

2) Their parent destroys their defenses with non-lethal attacks and injures them. When you lose concentration while holding magic in my world, you lose control of the magic, which immediately tears itself free and exits your body with zero regards for your health. Which hurts a /lot/ and can severely injure you if you were holding much magic. A teenager that experiences this is going to have days or a week of lying in bed thinking about how much they want to avoid it happening again. In real combat, an attack that takes your hand off when you are holding as much magic as you can is going to result in your own magic killing you from within, leaving a charred and blistered corpse that died screaming. Those with only a year or three of training have the advantage of not being able to hold enough magic within themselves that they would die if they lost control of it.

3) The teenager draws in much more magic than they can safely hold, which does mean they could probably kill their parent, but which also means that they are doing so much damage to their untrained body that they may die regardless of the outcome of the fight.

If you deliberately suicide bomb, you can take out someone much stronger than you. If you wish to survive, you are either going to settle for attacking someone much weaker than you or attack either when they are not prepared or when you yourself have some other significant advantage. If both parties are somewhere near equal and similarly prepared, yes, they will likely both die, and either would be unlikely to have time to retreat. Magicians avoid fair fights like the plague, therefore.

You would be replacing the aristocracy of arms with the aristocracy of magic pretty darn fast, and this is going to be blatantly obvious to any noble because they think in terms of force, plot and coup constantly. This means that no limit to numbers that does not allow the entire nobility of a given country to become mages themselves will be acceptable to said aristocracy.

This is terribly implausible. Sure, it's hard for a ruler of something the size of Germany, France, or the Holy Roman Empire to have that power, but for a smaller country like the Netherlands where you can safely get the entire first tier of nobility into a guarded room, you don't have to be terribly strong.

And with an advantage like perfect coordination, you can grow rapidly, meaning that there will be more power to go around, so having them agree should be pretty easy. And as you conquer new territories, adding any new nobility to the system is fairly easy. At which point you get, within a generation, a large country where it's an established norm that the entire nobility is required to visit the truth space with the king regularly, without any egregiously powerful king.

Can a group of 5-1000 mages live independently in the wilderness in relative comfort while still increasing in power? This would make it very hard to track them down, as a support structure is not needed.

Is magic good for making money? This would lead to semi-exponential growth in the number of mages that a country buys, as they can pay for themselves.

What is the extent of magic's intelligence and counterintelligence capabilities (divination and illusion)? If divination isn't powerful enough, then finding out about the other countries' actions would be very difficult.

You can indeed live out in the wilderness, but while magic can increase crop yields, it can't conjure food out of thin air.

Magic is very good for making money, but the exponential price increase is extremely punishing.

Divination: No scrying, unreliable prophecy, illusions useless against magicians of equal skill. A fully trained magician would very much lament the loss of their eyes. And they couldn't even regrow those, unless they were one of the very best healers in history.

** Depending on how magic is learned, a useful strategy could be to train mock-mages who understand the mechanics but haven't actually wielded the power, and thus do not give off the glow. To make an example from HP, people who've been given wands without power cores, and then taught to cast spells. Technically, they haven't used magic, but as soon as they've got a power core, they're off to the races.

Past that, this magical location thing, how hard is it to set up, and is the lie detector's death function separate from its killing function? Because barring extreme difficulty to create, I fail to see how every ruler wouldn't have a ceremonial room for accepting oaths of loyalty, nobles protests be damned (since you'd only need one iteration of the full-loyalty test, and then hey, nobody cares anymore because they're all loyal). Or a courthouse that can determine the truth of every statement. Killing might be going a bit far, but if everyone can tell when you're lying, either you need to doublespeak like a boss, or you wouldn't commit crime (or be disloyal) in the first place.

As far as wild mages go, the limits on divination and training time are the two most pressing concerns. Could I set sail for the middle of the ocean, get out of range, then train mages fast enough to supply food and water to the ship? How accurate are the divinations at finding wild mages?

The ocean would not work for a training ground because there are sea monsters that are drawn to magic like moths to a flash light, but you could set up camp out in the middle of the wilderness somewhere. Magic wouldn't let you conjure up free food, but it would certainly increase food production significantly. By the time your community was large enough to hold a whole army, though, you'd probably have been found. But hey, maybe not - there /have/ been world wars before where millions of magicians have existed at the same time. They just didn't end so well for anone who helped start them. There's no remote sensing magic other than very unpredictable prophecy, and even that is currently shut down because of man made extra laws of nature that stop some of the more powerful magic.

Training mock mages works to some small extent, but most of the training is really just slowly learning to handle more power without dying in terrible agony.

** What kind of government are we talking here? For me the term "Kingdom" implies hereditary monarchy. The question becomes not how to breed mages, but how to exploit feudal system to your advantage in this case.

Some other pertinent questions in no particular order:

How frequent are military conflicts? How loyal are mages in a given kingdom? How easy is communication between mages (intra- and inter-kingdom), is there a common language? How about magical encryption of communication? How significant is trade between countries? How long do people live? Is culture in the old kingdoms stagnant or is there any kind of social and cultural development? What happens when there is a rebellion in one given kingdom? What about a feudal power struggle? A pretender to the throne?

Basically, I think your kind of system should really be exploited not based on acquiring numerous mages in secret, but either by cultural and social means (establish some kind of virulent international ideology to unite kingdoms) or by political means.

You could always go for a quick and dirty "assassinate top three (or two, if short on manpower) layers of feudal hierarchy in every country" plan. I doubt the political system would return to equilibrium in a hurry after that kind of shake-up. No threat of everyone uniting to curb stomp you if every count is fighting to be the next king.

*** This is exactly the sort of comment I was hoping to get.

Hereditary monarchy is the norm. Military conflicts are common, although one kingdom entirely conquering another is very rare, because there comes a point where the enemy leadership just says "Fuck it, I'm going to take my best magicians and just break through your lines and turn your capitol into into slag."

Magicians are mostly the nobility and the very wealthy "Hey, I'll pay enough for you to pay the extra cost to the other countries /and/ enough to bribe you to let me have that extra spot". A few magicians are trained because they are the most gifted and loyal soldiers. Everyone who knows magic has a lot to lose then, and have a vested interest in keeping society relatively stable.

Communication is mostly fairly slow. There are telegraphs, but they run on magic and are require constant upkeep, so they are more rare and shorter range than they were in the real world. Spies do exist in every country, and a lot of trade vessels have a magician onboard to help create artificial winds when necessary.

There is a common language on the main continent. The worst you'll encounter is the difference between the US and Scotland as far as accent goes. Even when talking is difficult you can always communicate in writing, with only minor differences in spelling. Lands further away do have completely different languages, but diplomats are always on hand for the leaders, and magic regulation is thoroughly discussed, with extreme prejudice against any leaders whose accounts differ from spy reports.

No magical encryption of communication, I think. I have no idea how that would work. Mundane codes and encryptions exist and are used.

Trade is very significant, and spies and wind making magicians are common on such vessels.

People live as long as in the real world. High infant mortality rates amongst the poor, a solid 70+ life expectancy amongst the wealthy. Magical healing is not great, but it's around where medicine was 150 years ago.

Culture is relatively stable. There is some regional stagnation and some regional cultural development. Most notably the religions are very static and strongly opposed to magical and technological innovation.

When there is a rebellion surrounding countries make very certain that no extra magicians are trained, or they step in and take the side of whoever did not break the rules. This gives an enormous advantage to the king, who is the one who decides who is allowed to learn magic. Coups and assassinations are much more common than open rebellion.

Powerful noble families do squabble for power, and while assassinations are illegal they do happen. Rulers don't like losing magicians, but then rulers don't always get everything they want.

Pretenders to the throne, and cases where it's not clear who has the 'right' to the throne get interesting. It might be necessary for other countries to intervene and to force a discussion to take place in the magical location. At other times it becomes a 'mandate of heaven' deal where kingship is 'earned' by securing it. Other countries of course love to help someone win these struggles, since then they can secure favours from their new ally. Straight up puppet regimes do get found out in the magical location though, and then you get war.

Cultural and social manipulation does happen, and in fact the 'static, innovation hating' churches are the prime example of one of my ancient, long dead villains poisoning the waters after she realised she was going to lose.

Anarchy is frowned upon, and a kingdom that collapses will either be gobbled up by neighbours or forced to resolve themselves without training new magicians (With rule breaking factions being wiped out be other kingdoms). It's rare and gets pretty ugly, and the plot will include the main character's country turning into a very ugly mess indeed.

**** You've got an interesting world there. Here are some more questions and musings to help you iron it out:

Low population density. Are we talking here something like middle ages here in terms of population distribution? Most of population in agriculture? How about cities? Judging by how important you say trade is, I'd say there should be significant portion of population in cities engaged in producing those trade goods. Is there a printing press equivalent (as in relatively cheap, available, scalable copying of printed information)?

Answers to these questions should probably be enough to get a feel for the structure of society and formulate some more effective strategies, but going from what you've revealed thus far I have this one:

It's usually a safe bet that lower and middle class are going to secretly (or openly) hate nobility in that kind of society. Not only you have all the reasons from real world feudal societies, but on top of that they see nobility having magical powers which are pretty much forever out of their grasp. Your religion probably has significant influence as well and no doubt some anti-magic memes seeped into it over time. So my proposal is this: capitalise on hate and mistrust peasantry has for nobility using church as leverage.

Depending on the goals one could probably just convince and manipulate the current rulers into going along, but that's hardly munchkinry.

There are printing presses, although you need magicians to run them, so while the rich can print anything they like it's not quite as affordable to those living in the country.

There is some hate for the nobility (of course) and a lot of fear, but the church is pretty much deliberately set up to convince the population that magic is incredibly dangerous, and the lesser evil is to have the nobility around so they can hunt down any 'witches' (anyone who learns magic without permission, on purpose or otherwise).

I wouldn't probably use this as a main line of attack, but as a distraction? Find some ongoing conflict in which a middling country is losing, infiltrate a couple of skilled orators in the camps. Start preaching. Make sure the war drags on. Instigate a rebellion with a newly converted zealots at the head. Promise to end the war and let people go back to their homes and families if only they support you. Fund this rebellion (for added dastardliness use some neighbouring countries to finance it, they will be glad to weaken a rival) and assassinate key nobles of the country. There will be some casualties when rebels try to hunt down remaining nobles, but they can be used to fuel the revolution further. If all goes well you have a country with a new anti-magic regime in place and a virulent new ideology which will fall on a fertile religious soil. Use the lessons of WW1 and the rise of USSR basically. Only optimised for a different culture.

If the ideology was awesome enough one could probably even launch an enlightenment era with this. Economically this world is pretty much ready for it as far as I can see. The problem is strong ideological resistance to progress. If one could somehow decouple technological progress from religious stigma there would be nothing to stop it from starting and what better to do this than a country without magicians at all. After all it was magic that fouled up everything last time. Normal religious people making inventions for the sake of making life better for everyone surely is praiseworthy.

I can imagine some ways you could legitimately strongly pressure a leader to accept more mages of yours. Ferment a civil war, make them doubt the loyalty of their own country's mages, convince them to hire your more loyal mercenaries. That's been common through history- when internal divisions are bad and you can't trust your countrymen you hire foreign soldiers who are loyal to your money and who perhaps don't speak your language, have wives at home, are much harder to subvert.

I imagine that political leaders would have existing methods to prevent decapitation strikes- body guards, body doubles, illusion magics to decoy attacks, fast building so they could have multiple castles, flying mages searching for anyone who was glowing- you're already at risk from any non aligned mages or assassins from other nations. With ten thousand mages you can seriously step up these efforts.

Here's how I imagine you set it up.

You have several base camps which indicate some degree of illegal research/ legal research into necromancy and resurrection. They will be legally/ illegally abducting people, and then sending them onwards through more secure efforts to the secret camp/ camps (depending on local geography).

Anyone who tries to track the abductions will come to these decoy bases and it can be stopped, they can then be sent to another country.

In the mean while, a huge number of people (orphans, prostitutes, vulnerable people etc) can be abducted and sent to these indoctrination camps, a small number expended on research.

In a couple years you have a huge army and advanced necromancy/ resurrection magic, along with very advanced earth shaping magic from your many years of making underground tunnels. You use this to protect your leaders and civilians from attacks and revive the dead, fast build new homes for anyone who had theirs destroyed, and build large earth defences against mage attacks. In the meantime you train hundreds of thousands/ millions of one trick mages who can be used for other purposes.

There is no spell AI or even fixed spells, like there is no 'fixed' way to use steam power or fire.

The closest you could come (without finding forbidden 300 year old technology) would be to create an object capable of storing magic and of sustaining itself on whoever wore it that can be /manually/ triggered to release its charge.

There will be complex magical machinery in the later books, but because the world was sort of bombed back into the iron age during the last world war, religion and paranoia about evil (destructive/abusable) magic has led to magical research and experimentation being very illegal.

You can also shape the magic beforehand, at least if it's something simple like "Throw lightning/send out enormous heat". Holding magic is slightly damaging to your body, so you shouldn't do it for hours at a time unless your life is on the line. If you are very exceptionally skilled you could shape magic outside of your body, although you would need to do it by effectively reaching out with your soul to the point where the work is to be done (And no, you couldn't detach your soul entirely from your body, and it would be very vulnerable while reaching out)

No somatic or verbal components. Will power is all that is required.

No hard limit beyond human reaction time (Which can be shortened by holding more magic - the more magic you hold, the sharper all your senses, and the higher your physical abilities. Note that you can't sustain holding magic for too long, and the damage accrues faster the more you hold. There is also no hard limit on how much you can hold, it's just that while the usefulness of the magic increases largely linearly, the damage you take from holding it increases exponentially. (There is no exact math here, skill and experience will allow you to hold more magic for longer).

More complex magic doesn't really require more complex preconditions (Though keeping background magic from fluctuating too much (like it would if magicians were fighting nearby) would probably help). The only real limitation is "How quickly can your brain process everything it needs to process to keep all these disparate elements working together".

Spells manipulating spells aren't automatially banned although, again, there are no fixed 'spells', just effects that you learn to produce by harnessing a force of nature and which can be customized. Creating a fireball in the shape of a dragon would be almost impossible because it's so intricate, but you could easily throw lightning around a corner if you can model in your head the path you want it to take. While enroute, it is a natural phenomen that you or someone else could interact with, though you'd have to be quick about it.

Very complex magic /is/ possible, but the human brain (soul) only has so much processing power, and you would have to overcome this limitation somehow. Either by building many machines that do some very specific thing the same way each time and which you then chain together, or by dividing up the parts of the process in some other way. Later on in the books there will be some lmited hive mind creation, but it's not currently possible because the laws of nature do not allow it, and if the seal in question had not been designed and put together by tenss of thousands of magicians working together the world would long since have been reduced to nuclear fire.

** Drop on-sight recognition; magicians living in caves (out of a direct line-of-sight) could avoid it. Consider gravity-like ripples upon the fabric of reality: the USE of magic sends out instant notice to any magician in the universe that magic has just been used. Signal strength goes down with distance and the magician's level of power, and averages out across gravitational/magnetic fields. You can't study by listening to other magicians practice, because the details are omitted; you know what TYPE of magic they are using, but not exactly what they did. You can determine the distance and direction (with another mage you can triangulate for location) of other mages, if any try to approach you (even without casting spells) after they have had enough training to pose a serious threat, you can sense the increasing proximity of a potential hostile just from an unfamiliar signature getting stronger. Effective range (for magicians of any caliber) is "within your solar system".

Being aware of magicians all around you may seem overwhelming, especially if there are a lot of them. Think of any group with many overlapping conversations: you can pluck out a few voices close to you (or that are especially distinctive, or especially loud, or you are very familiar with), but the rest blend into a meaningless babble. Same with similar types of magic: you know that the country over that ocean is practicing a lot of healing magic (or how many types of unfamiliar/new magic, and you can recognize that type of magic again when you visit to audit their lab), but not whether there are a handful of very powerful magicians or an army of lesser magicians. (Location grows imprecise over great distances, too - if you move around in one area, you can't use your shifts in location to communicate in real-time with agents in another country.) It's still loud, though. Think of Yoda in the Star Wars books: the Jedi Masters, as their empathic sensitivity grew, had to find isolated PLANETS to live on so they wouldn't be distracted by the feelings of others.

Spies cannot be the "sneaking through your countryside" kind, just the "pretending to work for you" kind, because if you sensed an unauthorized magician in your area, you would start preparing your shields, and then go hunting. (The ruler would probably back you on this. Polite mages always announce their intended visits well in advance.) If you sense the sudden disappearance of a magical signature, it means one of two things: either that magician has died (and a few of these in short order means someone is assassinating them), or they figured out how to conceal their aura (which is a forbidden magic which makes everyone panic and execute the rogue). You mentioned that divination magic has "No scrying", but I think that location-sensing (with no way to remotely view what is actually happening) isn't contradicted.

@alexanderwales: Developing magical skill is like developing muscle: first you suffer a bit, then rest to restore, which builds up your tolerance. (Using magical coercion to force students to train faster basically means that an instructor uses their experience to judge when a student's breaking point is, and halt just before the student would be irrevocably committed to death, rather than the student's cautious method of halting the moment they feel the strain.) No matter how much theory you learn, the amount of energy you can channel is limited. (This is a separate idea from the previous suggestions. It's meant to address the possibility alexanderwales raised that book learning could be used to prepare peasant armies for wizardry.) Actually, reviewing your scattered notes on magic, it looks like I only managed to restate what you said, not add anything new. Tagging this paragraph accordingly.

On further review, you already thought of the magic-detection, with your sea monsters. I could definitely see the invisible-to-mage-senses creatures being designed before all techniques for creating more of them were taken away; resistant (or even invulnerable) to leftover types of magic, as well, when confined to particular geographic areas such as the ocean. Slumbering in the countryside (or hiding deep within the earth), creatures that only hunger for the BANNED types of magic, and were left in place as a contingency measure against prohibited research. Resistant or invulnerable to that magic, of course. The secret to destroying them could be kept in the same place as information on how to destroy the seals.

*** Thank you very much for your time and input. Magicians do have the sea monster like ability to sense magic at a distance, just weaker, since we were not engineered specifically for the purpose of eliminating enemy movement over the sea. While a magician not using magic can be detected within line of sight (and it's possible to hide your ability, at least against /passive/ sensing), any active use can be sensed through obstacles/at greater distance. It's nowhere near as long range as Jedi's can sense things, but a magician going suicide nova could be sensed kilometers away, and there is one location in my world that all magicians can sense at all times, effectively giving them a built in compass always pointing at the spooky place where the world was almost destroyed during the last world war. That spooky place gives name to the whole planned series, The Tower of Souls. While not as long range as Jedi senses, there are magicians in my world (mostly old ones) who seek to escape the background noise of being in the same city as other magicians, and they tend to move out into the countryside to perfect their own specializations (Which might involve a /little/ bit of research, but in a very narrow field, and after decades of loyal service the state and church will leave them alone except for the occasional visit to check that they are still sane and haven't made any progress in the wrong fields).

The hidden monster traps are a great idea, and I'll think about it. There are two related types of monster I had not mentioned because I tried to keep the OP from growing too long. There is a 'magic eater' monster that, while not /invulnerable/, is very resistant to all forms of damage, and which devours magic. They were created to help annihilate a now extinct race of sentient humanoids (And at this points humans are the only humanoids in my world), and their abilitly to suck the magic out of the world around them has left an entire continent dead. Deserts and ruins, with a few little fishing villages on poles along the coast. If you wanted to kill one you would have to amass around a hundred magicians to injure it faster than it could regrow, and of course that much magic being flung about would attract even more of them. The other creature is a black moss which is slowly expanding across the main continent, and which covers about a third of it when the books begin. It mostly keeps to forests, and it tends to cover both the ground and the tree tops, so that the sky cannot be seen. The moss itself is not directly dangerous, but there is some sort of creature living in it which is almost never seen. Anyone who wanders into the lightless area tends not to come back out, and if search parties are both stupid enough to enter and lucky enough to come back out, usually they find either nothing at all or a few pools of blood and maybe a limb that looks cut off rather than torn. For the magic-less villages living close to the moss, it is long work each year to burn some of the moss away so that it cannot expand and cover their home. Only, burning the moss seems to agitate the creature that lives inside the darkness, and it comes out at night to steal away any living creatures it can find and drag them into the darkness. The only thing it avoids is light (And my worls lacks stars other than the sun, so nights get pretty dark), so the days spent burning moss during the day are often spent gathered around a blazing bonfire in the village square at night. Magicians do have the luxury of creating light around them at will, but actually being inside of the moss covered area seems to embolden the creature to attack lone magicians whether they make light or not, and it will happily wait for a few hours for the magician to lower their shields from exhaustion before it strikes. The creature was originally created to hinder safe and easy troop movement, and moss, sea monsters and magic eaters were created by the same scientist queen during the last world war.

** First question: how much magical knowledge or ability does someone have to have in order to glow? Or in other words, can I use Muggles to carry information that will later be given to magicians?

For the no-lying location, all you need is some truly stupid puppet official whose beliefs you can shape via ordinary lies or indoctrination.

For long-term goals: how can I make reality and civilization more robust so that the restrictions on magic can be safely reduced or eliminated?

*** If you have ever used even the tiniest big of magic, actively delving you will reveal it. It's possible (and verboten) to learn to hide from the automatic, passive sensing. Non magicians can communicate anything to magicians, it's just that speaking about magic is a bit like speaking about riding a bike. Much easier shown than told. Should the first layer of the laws of nature be stripped away (as will happen during the books), you could implant a complete memory into the peasant, and have your colleague read it as though they were experiencing it themselves. In the meantime, the peasant would not glow. When that seal is stripped away munchkinry will happen on all sides, have no fear. During the 300 years that I'm hoping the treaty would keep the world relatively stable, the seal prevents any type of memory manipulation.

Puppet officials are very useful. Only remember, while you can change your mind after having told the truth about your plans, if you are anyone of significance you /will/ be made to visit every few years, and you couldn't say you have nothing planned if you had already thought of how you were going to do it. The obvious exploits are known, and talked about, but it's certainly possible to come up with a new trick /after/ your visit and like it so much that it changes your mind.

By restrictions on magic, I am not quite sure if you mean the legal restrictions or the "several layers of the laws of nature" restrictions. The laws are in place because a very bad person at the end of the last world war decided to manipulate all the emerging nations and religions into mistrusting magic, and though there is no obvious way to remove that influence, cultures and mind sets can be changed with a lot of time and work. If you mean stripping away the physical restrictions on what magic can do, well, all you technically need to do would be to be an extremely competent magician with several powerful followers, go to a known but far out of the way location, and dismantle a man made seal. Not easy, but it could be done. Of course it was put in place because the last world war looked like it would just continue escalating until the world was irrevocably destroyed, but then at the time the world was run by ten sociopaths who all forced their entire populations to learn magic and be either soldiers or scientists. There is no way of making reality more robust, but if magic was still kept much more restricted than "teach everyone", it probably wouldn't escalate as quickly as it did last time. Of course one of the forms of magic that would become possible again would be resurrection, and someone might have the brilliant idea to bring back leaders from that time... Theoretically, if you wanted to keep things stable, I guess you could resurrect them yourself, steal all their knowledge and destroy their souls to prevent any more resurrections, but then, would you get every single one with enough knowledge to pose a significant threat? History is not entirely clear on what happened with some of them - some may have been taken out of comission in some way other than just being killed.

** Sounds like an interesting setting. I love intricate magic systems - I'll look forward to seeing how this turns out.

Many of my ideas seem to have already been covered, but I have a few things for you to consider that I don't think I've seen (but it's a pretty big thread).

First off, I'd try to think of ways to game the definition of "train" to find other ways of creating spell casters. alexanderwales has already discussed this to some extent, but I think it can potentially be gamed further.

Examples:

- Can you use magic to cause a target's magical "muscles" to automatically begin to develop without any training involved? If so, casting that spell + providing the target with books may not constitute "training".

- Are there spells to transfer magical ability from one target to another? If so, you could potentially transfer some or all magical ability from mages to non-mages without it constituting "training".

- Once the ban on mind-magic is over, can you transfer knowledge of how to cast spells to a non-mage without it constituting training?

- Alternatively, if stealing magical power constitute training, can you transfer a bunch of magic to a few mages to make them more powerful?

- Is it possible for a mage to learn to suppress their magical ability (or any other mage's ability) from being detected?

- Is it possible to create an area where the ability to detect magic is nullified, either through directly removing that ability or making it useless (e.g. by saturating the area with too much ambient energy for individuals to be discernible).

- You mentioned that time travel doesn't exist, but what about time dilation? Could you build a [[http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Hyperbolic_Time_Chamber][hyperbolic time chamber]], or would this constitute "disabling physics" or manipulation of space? If this is plausible, using something like that as a rapid hidden training facility sounds like a potentially useful approach.

- Could you place people in stasis while under the effects of a spell that causes their magical "muscles" to be automatically stimulated into growth?

- Could you dig up dead mages, resurrect them, and recruit them without increasing your "training" count?

- Could you empower non-mage soldiers (or animals, etc.) with permanent magical buffs?

- What's the base number of mages a country can get, and how much does the cost increase per additional mage? What's the expected income of a mage with 1 year of training? How about 10? It seems pretty plausible that people would try to game the economy side.

Gaming the truth chamber could also be productive. I've already seen a lot of good ideas for this. A couple more:

- If "utterances" are what are detected for lies, could you use some sort of sound magic to dub over what you're saying, allowing you to "utter" truth (or just lip sync) and have others hear a false message?

- Puppet rulers have already been mentioned. What about sending a clone or a simulacrum with less knowledge than your own? Or, if those types of magic are impossible, how about a good old mundane twin?

- Does dying in the truth chamber prevent resurrection? This certainly isn't the most gamable approach, but it's worth considering.

- How well known is the exact wording (and intent) of the treaty? As long as you can convince your local nobles that your interpretation of the treaty is true, they can honestly say things in the meeting chamber that may circumvent the actual intentions behind it.

Aside from that, it sounds like there are some other fun things you could probably leverage:

- Your setting sounds like there are some very powerful magical beasts. Learning to control these (through mundane or magical means) sounds like a potential game changer, especially the ones that are highly resistant to magic.

- How does magic resistance work? Can it be trained? Could you train an army of soldiers with a high degree of magic resistance, even if they're not actually mages themselves?

- What are the limitations on magical devices? Could you have a non-mage army that carries tons of enchanted gear?

*** And here I thought I had milked this thread for all it was worth. Thank you very much for your input. It is very useful to me. Let's get to it:

1: No as far as politics is concerned. Indirect bulking would still be treated by other countries as training, and would detect the same as 'real' training. Treaty aside, you could speed up magic-holding training by hijacking your trainee's body and making it hold magic even when the trainee is too much in pain/unconscious to train normally.

2: No, magic cannot be transferred. If the Seal was to be removed, you could sacrifice someone's soul for a heck of a one shot burst, but the only people who have discovered any way of permanently stealing magic potential are a few of the most important villains. Me the author knows how this will work, but it's not low hanging fruit.

3: Once the Seal goes down the treaty is the least of anyone's worries. Yes, you could move knowledge very easily between minds. You could do it against either party's will, or against both parties' if you were a sadistic outsider. Magic-holding tolerance (I should find a name for that) is not transferrable, and needs to be pumped manually.

4: While the Seal stands, no. Once the Seal falls, the villains with the knowledge will return, and they do do this.

5: From the passive, always on sensing of other magicians, yes. This is forbidden, but all the countries have the knowledge, and once in a while a spy is caught doing it and it is very embaressing for the home country. But actively delving a magician will reveal them unless the skill difference between them is very big. A few years of training will make it very easy to actively delve someone with 50 years of experience, so in this case, active sensing just wins.

6: Directly no, by raising noise yes. Would be seen as incredibly suspicious, though.

7: When the Seal falls, time dilation becomes available to all. It's very energy intensive, and you couldn't really speed up local time by more than ~50% without some sort of massive power battery. My good guys do eventually get their hands on such a battery. Again, once the Seal falls the treaty is dust, and timey wimey shenanigans will happen.

8: No.

9: Once the Seal falls, the major players all have access to resurrection magic. And mind reading. And mind control. And soul destruction. The baddies control the timing of the fall of the Seal, and will make the most of this.

10: Temporary buffs yes. Permanent buffs no. Permanent magical weapons and such do exist, but they are slow to make and rare, and usually a lot more useful in the hands of a magician.

11: Not quantified. The cost of extra mages will increase exponentially, so while bigger richer countries can afford more and even smaller countries usually buy at least a few extra because the costs can be recouped, they can't afford /too/ many extra. Magicians often become the very best in their trades (Life is not fair at all), and poor magicians are almost unheard of.

Chamber:

1: This can be done. This has been done. But it is not currently a well known trick. The biggest obstacle to doing it is that magic being /used/ is extremely obvious to all magicians present, and cannot be easily hidden. So you would have to find a way to use magic while speaking without attracting suspicion.

2: No such magic. Mundane twin could work, although identifying yourself is part of the procedure.

3: It does. You turn to stone and your soul is broken.

4: Wiggleroom exists, and interpretation plays a role. But I the author do not intend to write a full text of the treaty, and I'm making it fairly solid.

Miscellaneous:

1: It sure would be. Let's hope the scientist crazy lady who created most of the monsters is not the very first villain to return from the dead and go into hiding.

2: Magic resistance is really not something you could train, any more than you could train your resistance to gamma rays in the real world. Some non-human creatures have resistance because they were made that way (as weapons of war that have since gone wild), and you can use powerful magic to /avoid/ incoming attacks, but resisting it with your body is a no go.

3: Slow to make, requires specialized knowledge to make. While the Seal stands the magical gear that can be made is not super hot by the standards of the pre-Seal weapons, although it'll still be strictly superior to anything mundane. A naked magician would still wipe the floor with a non-magician with high quality magical gear.

**** Great answers! I'm glad to be of some help. I love digging into magic systems, and it sounds like you've put a lot of thought into yours. I'll look forward to seeing your work.

I'd suggest the "train a pair of twins to play the role of the same person" idea, but I think it's been done enough in other fiction.

Glad to hear you've already thought of most of this stuff. I'm especially interested to see the crazy scientist with the magic beasts. =D
