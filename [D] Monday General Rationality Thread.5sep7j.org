Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics! Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world? Have you:

- Seen something interesting on [[/r/science]]?
- Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
- Figured out how to become immortal?
- Constructed artificial general intelligence?
- Read a neat nonfiction book?
- Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?


** Hey everyone,

I recently put together a primer on the planning fallacy that goes over the research and 3 debiasing techniques.

If you're at all interested in cognitive science and planning, you might want to check it out:

[[https://medium.com/@owenshen/planning-101-techniques-and-research-9bfff1a01abd#.iqa412kf4][Link here]] on Medium.

In total, the research + images took me about 23 hours, which was quite a lot for a project like this!

I'm ABD in a solid program(s) (top 3 or top 15 in the US, depending) doing, well, Bayesian graphical modeling, in a sense, and I had no relevant experience when I was accepted.

Otherwise, a few Master's programs /are/ funded (through RAs or TAs) but many are not. You could probably find a cheap one. You could also go to a less prestigious place for a PhD, Master out, chill in industry for a bit, and then reapply for a PhD elsewhere, but that's super-duper skeevy and highly frowned upon and may hurt you ultimately.

For a second undergrad, getting something from whatever state you have residency in would probably be the cheapest, especially if you can transfer credits from your first degree (or from some CC?). There are tons of scholarships and financial assistance programs that could help, but otherwise you'd have to take out a small-ish loan and best live pretty frugally (or work on the side -- relevant work, especially, would catapult your ultimate PhD app significantly). Dunno how undergrad financial aid works if you've already been through once (or if there are age cutoffs, etc.), but lotsa schools cover demonstrated financial need, at least your first time around. Apply to a bunch of places -- sometimes you can stack 10 smaller, niche scholarships atop one another, which is pretty groovy.

I hear going abroad to study can be pretty cheap, too, but maybe not for international students?

Why'd you only apply to two programs? What's your undergrad in?

I saw your post, but I think I fucked-up:

- I did get interest from a potential PI at one school. However, it turns out their admissions tend to be nationalistic: they don't like foreigners (like me, from south of their border).

- I forgot to talk to the potential PI I fanboy over at the other school, although I did mention him in my Statement of Intent. Or rather, I spent my time preparing my application, having panic attacks, and trying to get my GREs rescheduled -- rather than talking to the PI like I should have. I also think I'm just straight-up underprepared for this institution, since it is kinda the best in the world.

- I seriously could not get my MSc advisor to write a fucking recommendation letter on-deadline. He sent one in a month and a half late. Goddamnit.

Because at the time I figured, hey, I have a nice stable job, why apply to extra programs when I really only want to work in one or two specific labs? Now I... /don't/ have a nice stable job, and feel like I should have done more to make sure I can get into PhD school. My undergrad and preexisting research Master's (with a small, B-grade-conference publication) are in Computer Science. Both are from decent institutions, but merely top-20 (undergrad: top 20 in USA, grad: top 20 in world) rather than #1.

The PhD programs I'm applying to are in a Brain and Cognitive Sciences department, and a Computer Science department to work with a professor cross-listed between CS and Statistics on probabilistic learning. The former sends out its interview invitations at the end of January, and I didn't get one. The latter sends admissions decisions in mid-February through March.

In related news, I got reviews for my research paper in cog-sci a couple weeks ago. One review withdrew their review, the editor says it's almost definitely a reject, and the other reviewer wants major revisions. Some of their advice is useful, though!

Also, start thinking about fellowship apps! If you've already thought about them, think about them some more! There's so much free money out there (the NSF-GRF, DOE SCGF/CSGF, FORD, Hertz, NDSEG, SMART, PDSOROS, GEM, etc. etc. etc... though IDK much about opportunities for international students) and people always totally fail to take advantage of it.

edit: also, I think your CS degrees are more than sufficient for the programs you're interested in. If you're still unsure, one way to clarify matters /and/ show initiative during the application process would be to ask your prospective PIs during the course of your dozen emails what they'd recommend in way of preparing to enter the program and their lab. Books/papers to read, MOOCs to take, etc.

** I heard that 1984 has suffered a resurgence in popularity in response to the current political climate, so I decided to check it out in the hope I might learn something useful. Now that I'm finished, I really don't know what I can take from the experience. The worldbuilding and psychology of the characters was so alien to me that I can barely imagine how it applies to the real world or the implications it has for rationality.

I was specifically looking for insight into the ideology of authoritarianism and how social and psychological forces can lead to its rise. The book was instead about living under the ultimate totalitarian state and the psychology it forces it's citizens to adopt for the sole purpose of controlling them through fear and pain. I didn't get what I wanted or anything I thought I didn't already know.

Is there anyplace I could get the insight I'm looking for? It's possible I've already learned all I need about this topic from The Righteous Mind, my favorite sociology book that everyone should read, but I'd rather that not be the case since I don't think my current knowledge is helping me to preserve liberal democracy in the face of populism that rejects rationality. I'm holding out for some answer to my question that makes me less cynical and depressed about politics than I am now.

Newspeak is one of the few ideas that I haven't seen explored in greater detail elsewhere, but I still don't understand what special insight it grants beyond the basics of information control and propaganda. The book's dystopia was groundbreaking for its time and is still respectable for taking the idea as dark and depression as any novel could while still resonating with political issues at the time, but it just didn't do anything for me that other stories haven't.

In response to oppression they rallied behind authoritarian leaders because they didn't know any better and by the time they realized their lives were just as bad if not worse than ever their leader had become too powerful to stop even by his peers.

What makes it difficult for me to see how it relates to today is that the people rallying behind the demagogue aren't actually being oppressed by the people they're targeting, at least half the population doesn't support the leader which seems to only embolden the supporters, and our society is much better educated than the Russian serfs who backed Stalin.

We have a decision-making mechanism which disproportionately empowers specific segments of the population. Thus, the demagogue has to target /them/ rather than /everyone/. In a way, this makes it easier for him to acquire power, but it also puts the major obstacles in his way that, well, 73% of the registered voter population and 2/3 of the nation's GDP now not only oppose him but /despise/ him.

A lot of leftists I know have been comparing 2017 to 1917, and I'm sort of starting to see what they meant. Our upper class did not actually intend this outcome to happen, and as a result is dividing against itself. The governing segment of the upper class are /blundering around/ because the functionaries who can run a vast, bureaucratic, federalized state efficiently just don't want to work in an openly abusive environment. Meanwhile, our working class is growing more strident and more united than any time since the 1910s-1930s labor movement that built the New Deal.

For instance, [[https://twitter.com/i/moments/829897770123268100][/this/]] is a live-tweet of a /town-hall meeting/ with the head of the /House Oversight Committee/. You don't normally even hear or care about the House Oversight Committee, let alone show up to its head's town-hall meetings and start telling him how to do his job properly.

The USA is getting to be ripe for revolution, and there's a fair amount of resistance to going down the fascist route. We're not even two months in and people are talking about [[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/02/07/the-womens-march-organizers-want-a-general-strike-against-trump-could-it-work/?utm_term=.c252c157af36][general]] [[http://www.dw.com/en/the-audacity-of-planning-a-general-strike-against-president-trump/a-37481584][strikes]].

The worst way that I sometimes deal with this is going full Akrasic, and deciding "I just need to /finish/ the game, and then I'll be free." This recently resulted in me powering through 20+ hours of a game.

The worst part is I'll be thinking "I am not enjoying myself" whilst I do this. Completely ridiculous.

I'm trying to teach myself to catch that initial "I don't actually want to do this" and amplify it as much as possible. I bathe in this feeling and then don't do the bad thing, instead of ignoring it and jumping into the thing.

Which is to say, if you avoid playing games for an extended period of time, the desire to play more might lessen. The preliminary research I've seen into habits shows that, for some things, you don't even need a reward loop-- repetition itself leads to habituation.

** Weekly Monday Update

--------------

Story is still plugging along, the first chapter should be done by the end of the week and the Pokemon Renegades Engine's feature list is still being worked out.

--------------

I was meditating on one of ScottAlexander's articles a while ago, and he said something that kind of stuck with me. He was talking about how he always felt bad as a psychiatrist when people had an injury that wouldn't let them work, and those people were in some mode of depression or suicidal thoughts. When trying to get them to not commit suicide, he mentions that he feels bad saying "Think about those that care about you" ie "Think of the affect it would have if you commit suicide. You're being selfish"

The intellectual problem trying to be addressed in a lot of those suicidal thoughts is the belief that you have no value and whatnot. From there, one of the problems of depression is an incorrect self-worth-appraisal. It's not just that you're a burden on people, it's also often that you're not contributing either, or don't feel like you are contributing. And if you rely on the "think about how your death would affect others" approach, what you're telling yourself or the other person, or they may see it this way, is that they have no intrinsic value to bring to the table, so they need to rely on others for their self-valuations, and I think that is wrong.

I don't have a proper response for it though, but my suggestion is to find something positive you can bring to the table and contribute from there. Then you can say "I did x thing" and "I can't let go because of project Y". You or the other person might not be able to get out from under the "I'm a net-loss financially" thought pattern, but it does help to direct your mind. And if you're able to run personal projects, and such, I predict that it will help you to come to terms somewhat with your problems that's the root of your depression (assuming there are any ofc)

What I /think/ happened is that you used the wrong sort of quotation marks: =“= instead of ="= (since your comment prior to editing showed a link of =#s%20%E2%80%9= and =%E2%80%9= is the HTML encoding for =“=).

I guess I can test that:

[[#s%20%E2%80%9Ctest%22][curly quote test]]

[[#s][normal quote test]]

Markdown handles the two differently, as you can hopefully see. [[http://i.imgur.com/9z1Ctgl.png][(here's what it looks like on my end)]]

********** #+begin_quote
  That post was typed up from GoogleDocs
#+end_quote

Google Docs automatically changes ="..."= to =“...”=. This is invisible in Arial, but you can see it if you switch to Times New Roman.

You can disable this behavior with the =Use smart quotes= checkbox in the =Preferences= window under the =Tools= menu option.

*** I really like this movie and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes rational stories about solving a puzzle, though I always thought the reveal as to why the characters were put through the puzzle was one of the weaker parts. It was still presented very well and had the intended dramatic impact, but I do think it's a bit silly when you take an objective look at the plot and what the puzzle actually accomplished. It's about the journey more than the destination.

SPOILERS AHEAD

As for your question, even just selling the product like normal would be a restriction on who gets it and, ultimately, what impact it will have on the world. It's something that /will/ save lives and should not be suppressed, but since it will also change the world the company wanted someone to help make the hard moral choices that will come up.

I don't think it's just about creating a strategic plan, but also having to deal with people who will use the product to pursue an agenda, righteous or not. Some will want it publicly released, some will want it regulated, some will want to profit from it, some will want it banned, and some will want it to be exclusively for certain people whom they trust.
