** New Delphic! I really like the character development here, but I also feel like we aren't making any progress in the story plot wise with these short Kim-focused chapters.

*** Seconding that I'd sure love some longer, meatier chapters-- but also, writing is hard, and anything is appreciated, for the health of this sub and this genre I love.

*** Meh, this story has always seemed somewhat slice of life... Less action going on when your main character does most of it from his basement... So I kind of think the Kim stuff /is/ plot,,, yanno? Like. It's part of his life.

Also, I'm looking forward to finding out if she's evil or not

** The food fluff is a well appreciated element of this story. Such a fresh breath of writing.
