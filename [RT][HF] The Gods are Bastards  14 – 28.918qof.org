** I wish the entire chapter was just Trissiny beating on Vesk.

*** I kinda like the bits where Trissiny doesn't righteously kill the people who think she's going to righteously kill them.

** I do like this story, but even if the community agrees that it fits the definition of rational, it shouldn't be posted every time it updates. That would be two or three posts a week, which would make it most of the front page given how few posts there are on any given day.

A post every time a new book finishes would be more appropriate.

*** Practical Guide to Evil has more frequent updates and that gets posted every time.

*** Eh. This is a fairly interesting part of the story, with some important stuff being revealed regarding how the different gods think, sometimes in spite of their cults, and how godhood works regarding their concepts and restraints from the perception of their followers. I don't have a problem with regular posts during this phase. The more filler chapters, I agree, don't require posts.

*** I don't remember seeing any other TGaB posts since the one that got me started on it. I don't think this is an issue.

Plus as [[/u/Mountebank]] points out, PGtE gets posted every time, but we /love/ that one :D

It's good to get a reminder of stories that are updating, there's been some that didn't catch me the first time around, so it's handy to see them again.

Pretty sure it isn't.

*** Why not? The sub is /about/ rational fiction, shouldn't the front page be full of updates for rational fiction? The sub has a really low post rate anyway, perhaps if it updates more with more varied content, people will be more likely to find it.

**** Sure, rational fiction, but I would very much maintain that TGaB doesn't fit that metric at all.

***** I can see arguments on both sides as reasonable, when I started it I wouldn't have agreed that it was rational, but the same goes for PGTE, as the series continues and more is revealed it takes more and more qualities of the other rational fiction I see here.

Genre awareness.

Explicable and relatable character motivations (at least in hindsight)

Measurable character progression (in both power and personality).

Structured world building.

Well implemented if not entirely understood magic.

The series shows more and more of this as it continues, and what I have seen about this most recent volume (which I haven't read any of yet) it seems to be getting closer and closer.

****** See, I don't really think many of these fit. Like one of the big "genre awareness" things is that "this is a deconstruction, and the age of adventures is over, so you can't get anywhere as a lone wolf" or "Fight smarter, not harder," and while both of these are true irl, they're completely false in fic. The character motivations are similarly wrong; for basically eveyr character, the narrative will repeatedly lie about everything about them. Look back through the text if you don't beleive me; when was the last time trissany picked a fight or tried to solve her problems with brute force, as opposed to the narrative claiming she always does? When was the last time toby was an understanding and kind pacifist monk rather than a judgmental militant?

The third point I don't think is a point at all. That's fiction in general, and not necessarily even a good thing there.

As for the last two, I think I'm goign to tie these together. The author often retcons fundamental laws of magic, exposition, and the like as the plot demands. It's at best consistent if you read post retcon, but even then most peoples actions often just don't make any sense under the new paradigm. Sometimes this is a positive, like when they removed the "your minds influence reality at a subatomic layer because observation," but even these still speak to a magic system that isn't really all that thought out (or explained to the readers."

******* If you want to see my reply to your objections of the characters, you should check my reply to your comment on chapter 27, you aren't reading past the plain text, and you are misinterpreting terms like 'brute force', if you have any new objections than please raise them, but I have read your arguments in your past posts and I /fervently/ disagree with you, not just on whether TGAB is Rational, but on your entire opinion of the series, to the point that I wonder if we are reading the same series.

******** If you aren't going to give any examples, I'm going to continue to assume they don't exist, because I'm pretty sure they don't.

As for the latter part, I agree completely and I wonder if you're just headcanoning in all these explanations, or if there was a major rewrite since I read it, or if you just didn't pay attention to these things, because they were definitely there when I was reading it.

*** Personally I come here to see if the stories I read have gotten an update yet, so I'm completely fine with a post per week at least. And it's not like this subreddit has too many posts right now. The 20th post is 5 days old.
