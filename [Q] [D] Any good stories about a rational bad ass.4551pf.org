** Taking the most charitable possible view of this request, I'd say you're looking for action-packed tightly-written rationalfic without philosophizing or author tract. Ideally, you're looking for something focused on problem-solving and the "will to mastery", so to speak.

Given that that's the case, I highly recommend [[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553418025][The Martian]] by Andy Weir. It sounds right up your alley, and is one of my favorite examples of rational fiction (though some may dismiss it as "competence porn") in published literature. A publisher's synopsis:

#+begin_quote
  Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars.

  Now, he's sure he'll be the first person to die there.

  After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he's alive---and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive.

  Chances are, though, he won't have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old "human error" are much more likely to kill him first.

  But Mark isn't ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills---and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit---he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?
#+end_quote

I found it humorous, gripping, and intellectually stimulating. It's "manly" and "masculine" in the ways you'd almost certainly like.

Also, Mark Watney is definitely badass.

And... a word of advice: You phrased this request poorly if your goal was to get recommendations. People aren't here to discuss masculinity or femininity in books, or whatever it is you gripe about. We're here to find rational works. Most people, including me, will view your post as some kind of long-winded complaint. A post like this will most likely get downvoted by most people, again including me. That's no reason not to give a good reply, though.

*** I greatly enjoyed the Martian but I wonder if it's fair to label it as rational fiction. After all:

(Spoilers below)

-- The main plot line is that NASA spends billions (or more?) dollars to rescue one person. Implicitly the book cheers this on.

I understand the emotional appeal here as well as any other human being, but putting that aside and thinking rationally for a moment: that amount of money could likely save many, many more lives if spent differently.

-- There is a common anti-rational trope which pervades a lot of Hollywood movies: instead of a safe plan which involves suffering some losses, the protagonist bets everything on a plan which has extremely low chances of success but works perfectly if everything goes right. Then everything goes right, and the lesson we are supposed to draw is that courage and bravery always prevail.

The Martian suffers from this as well: I'm referring to the final plan where the crew is redirected back to Mars and later part of the ship is blown up to change course. It seems extremely unlikely that this plan can pass a rational sanity check (after all, what should the probability of success be if you want to risk six lives to save one?)

**** Precommitting to spending billions to save one person makes things better for lots of people. The knowledge that if you are in trouble, billions will be spent to save you, makes it easier to get good people for dangerous jobs in the first place. Of course, this only works if the precommitment is credible, and it's only going to be credible if it's actually going to happen.

Yes, a utilitarian calculation shows that at the moment the billions are being spent, it is wasteful, but it is often true that if you have to do the thing you precommitted yourself to, you may be worse off in the immediate situation even though you are better off averaged over all possible worlds.

We sometimes refer to such precommitments as "morals" or "willingness to sacrifice".

**** Continuing spoilers:

I think that in the story NASA doesn't actually want to redirect the return flight, the astronauts violated orders did that themselves. The directors at NASA already had a mission back to Mars planned, and wanted to send Mark Watney some food so that he'd survive until that mission arrived. Mark Watney acted rationally and so did NASA.

In any case, I'd like to note that in general if we are talking about spending billions of dollars to save astronaut lives... well, the Apollo missions cost like 100 billion dollars in modern money, right? I bet we could have saved a LOT of cash if we didn't include return trips for the astronauts. This would likely be even more true for a Mars mission since Mars isn't in the Earth's gravity well and has a very deep well itself. Sending enough fuel and the right equipment for return is probably more than half of the cost thanks to the rocket equation.

Basically, NASA in this story already has spent a huge amount of money to bring the astronauts back, when it could have just made it a one-way mission from the start and left them to die horribly and alone on Mars. Now, that would be terrible, and people wouldn't do that; I think whatever calculus led them to include a MAV and a spacecraft that could return, I'm sure also applies to getting Mark Watney back by sending him food.

Your second point is pretty spot-on though. Watney's crew isn't rational. That being said... I could see them trying something like that. This is something real people could do! And lots of things do go wrong, including Watney's use of the MAV. At the end, yeah, there's a part where something happens "just for the plot", which is that Watney survives and makes it to the ship. I don't think fic needs to have everyone in it act rationally for it to be a rational fic, and for there to be a stretch of what's likely right at the end, at the climax? That's okay with me too. Given a choice between being more rational or better written, this story chose "better written" and I'm okay with that.

Maybe it's not the most rational a story could be, but I don't begrudge The Gunslinger its guns and portal to a modern world, claiming it's no longer a fantasy fic, and if Jennifer Government doesn't seem to have taken the sci-fi direction in every element of its worldbuilding, I don't think that disqualifies it either. Lots of works in any genre will be on the boundary, and The Martian is... well, it's legitimate. It's a published book. It's even a movie, now. I'll claim the heck out of it for rational fiction.

**** Having only seen the movie, Jeff Daniels' character, the Director of NASA, makes the point that a picture of a dead astronaut will kill their ability to get government funding.

Saving an astronaut in a daring rescue mission with assistance from China, on the other hand, would be a spectacular global event and the most important event in the history of space exploration up to that point. US-Sino relations, which are already a trade positive, would be supercharged on all levels, from general government cooperation (as is shown at the end with the two countries launching a rocket together) right down to the citizen level where at least American affinity for China would be enormous.

If the Blue Team is right, and about a decade ago I thought they were (though not anymore,) then such an event would almosy certainly put permanently to rest any chance of war, in which case a few billion would be pocket change to the damages that would incur in such a conflict. And that's just one benefit, a cooperating US and China on the level of how friendly we are with Canada or England would be a massive boon to global geopolitical stability and generally getting shit done.

And of course millions of children now want to be astronauts, money pours into space in the public and private sector, the US and China are now launching rockets together... I'd have to think humanity gets off the rock a whole lot quicker. That's worth /everything/.

Doesn't this feel a bit like a rationalization? The space shuttles Challenger and Columbia have blown up but we still have a space program.

****** This is a good counterpoint, and I don't explicitly disagree with you, but for the sake of continuing this thought I will propose possible explanations for the difference:

Challenger occurred in 1986, with it being the Reagan Administration and Cold War, that would be one reasonable explanation for why funding would not decrease.

Columbia, however, did affect the space program. It caused the space shuttle program to be suspended and was likely the long-preceding death knell of the program as well. That said, what could have helped mitigate a negative aftermath are these things: it was February 2003, a month prior to the invasion of Iraq. A combination of President W. Bush having a boosted approval rating and the news shifting to focusing on the war would have strongly deterred initial media and political criticism of the program and thus prevented knee-jerk reactions. Additionally, President W. Bush's Vision for Space Exploration may have also helped, though it was nearly a year following the disaster.

Another possible reason is that because the Challenger and Columbia disasters were explosions, the death of the astronauts was for most people, congress included, closer to an extrapolated abstraction rather than palpable reality. It is implicit to see the rocket and shuttle explode and understand the crews have died, but there is no explicit death. The preserved corpse of an astronaut on the surface of another planet is real, apparent, and visceral. Death there is immediately appreciable, and so if such a picture were on the front page of major newspapers, then yes I think it is possible that it would have a more negative effect on funding than the Challenger and Columbia disasters.

**** I only watched the movie, and didn't read the book, so take this with a grain of salt, but my understanding was that the crew chose to take the risky plan to save Watney because they came to the collective decision that they would be morally dissatisfied with themselves if they didn't risk their lives to attempt to save their colleague. Therefore, (disregarding the use of government resources and focusing only on the risks to human lives) they made the correct decision from a preference utilitarian perspective.

***** An issue with this argument is that it proves too much: any decision X can be justified by saying that the decision-maker(s) would feel morally dissatisfied with themselves if they chose not-X. If this argument can be deployed to justify the label of something as "rational fiction," we could use it to conclude that most of the fiction out there featuring what appear to be irrational decisions is in fact rational.

******* The problem is that characters in fiction often don't articulate their goals precisely. Should we feel comfortable saying "This work of fiction is rational fiction because each character's behavior is consistent with a (possibly unusual) utility function I can come up with?"

In the case of The Martian, such a utility function for each member of the crew of the Hermes would place his/her own moral discomfort above the lives of four or so crewmates.

It seems to me more natural to say that the crew of the Hermes is acting out of a reflexive sense of guilt over leaving Watney on Mars.

**** The best argument I've heard for this is that we learned more on Apollo 13 than on every other Lunar mission combined. When things go perfectly, all we learn is that we made good things that worked. When everything falls apart, however, you learn the real limits of the technology you have designed, learn what new functionality you should include next time, and you learn what not to do in the future.

Watney benefited directly from Apollo 13 because it was then that NASA learned to /always/ have standard, interchangeable parts for every part of a mission. Watney benefited directly from Apollo 1, because it was then that NASA learned to never enclose humans in a pure oxygen atmosphere. Watney benefited from every diver who has ever experienced the bends, because that's how we learned that decompression is bad.

In this case, NASA has learned that hab canvas is capable of surviving a year-long mission. They learned that they need to redesign the connection between the hab and the airlocks, and also that they need to require rotating airlock use. They now know that a MAV can be used to achieve low Martian orbit under great duress, and also that they need to redesign the MAV to do so better if needed. They learned that their oxygenator design is perfect, and that their water reclaimer needs some way of internally scrubbing minerals. They learned that, while far from ideal, using a nuclear generator as a heat source isn't the worst possible thing to do. They learned that 45 year old hardware left on barren planets can be resurrected. They learned that their communication system was woefully inadequate. They learned that remote piloting a manned launch is possible and perhaps even a good idea.

Though this flies in the face of real Mars (perchlorate salts are a bitch), they learned that Martian soil could be used to grow food.

Is learning all of that, with the cost of several billion dollars and potentially 6 human lives, worth it?

If we ever plan to actually live on Mars, yes. Absolutely.
