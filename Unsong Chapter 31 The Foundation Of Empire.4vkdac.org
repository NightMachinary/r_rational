** I'm curious what Unsong's take on the Holocaust is. Yes, it happened before the sky cracked, but it had a huge effect on Jewish culture in real life, whereas it's not even been mentioned thus far in Unsong, as far as I recall. Did the events of the sky cracking simply overshadow it to the point of irrelevance? I somehow doubt it.

Is it a coincidence that our rocketry programs, which destroyed the beautiful order of things everyone had settled on, relied on the employment of Wernher von Braun, an engineer who worked for the modern empire that made the most credible attempt of wiping out God's chosen people within that beautiful order?

*** The Holocaust has been mentioned. The Rebbe who created the Liberty Golem was a Holocaust escapee, and he mentioned that "As New York saved the Jews, it is time for the Jews to save New York."

I would still think this is a matter of enough significance to get explicitly, personally discussed at length by Aaron in the narration.

Is your understanding of how we evaluate works so warped that you think something like "the pace was too slow" or "his motivation didn't make sense" is somehow invalid because it's not holistic?

I don't see why. So long as more than half of his writing is good, it's a net improvement in my life.

And, really, even if someone wrote something that sucks completely, I could still commend them for their efforts. Whoever wrote the time cube, for example, certainly spent a good while on it and definitely can get credit for /that/ even if it's mostly just psychobabble and is otherwise not worth reading. I don't see the connection between giving an author credit for writing something and giving a subjective evaluation of it.

***** ... You are reading a "Kabbala-punk" story. Multiple key events have involved or outright hinged upon puns and choices of letters... Thus Unsong itself can be thought of breaking up sentences into word and words into letters, so I don't think you can criticize a criticism that involves breaking things into bits and pieces.

That I think I don't mind Aaron's parts, but only because they provide a narrative for the interesting interlude pieces to give context too, otherwise those pieces would be too disconnected.

** #+begin_quote
  “Like you did, Jalaketu ben Raziel?”
#+end_quote

So this makes Jala's father, Comet West, Raziel.

Raziel was previously mentioned in [[http://unsongbook.com/chapter-20-when-the-stars-threw-down-their-spears/][Chapter 20]]:

#+begin_quote
  Raziel was missing, as always, out doing his thing, whatever Raziel's thing was.

  ...

  “Sometimes there comes upon us the desire to seek out and explore new parts of God's creation, that we may appreciate ever-greater portions of His glory. ... Thus Raziel, who has absented himself from this assembly to traverse the gulfs beyond the world.”

  ...

  “Raziel?”

  “Off somewhere,” said Michael.
#+end_quote

Jala's other patronymic, "ben Kokab", appears to mean "son of a star" (or /the/ star; I don't know how the grammar works there).

In the comments of this chapter, Scott said:

#+begin_quote
  I really wanted her to actually call him “Jalaketu bar Kochba”, but I remembered at the last moment that angels can't speak Aramaic.
#+end_quote

This is the aramaic translation of "ben Kokab", and it refers to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_bar_Kokhba][Simon bar Kokhba]]. He led a revolt against the Romans and established an independent Jewish state that was conquered within 3 years.

Given what we know of Jala's eventual (presumed) demise and the fall of his empire, it seems kabbalistically appropriate.

He was also a Messiah candidate, but that wasn't bourne out for obvious reasons.

It seems likely that Raziel was aware of the kabbalistic connotations of siring Jalaketu. So what was his plan? I can't remember if he's still around. Apparently he was giving Jala dreams throughout his childhood, so at the very least he didn't die in coitus.
