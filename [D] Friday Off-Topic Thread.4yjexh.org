Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with [[/r/rational]], but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/japanesegameshows]], but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!


** Just completed a writing project that I started eight months ago. It's terribly written, full of blunders and mistakes, lot of grammar mistakes too. But damn it, I DONE IT! I completed a thing.

Now, I am going to be working on finishing yet another project, a rational stargate fic.

There's an original fic that I wanted to do, but it's very research-heavy. I need to find an original fic that's not such research heavy or find a better solution to worldbuilding. It's very hard to write when you have no reference materials to fall back on.

** There was an MCU fanfic called Move Fast and Break Things posted on this subreddit yesterday that most people seemed to like. Am I the only one who didn't like it? I didn't think it was terrible, just not good enough to keep me reading past the first three chapters.

Instead of reimagining an established story like HPMOR did, it seemed to be retreading old ground with only superficial differences. Toni Stark is nearly identical to her canon counterpart, and the situation she's in is only slightly different and makes just as much sense.

The biggest problem I have, however, is that it's missing what I loved about the movie it's based on. You can't just write dialogue that sounds like RDJ and expect it to have the same impact without his acting. Writing in prose is different than in movies, or even comics.

There's also no Iron Man in it. Toni doesn't even save herself from the terrorists, she escapes almost by accident without overcoming any obstacle. When I sit down to read a story about a superhero character, I want to see them do heroic things. Where was Iron Man?

I don't understand why people like this fanfic. I don't hate it, I just find it boring. It lacks what I liked about its source material and it didn't have anything I wanted that the original story didn't. Maybe it gets better after Toni gives press conferences, but I didn't care enough to keep reading after that.

Anyways, I am totally fine with gender benders even if they don't have a point.

** Let's talk about the horror genre. 'Supernatural' horror genre, to be specific.

*I.* You see, I quite like it: it's one of my favorite genres. Characters encountering unknown, usually dangerous and hostile but almost always /strange/ forces, trying to understand them and deal with them.

And, as could be expected from a member of this subreddit, I like rational and sane characters, original plot twists, and when priorities are assigned correctly.

Probably not too hard to guess that I rarely get everything I want. Almost never, in fact.

Characters in horror stories are almost always ridiculously stupid and genre-blind, fishes-in-a-barrel. Horror stories are full of cliché character roles and cliché twists and cliché antagonists and cliché everything. Instead of focusing on /encountering supernatural,/ they care about something inconsequential like an old grudge or some blightul love triangle. Nobody ever does anything interesting, and if they do, I almost certainly am reading/listening to/watching a parody.

On the other hand, I saw but a few genuine horror stories in the rationalist community. Usually it's something about the horror of wireheading or uFAI, which is scary, but not exactly what I seek. Why, I wonder? The aforementioned premise is a great way to show characters' rationality, genre-savvines, ability to update their beliefs and explore the unknown. This genre is /full/ of low-hanging fruits.

Really, just imagine that: the main characters notice that something weird is going on in their home. Instead of ignoring it or rationalizing it away until it's too late, they investigate. A monster, they quickly discover, bewildered. They contemplate running for their lives for exactly two seconds. Instead, they carefully study it, making heavy use of modern technology, like quadcopters with video cameras, then capture it and sell it to the scientists, acquiring eternal fame and wealth. Scietists subsequently discover 'supernatural', turn it into a branch of engineering, find a missing piece in their model of the universe, and lead the world into post-scarcity utopia.

Did anyone ever perceived a story that went at least remotely like that? No, I expect. /sigh/ I suppose I will have no choice but to write it myself, will I?

*II.* That part probably belongs in a Monthly Recommendation Thread, but the rant above doesn't, and I wanted to post it all at once.

I do know a few instances of rational-ish works in this genre:

*[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/][SCP Foundation]]*; *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft][Lovecraft]]*'s works; *Wildbow's* *[[https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/][Pact]]*, partially; *EagleJarl's* works: *[[https://www.amazon.com/Pay-Attention-novella-psychological-horror-ebook/dp/B00V4ZIEMQ/ref=la_B00WCPXLMA_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1471618396&sr=1-2#nav-subnav][Pay Attention]]*, *[[https://www.amazon.com/Baby-Blues-David-K-Storrs-ebook/dp/B00V52XRIE#nav-subnav][Baby Blues]]* and *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11530632/1/Supernaturally-Rational][Supernaturally Rational]]*. I suppose most people here already know about them; included for the sake of completedness.

*[[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1259521/][The Cabin in the Woods]]*, a movie. To be brief, Worm : Superhero stories :: The Cabin in the Woods : Horror movies.

*[[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2388715/][Oculus]]*, a movie. It promised to be /perfect/. Kaylie's plan, outlined in the first half of the movie, was exactly the sort of thing I expect a rational character to do; I cannot express how pleasantly I was surprised. Unfortunately but inevitably, it didn't last: she [[#s][spoiler]] towards the end (almost literally (it was +an apple+ +a lighbulb+ an apple)), and [[#s][spoiler]] The first half is very good, though.

*[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Another][Another]]*, an anime/light novel. Has a very good atmosphere, genre-savvy and not idiotic main characters, and an interesting and complex yet consistently-behaving opposing force. Has its flaws, which can be summarized as 'the last two episodes of the anime'. I intend to write a rational fanfic of it, someday.

I invite everyone to recommend their favorite works in horror genre, preferably with rational undertones. Everything's fine: books, movies, anime, podcasts, games, etc.

The horror is in mysteries that /don't/ fold like wet tissue paper to inquiry, and/or in victims who /don't/ have the resources to overpower the threat. "Rationalist goes to town on baddie" belongs in the climax if at all, and needs to be written carefully to not ruin the atmosphere.

 

Recommendation: *It Follows*. The characters aren't geniuses and don't make perfect decisions (sleep deprivation is a factor), but they're all [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent][level 1 intelligent]] and actively prioritize /solving the fucking problem/ over petty drama and everyday concerns.

Of course; I didn't mean to imply that winning in every rational horror story would or should be /easy/ for the main characters. However, it would be far more interesting and horrifying if the threats were dangerous or incomprehensible enough to hold its own against the full extent of humanity's technology and creativity, instead of relying on the protagonist not having access to a handgun and being stupid.

Thank you for the recommendation.

Think of it like the Mars rover: we can't communicate with it in real time, so we have to send it instructions for what to do. In this case, you would be acting as both the rover and control, and instead of a light delay it would be a delay of how long it took to shuttle yourself in and out of the zone of distrust, combined with how much time it takes to review the data.

You can also use things like autodialers and other automatic systems to circumvent self distrust, but this is just an extension of the rover analogy.

*** I really, really loved the horror-ish parts of Dan Simmon's Hyperion - I'm thinking particularly of The Priest's Tale: The Man Who Cried God, and a few different parts of the end of The Poet's Tale. The Priest's Tale was strange and disturbing and horrific in a number of ways that really worked and resonated with me. Strangely enough, Simmon's completely straight up horror works like Carrion Comfort and Song of Kali never really worked for me at all in the same way.

I really liked the novel House of Leaves by Danielewski. It's got a wonderful creepyness and the structure of the book is just really unique and interesting; everyone should buy and read this book. I just love how the author structures things as stories within stories and how the book is crafted.

I really love parts of Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem (Gamecube) for it's 4th wall breaking horror stuff. It's also got a really nice Lovecraftian aesthetic and structure, and the voice acting is actually astoundingly good quality. The actual gameplay itself isn't all that great, but the other parts of the game have so much going for them I beat it the full three times to get the complete ending.

Song of Saya (Saya no Uta) is a light novel that takes it's inspiration fairly directly from Lovecraft, and was written by the Urobutcher. If you can survive the fairly graphic and disturbing sex scenes, it's got some excellent horror content with a particularly neat aesthetic. It's super disturbing in many ways.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3659997/chapters/8088522][The Northern Caves]] is actually pretty neat horror-ish stuff with a non-neurotypical slant, but the most directly rational horror on AO3 is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868][Cordyceps]], which bills itself as irrationalfic.

I wouldn't have called The Cabin in the Woods horror - for me, the movie (while wonderful) never really evoked any sense of dread or terror because of the framing narrative. For me, I felt the movie to be more of a comedy deconstruction of horror in the same sort of vein of things like [[http://lparchive.org/Illbleed/][Illbleed]]

** I just read someone mentioning the Dunning-Kruger offhandedly (in Twig's comments), and decided to checkout out the Wikipedia article on the subject. It's the phenomenon where people with low knowledge of a subject tend to overestimate their knowledge of it, and people with high knowledge tend to underestimate it.

Now, I'd read/heard about it before, mostly interpreted as "you should be careful teaching things to people or you could make them overconfident" or "this guy thinks he knows a lot about X, that means he doesn't know much", and it feels like a meme that would easily spread by allowing people to be smug about people who disagree with them (not only does he not know the first thing about X, he thinks he knows a lot about X! what an idiot) regardless of its veracity. So I searched for articles criticizing the effect.

Well, it turns out the Dunning-Kruger effect isn't real. The experiment failed to replicate several times, and it has basically no credibility in the psychology community. So I guess everyone who quoted this "science fact" is a gullible idiot, and if you feel like telling them that, well, please don't because this whole paragraph is a lie (also don't repeat what I say without looking things up yourself, dammit). Starting over.

As far as my ten minutes research can tell, there is an effect that does replicate (though only for occidentals? I'm not sure), but the "stupid people think they're smart" meme is basically unfounded. low-skill people tend to overestimate their skill and vice-versa, but perceived skill still augments with actual skill. What happens is people who get a 10 think they have a 40, people who have a 50 think they have a 60, and people who have a 90 think they have a 80. [[http://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/dunning_kruger.png][(see this graph for a more visual explanation)]].

The actual explanation is contested. Dunning and Kruger think that, as people get more skilled, they get more tools to notice their flaws and loose some of their overconfidence in the process. On the other hand, most of the effect might be explained by regression to the mean (most people are terrible at judging their skill, most people think they have a constant high level X, and as they get more skilled their level gets closer to perceived level X, without any learning one's flaws involved).

So, what did I learn today? A. Small Wikipedia articles about psychology can be wrong, or, at least, not as informative as googling "is [X] true?". This really bothers me. B. Quoting psychology experiments to prove a point is a horrible idea and you shouldn't do it even if the experiment agrees with you especially if the experiment agrees with you, especially especially if you haven't at least read the entire Wikipedia article about it. That also goes for the Milgram experiment, the Stanford Prison experiment, that one peer pressure experiment with the short lines and the long lines, or the Rosenhan experiment.

Also, I suggest setting a daily or weekly goal. Like I try to write at least 1000 words a day. Set something achievable like 500 words a day. You may not always meet the goal but most of the time, you will finish your quota. Sometimes you will write much more than expected. Feel free to decrease the quota if it proves itself too much. But try to do your best.

When you see that you are regularly writing much more than the goal specifies, raise it a bit. It will take about a week or two to get comfortable with the new target. If it still gives you trouble then you may have set the target too high. Experiment until you discover your groove. Good luck.

**** Yep, I took like, 18 hours off and I'm already feeling better.

With regards to the quota, that's actually what I'd been doing of my own volition. Great minds think alike, I guess! It's just there'd been a few days where for some reason I didn't feel the need to stop.

** I haven't updated Sanity Falls (a rational Gravity Falls fic) in several months. At first I was just putting it off, but now I'm leaning towards abandoning it outright. I only ever got two chapters in; does anyone strongly object? I feel my efforts would be better-spent elsewhere, but if there's a strong demand for more, I wouldn't want to disappoint.

*** I definitely liked it... But if you are thinking in terms of being a disappointment, that probably isn't a good motivation to write with. As a compromise, think of one or two of the cooler scenes you had planned and write snippets of them and see if your motivation changes. If you still feel like putting it off, drop it then.

*** Agree with others that I enjoyed the 2 chapters you wrote but I will not be disappointed if you choose to focus on something else instead. Plus the imagined disappointment of readers is not a good reason to carry on if you don't otherwise desire to, anyhow.

** What should we do with information that isn't helpful for people to know. For example it is a fact that intelligence is strongly tied to genetics for any reasonable definition of either of those words. Knowing this doesn't help though. In fact, believing this has been shown to correlate with low achievement especially in children. Should we then avoid mentioning this. Should we pretend it's not true?

I'd say probably for one we should have more study. Is it actually the belief that is causal or is it reverse causation. If it's the latter than there is no harm in spreading the info wide and far, but if it's the former we at least need to be careful about publicizing it.

Also totally unrelated, but I just got told that I'm on to start the first phase of technical interviews with Google. Strangely I feel better about that than I do about more standard interviewing so we'll see.

It helps if you're in a position to influence policy. Children genetically doomed to low IQ need a very different kind of help than children who happen to be stuck in a damaging environment/education system.

Also important if you happen to have low-IQ children of your own.

**** So in other words it tells us that no child left behind was a terrible idea and tag line?

The problem is that I'd argue you get minimal gains from that and at the least unlike most info it's not something you wan't to widely spread.

The only way we could resolve that argument with facts is by using that research data.

(Although I agree there's no reason to discuss that information with the children themselves, since they're not usually in a position to influence policy.)

1. Politics is spiders, but I keep seeing the Trump=Hitler meme-set and it's worrisome despite the lack of civility in the WWF world US politics has become.
2. I have a deep conservative/capitalistic/faith in some parts of the system bias I am re-examining; your personal attacks are unwelcome, as are failure to use primary sources, in context, and will only lower my opinion of you. If you don't have an steel-man argument on the topic please don't bother as you'll only increase my bias.
