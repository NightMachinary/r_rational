I'm not sure there is anything a sufficiently advanced alien couldn't do, down to re-wiring me to believe in a specific god. Though that would be a kind of Pyrrhic victory for said alien/god, it meets the victory conditions.

Put into those terms, I guess the answer is "nothing", even if it does succeed, it could still be a trick.

In practice, I doubt I would be as thoroughly rigorous.

Let's try this one on for size:

- The Catholic church, the Anglican church, all the various denominations or protestants and pseudo-protestants, they all shed the 2000 years of obvious nonsense that have been layered on top of their religions, stripping everything from Saul's letters onwards out of their holy books, and the Council of Nicea is undone.
- Priests that are insufficiently Christ-like spontaneously leave the church and take up secular occupations.
- Prayer is unambiguously answered, laying on of hands actually heals people, and so on.

I don't think I'd remain skeptical in that situation. And, hey, that's how things are supposed to be, right?
