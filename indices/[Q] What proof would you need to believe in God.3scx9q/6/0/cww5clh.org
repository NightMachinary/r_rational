Great question, I should have clarified this in the OP. "God" is the creator of our universe and has the attributes and history described in the relevant religious text. An advanced alien either evolved naturally or was created by God, and did not create our universe, although it may have visited earth in the past to do the things attributed to God in religious texts.
