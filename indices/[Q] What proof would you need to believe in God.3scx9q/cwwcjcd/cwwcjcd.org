The last time I was asked this question, I took a certain inspiration from the site "[[http://whywontgodhealamputees.com/][Why won't God heal amputees?]]". Direct experience of such an event could be considered a necessary piece of evidence, if not sufficient in itself. However, since, as I don't anticipate any removed limbs of mine to be able to be replaced, I have no incentive to put any putative deities to the test by removing one of my limbs and having them replace it, I came up with an equivalent test: Just have me grow a new limb, in a fashion current science couldn't manage. A nice, long tail would be ideal.

(Why yes, I did suggest to certain people that if they wanted me to avoid the pains of hellfire for not believing as they did, that they should pray for me to grow a lovely tail. I have no idea whether any of them actually did or not.)
