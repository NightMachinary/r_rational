I could be persuaded into believing in a creator of our universe. I feel like that proof wouldn't even have to be difficult, show me the universe untethered by a linear time point of view. That'd probably do it.

If I was at a bar, and a person sat down next to me and was like "I'm God, check it." And then showed my brain the universe from start to end without the complication of time. I'd totally believe.

The belief wouldn't change anything about my life though. I believe a creator of our universe may exist. I do not believe in God as any religion on Earth frames it, because people are bullshit, and the more people there are, the more bullshit happens. A human being cannot even keep their own memory straight. You can introduce false memories that people will fervently believe are absolute fact with very little coaxing. I can't imagine *any* religion is even *close* to correct on what God is or represents.

I'm not even certain that we're not just like the cells and/or neurons of God's mind. Maybe we're all just autonomic functions of God's being that it is barely aware of.

The average human breathes 12 to 20 times per minute. How many neurons does that take to make sure that task functions? I don't know, but are you aware of every firing of each neuron that it takes to make you breathe roughly 20,000 times per day? Are your cells aware that they are part of a larger being? Awareness relies on definitions of consciousness that the greatest philosophers throughout the ages have yet to come to consensus on.

Do I believe in a creator? I cannot prove or disprove nor am I qualified to make such judgements.

Do I believe in anyone's "God"? I cannot.

I could not accept any religions version of God. Especially a judeo-christian God. Any omnipotent being, who sets moral codes of behavior for humanity and then sits by and allows those doctrines to be blatantly broken, to the suffering of "God's children" is no deity of mine.
