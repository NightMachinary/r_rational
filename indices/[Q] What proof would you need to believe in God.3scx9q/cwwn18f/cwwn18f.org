There's a difference between "prove there is a God" and "make me think the evidence for God is a whole lot better than it is now". Having some entity come down from the heavens and perform a miracle wouldn't prove there is a God; it could be an advanced alien or a magician. But it would certainly be one /step/ towards proving there is a God; my estimate for the chance of God existing would be a lot higher after that.

If the entity were to then explain how many apparently incoherent philosophical claims made by religions really were coherent after all, my estimate would go even higher. Likewise if science suddenly started finding evidence that religious texts predicted things about the real world that could not possibly have been known or guessed by the authors.

At some point, the evidence would be so good that I would agree that there is a God, even though

-- no specific piece of evidence completely proved it and

-- nothing can be proven to certainty.
