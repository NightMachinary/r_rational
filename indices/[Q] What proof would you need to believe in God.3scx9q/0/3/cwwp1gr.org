  for the existence of a religious God, my requirements simplifies to treating religion like any other scientific hypothesis and finding evidence to support it. The main reason why religion isn't considered to be scientific is because the existence of God can't be falsified. But if God exists and there is evidence of God's existence, then we can apply the scientific method to proving God's existence.

I'm not incredibly familiar with the rationalist community but I haven't seen anyone yet talk about the falsifiability vs. verifiability distinction. As you say, what makes a hypothesis "scientific" is that it is falsifiable. But try to create a falsification test that I exist. You cannot, one because to disprove my existence you would need to search the entire universe and not find me and two because I do, in fact, exist. Like my existence, any hypothesis seeking to prove God's existence must be a test of verification. Am I making any sense?

If my argument stands, then searching for God using the scientific method would a bit like looking for a rose while wearing rose colored glasses. You're excluding the possibility of finding it by the method you're employing.
