You can falsify the non existence of something. "All gods are non existent" is a statement. If there's a god outside your house that evidence would make the statement seem unlikely. If all gods are outside your house that statement is very false.

I'm doubtful that scientists actually work with Popper's falsification theories. Some like it, some don't. It was made to try and distinguish science from pseudoscience- the idea that there's some bright line between pseudoscience like astrology and tarot reading and such and astronomy and mathematics that he has found.

But, scientists don't generally actually widely use that as a guide to their experiments. Explanatory power, empirical value, scientific method, and being about reality are also important factors.
