  Well. Obviously. I said that existence of things generally can be proven but not falsified, and conversely that non-existence generally can be falsified but not proven.

Existence often makes claims about specific existence.

For example you might claim "God is existent on Mount Olympus, visible by looking at the thrones and the human like beings on the top in their palace." and that is a very falsifiable statement.

  That's true, because this is not science, it's the philosophy of science. That is, it's relevant in order to demarcate what science is and what science can do. It's of no use when doing science or experimenting.

When trying to demarcate what science is and what it isn't the practical effect is to stop people who make claims like that they can see the future from being in the same boat as people who claim they can make fire come out of metal sticks using gunpowder and metal.

What science do and their experiments is more important than what some random philosophers believe.
