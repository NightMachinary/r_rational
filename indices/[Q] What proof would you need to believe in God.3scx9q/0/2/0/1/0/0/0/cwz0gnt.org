  You can falsify the non existence of something

Well. Obviously. I said that /existence/ of things generally can be proven but not falsified, and conversely that /non-existence/ generally can be falsified but not proven.

  I'm doubtful that scientists actually work with Popper's falsification theories

  scientists don't generally actually widely use that as a guide to their experiments
#+end_quote

That's true, because this is not science, it's the philosophy of science. That is, it's relevant in order to demarcate what science is and what science can do. It's of no use when /doing/ science or experimenting.
