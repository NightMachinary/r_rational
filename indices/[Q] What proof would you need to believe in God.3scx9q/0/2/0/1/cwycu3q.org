  God's existence is famously unfalsifiable, since religious people like to point out that if God exists (and is omnipotent) he can easily confound any tool used to look for him.

That would make the non existence unfalsifiable. The existence could be easier to falsify. If God was dancing around on your streets throwing thunderbolts around that would be easy enough to test.
