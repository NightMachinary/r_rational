Ah, just to head off communication issues before they happen, I should mention that I'm an agnost. With that said, I feel like you should avoid statements like: "how the mighty have fallen". It needlessly polarizes a discussion, and is basically acting anti-rationally.

Aside from that, I do not believe falsifiability to be a necessary condition, for the scientific method to be applicable. As I stated above, that limitation would restrict the domain of science, to axiomatic systems; and while we all agree that math is the foundation of science, I do not think anyone would say it is it's sum total.

So, if I'm understanding your thoughts correctly (which you may correct me on, if I am not). You believe religion to be non-scientific, on account of the inability to use evidence to refute it. But the same can be said for any other hypothesis, in the same vein as the story of the Dragon in the Garage ([[http://lesswrong.com/lw/i4/belief_in_belief/]]).

The point I was getting at in my previous post, is that, in order to gain information one needs to make certain assumptions. An example of a common assumption is Occam's razor, but one can make alternate assumptions (Such as, a religious one). How you treat evidence, is dependent on this perspective.

Under this guise one can think of rationality, as a sort of meta level assumption. In words it would be something like: 'I will assume that which will increase my expected utility, by the largest amount'. Which means people who hold a /belief in belief/, are generally acting irrationally.

Now, it is my personal *opinion*, that arguments in favour of religion are as irrational, as arguments in favour of the sky being green. But under another set of assumptions, I could be made to believe otherwise. This does not affect the applicability of gathering evidence, either for or against a hypothesis, it only reflects my personal assumptions. So as per my previous post, it isn't the hypothesis which is non-scientific, it is the people.
