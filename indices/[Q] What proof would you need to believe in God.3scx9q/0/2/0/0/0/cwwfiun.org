  statements like: "how the mighty have fallen". It needlessly polarizes a discussion, and is basically acting anti-rationally.
#+end_quote

Really? That wasn't my intention at all, I only meant it as a commentary on how organised religions have gone from being dominant world powers to the lesser position they have today. Maybe I could have been clearer! I think that everyone can agree on that, regardless of whether one is religious or not, so I hope it doesn't polarise any debate.

  I do not believe falsifiability to be a necessary condition, for the scientific method to be applicable.
#+end_quote

Well, this right here is the root of the matter then. By definition, scientific claims must be falsifiable (they must make predictions that can be tested), otherwise it is not scientific.

  You believe religion to be non-scientific, on account of the inability to use evidence to refute it. But the same can be said for any other hypothesis, in the same vein as the story of the Dragon in the Garage
#+end_quote

I know religion to be non-scientific, and I disagree that this can be said about any other hypothesis, though it can be said about some. For instance, my statement /the sun will rise before 07:00 tomorrow morning/ makes a prediction and is quite testable. The claim /there's a dragon in my garage/ (without modifiers) is also testable, and thus subject to scientific inquiry, but the claim /there's a dragon in my garage and there is absolutely no way to tell/ is not. I hope that explains the point.

The fact that God's existence isn't a scientific hypothesis means that it's hard to gather strong evidence against it, but it also means that the claim in itself is "weak" in the sense that it isn't very useful. After all, what's the point of knowledge if it can't be applied to other knowledge in some way, such as making predictions?

Now comes the part where I think we will agree: the fact that God's existence can't be directly tested means that we can't acquire any hard knowledge on the matter, but that doesn't mean we can't make an estimate with educated guesses. So, we can assign some sort of probability (or rather an interval of probabilities) to the existence of God, not because it is a scientific hypothesis but because it is a statement about our world, and they can all be assigned some probabilities. The key point here is that our guesses about non-scientific claims will be much more loose than our guesses about scientific statements, all other things being equal, which is mirrored in the width of the probability interval. With the specific case about God we do have an advantage; we have a very long period of data to review. Nowhere in recorded history is there any evidence for God's existence, which do give our estimation some strength simply by virtue of a lot of correlated data.

  it isn't the hypothesis which is non-scientific, it is the people.
#+end_quote

In conclusion, the hypothesis is non-scientific, and so are the people.
