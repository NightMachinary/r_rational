  The main reason why religion isn't considered to be scientific is because the existence of God can't be falsified.

Eh, I don't really think anything can be considered to be non-scientific. Basically all proofs made outside of axiomatic systems, are going to be probabilistic.

If we pick another hypothesis like: 'the sky is green'. Then if we observe evidence to the contrary, I can make a hypothesis to explain the new data such as: 'the Illuminati hypnotised everyone'. Even though we might scoff at it and call it a rationalization, it is still a valid hypothesis.

The only difference between 'the sky is green' and 'god exists' is the number of people willing to support it. So it's not the hypothesis which is non-scientific it's just people not acting rationally.
