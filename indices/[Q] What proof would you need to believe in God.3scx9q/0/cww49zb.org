An exorbitant amount.

It'd be comparatively easy to prove that a godlike being exists when compared to the amount of evidence it'd take to prove a God from the Abrahamic religions does in fact exist.

A godlike being could convince me of its power by preforming actions which either breaks the laws of physics as I currently understand it (assuming that I am capable of seeing through any 'tricks' to fake the abilities) or feats which are impossible for current level of technology.

Note that the above cases are distinguishing between supernatural abilities, or highly advanced aliens.

However for the existence of a religious God, my requirements simplifies to treating religion like any other scientific hypothesis and finding evidence to support it. The main reason why religion isn't considered to be scientific is because the existence of God can't be falsified. But if God exists and there is evidence of God's existence, then we can apply the scientific method to proving God's existence.

After all of that, it'd boil down to me deciding between the existence of God, or me living in some stimulation of the universe with a construct of God. Evidence sufficient to convince me of a God as described by Judaism, Christianity, Muslim, or others of a similar type would require events such as religious prophecies coming true, priests/rabbi/mullah developing genuine abilities which can't be replicated by science in any form, *AND* the revelation of a valid argument for how an omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, and omnibenevolent God could exist while allowing the current state of the world to occur.
