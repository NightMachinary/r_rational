I'm not entirely sure, but I think the point that the argument is making is that God is only allowing our current universe to exist is because God has already created all other possible universes which are more 'good' from an objective point and if our universe is any more 'good', it'd be identical to one of the other universes already created.

  The need for many universes seems like they are existing only for us to compare against.

That's kinda the point of the argument.

Although....it brings up the interesting scenario, is there any reason for God to have created our particular current universe, assuming that there is only ever exactly one universe?
