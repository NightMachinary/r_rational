That argument almost works to convince me that a moral God can exist and still allow evil to occur. It just means God has decided that it's more important to have a large quantity of goodness even if it allows a small amount of evil over a small amount of good with no evil at all.

I wouldn't agree with the morality of such a God, but it works well enough to convince me that a benevolent (by my standards) God can exist and still allow the current world to exist. Congratulations! You have convinced someone on the Internet!

Of course, this brings up the question can a objective moral system exist where it is considered good from every individual's subjective perspective?

This is a hard problem in logic and philosophy where you can have different axiomatic systems which are each internally consistent, but disagree with each other.

Note that I'm distinguishing between a God who follows a moral system (especially one we can understand and agree with) which seems to be the type you are describing, and a God who is perceived as 'good' by every single sapient being which every religion uses to persuade people by saying "You can't question God, He's perfect in every possible way! Never mind that it's logically impossible!".
