Seems like for any morality system you could define a (possibly very ugly, possibly just an arbitrary list of values) function M1 = f(x) that outputs the moral value of any possible action.

There is exactly one moral system defined by M2 = -f(x), the function of an agent who would be seen as pure perfect evil under M1. (and to it, agents operating under M1 would be seen as pure perfect evil)

Any summing or averaging or integrating of all possible moral systems seems like it would produce a function that calls every possible action morally neutral, ie 0.
