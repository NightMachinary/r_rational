  integrate over all the subjective moralities

That doesn't make sense to me. What does it mean to integrate over multiple moralities? Also, there is no guarantee that it's even possible to reconcile different moral systems.

For example, our culture considers cannibalism to be a deeply unethical act (barring circumstances where both people would starve to death otherwise). However, there have been other cultures throughout history who considered it to be a necessary ethical behavior to eat the flesh of our ancestors once they have passed on out of a 'life is a cycle' style philosophy.

How do you reconcile two moral systems who have opposite opinions of the same action?
