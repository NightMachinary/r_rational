To echo some other comments here: I will treat [X] as if [X] = [Y] if enough evidence is provided that [X] = [Y] is the most compelling hypothesis.

To portray this in terms of Occam's Razor: badly-faked, it's a simpler proposition that [X] is only pretending to be [Y] and is in fact something else. Perfectly faked, it's a more complex proposition to imagine levels of pretending (more so if successive). The most likely version of reality will be treated as true, always while keeping in mind that I could in fact be a brain in a tank or a vacuum fluctuation or similar. (There's the perspective of 'if someone is willing to go to these lengths to fool me by satisfying my curiosity, I might as well give up and reward their dedication'.)

In practice, both 'reality as consistent with that deity existing actually make sense' and 'it doesn't just make sense, something with that level of control actually exists' would need to be demonstrated, at least ideally. If minds really didn't die when they were thought to, but 'woke up' from a simulation (or afterlife, et cetera) then a lot could be explained in terms of permitted ethics (though easily disagreed with, regarding suffering). For example, I'd be much more okay with {agreeing beforehand to put myself through the fear of death without risk of death} than I would be with actually facing the risk of death, and I might be willing to forgive a lot if I learned I had never actually risked death. That said, while it would be wonderful if there weren't actually any risk of death, it's not at all convincing that that's the case, and so it is wholly appropriate to act as though there's no safety net. ...though then there's the valid perspective of 'even if a being shows you an afterlife, should you devote your life to immortality research to improve your chances in the slim-subjective-probability event that you're being tricked?'.

If your brain's inner workings are being messed with, then your final mental state is disconnected from your processing intentions beforehand in any case.
