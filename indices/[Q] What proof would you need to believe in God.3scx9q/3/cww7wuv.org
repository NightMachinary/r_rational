Depends precisely what sort of theology you're looking to prove.

For Biblical literalism, well, that conception of God might as well be a sufficiently advanced reality warper, so hey, just show me the sufficiently advanced reality warping. You'll have a hard time convincing me you're the only SARW around, or the precise one featured in the Bible, but hey, that's because your powers are so advanced the likelihood functions for "can you do that?!" go to almost 1.0 everywhere.

If you're going for some more Medieval "ground of being" metaphysical stuff, then I consider it logically incoherent and will require infinite proof, or at least, proof at the levels of abstraction where I consider the incoherency to exist.
