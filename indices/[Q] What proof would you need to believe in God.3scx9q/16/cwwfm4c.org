You'd have to disprove the very system that makes proof a thing (logic, non contradiction). So basically, there's no amount of evidence that would prove the existence of the Abrahamic god. If you had such evidence, evidence becomes meaningless.

This is similar to asking how much evidence it'd take to prove reality is an illusion.
