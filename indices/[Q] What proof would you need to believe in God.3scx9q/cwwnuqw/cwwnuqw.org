Depends on your definition. If you just mean "omnipotent" then sure, that's pretty straightforward -- or, at least, it can convince me that it's so powerful that it might as well be considered omnipotent.

If you also need "Creator of the universe" then pretty much nothing. It could show me the universe without time so that I can see it doing the creation and I'd have no reason to believe that that was a true vision.

Well, it could always tweak my brain to force me to believe, but that's not what you're asking.
