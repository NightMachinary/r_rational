Consider a multiversal approach to your idea of going back in time to kill yourself.

Physicists like to make thought experiments within a multiverse approach. Where being every choice on the quantum level makes a universe with every possible quantum state. Now think about that from a linear time traveller.

As soon as the time traveller decides to go back in time they are creating an endless amount of possibility, (if the standard model holds true) thus anything they are /going/ to do, as in actions in their own personal future on a linear time scale, will create the universes necessary to accomplish any task regardless how improbable the time traveller's actions may be. This universe creation includes futures where the time traveller travels back in time to kill themselves.

However since the time travelling happened in the future from when the time traveller decided to go into the past, then travelling into the past is not necessarily in the same universe, maybe the time traveller was shunted into another universe.

Even if it was the same universe that the time traveller traveled into the past to, as soon as the time traveller kills their past self, then the time traveller may be shunted into a new quantum reality the moment when they've killed their past self. A universe where this very thing has happened.

Now framing this into the original idea of an omnipotent God. Perhaps the omnipotent God exists across and maybe even outside all multiverses simultaneously, reasonably an omnipotent God could create, destroy and alter all realities and itself. Could an omnipotent God create an object that God couldn't destroy? Yes, and no: at the same time. It depends on the scope of perspective really.

Could God create a universe where it sets the rules for itself that it cannot destroy objects? If God is omnipotent then yes, it could. An omnipotent God would be able to limit it's omnipotence without limit, but still retain omnipotence.

Sort of like Schrodinger's cat, the wave function is only collapsed when an outside perspective is inteoduced making either the yes or the no true. However if God's Perspective is the only perspective in a universe where the omnipotent God limited its omnipotence and created an object it couldn't destroy, then from the singular perspective that is true, that object cannot be destroyed by God.

Though that's just in that particular singular reality. If you are asking the blanket statement of "can an omnipotent God create an object it cannot destroy" then that answer should be yes. But that does not mean the omnipotent God is not omnipotent, just that there was a self-imposed restriction of omnipotence by making multiple realities where in one reality the answer was yes, and another reality is no.
