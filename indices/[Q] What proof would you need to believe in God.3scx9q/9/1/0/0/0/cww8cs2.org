Is omniscience necessarily an attribute of God? There seems to be mixed evidence from religious texts as to whether God is truly omniscient. If God admitted not knowing something, would that make him not God? What about the paradoxes that happen when omniscience conflicts with omnipotence? If God knows something is going to happen does he not have the power to change it?
