[[http://genius.com/Philip-k-dick-faith-of-our-fathers-annotated][Link here]] if you want to read the whole story.

When God (or the Demiurge, arguably, given PKD's gnosticism) appears:

#+begin_quote
  It was terrible; it blasted him with its awareness. As it moved it drained the life from each person in turn; it ate the people who had assembled, passed on, ate again, ate more with an endless appetite.
#+end_quote

Part of Tung Chien's internal monologue:

#+begin_quote
  I see that Arabic poem, the searching for the flowers of life to each them -- I see you astride the plain which to you is Earth, plain without hills, without valleys. You go anywhere, appear any time, devour anything; you engineer life and then guzzle it, and you enjoy that.
#+end_quote

There are some other relevant passages, but they lose a lot of oomph without context. Basically, God/Demiurge created living things in order to snack on their souls.

(And apparently there are worse things than it out there)
