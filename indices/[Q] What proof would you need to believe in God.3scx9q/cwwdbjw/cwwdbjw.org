Even if I watched a deity resurrect christ, I would still not believe that god was what it claimed to be. Not just in the sense of never being able to be absolutely sure of what I'm seeing, I mean in the sense that Yahweh appears to be lying about its own motivations, and that the things it has said about itself don't seem to be actually useful for predicting its future actions.

It seems very very strange to me that it does not seem that anyone in this religion has discussed the possibility that their god which claims to be able to do anything, which clearly needs us for something, and is unwilling or unable to intervene beyond a certain point, might have lied to us about anything at all.
