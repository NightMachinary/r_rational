Ok I see what you mean now about the parts that I quoted. However, if God explained to you that he intentionally erased the evidence of the flood and planted false evidence of no worldwide flood happening, that would be at least logically possible, unlike an omnipotent being.

As to your Kryptonian point, that still seems to me to be a strange bar to set for the supernatural. There are plenty of logically possible feats that a hypothetical alien race could achieve that are outside the capability of humans and that would not prove the existence of any gods. Still, I applaud you on your knowledge of the example you chose. I didn't know that about Lex.
