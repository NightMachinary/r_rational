Hmm. Good point. It seems like most conceptions of God are that he exists outside of the universe (since he created it) and is not bound by its laws. In some sense, anything that interacts with our universe, whether it follows the perceived laws of nature or not, must be natural, but at that point the definition becomes so broad as to be almost unusable.
