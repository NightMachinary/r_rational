No. You should reread this conversation again and really think about it, because you are entirely missing the point again. His point is that there are some things that by their very nature are impossible no matter how much power you have. Something is not logically impossible just because you aren't powerful enough to do it.

"Logical impossibility. a condition or statement involving contradiction or absurdity; as, that a thing can be and not be at the same time."
