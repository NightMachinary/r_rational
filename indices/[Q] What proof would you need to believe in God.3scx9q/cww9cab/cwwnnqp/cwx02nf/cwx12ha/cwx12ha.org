That isn't really what [[/u/eaglejarl]] is saying. No matter how powerful a being, or what physical laws it obeys, it cannot do something logically self-contradictory. If you were powerful enough, you could perform magic, but no matter how powerful you are, you can't make a circle with corners, because by definition, a circle has no corners. An omnipotent being could create the universe, but couldn't make 2+2=5 without changing the definition of one of those terms.
