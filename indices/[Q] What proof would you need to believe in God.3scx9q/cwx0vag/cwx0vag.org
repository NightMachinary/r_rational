Omniscient God? No amount of proof will convince me. Mind can *never* be sure it knows everything. First, there are unknown unknowns. Things like "Am I on top of existence, or simulated on computer set up by other agent" or there could be other Universe, completely disconnected/not interacting with it's own.

No one can rule this out.

And knowing everything... umm... recursively explodes. Mind can't know all of it's implementation details at once. Because then it needs additional memory and computing capabilities, which themselves are part of the mind, so it needs additional memory and computing capabilities....
