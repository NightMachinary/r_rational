That's very interesting. Many people who are religious believe in their belief, but aren't actually capable of the core belief. In other words, their self image includes them believing in God, but deep down, they don't truly hold that belief. [[/u/EliezerYudkowsky]] wrote a very interesting [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/i4/belief_in_belief/][article]] on this topic that is worth reading if you haven't yet. I came from a very religious household, and after long discussions with my parents, I am confident that my mother truly believes deep down, while my father only has a belief in his belief.
