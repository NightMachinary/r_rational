This is a really well thought out reply. Perhaps there could be a God that retreats upon examination, like a computer simulation creating more and more of the map as you explore. E.g., there was no need for atoms or quantum particles until people performed experiments that demanded answers. Or the only stars that existed were the ones visible to the naked eye, until the telescope was invented. I'm not sure exactly where I'm going with this, but I'm sympathetic to your point and I think it's a reasonable position. I suspect the best answer we have is that humans have evolved an evolutionary bias towards believing in the supernatural because those types of beliefs and resulting actions have kept us alive through either rudimentary science or social cohesion.
