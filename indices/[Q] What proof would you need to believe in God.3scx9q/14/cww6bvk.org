Very little to believe he exists. To let it actually alter my paths, a lot more. I've examined my internal beliefs, and I do believe in God. I just don't believe in that belief. I disbelieve my belief, so to speak. It's a facet of my upbringing- i know there's no reason to believe he exists, but at the lower levels, i believe in him. if i stop and think i don't, but until then i do.

I don't believe in him at the level in the religious texts... but i do believe he exists, even if as propoganda and excessively moral absolutist.

In other words, in the same way i know reality is really made up of lots of complex things, i know god doesn't exist. but in the same way i don't conciously think of everything being made up of atoms, when i'm not conciously planning it, i'm far too superstitous.

It wouldn't take a ton to prove his existence beyond my doubt level because of that, but for me to think it's worth changing plans would require substantial proof and deviation from the religious norm.
