Sure, but in my hypothetical, the being claiming to be God is actually God, and merely wants to convince you of his identity, using your own standards of proof and logic. There is no penalty for disbelieving and he won't supernaturally alter your brain to make you believe. However, he does present himself and is perfectly willing to accommodate any demand of proof you can think of.
