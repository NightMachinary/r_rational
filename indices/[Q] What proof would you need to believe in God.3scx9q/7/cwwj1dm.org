A definition of "god" that is sufficiently rigorous to discuss, and which implies some testable difference between a world in which he exists and world in which he does not. And then multiple tests of that difference, and a few years of analysis attempting to come up with alternative explanations.

If /you/ are God, then the proof I require can easily be provided by simply making all diseases non-contagious for one year, and causing a pizza to appear spontaneously in my living room. And if you could tell the zealots to lay off the gays, I'd appreciate it.
