A God that fulfills the conditions of theodicy? There's no such proof. The existence of any such evidence is a logical impossibility.

In fact, the amount of power I can absolutely believe any godlike entity to possess in defiance of physical laws is bounded by the power needed to make me hallucinate completely, i.e. the power needed to control most of my brain chemistry and sensory inputs, and that's not much at all.
