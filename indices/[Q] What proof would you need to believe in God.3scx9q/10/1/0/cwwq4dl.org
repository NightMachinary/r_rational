Not by itself, no. But remember, just as every theory needs to pay rent in anticipated experiences, every question has to pay rent by letting you change your behaviour depending on the answer. If a putative deity can't do at /least/ one small miracle on demand, then I have no reason to put said deity to further questioning. Thus, growing a tail is a particular example of a class of miracles, the demonstration of any one of which would be necessary to start considering further questions and evidence, even if, on their own, they are insufficient to differentiate between God and aliens.

Having heard of various stories where someone demanded, "Prove your power by doing X!", and having X demonstrated to the demander's sorrow, out of that class of miracles I simply picked one that had the combination of highest predictive power (as in, being incredibly unlikely to happen without Something Unusual going on) and the least likelihood of my regretting it should it actually happen (ie, I'm reasonably confident that I could live a happy life with such a tail).

This particular piece of evidence also has the interesting property of, very likely, being time-limited; in that, depending on certain advancements in various possible technologies - robotics and cybernetics and human-computer interfaces, or biotechnology, or uploading minds into software form with customizable virtual bodies - then me living with a tail may turn out to be something that can be accomplished within the century, without any alien or divine intervention required.
