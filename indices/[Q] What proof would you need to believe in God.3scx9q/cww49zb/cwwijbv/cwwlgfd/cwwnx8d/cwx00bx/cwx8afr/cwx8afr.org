When he says 'integrate over all the subjective moralities' I believe he's just saying to take the average over everyone's individual subjective morality. I can't write it well in reddit's markup, but take its own actions, and sum how moral those are perceived to be by EVERYONE, and divide by number of people judging you.

In your example of cannibalism (good choice, btw), a 'omnibenevolent' being would seek to maximize their total moral character as seen by everyone - thus, if more people think allowing cannibalism is morally abhorrent than not, it is not allowed.

Caveat to all the prior: I don't actually agree with this as a sound moral framework, as it inevitably leads to tyranny of the majority extending to definitions of morals. It is, however, an interesting model, and one I can see a bit of in society as a whole; once something gets majority approval, it ceases to be morally repugnant for that society.
