  AND the revelation of a valid argument for how an omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, and omnibenevolent God could exist while allowing the current state of the world to occur.

I didn't think I'd find a good answer to that question. But then I read [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/15/answer-to-job/][this]]. (Although I still don't believe for the other reasons you list):

  Job asked: “God, why do bad things happen to good people? Why would You, who are perfect, create a universe filled with so much that is evil?”

  Then the Lord spoke to Job out of the whirlwind, saying “WHAT KIND OF UNIVERSE WOULD YOU PREFER ME TO HAVE CREATED?”

  Job said “A universe that was perfectly just and full of happiness, of course.”

  “OH,” said God. “YES, I CREATED ONE OF THOSE. IT'S EXACTLY AS NICE AS YOU WOULD EXPECT.”

  Job facepalmed. “But then why would You also create this universe?”

  Answered God: “DON'T YOU LIKE EXISTING?”

  “Yes,” said Job, “but all else being equal, I'd rather be in the perfectly just and happy universe.”

  “OH, DON'T WORRY,” said God. “THERE'S A VERSION OF YOU IN THAT UNIVERSE TOO. HE SAYS HI.”

  “Okay,” said Job, very carefully. “I can see I'm going to have to phrase my questions more specifically. Why didn't You also make this universe perfectly just and happy?”

  “BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HAVE TWO IDENTICAL INDIVIDUALS. IF YOU HAVE A COMPUTATIONAL THEORY OF IDENTITY, THEN TWO PEOPLE WHOSE EXPERIENCE IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SATURATED BY BLISS ARE JUST ONE PERSON. IF I MADE THIS UNIVERSE EXACTLY LIKE THE HAPPY AND JUST UNIVERSE, THEN THERE WOULD ONLY BE THE POPULATION OF THE HAPPY AND JUST UNIVERSE, WHICH WOULD BE LESS GOOD THAN HAVING THE POPULATION OF THE HAPPY AND JUST UNIVERSE PLUS THE POPULATION OF ONE EXTRA UNIVERSE THAT IS AT LEAST SOMEWHAT HAPPY.”

  “Hmmmmm. But couldn't You have have made this universe like the happy and just universe except for one tiny detail? Like in that universe, the sun is a sphere, but in our universe, the sun is a cube? Then you would have individuals who experienced a spherical sun, and other individuals who experienced a cubic sun, which would be enough to differentiate them.”

  “I DID THAT TOO. I HAVE CREATED ALL POSSIBLE PERMUTATIONS OF THE HAPPY AND JUST UNIVERSE AND ITS POPULACE.”

  “All of them? That would be...a lot of universes.”

  “NOT AS MANY AS YOU THINK.” said God. “IN THE END IT TURNED OUT TO BE ONLY ABOUT 10^{10^(10^(10^(10^{984}}))). AFTER THAT I RAN OUT OF POSSIBLE PERMUTATIONS OF UNIVERSES THAT COULD REASONABLY BE DESCRIBED AS PERFECTLY HAPPY AND JUST. SO I STARTED CREATING ONES INCLUDING SMALL AMOUNTS OF EVIL.”

  “Small amounts! But the universe has...”

  “I WAS NOT REFERRING TO YOUR UNIVERSE. I EXHAUSTED THOSE, AND THEN I STARTED CREATING ONES INCLUDING IMMENSE AMOUNTS OF EVIL.”

  “Oh.” Then: “What, exactly, is Your endgame here?”

  “I AM OMNIBENEVOLENT. I WANT TO CREATE AS MUCH HAPPINESS AND JOY AS POSSIBLE. THIS REQUIRES INSTANTIATING ALL POSSIBLE BEINGS WHOSE TOTAL LIFETIME HAPPINESS IS GREATER THAN THEIR TOTAL LIFETIME SUFFERING.” ...
