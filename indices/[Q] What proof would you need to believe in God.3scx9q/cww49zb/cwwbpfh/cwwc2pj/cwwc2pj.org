While I agree with you that scientific methods can help us estimate the probability of God's existence, /technically/ only falsifiable theories can be scientific theories. God's existence is famously unfalsifiable, since religious people like to point out that if God exists (and is omnipotent) he can easily confound any tool used to look for him. While that's true, it's an extremely cheap argument to try to explain the lack of God around us. To me at least, it's a clear sign that religious people are starting to give up, how the mighty have fallen.
