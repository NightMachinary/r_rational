Hmm, I understand what you mean but that isn't called "falsified." After all, if God exists then the claim that he does exist isn't false. In that case his existence will be said to have been proven, not falsified.

In general, propositions can often be /either/ proven or falsified, not both. The existence of things can be proven if they are found, but are hard to falsify since we might not have found them yet. Scientific theories are never proven, but are used as long as no one has successfully falsified them by finding enough discordant data to convince the consensus of scientists in that field. Even when falsified, a scientific theory might be usable under certain conditions: the case with Isaac Newton's laws is one of the most obvious ones. Einstein's theory of relativity successfully falsified Newton's earlier theory, and showed that Newton's laws doesn't always work when describing the movement of an object. However, Newton's formulae are much simpler, so if one is considering a thrown tennis ball (that moves significantly slower than light) everyone still uses the old way.
