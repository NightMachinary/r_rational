  By definition, scientific claims must be falsifiable

I agree with you, but I think our reasons for agreeing on this are different.

AFAIK, "Science" is a method to determine better/best/good questions. Ideally, you can use information theory and Science! to determine the "question which will teach you the most" (information quotient), although I don't think that's usually possible. Still, ideals to strive for and all that.

As such, non-falsifiable claims aren't useful (scientific) because they cannot result in questions with answers.

Note that this means Science! can be applied to subjective things, which is pretty cool (it's just that the subjective learning can't be applied to other people).
