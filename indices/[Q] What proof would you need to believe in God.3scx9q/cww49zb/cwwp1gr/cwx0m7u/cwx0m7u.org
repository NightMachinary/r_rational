FOR EVERYONE - Here's a good [[http://www.openscience.org/blog/?p=312][link]] that better sums up the difference between falsification and verification for anyone reading this who may be confused.

FOR RATIONALFIDEISM - You are right that proving your non-existence is difficult because it requires searching the entire universe for you or evidence of your existence (for example this post is sufficient to prove you exist even though I have never seen you in person). It is only after searching the entire universe (or just planet since you are assumed to be human) that I can actually say that you don't officially exist.

However, the above paragraph has detailed an entire procedure for how I can conceivably prove the statement 'Rationalfidiesm doesn't exist'. When it comes to God, there is no test that I can even conceive of to prove to people that God doesn't exist. It's only the fact that we have never found evidence of God weakly proves the statement 'God doesn't exist' (I know other people think they have found proof, but I don't consider anything in religion to be evidence).

To clarify further, let's do a thought experiment. Pretend for a moment that a subatomic physicist has been thrown to the ancient past of humanity around 100 B.C. There is no way for him to recreate any of his physics experiments to prove his knowledge due to lacking the advance technology to prove it. Yet he can still imagine some theoretical test which doesn't violate any laws of physics (otherwise it'd be just a thought experiment), making his knowledge falsifiable.

It basically boils down to whether or not that there exists some potential test to disprove your statement (regardless of the feasibility of your test) that determines whether or not the statement is falsifiable.
