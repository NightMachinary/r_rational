You can solve the existence thing by cutting existence down into parts or 'dissolving the hypothesis' into smaller chunks.

I could be wanting information of many kinds.

Like I can ask a question "is there a shape of matter which obstructs moving sticks through it that matches your shape definition?" that is easier to falsify and test.

To be more specific and even more broken down I can test "Is there a shape of matter defined as you that obstructs me moving a stick through it which is actually in reach of my stick poking?"

We can break down to simpler or move on to different discrete tests for the capabilities/properties of 'things' like 'god' and 'you' until we run out of attention, resources or questions that are useful.

So yes I can't falsify 'you existing' but I can narrow down the properties about your hypothesis of 'you existing' until I don't care about whatever extra semantics you want to throw at it.
