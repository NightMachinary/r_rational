  It's almost tragic that even if there is a God, there isn't really any fair way it could convince us of its authenticity.

Well, my parents can't convince me of their authenticity either, if we're being truly skeptical. But at some point you just say 'well this seems to be a reliable hypothesis' and run with it.

I don't leave my house by the second-storey window, I know I can get food at the supermarket, I know I'll be able to check reddit by turning on my computer, and if some 'God' rocked up and started showing off, I wouldn't be worrying about demons, aliens, simulations or delusions for long.
