Let me rephrase the question for you:

A being claiming to be the God of the (Torah/Bible/Koran) appears, and he wants to convince you of his identity without manipulating your mind and solely by providing whatever evidence you request. His goal is to honestly convince you of his identity by argument and evidence. You may demand any proof you can think of that could convince you that he is who he claims to be. He won't use his power to "cheat" in any way, unless you specifically ask him to supernaturally change your mind. What proof do you ask for?
