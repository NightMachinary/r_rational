Well... god/like/. And presumably somewhat commutative, as our universe-sim could have been created by a being just dicking around with a Build Your Own Universe kit, or a kid playing a game which simulates a universe for the game characters to exist in (and we're procedurally-generated NPCs on the edge of the map). The beings who built the kit or game might not be the ones responsible for it coming up with our particular universe.

Heck, if it's a game engine, it might provide a game arena by simulating a Big Bang and a trillion years of fast-forwarded evolution before the game starts. We could just be part of the automatic precalculation process; extrauniversal beings might not start interacting with our simulated spacetime continuum until well after our sun goes dark.
