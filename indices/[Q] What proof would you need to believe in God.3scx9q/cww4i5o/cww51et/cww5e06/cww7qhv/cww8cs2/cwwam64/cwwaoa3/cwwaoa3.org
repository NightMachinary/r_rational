Correct. And omnipotence creates its own host of paradoxes. However, the God of the bible is not omnipotent (according to some interpretations- "almighty" notwithstanding) because there are things that he cannot do; e.g. he cannot lie. He's also not omniscient because there are things he doesn't know (Depart from me etc. etc. I never knew you).
