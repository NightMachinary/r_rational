I was referring to Titus 1:2 (KJV) "In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began". The church I used to attend interpreted this as a literal restriction on God's possible behavior. Although I was never sure if God prevented from saying something untrue, or if by virtue of saying it, he made it true (i.e. God cannot say, "The sky is green" vs if God says "The sky is green" the sky would instantly turn green.)
