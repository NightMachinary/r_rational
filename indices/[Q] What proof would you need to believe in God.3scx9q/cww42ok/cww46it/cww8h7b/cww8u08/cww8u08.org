I'd go the other way around. You might as well assume they're telling the truth about their power, but scrutinize everything else incredibly closely. xe may be all powerful, but if he cares to trick you, you have leverage. Of course, I'm paranoid about single omnipotent beings- we got powerful by working together, and while some are more powerful than others, the same reason i can be doing this translocationist magic is other people worked to create it. Either xe is omnipotent- what happened to the others- xe is a collective- in which case everyone he cared about before today is himself- or xe is a single, isolated instance- in which case, why should i expect unity amoung your number.
