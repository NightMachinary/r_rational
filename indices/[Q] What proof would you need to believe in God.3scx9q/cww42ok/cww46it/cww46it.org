I agree with your first sentence for the most part. As to the second, is that because they wouldn't be meaningfully distinguishable from what we perceive as "God"? Or because it would be dangerous to doubt such a being? Or because you think it's likely that any being that claimed to be the same one depicted in our mythology most likely is?
