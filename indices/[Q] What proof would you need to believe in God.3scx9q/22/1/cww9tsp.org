  all gods who freed the Jews from slavery in Egypt, who created grass before the Sun, who caused a worldwide flood that killed all but a few people, who sacrifice their son as an act of goodness and forgiveness, or who led King CyberHitler the 14th of Japan to victory over the Scientologists in 13BC at the battle of Waterloo.

I completely agree with the first part, that any God that is logically inconsistent or paradoxical cannot exist. But why would a God who acts in the ways you described in the quote above be a being you could not believe in, even with any proof you could demand? Those are falsifiable claims about actions in the past or future that such that it could provide proof of its participation.

This seems like a low bar. Plenty of Kryptonians could easily perform feats beyond the ability of humans to duplicate. If Superman arrived here and claimed to be God the creator, you would have plenty of reason to doubt him, despite his blatant supernatural abilities. I think your criteria are all necessary but still insufficient because they don't rule out very powerful aliens. They also don't rule out insanity or a simulation, but I'm not sure if that's even logically possible. What do you think?
