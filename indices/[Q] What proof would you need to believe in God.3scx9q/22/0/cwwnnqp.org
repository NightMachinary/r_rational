  The first necessary but insufficient condition is that the proposed god must not be self-contradictory. If it's self-contradictory, then I don't need any evidence at all: It doesn't exist. This rules out all omnipotent gods, all omnipresent gods, all omniscient gods, all omnibenevolent gods,

Seems to me that you can have some of those traits while still being consistent, if you add the minor restriction that omnipotence is defined as "can do anything that is not logically self-contradictory". So, an omnipotent being can't (eg) make a round square, but can rearrange every star in the heavens to spell your name.

A god could be (omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent){1-3} or (omnibenevolent, omnipresent){1-2} but also completely {apathetic, !empathy){1-2}; that would match what we see. It's only when you add omnibenevolent to the first set that you have a problem. A being could also be omnibenevolent and lack the power to effect change. (Whether this is a god is an open question.)

Side note: my iPhone knows "omnipotent" and "omniscient" but not "omnibenevolent". There's a joke in there somewhere about corporate beliefs and Apple's culture.
