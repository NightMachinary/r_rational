Once you water down omnipotence in such a way, it makes me omnipotent. I'm a being made of some finite number of physics-obeying particles in a particular configuration. It's logically self-contradictory for me to perform magic. So everything I can't do is handwaved away by your definition. I'm omnipotent! Hooray! And omnipotence is now meaningless as a word. All the other omni-attributes also fail on their own.
