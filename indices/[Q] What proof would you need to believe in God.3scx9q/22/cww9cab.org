The first necessary but insufficient condition is that the proposed god must not be self-contradictory. If it's self-contradictory, then I don't need any evidence at all: It doesn't exist. This rules out all omnipotent gods, all omnipresent gods, all omniscient gods, all omnibenevolent gods, any gods that "ever" exist "outside of" space or time, and all gods who freed the Jews from slavery in Egypt, who created grass before the Sun, who caused a worldwide flood that killed all but a few people, who sacrifice their son as an act of goodness and forgiveness, or who led King CyberHitler the 14th of Japan to victory over the Scientologists in 13BC at the battle of Waterloo.

The second necessary but insufficient condition is that it must be explicable. If it took the time to explain itself to me, it would help, but with sufficient scrutiny of the phenomenon this might not be necessary. Perhaps it is a remainder in the fundamental constants of the big bang taken sentience, which somehow allows it to selectively manipulate spacetime and the forces to achieve its miracles, in a process that can be described by physics and experimentally verified. If after learning about a phenomenon the phenomenon is still MYSTERIOUS, then we don't yet understand the phenomenon well enough to conclude it an act of god rather than an act of David Copperfield.

The third necessary but insufficient condition is that it must be demonstrable. That is, despite being possible, and explicable, it must yet turn out to actually occur. At some point, the god has to actually show up and offer to buy me a drink, or have an effect on the world which is different from how the world should be expected to progress if it were absent, which can be distinguished and verified. It must not be merely a fiction written by a creative person with a plausible explanation of how god could be.

The fourth necessary but insufficient condition is that it must be deific. My shoe is demonstrable, is self-consistent, and explicable, but it is hardly a god. The entity proposed must be capable of doing something that will by some mechanism be forever beyond the ability of humans to duplicate. This is the difference between a god and a Kryptonian. Perhaps as in the above example the god is "made" of a self-propagating remainder in physics. Humans will never have access to such materials as generate such a force to build with, and so cannot replicate the god. The god must also be in some way sentient, if not an actual personality that can be talked to. This excludes the mundane and the universe itself from being god.

Fail any one of these, and I am not convinced. Succeed in all, and I will believe in it. And then, if it turns out to be responsible for all the suffering of humanity by having shoddily created the universe in a premeditated act it foresaw the consequences of, I will attempt to murder it.
