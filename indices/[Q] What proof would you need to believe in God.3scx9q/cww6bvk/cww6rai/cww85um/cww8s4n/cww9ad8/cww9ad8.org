Thank you. I was worrying the entire time- does this represent my beliefs accurately? I think it does. I don't know god exists, my hypothesis/theory/law- in the scientific sense, i.e. can be disproven - is he doesn't, but the instant i turn my back, I'm thinking like he does.

The closest one word for the map I find myself using is deist. it's not ideal.
