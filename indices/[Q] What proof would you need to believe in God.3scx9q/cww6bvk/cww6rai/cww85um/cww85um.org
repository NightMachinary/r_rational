Yes, that might be it. The reason is inverted though- deep down, I believe in god. But I do believe in a world where god, gods, could exist. I don't know how delusional that is. On the other hand, examination implies god either doesn't exist, or is so subtle as to be irrelevant to my mental model of the world.

Unexamined, I believe god exists, that that's an immutable facet of the universe. I've adjusted my parameters for god's behavior over the years, but i never really disbelieved he existed, merely that his defeinition of good was accurate. For me, God is like some lovecraftian deity, or a paperclip AI. His priorities are close enough to think we can know him, but more than far enough away to prove futile, and powerful enough to avoid our gaze if it would be counterproductive. As such, if he is defeatable, the best course of action is to plan around him and if neccessary, to wage war on him, and if he isn't, pursue your goals while trying to avoid his gaze and minimize his harm to your life. I don't think he's omnipotent- or if he is, he's doing this for the game, like a video game player- they could hack in and insta-win, but that wouldn't be any fun, so they follow rules anyways- but i do think his power outscales ours tremendously.

I tend to find myself thinking, or even planning as though this is the case, if i'm not careful. little, superstitous things, like not taking deities' names in vain or believing in providence rather than luck. It's an undercurrent of belief, i suppose.

If someone walked up to me and tried to prove god existed, I'd be far too credulous, I suspect. Carefully examined, I believe god doesn't exist. but the instant i turn my back, i find myself thinking like he does. It's not a huge difference, but it is there.

I don't believe God doesn't exist, but I should, hence why I said "I disbelieve in my belief." But that doesn't change the fact, that when you asked if there is a creator when i'm distracted I'd say yes, before pausing and correcting myself.

If you asked where god is, I'd say I don't know, but if you asked if it would be possible to see him with omni-knowledge i'd say yes- because it's not a matter of throwing the flour in the garage, it's a matter of a single invisible dragon somewhere in the galaxy.

But since most don't have any proof he does exist, I believe he doesn't IFF I stop and check my beliefs, or manually replace them. But it just keeps sitting there anyways, a subtle trap for any future plans.

Tested, reality implies god doesn't exist, or doesn't have enough power, or doesn't care to meddle with us- that this is all some salt crystal collection, and our existence is a coincidence, or that our origins aren't from a meddling creator, so it shifts my plans very little.

But very little isn't none. It leads to a slight bias towards what I consider moral behavior, which doesn't always overlap with right behavior, in the same way belief in karma might.

It might be belief in belief, but I want to disbelieve in god. It's just not that easy. Wanting to disbelieve doesn't make me disbelieve it. It's a bit of "disbelief in belief", really. I believe something, but I don't want to believe i believe it.

huh. I notice i am confused. Something in this is probably innacurate... on the other hand, i'm talking about how the map i use automatically doesn't match up with the one i'd use if i manually thought it through. of course i'm a little confused.
