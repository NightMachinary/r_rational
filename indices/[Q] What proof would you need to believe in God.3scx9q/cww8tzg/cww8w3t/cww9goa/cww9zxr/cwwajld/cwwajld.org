Tricky. The God of the Torah/Bible/Koran is all over the place as far as what the documentation describes, there isn't just one non-contradictory description that can be distilled out of that.

I suppose I could ask it to let me into Heaven. Heaven is usually where God is described as keeping all the most Godly stuff. If Heaven's nice enough I might just go ahead and concede the argument so I can stay there. Conversely if it sucks I could try to take a look at what the competition has to offer downstairs. :)

That's a little cheaty, though, and if this is really God it's supposed to be able to see through such "I'll believe if you pay me well enough" approaches. In fact, it's often described as getting a bit cross when such arguments are attempted.

Hm... Honestly? I think this is the real best approach: get a team of experts on the subject. I'm really not well qualified to judge this personally, but I've generally found that the scientific community does a good job in the long run. So I'll tell "God" that I'll believe it when the overwhelming majority of the scientific community has become convinced it's telling the truth. I'd then send it off to go do its best to argue its case to the various scientists and researchers of the world and see how it goes. The physics community is probably the most important subset of those since they're down into the basics of how reality works.

Ultimately, this is how I would answer /most/ questions about things that are well outside my areas of expertise - turn the actual experts loose on the question and see what their consensus is once they settle on one.
