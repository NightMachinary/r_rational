There are a lot of questions that just don't make sense in the face of an omnipotent actor.

For example, an omnipotent actor could decide to /make/ "I diddle with your brain so that you believe in me anyway" into a "fair way" to convince us. You wouldn't be able to argue that it's not a fair way to convince us because an omnipotent being just made it so.

It's kind of an uninteresting question when you get right down to it. Like asking what we should do if the Sun just exploded. Nothing we could do makes the remotest bit of difference, so why bother with the question? The existence of an omnipotent being makes the answer to any question come out as "whatever the omnipotent being wants."

The gods that are indistinguishable from advanced aliens are more interesting because they've at least got /some/ limitations on them.
