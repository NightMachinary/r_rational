Okay I still have to give this a read but I had a cold shiver when I saw Pinkie Pie as a character. . . Imagining her working for [a classical] MinLuv is a new level of horror that's making me walk away from my computer to get more coffee first.

Edit: Had coffee read it. clarified my fear of MiniLuv Pinkie.

/chuckle/ I'd say the author missed the point of 1984 except you can't do that much of an inversion of 1984 without understanding it. This isn't a deconstruct it's an inversion. More than a few laughs but not very applicable to the dystopians discussion except as how Luddites will view the future if we get it right.
