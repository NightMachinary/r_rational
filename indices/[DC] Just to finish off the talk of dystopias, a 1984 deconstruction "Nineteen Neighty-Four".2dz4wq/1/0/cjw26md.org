Art consists of rules (broken or adhered to), a work medium, and the wider context it exists within.

The context surrounding the writing of MLP fanfic amuses some good artists, and for good reason. Creative people are trolls, or at least can be very effective ones. Writers like getting reactions to their words and an attentive audience. MLP fanfic does that in spades. Note, I didn't say it was necessarily a /positive/ reaction being sought, just attention.

Using the medium of the MLP world also gets one a lot of elemental characterizations and well-explored background for free, just like with Harry Potter. It means you don't need to explain a lot of stuff, you can just jump to the meat of the story you want to tell. Or you can play with expectations, which is even more fun.

And all this breaks the "rule" of no good MLP fanfic existing, and social norms in general by merely writing fanfic. Few people would stop to read a /1984/ fanfic, or something simply "inspired by" or parodying /1984/. I doubt that subreddit is very active. Lots of people want to see the freakshow of /1984/ plus MLP. But they still have to follow the rules of the MLP 'verse, at least most of the time. Otherwise, it makes no sense as fanfic.

This all adds up to a rich vein of possible art -- art people will actually pay attention to. And also a lot of trainwrecks, but those can be ignored if you only read based on other's recommendations. As you clearly have.
