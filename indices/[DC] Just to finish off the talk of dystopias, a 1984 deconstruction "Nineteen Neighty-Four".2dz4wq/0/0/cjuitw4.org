Personally, what I liked about it was the way the author built in a bunch of genuinely forward-thinking social policies as /background material/, [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/ou/if_you_demand_magic_magic_wont_help/][rather than presupposing that people's problems are solved by "magic" or even "technology"]], even in an outright fairy-tale universe.

Orwell made his novel work by relentlessly and accurately documenting the actual mechanics of life under a totalitarian state. This author has made /his/ story work by relentlessly and (mostly) accurately documenting the actual mechanics of life under... a Strawman-grade free, rich social democracy. I can laugh all the harder because it's an inverted-dystopia built on policies that have actually proven their real-world mettle in improving people's lives, and gone vastly underappreciated for that due to not being magic.
