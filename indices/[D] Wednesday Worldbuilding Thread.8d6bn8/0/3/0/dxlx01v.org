Hmmm. I see fire as more of an area denial weapon than anything else - it chases away an enemy tribe, yes, but if you're not /super/ careful it also burns down the trees and closes down the trade route.

Having their mathematics and astronomy more advanced than their tools also makes a lot of sense. They'll also have a fair grip early on on the idea that the stars are Really Far Away (because no matter how far up you fly, they don't look any closer) - though they'll still underestimate just how Really Far they are for a long time.

I think I might have to take a closer look at the Aztecs for some ideas.
