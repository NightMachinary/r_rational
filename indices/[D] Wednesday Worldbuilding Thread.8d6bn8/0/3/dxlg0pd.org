  How would a non-human race develop technology in a different way to humans?
#+end_quote

The answer is, "they might not." Or rather, while they'd be likely to make simple-ish tools of stone and wood, we don't know enough about /human/ history to conclusively say why humans developed civilization. After all, a number of isolated humans groups /still/ haven't developed civilization, and I think it's pretty clear that it would be weird to develop advanced technology before civilization, if only because civilization is itself a technology, and once all other lower-hanging technological fruits are picked, if there's still pressure to develop new technology, then civilization will tend to be next on the list. And if for some reason civilization isn't feasible, that probably has negative implications for the cross-generational transfer and therefore buildup of technology.

That being said, with your bat species specifically, they actually sound a little similar to the indigenous tribes of the pacific northwest, who were sedentary, but didn't develop agriculture, and instead exploited local resources by fishing, trapping, and in general hunter-gather-ing, and then trading their good with other tribes. The bats might build relatively stationary communities around places rich in fruit and fish even without explicit farming operations, and then exploit flight to trade with other bats who live in other locations. That would disperse fruit seeds widely, and eventually lead to a form of artificial selection for fruits most likely to be picked by the bats, and capable of being grown in many locations. The bats might notice fruit trees being more likely to grow along their trade routes, and encourage that in various ways.

Even without explicit agriculture (difficult with the bats hesitant to be on the ground) the bats could develop a number of tools surrounding that practice, likely made primarily out of tree branches. The impetus for control over these fruit-filled trading routes would lead to territory struggles, with the technology used to defend the trees repurposed for use in war. Eventually, bats figure out that stones are more lethal than branches, and that they can use fire and poisons to take down rival factions' trading routes. Or alternatively, that it's easier to carry trade goods with some sort of harness, and develop mathematics to make trading operations more efficient.

From there, the bats start looking a little like the Aztec-- no wheels, no significant pack animals, but advanced mathematics and astronomy (for navigation) in spite of that.
