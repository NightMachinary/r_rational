Fireuse was primarily driven by the much greater metabolic availability of cooked food, and that is old enough to have been written into our digestive system in a big way. A species of fliers is going to have very high caloric requirements, so will find fire for cooking purposes extremely advantageous.

This means early settlements will be very much driven by the need to find places to build camp-fires that large land dwellers cant get at. .. But an intelligent flyer is going become the apex predator on its world, at least on land, /very early/ in its history, because there is just no way for said mega fauna to retaliate against ranged weapons used from the sky, which turns them from "threat" into "Larder on legs".

I am not sure if agriculture of the kind known on earth is ever going to be a thing, just because walking around spreading seeds on open ground is not going to be very appealing. More importantly, with a flying work-force, the natural territory (the area of land its calories comes from) of cities becomes enormous, so maybe you get a civilization based on herding and fruiting-trees equivalents. - That is you have a city, surrounded by orchards and coppice-cropping plantings, surrounded by a vast territory filled with grazing animals that are occasionally herded to the city for killing, and if on the coast, a fishing fleet.

That gives you a concentration of people, and a good percentage of them not occupied with the pursuit of getting enough food full time, and that is all you need, off to technological races.

Also, if you can have an entire civilization of flying mega-fauna-ranching cow-boys/girls, ancient cities with bottom-less catacombs-libraries of plague victims and the bone-libraries written on their remains, fisher birds abandoning vastly over-rigged ships into the sky when caught by storms (over-rigged because of species wide obsession with wind and speed. The right answer to how many sails being almost always "MORE!" as far as they are concerned. ) and so on, why would you /want/ to recapitulate human technological development exactly? Go off-track. Skip entire parts of the tech tree, vastly expand other parts.

Global population might never get very high this way but it does not really need to be, especially, since with flying knowledge ought to spread from city to city extremely well.

Downsides: Plagues. Those will spread very well also. High-grade sanitation and basic medicine is going to be a major watershed where civilization stops falling into dark ages due to mass die-offs from pestilences.
