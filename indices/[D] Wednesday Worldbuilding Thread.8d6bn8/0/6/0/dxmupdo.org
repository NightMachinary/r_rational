  But an intelligent flyer is going become the apex predator on its world, at least on land, very early in its history, because there is just no way for said mega fauna to retaliate against ranged weapons used from the sky, which turns them from "threat" into "Larder on legs".
#+end_quote

I can think of a few, almost all of which can be overcome by ingenuity on the part of the fliers should they really need the land (the sole exception being a predator that is also poisonous, in which case is still dies but can't be eaten- a combination which seems unlikely).

  That is you have a city, surrounded by orchards and coppice-cropping plantings, surrounded by a vast territory filled with grazing animals that are occasionally herded to the city for killing, and if on the coast, a fishing fleet.
#+end_quote

A village and an orchard might be the same thing, with the people living in the treetops in something reminiscent of an Ewok village but without the walkways. Though the higher-density housing required for a city might make that model unworkable on the city scale (but then how /would/ they form cities?)

#+begin_quote
  That gives you a concentration of people, and a good percentage of them not occupied with the pursuit of getting enough food full time, and that is all you need, off to technological races.
#+end_quote

Oh, certainly. (Fishing nets alone would probably be enough to kick-start technological development).

#+begin_quote
  Also, if you can have an entire civilization of flying mega-fauna-ranching cow-boys/girls, ancient cities with bottom-less catacombs-libraries of plague victims and the bone-libraries written on their remains, fisher birds abandoning vastly over-rigged ships into the sky when caught by storms (over-rigged because of species wide obsession with wind and speed. The right answer to how many sails being almost always "MORE!" as far as they are concerned. ) and so on, why would you /want/ to recapitulate human technological development exactly? Go off-track. Skip entire parts of the tech tree, vastly expand other parts.
#+end_quote

This, I have to say, is a brilliant paragraph. I really like the imagery that it conjures up.

And I do want to go off-track. The question I have is, which specific off-track direction should I take?

  Downsides: Plagues. Those will spread very well also. High-grade sanitation and basic medicine is going to be a major watershed where civilization stops falling into dark ages due to mass die-offs from pestilences.
#+end_quote

Hmmmm - that's true. Basic hygiene could well be their foundational technology (in the same way that fire and the wheel could be considered Earth's foundational technologies).
