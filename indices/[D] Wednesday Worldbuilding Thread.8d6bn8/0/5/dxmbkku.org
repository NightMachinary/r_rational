Do you have a picture or model of these creatures? I find looking at things actually makes thinking about capabilities a lot easier.

If you don't, and aren't someone who could draw it themselves, you could try the [[https://www.origin.com/deu/en-us/store/spore/spore-creature-creator/standard-edition][Spore Creature Creator]]. It costs 5â‚¬ (which is weird, since I remember it being free), but it makes designing approximations of your mental image quite easy.
