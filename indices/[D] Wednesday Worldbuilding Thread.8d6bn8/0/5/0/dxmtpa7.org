It seems it only works on Windows, which disqualifies me at once...

But I can describe it in terms of a few other images, if that will help. Start out with [[https://i.imgur.com/MnRbtqW.png][these creatures]]. Lose the tail fins, cover them in brown fur, enlarge the ears, and give them a face that looks something like [[https://res.cloudinary.com/dk-find-out/image/upload/q_80,w_1920,f_auto/25082371_cbwkxn.jpg][this]]. Their total height, standing, without the tail, is about a metre, with a wingspan of around three metres; their feet have three forward-pointing toes and two backward-pointing (effectively, three fingers and two thumbs).

Does that help, or should I try my relatively unpractised art skills?
