humans don't really have races. Just compare Chihuahuas and Labradors.

It depends how far they can fly. The first generation could know where the main land is, but not be able to get there because of wind only/mostly blowing one way.

I open some knots with my teeth, even though I can't see them then. :-/

Hanggliders could be like the wheel for us (we can walk, so why wheels) and they could transport eggs, kids, handicapped, injured, old or just food.

Heat for nightactive, since they live on a hot planet. Or the fish are nightactive. And they could have sex while flying (ant queens have wings only for that) or good flying skills are just sexy. Plus the predator stuff.
