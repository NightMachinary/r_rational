  humans don't really have races. Just compare Chihuahuas and Labradors.
#+end_quote

Well, yeah, nowhere near that extent. Had humans taken a good twenty thousand more years to figure out boats, it could have been different - but we got good enough transportation to bring everyone together again well before the differences could grow /too/ pronounced.

  It depends how far they can fly. The first generation could know where the main land is, but not be able to get there because of wind only/mostly blowing one way.
#+end_quote

If the first generation knows where land is, they'll tell their children, and the second generation will know, too. (Of course, the first generation might describe land as 'the place of horrible giant monsters that want to eat you', so the second generation might not /want/ to go back).

Their physiology is very awkward on the ground, okay in trees, and great when flying. So I imagine they spend a /lot/ of time on the wing - which implies that they can glide practically all night long at once. So, I'd say they can fly Pretty Far.

  I open some knots with my teeth, even though I can't see them then. :-/
#+end_quote

Would you still do that if the act of putting a knot in your teeth forced your eyes closed altogether? So not only can you not see the knot, but you can also not see anything else?

  Hanggliders could be like the wheel for us (we can walk, so why wheels) and they could transport eggs, kids, handicapped, injured, old or just food.
#+end_quote

Oh, you mean like some sort of flying cart? Yeah, that makes a lot more sense, and would probably be a fairly foundational technology for them. (Which means that they'd have the glider well before the wheel - nice!)

  Heat for nightactive, since they live on a hot planet. Or the fish are nightactive. And they could have sex while flying (ant queens have wings only for that) or good flying skills are just sexy. Plus the predator stuff.
#+end_quote

Good flying skills are super sexy for them. Perhaps even elaborate flights as a mating ritual (which means that the 'flying carpet' scene in Aladdin will make /complete/ sense to them, once someone figures out how to translate films for their senses). And they have several superstitions about light and fire (at first mainly that it's Bad Stuff, later on that it can only be dealt with by trained professionals and a good distance away from the village).
