  there should be a high varienty of similar races (species) on islands. Since storms can exile groups of birds to them. (Maybe they all died out later. Like neanderthals)

  ...how do you mean?

While human migration was mostly landbased and so there were never really isolated populations cause they could just follow their footsteps back (or more like the populations left back on the way)

Birds can be driven of course out to the sea. Most would die. Some would find an isolated island. And die slowly or because of old age. And rarely their would be a group of birds stranded on one island. Or only a female with fertilized eggs. And that female could be an albino. And some million years later, you have a new race of the same species of birds, that are all white and they don't need echolocation or aren't night active because they lived on an island without predators. They would have adapted in other ways to the island, to be fit to live there. Like different teeth.

So anyhow birds are more likely to land on isolated islands. And so there would be more isolated populations. And evolution would tell us, that means, that population would change over time to a different race and after that to a different species. (Evolution happens 'faster' in smaller population and also if there is a higher selection rate aka death.)

Faster means here in less generations. If all non-blue birds die, the next generation will have only blue parents and will likely have a higher percentage of blue birds. and so on.

You could just ignore this. Or they split off not long ago (10000 years is not long.) But I think, that could make an interesting story and explain different variants. Like some who can dive. Or others that are smaller/bigger. Or better/no echolocation. Or monstrous ones, that come, when you look into the sun. (Like our buggyman or monster under the bed.)

I thought they could migrate to the same trees every year. And fight with each other for their old trees. And barricades could prevent climbing animals of eating the fruits too. And their children could be too young to fly. And maybe one family has one tree and eats its fruits the whole year around. And if they get more people, some would leave and look for their own tree.

Nets can surely be weaved with help of the mouth, without echolocation. (They do still have eyes?) And I do not see a reason, why echolocation should be impossible with beaks. (You could echolocate with snipping your fingers as sound source.) But I assumed they have mouths like bats.

About agriculture. They could develop hybridisation. They would take a tree and switch it with some other plant branch. Like a bush with berries. [[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2437247/250-varieties-apple-tree--thanks-bit-hard-grafting-years.html]]

If they get somewhere light enough materials they could develop handgliders.

I really think you should rethink the predators as reason for flight/nightactive. Cause if you really want them to become inteligent, they would exterminate every predator. And there would be no reason for them to still be active in the night or fly. Of course, the predators could just be one reason of many for that.
