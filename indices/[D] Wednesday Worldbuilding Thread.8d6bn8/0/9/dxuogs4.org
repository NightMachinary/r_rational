How big are they? (I guess a little smaller than humans)

I assume trees are a thing.

How I think their ancestors lived:

- If fruits don't grow the whole year, they will travel between fishing grounds and fruit trees. If they can live of one food source they will.

- They will hunt/fish in the night, cause echolocation. [[http://animals.mom.me/nocturnal-animals-only-come-out-night-3324.html][(Because of predators, prey, competition or heat)]] Or maybe the water is to muddy to see with eyes.

- They will prefer to live in cliff sides or on trees.

- there should be a high varienty of similar races (species) on islands. Since storms can exile groups of birds to them. (Maybe they all died out later. Like neanderthals)

- I fear all agriculture will only be to protect good trees. Trees need too long to grow. At least for the start. They will also destroy trees that have no fruits.

Their first technologies will help in survival, hunting and food preparation. Like stone knives and sharp stones they drop. They will also build barricades against climbing predators. Or put sharp stones in the bark of trees.

They will make relative early flying stuff. Some flying cart, so they can move food and tools more easily. They will need to tow it.

No fire will prevent them from many technologies. At least until they start killing (and eating dinosaur monsters.) After they killed all predators, they will need a new reason to still keep wings. Maybe they have sex in the air.

After that they will get hot air ballons and metal. And their main focus will be lightweight materials. So chemistry. first from tree saps and oil

Oh yeah, don't forget most birds use their beaks as tools, so maybe they use their mouths too.

And smashing predators egg, will be hard, if the predators dig caves.

Also flying predators could be tough.
