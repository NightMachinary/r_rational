If they do not have natural weapons, their first tool would probably be weaponry. I can imagine some of them moving further inland and dropping rocks on small animals to kill them. In the process, they might accidentally chip the rocks and make sharp points out of them which they discover can be used to cut into carcasses of larger animals which have died of other causes. Later on they might begin chipping rocks intentionally for this purpose as they begin hunting larger animals.

Since they need to stay off the ground and their young may not be ready to fly immediately, I can imagine them potentially also developing nest-building behavior. Of course, I imagine they're a bit larger and heavier than your typical nesting bird, so they would need larger branches and sticks for their nests. Since they have opposable grasping appendages, they would probably learn to use their feet to break off branches of appropriate sizes for their needs.

Nest-building behavior could also turn into raft-building behavior if sufficiently low-density wood is available when the nest-builders' territory comes within range of the coast again. This would allow them to follow ocean currents far out to sea and potentially colonize other islands and continents while still in their prehistoric phase of civilization. They could even potentially sail with the wind by grasping their raft and simply extending their wings.

Agriculture would probably start accidentally. Trees that provide both food and safety from predators would probably be very popular for them. Constantly eating fruit from these trees and spreading it around would result in that particular tree species becoming increasingly prolific. The most desirable variants of it would spread the fastest, resulting in gradual coevolution and effectively domestication into a plant that acts as both an excellent food source and home for them. Since bands of these creatures would protect their trees from various leaf-grazing herbivores, the trees could begin to adapt towards producing more fruit rather than adapting defenses against their predators. As long as these creatures are mostly breaking off branches only from trees they don't find otherwise useful, they'll also manage to reduce competition for their preferred fruit and nesting trees.

With agriculture, they'll start to become more territorial. They'll become reliant upon fruit-bearing trees and will need to aggressively chase off other animals that eat the fruit or damage the trees. Basic spears made from sharpened sticks might first be used for this purpose.

With more advanced weapons and competition over territory, social hierarchies and more sophisticated language would like to start to form. At this stage, a chieftan system would likely begin to develop, with tribes of up to 100-200 of these creatures following an elder. Division of labor would also likely start to occur, with some specializing as fruit farmers, others as spear-makers, fighters, hunters, etc.

With division of labor, trade and barter would likely begin, and written language would start in the form of written tallies to serve as a memory aid for debts owed between tribe members, and later as a record of taxes as tribal federations begin to unite into larger and larger groups. Animal bones carved with sharp rocks would likely be used as tally sticks.

It's likely that civilization will likely linger around this stage for quite some time. Weaving and rope will be developed, cloth sacks, some animals may be domesticated for food, currency in the form of shells might be used, and the bow and arrow might be developed. Gradually, the population will grow large enough that abundant food sources on the ground will be needed, and large ground predators will become less acceptable. The population will have the means to kill these predators, and will increasingly do so.

With the ground cleared of large predators, I expect that ground herbivores would be corralled into wicker-fence type enclosures for domestication and farming. Some of the plants may also be cultivated at this point if they are palatable enough; if they aren't terribly palatable to begin with, a famine will likely be the initial impetus which brings them into the diet, and gradually leads to them being domesticated into increasingly palatable variants.

For these farmers, fire will finally be a valuable tool. As a natural occurrence, they'll see lightning strikes create fires which clear out useless forests and allow them to grow more of the trees they can eat from. No large predators will be drawn to it anymore, and it will be needed for clearing away vast tracts of land as their civilization expands out into the wilderness. Forests will be burned down and the barren landscape fertilized with ash will be cultivated with domesticated trees.

With fire harnessed, it won't be too long before cooking, pottery, and metallurgy are discovered. The early beginnings of industrialization will be seen, and finally wheels will be developed as a means of transporting far more material at a time. Domesticated animals might be used as beasts of burden to pull carts and wagons laden with wood, ore, and ceramics.

From this point onward, their society will likely progress much like human society did. Their wings will allow for faster exchange of information and ideas, although it will also make it a smaller world where large empires tend to be more predominant, resulting in slower social growth, and perhaps several starts and halts to industrialization as monarchs seek to protect their status from upstart industrialists. Slowly but surely, however, industrialization will occur, leading to an information age and later space age.
