Here's an idea.

The transition from pictures->ideograms in humans makes sense. We see things, draw them, start using drawings to communicate. Having an alphabet, where symbols represent sounds instead of ideas, came later (unless my understanding is flawed through popular misconceptions).

These aliens are much less visual. Maybe they communicate locations to each other by mimicking an echo you would hear near a location. The echo has 'far' and 'near' qualities to it--imagine a sweep of the landscape where nearby trees and large rocks stand out, while empty spaces feel more distant. Communication about travel is going to be much more important to a species that flies, especially one flying in the dark.

These aliens could discover a way of transcribing echos into ridges on branches they can grasp with their difficult-to-view feet. Deeper cuts mean longer return time on an echo. That could be their equivalent to an ideogram. What if their original writing (other than numbers) starts with 'echograms' transcribed onto sticks as ridges and valleys? I'd give them an alphabet from that relatively early, considering their use of sound.

Writing could later become finer by embedding stones in wood, or eventually into scrolls. Eventually they would be a species whose text is more inherently like braille--braille would be their modern, ultra-condensed text, read by rolling a scroll through your claws.

Just an idea.

I'll also note that they don't need computer monitors--computer speakers playing echograms would communicate information to them about as fast as monitors communicate visual information to us.
