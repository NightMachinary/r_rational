I'd imagined that, since their primary means of sensing is through sound and their language is also sound-based, that their primary means of communication would be through patterns of sound that bear some resemblance to the echo returned by the real thing - in much the same way as a charcoal sketch of a buffalo bears some resemblance to a buffalo. So their primary communication would already be in the form of sort of audio pictograms, if that makes sense.

This implies that language barriers would be largely a foreign concept to them - though more distant tribes might have a fairly thick accent, mutual understanding could probably be almost always achieved (at least insofar as nouns go).
