  Given their preferred (or only realistic) means of traveling distances (flying), could they even waddle around on their short legs mining in caves, quarries, etc.?

It would certainly be harder for them. I imagine that swinging a pickaxe would involve (for example) grasping it with their right foot and their tail, while balancing on the left foot with their left wing braced against the ground. They might need to develop 'feet' for stability on the ground, something almost like a snow shoe with a branch to grasp it at the center so that they could more easily balance on one leg while using the other for tools.
