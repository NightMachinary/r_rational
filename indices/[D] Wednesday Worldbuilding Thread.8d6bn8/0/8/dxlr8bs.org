Outside of the broad strokes of how their society might reach the agricultural stage and beyond, I'm having a head-scratching time imagining how their physiology would impact the creation of their first tools and how technology might be adapted to those limitations.

Do their feet have 'opposable thumbs'? And any fine manipulation all happens on the distal posterior and, assuming their wings are directly on the back, I don't think they would risk lying down on their primary means of travel (wings) in order to manipulate objects like an otter lying in water. I don't know what the rest of their physiology looks like, but I assume they'd have to find positions to use both feet, or else their tool manipulation would be restricted to a combination of a single foot + tail (assuming they stand on one foot and they don't have the convenience/inconvenience of manipulating things while flying). Or their legs/posterior are far apart enough that they could sit on a branch and wrap most of their tail around for balance: then most of the manipulation/building would have to take place on trees and that might limit possibilities for creation.

How much can their tail manipulate finely? Can they throw spears using it? How much angular velocity or torque can they squeeze out of their tails? If they manage to create rafts like someone mentioned, can their tails function as an oar by holding some flat object?

Technology develops to solve problems. What kind of basic problems do they start with? Or what problems are forced on them by their environment?

I imagine, as a hunter-gather society, that a major bottleneck is how much fish they can catch. They could easily weave large nets on the treetops and have groups go netting.

I think they'd have a tough time progressing beyond basic technology and the Stone Age because:

- being averse to the ground, they wouldn't have much incentive to start agriculture, especially if their environment doesn't force problems like bitter winters or fish/fruit shortages

- they don't have an inclination to manipulate fire, which is a cornerstone of technological advancement. If winters are cold enough that they have to build specialized shelter, fire doesn't mesh well with their presumed tree-dwelling habits.

- if they do turn into an agricultural society, dinosaurs seem to be the major threat as active predators. If they have a single martial bone, they could probably easily deal with them given their aerial superiority. Then would they become the apex predator?

- Given their preferred (or only realistic) means of traveling distances (flying), could they even waddle around on their short legs mining in caves, quarries, etc.?
