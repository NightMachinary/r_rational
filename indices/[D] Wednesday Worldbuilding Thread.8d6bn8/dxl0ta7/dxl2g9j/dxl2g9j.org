The primary "starting" technologies are tools, shelter, domestication of plants and animals, clothing, and transport -- I think everything builds out from there.

Their /first/ pieces of technology should relate in some way to their "starting" living conditions; if they're fishers, then maybe something to help with that, meaning spears to stab fish, or simple fish traps made from sticks (with nets being, IMO, a later technology once people have the time and effort to spend on something like that, though it somewhat depends on what raw materials are available). Other starting technologies should be ways of defending fruit trees, planting useful plants, domesticating small, manageable animals that live up in the trees with them, or maybe figuring out some way to make living high up safer. Depending on what they have access to, they might start making "nests" as raised homes, or transition to pottery for e.g. storing materials, collecting water, and as a tool to make more tools.

A lot of what they develop to start with should be food related, even if it's just tools to help open up a specific type of fruit seed that then give them a competitive advantage in eating that fruit. (By some theories, cooking food was the big benefit of fire, more than its other uses, since it allowed easier and safer calorie intake.)
