How about this:

Initially, they're isolated on a smallish, densely forested continent and stuck living in the canopy. They eventually domesticate some fruiting vines that can grow in the tree tops and start conducting complicated agroforestry, supplemented by the incredibly dangerous job of fishing in giant dinosaur infested waters.

They aren't able to mine or quarry, and fire is mostly taboo, but over perhaps dozens of millennia, their domestication of other species becomes far more sophisticated than anything we've managed. They breed not only food crops, but plants that grow in forms useful for tools or even shelter, along with a wide variety of animal species that will instinctively perform complicated tasks like harvesting food and sending messages.

With this abundance, they're able to afford a permanent class of philosophers, artists and inventors, who start writing books and creating things like wooden clockwork calculators and eventually printing presses. They also develop weapons- like the huge, highly portable ballistas that are finally capable of reliably killing the most dangerous giant predators. Before too long, most of those are systematically driven to extinction.

Finally, they have safe access to stone and metal. The taboo against fire is slow to die, but once it does, scientific experiments in smelting progress to industrialization within a few centuries.

During that time, they also discover a larger continent on the other side of the world, filled with even more huge and dangerous predators. Even once they have aircraft and radio, exploring that continent is fraught with danger.

One other thing: they often wear a tool on their tails that's shaped like a pair of tongs with loops on each of the handles. The end of their tails are threaded through the loops, and when the flex the tip, the tongs open and close, giving them a more precise grip with that appendage.
