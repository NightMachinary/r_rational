  How big are they? (I guess a little smaller than humans)
#+end_quote

I was working on the idea of maybe a metre tall, standing, with a wingspan a little over three metres. Or about the size of a condor.

#+begin_quote
  I assume trees are a thing.
#+end_quote

Trees are a thing on their world, yes.

#+begin_quote
  If fruits don't grow the whole year, they will travel between fishing grounds and fruit trees. If they can live of one food source they will.
#+end_quote

Even if fruits do grow continually, a tribe will probably strip a whole bunch of trees bare and then be forced to move on...

#+begin_quote
  They will hunt/fish in the night, cause echolocation. (Because of predators, prey, competition or heat) Or maybe the water is to muddy to see with eyes.
#+end_quote

I was thinking because of predators, mainly. They'd have an instinctive fear of bright light and feel more comfortable in the dark, for similar reasons.

#+begin_quote
  They will prefer to live in cliff sides or on trees.
#+end_quote

That makes sense, yes.

#+begin_quote
  there should be a high varienty of similar races (species) on islands. Since storms can exile groups of birds to them. (Maybe they all died out later. Like neanderthals)
#+end_quote

...how do you mean?

#+begin_quote
  I fear all agriculture will only be to protect good trees. Trees need too long to grow. At least for the start. They will also destroy trees that have no fruits.
#+end_quote

...this also seems sensible, though they might cultivate a particular vine or something.

#+begin_quote
  Their first technologies will help in survival, hunting and food preparation. Like stone knives and sharp stones they drop. They will also build barricades against climbing predators. Or put sharp stones in the bark of trees.
#+end_quote

I was thinking of starting with fishing nets (woven from vines), which would help them hunting and allow them to carry stuff. Barricades are a good idea, but they assume that the tribe will be staying in one place, not flying away at the first sign of danger. (Some form of tripwire-based alarm might be preferred - after all, it isn't much bother for /them/ to fly a few dozen trees over, or across a ravine, but a climbing predator would have to go the long way round...)

#+begin_quote
  Oh yeah, don't forget most birds use their beaks as tools, so maybe they use their mouths too.
#+end_quote

Hmmm. I don't think they can echolocate with beaks, so they'd have to have mouths... I guess they can hold something in their mouth, but doing so would mean they can't echolocate, so it would be done in emergencies only...

#+begin_quote
  And smashing predators egg, will be hard, if the predators dig caves.

  Also flying predators could be tough.
#+end_quote

Both excellent points. I might need to add a flying predator which lays eggs only in secluded caves.
