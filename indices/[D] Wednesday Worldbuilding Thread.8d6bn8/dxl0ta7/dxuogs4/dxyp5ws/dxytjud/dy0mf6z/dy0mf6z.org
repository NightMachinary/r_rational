  While human migration was mostly landbased and so there were never really isolated populations cause they could just follow their footsteps back (or more like the populations left back on the way)
#+end_quote

Of course there were isolated populations. Why do you think we have racism today?

Alright, humans haven't really developed much in the way of independent traits - mostly just skin pigmentation - but still.

Still, that only reinforces your point - yes, different tribes is a thing that can happen, given isolated populations. I'm just not sure that an intelligent, flying species can have much in the way of isolated populations - their wings should give them mobility along the lines of humans with boats (at least the simple, stay-in-sight-of-shore type of boat) and their ability to navigate by the stars (which they should pick up fairly quickly) should allow them to figure out which way to go back to the mainland... though they might need a while to rest and recuperate after the storm a bit, first.

  You could just ignore this. Or they split off not long ago (10000 years is not long.) But I think, that could make an interesting story and explain different variants. Like some who can dive. Or others that are smaller/bigger. Or better/no echolocation. Or monstrous ones, that come, when you look into the sun. (Like our buggyman or monster under the bed.)
#+end_quote

Hmmmm... the ability to dive could be a purely cultural thing, an ability practised by a coastal tribe. As for monstrous ones, well, in their early days they'll have a rich heritage of myths, some of which have at least a tentative basis in their world...

  I thought they could migrate to the same trees every year. And fight with each other for their old trees. And barricades could prevent climbing animals of eating the fruits too. And their children could be too young to fly. And maybe one family has one tree and eats its fruits the whole year around. And if they get more people, some would leave and look for their own tree.
#+end_quote

I think a lot of this would depend on the period of history that they're in. In their hunter-gatherer days, a singe tree won't provide enough (year-round) for a tribe - they'll form into larger groupings that families, I think - so perhaps a tribe will lay claim to an area, and chase off anyone else who intrudes on that area.

The concept of individual property (as opposed to tribal property) probably won't be a thing until they've developed at least rudimentary agriculture...

  Nets can surely be weaved with help of the mouth, without echolocation.
#+end_quote

I was thinking nets could be more easily woven by the feet, while hanging upside-down from a branch by their tail. They do still have eyes, yes - though I'm seriously considering making them as a race colourblind, seeing only in shades of grey. And yes, they can still use their mouths to manipulate things, but - well, if I temporarily lost the use of my primary sense every time I held something in my right hand, I'd certainly find a lot of ways to manage without doing that.

#+begin_quote
  And I do not see a reason, why echolocation should be impossible with beaks. (You could echolocate with snipping your fingers as sound source.) But I assumed they have mouths like bats.
#+end_quote

Point taken - echolocation should be possible with beaks. But yes, I was thinking batlike mouths.

#+begin_quote
  They could develop hybridisation. They would take a tree and switch it with some other plant branch.
#+end_quote

Now, /that's/ an interesting idea - maybe that's how their agriculture took off. Hmmm - but is it possible to graft before they have metal knives to slice branches off with?

#+begin_quote
  If they get somewhere light enough materials they could develop handgliders.
#+end_quote

Why would they? They can fly already...

#+begin_quote
  I really think you should rethink the predators as reason for flight/nightactive. Cause if you really want them to become inteligent, they would exterminate every predator. And there would be no reason for them to still be active in the night or fly. Of course, the predators could just be one reason of many for that.
#+end_quote

I do want them to retain both flight and nocturnal tendencies. I thought that starting out with predators as a reason and then transitioning through to cultural inertia as a reason once the predators were gone would be enough... but I'm not too invested in those being the only reasons. What other reasons would you recommend?
