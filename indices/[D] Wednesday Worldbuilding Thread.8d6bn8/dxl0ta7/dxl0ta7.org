How would a non-human race develop technology in a different way to humans? I mean - consider, for example, a race with these characteristics.

- They are mammals, have two sexes, give birth to live young
- They can fly
- They have the ability to echolocate, 'seeing' in the dark
- They have five limbs (two wings, two legs, a tail) and one head
- Their feet are fairly dextrous, approximately equivalent in capability to a human hand. However, their legs are short - they can't reach all the way to their own mouth.
- Their tail is less suited to fine manipulation, but longer, stronger and more or less serpentine. (They can reach to their own mouth with their tail, and will use this, for example, when eating).
- They are omnivorous, eating both fruit and fish
- They don't like to go down to ground level on the land (at least, not at first) because ground level includes a lot of fairly large creatures (think dinosaurs) may of which find them delicious. Ground level at sea (to go fishing) is a lot safer.
- Their home continent is fairly temperate - they have no need of fire (in fact, it attracts Dinosaur Monsters, so it's a pretty bad idea).

I've got a fairly good idea of how these aliens work (I think) but absolutely no idea how their /technology/ would work. They should be slow to invent fire (if ever), and of course the wheel is not wonderfully useful to them, but how is this going to affect their technological development? /Can/ they even develop a technological society?
