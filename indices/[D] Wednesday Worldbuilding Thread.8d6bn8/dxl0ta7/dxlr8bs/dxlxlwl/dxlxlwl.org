#+begin_quote
  Do their feet have 'opposable thumbs'?
#+end_quote

I'm going to go with "yes".

#+begin_quote
  but I assume they'd have to find positions to use both feet,
#+end_quote

I was thinking that if they wrap their tail around a branch, they can hang upside-down and have free use of both feet. A platform made of woven tree branches attached to a rope made from a vine and then hooked over the same branch can then provide them with a handy 'tabletop' surface in easy reach, should this prove necessary.

#+begin_quote
  How much can their tail manipulate finely?
#+end_quote

Not nearly as well as their feet.

#+begin_quote
  Can they throw spears using it?
#+end_quote

Given that a spear can be thrown using a stick with a ridge at one end, I'm pretty sure that they can manage to duplicate the feat.

#+begin_quote
  How much angular velocity or torque can they squeeze out of their tails?
#+end_quote

I'd say... their species average would be more torque that an unaided average human can produce, but less than twice what an unaided average human can produce.

#+begin_quote
  If they manage to create rafts like someone mentioned, can their tails function as an oar by holding some flat object?
#+end_quote

Yeah, this makes sense to me.

#+begin_quote
  I think they'd have a tough time progressing beyond basic technology and the Stone Age
#+end_quote

Yeah, I have similar suspicions.

#+begin_quote
  they wouldn't have much incentive to start agriculture, especially if their environment doesn't force problems like bitter winters or fish/fruit shortages
#+end_quote

Eventually, their population will expand to the point of causing food shortages.

#+begin_quote
  If they have a single martial bone, they could probably easily deal with them given their aerial superiority. Then would they become the apex predator?
#+end_quote

Eventually, yes, they could defeat everything that tries to predate on them. Dropping rocks on nests leads to a very skimpy next generation...

#+begin_quote
  could they even waddle around on their short legs mining in caves, quarries, etc.?
#+end_quote

An excellent question. Mining /would/ be tricky - though they probably could accomplish it if they knew what could be done with metals.
