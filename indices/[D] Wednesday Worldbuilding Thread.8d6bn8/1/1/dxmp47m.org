How about aether being the element that acts like a universal bonding force, where normally each element can only bond with itself? with aether being a structural requirement for advanced life forms, it makes sense that the simpler forms of life, only using two of the elements, would need less, while the advanced 4 element life would need an exponentially larger amount. As a result, "thinkyness" could be an essential part of all elements, and Elementals are just pure atomic chains/crystals of that element. As a bonus it lets you apply personalities to characters who have different elemental leanings, something like the classical four humors setup.
