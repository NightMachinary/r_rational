The whole setting is inspired by Plato's elements and alchemy, so I want to keep aether, the fifth element, close to it's conceptual roots of being cyclical, celestial, or Vital.

I think I want to keep aether as a life-granting force, even though historically aether has also been used as an "explanation" for light and gravity. So ambient aether is more like bacteria and viruses permiating everything, and not used as a binding force in definitively dead, non-thinking things like rocks.

Classical four humors are an excellent idea. But I think a better explanation would be aether carrying memories, and a fiery personality comes from a larger proportion of a person's aether recently being in a fire elemental. Oh! New idea: Rich parents could try to game the system by destroying particular elementals near their child to try to instill a temperament.
