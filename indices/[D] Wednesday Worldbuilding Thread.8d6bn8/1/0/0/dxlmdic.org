I like the virtual elementals!

I was actually thinking about ‘elemental ores' in the form of ‘cores' that drop from elementals you kill (deplete them of aether through battle). So that's good that you thought of that as a logical outcome of my worldbuilding instead of just as a loot drop mechanic. :)

Space elementals are neat if I ever do a futuristic sequel in this setting, but I'm not sure how stars work in the absence of nuclear fusion.
