I am making a world (for a video game) with chemistry based on the four classical elements and elementals in an approximately Renaissance setting. I've thought of a few interesting second order effects of this new chemistry, but I would like advice for more.

- The four elements form molecules. Bond strength and molecule shape detrmine properties. Mud is a particularly weak bond between earth and water, it is barely even counted as a distinct molecule. Alcohol, however, forms from strong bonds between water and fire, bonds that must be catalyzed with wheat/potatoes/etc. and careful brewing.
- Aether is the element of life. It is found in extremely small quantities in nearly everything. Concentrate it with energy, such as light, and it forms lichen and plant life from surrounding materials (seeds act as a template), concentrate the aether further, and animals can exist, concentrate even further and elementals can exist. Elementals are formed by adding concentrated aether to an extremely pure sample of element (or molecule). Once the elemental is formed, it can draw more of its element to itself in relation to how much aether is present.\\

  - Knock-on effects:

    - IDEA: aether remembers what it has been a part of

      - reincarnation, spiritualism
      - poisons
      - story: themes of identity
      - story: Eldritch aether elemental would be a zeitgeist god of all of life's remembered experiences. Anima mundi.\\

    - Elementals forming causes desert by depleting the aether available for plant life. -> Destroyed or dissipated elementals cause a bust of plant and animal life shortly after destruction.
    - Elementals are dangerous to life because they can suck up the aether a person needs to live (if no other aether is present. Animals hold on to their aether tightly.)
    - Areas with lots of light + heat energy form deserts as aether concentrates into elementals
    - Rain forests also have light + heat, but elementals from open sea blow in and are then killed by local life to harvest the aether.

      - magic-eating plants
      - reason for elementals to have some preservation instinct (would need some way to evolve)
      - Dead animals cause a burst of plant life shortly after death

    - Aether is only loosely correlated with cognitive function. Humans are smarter than other animals and elementals because they have more complex (brain) structures that function on aether alchemical reactions.

      - It requires eldritch amounts of aether to compare to human minds operating on less than a wisp, but eldritch elementals are not limited by human brain architecture.
      - Levels of elemental: wisps = basically mindless, nymphs = rodent intelligence, sprite = dog intelligence, eldritch = human or beyond.

    - An aether elemental is almost impossible to create--especially with the (lack of) technology in the world. It requires ridiculously concentrated aether in an absolute vacuum for it to draw in more aether instead of more of whatever element first touches the nascent elemental. And as soon as an aether elemental would start accumulating more aether, it would grow until it touches the boundaries of the vacuum and then explode into elementals of whatever it touches. -> need absolute vacuum + concentrated aether in absolute desert.

  - Elementals expending energy makes them lose size, aether, element.
  - Elementals gradually grow if enough element, aether, energy is present
