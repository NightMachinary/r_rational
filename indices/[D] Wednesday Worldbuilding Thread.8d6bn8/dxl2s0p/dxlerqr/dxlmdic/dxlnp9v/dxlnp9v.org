  I'm not sure how stars work in the absence of nuclear fusion

How about elemental fusion?

- The universe is mostly elemental fire

- Elemental fire can fuse with itself to elemental air while releasing some aether, but only in extreme pressure

- Elemental air can fuse with more elemental fire (or elemental air, your choice) to make elemental water and earth, while absorbing some aether, at more extreme pressure.

With these rules, you get:

- Stars made of mostly fire

- A source of aether to drive life

- Supernova still occur (when stars become dense enough from cooling) and heavier elements still come from supernovae

Admittedly, I'm cheating by blatantly stealing our universe's rules. To make it more thematic, make stars full of warring elementals, and make the star's volume proportionate to how much they fight. Cooling stars go nova when there is too little aether to power fighting air and fire elementals.

These rules would be hard to work into a story, but they are fun to think about.
