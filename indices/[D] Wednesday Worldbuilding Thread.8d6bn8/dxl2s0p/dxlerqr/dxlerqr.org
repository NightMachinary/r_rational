Virtual elementals--small elementals form wherever aether is present, and also evaporate instantly. Only an elemental of sufficient size can pull aether from the surroundings and be stable. Maybe the formation of elementals in this world is like the formation of raindrops in ours, a balance that doesn't favor growth unless the starting point is large enough.

Fire is a unique element in one way or another. It seems to violate conservation of mass, assuming it is made of matter but also disappears like fire in our world. Maybe make a flame 'diatomic fire', and make 'elemental fire' the smallest of the four elements. This would be for the justification that without energy a flame degrades into elemental fire and diffuses. Alcohol forms in water with elemental fire that naturally pervades all matter.

Maybe valuable resources in this setting are 'elemental ores'--ores that are molecularly diverse enough to discourage the formation of elementals (and are thus stable) but are otherwise primarily composed of one element. I'm imagining they look like glass.

Possible existential threat: hungry aether elementals formed from supernova.

Perhaps ghosts or undead form when a living thing suddenly dies in a desert for any reason that isn't starvation or being eaten by an elemental.
