I'm most interested in Zenith of Sorcery by far, but it's definitely true that it's the riskiest option. A protagonist that magically powerful needs to consistently face real conflict just like any other, and that means that political and logistical problems basically have to be a huge focus of the story. I live for that stuff, so I'd love to see it, but there is the danger of just going full wish-fulfillment with a protagonist that powerful. I trust nobody to avoid that, but a more cautious course is definitely starting with King of the Junkyard, which also looks interesting and is definitely more in the established comfort zone.
