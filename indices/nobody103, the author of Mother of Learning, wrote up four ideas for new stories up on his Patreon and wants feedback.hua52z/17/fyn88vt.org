King has my vote. There's a dearth of good modern-superantural/urban fantasy fiction in rationalish spheres, and I honestly have trouble thinking of much the gameish stories might contain that other stories in those genres haven't already done extremely well.

Zenith might be interesting, but (unpopular opinion time) very little of what the protagonists in MoL did felt "clever" in a way that makes me excited to see more supermages-beating-everyone kinds of stories from this author. Would rather see him try something new.
