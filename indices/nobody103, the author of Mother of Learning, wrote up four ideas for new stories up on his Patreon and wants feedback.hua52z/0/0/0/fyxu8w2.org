I really liked the ending of MoL, but I think that Zorian's mana limits were kinda thrown out the window. Nobody103 didn't let him solo artillery spells or anything, but he was maintaining a lot of simulacra at the same time, all casting magic.

The golems and crafting made sense, in that he didn't actually independently develop all of them, he iterated them over restarts hiring people to work on them and then recreated that work out of the time loop, but having all his gadgets and letting him teleport simulacrums around shooting force lances and fire stars and running ritual spells...

I still loved it, but arguably it could have been even better if he'd restrained zorian a bit more.
