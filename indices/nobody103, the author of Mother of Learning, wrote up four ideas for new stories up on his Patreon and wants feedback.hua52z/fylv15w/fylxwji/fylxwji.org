I feel like a teenage protagonist is the "safe" choice and thus way, way over-represented in fiction. Personally my favorite characters from fiction are all mature people with interesting pasts. Corwin of Amber, Croaker, Pham Nuwen... adults are just far more interesting people than teenagers.

Anyway, just pushing back slightly that there's a trend of some sort, the real trend in my eyes is the eternal overuse of kids as main characters. I think it has been particularly pronounced in progression fantasy because most of the authors are also very young.
