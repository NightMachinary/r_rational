Oh, ok. That context about Quatach-Ichl makes more sense. I'd be interested in reading about him -- if he turned out to be a complex person with more motivations than a papier-mache villain. He's closer the the latter than the former in MoL, in that the only thing we see of him is wanting power.

I don't underestimate how many stories use tricks. I'd say, instead, that 90% of progression fiction is crap that doesn't have much to recommend it, at all, and it's not particularly surprising to know that crap relies on cheap tricks.

... that's way more shade than I meant to give, I also recognize that these are amateur writers doing it for fun. Haven't read Heart of Cultivation, but Street Cultivation was nicely done. Anyway, we're probably on the same page insofar as we want authors to try new things and not just copy the last fiction.
