That's not really what I meant. I was referencing someone else's sentiment in another chain that, for example, a lot of people seemed interested in a Quatach-Ichl sequel because they like what author could do, powers-wise, with a full archmage from the beginning.

My point is that a young protagonist promises more mistakes than an adult protagonist (meaning more opportunities for growth or subversion of growth, forms of progression in a dimension other than power-through-mechanics) as well as implying that they have things to learn about the world they live in, and seeing some of the dry power fantasy that comes out of the genre and knowing characters are not the author's strong suit, I'm not convinced by what's on offer here.

At the end of the day these are all very cursory overviews of ideas. Maybe I'm completely off-base on the predictions part of my argument, but I know I'm not lying about my reaction to reading through these. If you don't like young characters that's your thing. You're entitled to your own opinion.

I personally don't believe in "overused" or "predictable" as markers that predict whether I'll enjoy something. I believe in setup and execution above pretty much everything. Premise is part of setup, and the protagonist's experience or lack thereof is a part of a story's premise.

I also think you underestimate how many stories use tricks to get the same kind of setup as a young protagonist would give (TRICKS ARE GOOD, just to be clear). Making the character a fish out of water through Isekai, for example, is a way to keep the protagonist learning new things like a young protagonist would. Stories like Street Cultivation and Heart of Cultivation don't do this, because the protagonist already knows everything important about the setting (or has the means to look it up) and is only educating the reader.

People who don't want to see progression, just power, are going to gravitate towards the archmage story. To borrow an expression, they're valid. I don't like that kind of story so I don't like that kind of story.
