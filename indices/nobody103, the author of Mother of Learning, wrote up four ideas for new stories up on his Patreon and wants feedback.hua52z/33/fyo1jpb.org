I dislike 1 as the premise is overly similar to Worm for my tastes. I dislike 2 as it sounds like genre conventions will be used as load-bearing supports for the worldbuilding, and I would rather not read more litRPG.

Zenith of Sorcery sounds pretty interesting, but if there's limited power development then that doesn't leave much room to write in. Refuge in Void seems like the most original and interesting setting to me overall, with lots of possible directions that it could be taken. So I prefer Idea 4 out of these.
