  Again, without a looming threat, I think I could enjoy this being episodic, but there would have to be an overarching plot asserting itself, at least occasionally, if it's going to have a satisfactory conclusion. I'm not overly fond of LitRPGs, but I would make an exception for something by nobody103.

It sounds like the overaching plot would be the mystery of the dungeon, and I am a sucker for a good mystery. This one is my favourite.

  I like the idea of a reverse-LitRPG. The only time I've seen something like this done was Kid Radd
