I have thoughts about each.

*King of the Junkyard*

I like the episodic nature, as long as it's going to ramp up to an occasionally broader plot. Think DS9, where there were a lot of plots that were resolved by the end of each episode, but the ending was stretched across nine episodes, and resolved plot threads going back several seasons.

My main concern with this problem is that it seems like a bit too much of a coincidence for all of these various plot threads to be happening at once. The aliens showing up so soon after Godfall, in particular. I'd want to see the various Weird Thingsâ„¢ to all make sense to be coming to a head a the the same time.

*The Infinite Dungeon*

Again, without a looming threat, I think I could enjoy this being episodic, but there would have to be an overarching plot asserting itself, at least occasionally, if it's going to have a satisfactory conclusion. I'm not overly fond of LitRPGs, but I would make an exception for something by nobody103.

My main concern would be: why is this person the protagonist? He's just "lucky and willing to take risks?" It seems to me like there would be people who were better, smarter, stronger, more skilled, etc., or otherwise more naturally talented, and "lucky" isn't a really satisfying reason for a protagonist to be the one who prevails (unless played for laughs).

One thing that I would really like to see if this is the concept chosen would be to have rotating viewpoints. All of these characters are going into the dungeon for their own reasons and having their own adventures; it'd be a shame to focus too closely one one point of view.

*Zenith of Sorcery*

High-power-level stories are hard to write, and I just don't see this going well. This sounds like a character who can accomplish pretty much anything through magic, which makes it really hard to relate to the character, really hard to have the challenges that the character will struggle to overcome, and really hard to have antagonists who want to antagonize the protagonist in the first place. It's like writing a Superman story: you either have to use Kryptonite, or threaten someone Supes cares about, or put the character in a moral quandry, and all of those stories will eventually get old.

Again, this is a [[/u/nobody103][u/nobody103]] story, so I'd probably at least start to read it, but this is the least compelling of the four ideas in my view, just because: where does the tension come from?

*Refuge in Void*

I like the idea of a reverse-LitRPG. The only time I've seen something like this done was [[https://www.bgreco.net/kidradd.htm][Kid Radd]], which I really enjoyed. And this one actually sketches out a long-term plot, which endears me to it more than the others. In fact, I'd say this is the one that speaks to me the most.

My biggest concern with this one is that, at first glance, the protagonist sounds completely unlikeable, and for someone who we're going to spend a lot of time with, that sounds like a pretty fatal flaw to the story. I mean, it can be done (see Black Mage from 8-bit Theater), but you'd have to sell the character as someone worth following pretty quickly, in order not to alienate the readers.
