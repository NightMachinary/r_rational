Combine all ideas. Start with King of the Junkyard, with the first 4 episodes you've already planned. Episode 5 have a Spark (or other entity or object) who can access The Infinite Dungeon. Episode 6+ have Jack encounter Zenith and his newly recruited sidekick NPC in the Dungeon (or just one alone). Spinoff Dungeon or Zenith or Refuge into fully realized series based on your own comfort and enjoyment in writing or if patrons start paying you serious money for more of one in particular.
