(This post is intended for [[/u/nobody103]], not the OP)

To me, Zenith of Sorcery both has the most potential, both the potential to be good and bad.

I have been searching for a good OP protagonist story for years now, basically. They are incredible hard to write, as you already knows. Still, if anyone could have the chops to write it, I believe it would be him.

My biggest problem, however, is that the setting seems...super boring. I know that you mentioned that different universes/planes will eventually be explored, but why not have that right from the start? What would a world look like in which multiple universes, all with different magic and technology, look like?

The obvious problem would be how hard it would be to write. I know you mentioned that MoL took a lot out of you, and you seem to be more interested in branching out. Still...I would absolutely love for you to write Zenith of Sorcery. And heck, if you want to write King of the Junkyard as a side project, I'd read that too!

Well, I'll read everything you post, anyway.

Thanks for the absolute incredible journey of Mother of Learning, and I'm excited to see what you create next!
