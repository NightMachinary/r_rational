I rather like King of the Junkyard and Zenith of Sorcery.

I'm confident Junkyard would be good. The premise seems promising, and I don't see any obvious traps that would cause readers to bounce off.

Zenith sounds like a great premise, but I think it would be very difficult to launch. An advantage of a tabula rasa low-level character is they can learn about the world and develop their own abilities at the same rate as the reader. Managing the exposition loads of both a new world and a wide-ranging set of abilities from the very start sounds like a real challenge.
