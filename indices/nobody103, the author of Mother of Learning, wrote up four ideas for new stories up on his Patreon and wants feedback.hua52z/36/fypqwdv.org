King of the Junkyard is definitely the most interesting setting, because a fantasy kitchen sink where the different elements of different thematic focus are woven together with a coherent underlying world creates excellent opportunities to tease out the underlying mechanisms and forces of the setting as you go along. If it's episodic, I feel you could approach it one of two ways:

- Episodic until the last big arc(s), where things start tying together. This would give you the, in the end, final overall narrative, while retaining the episodic freedom from concurrent plots for most of the fic. All a given arc would need in terms of tracking plots is "This incident was caused by X, which will become relevant in the finale arcs."

- Fully episodic, with the emphasis on character progression. No need to make a grand plot where everything ties together, you just need Jack to be a slightly different person at the end of each arc, until you reach the final arc that's the culmination of his growth as a person, even though the last arc needn't be a world-shaking conspiracy or anything.

If you go fully episodic, I would recommend the side-project approach, for whenever you need a change of pace or to leave the main story to percolate. If you go only mostly episodic, with an underlying plot for the grand finale, though, it could fairly easily stand on its own imo.

The Infinite Dungeon, in its LitRPG dungeon-delving premise, would likely find it hard to stand out from all the other LitRPG dungeon-delving stories out there. This doesn't mean it'll be bad or uninspired, of course, but rather that it might not be as popular as the other stories. In terms of quality, I'm especially interested in the factor of the masquerade straining and breaking and new powers rising in the world destabilized by this out of context problem. As for the questions posed:

- If I was given a low-key magic, I'd probably not risk myself to make it stronger, but instead go public immediately. The Randi Prize isn't up anymore, but it wouldn't be hard to find someone in a similar position and prove that my magic is legit, which would give me the signal boost to get attention and recognition early. My goal would be to become famous enough that I can enlist protection against anyone, magical or mundane, that might want me dead or under their thumb because of my magic, as well as to help control the breaking of the masquerade as best as I can.

- If I /was/ adventuring and there was a government order to give up the prizes, what I would do would depend on 1) whether I thought I could get away with it, 2) what I stand to lose if I get caught, and 3) what I stand to lose if I give in. I can see myself having enemies and not wanting to give up the only thing keeping them from killing me, and I can see myself knowing that there's no way for me to hide that I've got such prizes, and that if I don't comply I'll be targeted by a force far superior to me.

- I'd go for a survival-focused build, because above all I don't want to die. Factors relevant to good health, weathering damage, avoiding danger, and escaping conflict. Stealth, essentially, with a focus on damage control if stealth fails me. I would ideally resolve combat by avoiding enemies altogether, or by hit-and-run ambush strategies.

Zenith of Sorcery, especially the latter half, sounds interesting, but the fact that he's already powerful and has tons of tricks means that you'd have to be creative a lot of the time. And/or do a lot of 'nothing in my bag of tricks can do that' ahead of such limitations becoming relevant. If you can get that to work, though, it sounds like a very enjoyable story to read, because as others have noted you do archmages well. I have no doubt that you'd make Marcus' fight scenes extremely impressive, and as long as you can sort out the meaningful limitations bit you'd be sorted.

Refuge in Void is my personal favourite of the options here, if only because it's heckin /evocative/ to make the setting a world falling apart and have the slow subtle collapse of everything be a main focus on the story. I also like the idea of an NPC who thinks inhumanly, and if you go with that I hope you lean into it where appropriate. In my opinion this story has the greatest potential, with the biggest trap in it being the risk that NPC-guy would come across as too obnoxious when his differences from normal human thought is highlighted, but that's far from an insurmountable hurdle.
