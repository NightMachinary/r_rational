1. King in Junkyard. Like it 8/10. Currently I do want to read some urban fantasy with good world-building. This does not have the aim of having a good world-building but I believe it will still be better then most things around.
2. The infinite dungeon 4/10. Mixing fantasy dungeon with modern world does not sound cool. After watching the first video of fantasy knights getting killed by machine gun you saw it all. [[https://youtu.be/UEahGo9EEyE?t=329]]
3. Zenith. 7/10. It is hard to write a book about a powerful protagonist. The only time I saw it being done well was in Hard to be a God. A very short story by Strugazkie. They made 2 movies but they are shit go read the novel.\\
4. Refuge. 5/10 Recently saw it done in New Game Minus. I do not believe good world-builidng is possible with such a premise.
