4th: Like it most. Potentially very interesting social dynamics, resembling a little the information techs of our world. Open source powers! Trading in power futures, power sharing cooperatives, power sharing laws, power taxation and more. Are married couples always share their powers? Spoiled kids piggyback on powerful parents? A lot of material for interpersonal dramas here.

1st and 2nd: sharing second place. Both are common tropes but solid premises. 1st is theme used a lot in paper published urban fantasy, 2nd is most common web stories theme. Common doesn't mean bad - it means that most glaring error already identified in genre.

3rd: Nop. Receipt for failure. It's extremely difficult to write. Plotwise it only make sense as tragedy (Like in Dostoevsky, "Idiot" which is essentially about social communication superpower) and tragedy kind of difficult to build with two part structure of the plot. May be if two parts are fall form the grace and redemption, but still difficult.
