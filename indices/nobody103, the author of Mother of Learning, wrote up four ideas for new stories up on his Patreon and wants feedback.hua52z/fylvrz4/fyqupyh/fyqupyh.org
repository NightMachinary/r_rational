See, I thought the back half of MoL was weaker than the first half. The problem with extremely powerful characters (especially ones that start powerful, rather than develop over the course of the story) is that it's very easy to fall into the trap of them always having another card up their sleeve. When they're that powerful, it's tricky to make sure that the reader knows exactly what they can and can't do.

The final fight, in particular, suffered from this, I think. While I'm not sure I'd call any of the gadgets Zorian pulled out Deus ex Machina, it definitely felt a little too close for comfort.

If Zenith is more of a Zach than a Zorian (classic Fireball wizard, rather than a artificer), that might help. But I'm not sure.
