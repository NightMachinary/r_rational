Definitely Zenith of Sorcery. Nobody103 writes archmages extremely well (many of the MoL fans were really excited about the idea of a Quatach-Ichl sequel, etc.) so I'd be interested to see his take on this. Plus, archmage protagonists aren't something you see much of; most novels start far from the top in terms of power levels so it would be covering fresh territory.
