Yeah, Sparks definitely seem to be directly inspired by "Shards" in a lot of ways. The addition of the possibility of outright "breaking" is an interesting addition to the way they affect their users. And having the origin and mechanics laid out so clearly before the story has even started makes me think that the characters are probably more aware of the way the Sparks work at this point then most capes were in Worm, which could have some interesting applications.

There does also seem to be the addition of a lot of other extraterrestrial and/or supernatural beings and elements outside of the Sparks, whereas all the supernatural elements of Worm could be traced back to Shards
