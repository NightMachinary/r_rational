Both Void and Junkyard sound interesting.

Refuge in the void is very original, while cyberpunk kind of setting is something i always enjoy and could be pulled off in King of the Junkyard.

If i have to vote for one, it wold be Refuge in Void for its originality and the fact that the story can go anywhere.

But like someone said, whatever this author writes i'll read it (best thing that came from my country on the internet right now :))
