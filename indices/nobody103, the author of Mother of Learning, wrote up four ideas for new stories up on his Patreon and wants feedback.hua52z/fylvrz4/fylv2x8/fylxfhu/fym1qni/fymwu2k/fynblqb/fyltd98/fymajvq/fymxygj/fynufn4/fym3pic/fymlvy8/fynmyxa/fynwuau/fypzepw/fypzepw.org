# 4: The premise sounds somewhat like Wild West Hero in the Land of Robot Maids by Velvet Canopy. The first installment is done, the sequel is still publishing, and both can be found on Royal Road.

An NPC in a VR game is transmigrated from his home server to another with a different theme and must make his way in the world. The NPC has intelligence because all NPCs are AIs, and this one happens to ‚Äùreincarnate" due to a fluke bug. A major difference in premise though is that the transmigrated NPC interacts pretty often with human PCs and comes to the attention of the "god-like" Admins, which ends up being quite the source of conflict.
