Refuge sounds interesting to me, but I'm not sure how much of that is the story itself, versus me just being interested in the central mystery of the setting. Like, I think there's a pretty good chance I'd get as much enjoyment out of a ten-page "here's what's causing the gods to be stressed out and why everything is ruined" infodump as I would a full web serial.
