I haven't read any of those, but I have read several stories with overpowered MCs, and most of them left me wishing that the antagonists were more than just evil caricatures so that I could root for them instead. There are exceptions (Morpheus from /Sandman/ is theoretically ridiculously overpowered, but is extremely compelling), but those are the exceptions more than the rule.
