I like Junkyard and Zenith. Alternating between them sounds nice, too.

Maybe an alt-Earth with the action focused in a fictional city and/or country? Like Brockton Bay or Wakanda. That way if you want something hand-crafted to your tastes, you can always insert a new city/country. But if you want Canadians, you don't have to invent fictional!Canada and describe it until people learn to associate a made up place name with Canada, you can just say Canada.

  [Zenith of Sorcery]: Since the protagonist is already very powerful, the power growth he experiences in the story will be relatively small.

I don't think a huge relative power growth is necessary for an interesting story, but one downside of starting with a powerful character is that it can be hard for the reader to follow along with a developed power set from page one.

One way to slow down the infodump on powers would be if Zenith hasn't had time to read some of the spellbooks from ancient masters that he found on his journey. That would let you introduce his "starting" powers in chunks - whatever he already has, whatever's in book 1, whatever's in book 2.
