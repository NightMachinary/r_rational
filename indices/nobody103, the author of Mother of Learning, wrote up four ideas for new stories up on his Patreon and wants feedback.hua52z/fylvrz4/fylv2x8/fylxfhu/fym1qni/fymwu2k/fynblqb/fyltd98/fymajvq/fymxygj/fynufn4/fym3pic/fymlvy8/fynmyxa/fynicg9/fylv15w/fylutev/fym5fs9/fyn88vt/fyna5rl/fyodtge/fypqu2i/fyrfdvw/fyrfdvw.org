*King of the Junkyard* - Healer/Mender Protagonists are rare and well-done ones that don't turn their self-healing into a method of being godlike in combat are rarer still. This has promise.

*The Infinite Dungeon* - Pass. I don't mind LitRPG in general but the genre is absolutely saturated right now.

*Zenith of Sorcery* - Hard pass. There are two good ways to write an OP protagonist - have the conflict involve side characters mostly while the protagonist is largely there for comedy (One Punch Man) or acknowledge that the MC is undefeatable and go full slice-of-life so that Demon Lords showing up is just an amusing afternoon diversion before dinner (the middle arcs of Death March WN [first arcs are rocky and worse in the LN version, and later arcs become too serious]).

This one sounds tedious and awful.

*Refuge in Void* - My vote goes here. I've always wanted to see a story set in a world where the odd abstractions used in a TTRPG actually exist - quantised power-ups etc. - but where it's also not actually /gamified/.
