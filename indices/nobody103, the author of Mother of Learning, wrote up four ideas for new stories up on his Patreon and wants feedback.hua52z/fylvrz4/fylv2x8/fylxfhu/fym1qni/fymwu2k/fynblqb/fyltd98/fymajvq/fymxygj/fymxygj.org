I hope it's either Junkyard or Zenith. LitRPG is getting too stale and makes it harder to care about the world and the characters.

Zenith sounds like the exact opposite of MoL. Young novice vs old master. It's also a break from the constant teen protagonists. Junkyard's lightheartedness also looks promising and poses a challenge to nobody103 who is a bit lacking in writing fun and humorous dialogue.
