Tricks are not by definition cheap. Don't stick that word in there like I meant it that way.

Also I've said multiple times I don't care about originality (though it can be a good thing), so maybe not on the same page.

Street Cultivation is serviceable but it's dry and the characters are flat like cardboard. I wouldn't recommend it except to someone looking for ideas. I thought its world-building was its strong point, but not in a way that elevated it.
