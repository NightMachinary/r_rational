I prefer character-focused mystery, rather than setting-focused mystery. That is, the mystery revolves around the motivations of the characters, rather than some question about the mechanics or backstory of the world building. Since I (obviously) haven't read the story, I can't say for certain which the mystery of the dungeon is, but it sounds like the kind of mystery that's more likely to be setting-focused.
