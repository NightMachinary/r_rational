I would definitely call it a trend, having read Street Cultivation and seen Heart of Cultivation show up only a few weeks after I was done. There's other examples but I'm blanking on names (Diaries of a Skill Trainer? Not sure that's right). It's a very trends-based genre, at least at the moment. That doesn't make stories bad, so I'm not bothered by the idea that younger protagonists are an "overused" trend (though I think they're more a natural choice for coming of age narratives). I'm just speculating as to the inspiration/motivation for ranging far from Zorian (maybe it's specifically to get away from that type of protagonist, even).

I think progression is at its best when it's multi-dimensional. I feel like these stories come with characters that are developed out of the box, all their learning far behind them, with only a situation to remedy and then power progression ahead of them. It's not a lack of originality that I'm speaking out against, but more a choice I personally see making stories worse instead of better, by a subjective standard.

I get that other people are more interested in power speculation and numbers-other-than-age going up, but I like Mother of Learning enough to comment when I see the author joining in a trend I'm personally not confident about.

(This is also not to say I don't see character development in the future for Heart of Cultivation, for example. I think that story did well setting up a big misunderstanding right at the beginning that not even the readers are sure about and that the protagonist will eat crow for almost for sure. I'm not sure the stories outlined here lend themselves to the same kind of "promise" built into the premise. Then again, that's just one promised moment. A young character promises more than one right from the concept, not so much an adult one.)
