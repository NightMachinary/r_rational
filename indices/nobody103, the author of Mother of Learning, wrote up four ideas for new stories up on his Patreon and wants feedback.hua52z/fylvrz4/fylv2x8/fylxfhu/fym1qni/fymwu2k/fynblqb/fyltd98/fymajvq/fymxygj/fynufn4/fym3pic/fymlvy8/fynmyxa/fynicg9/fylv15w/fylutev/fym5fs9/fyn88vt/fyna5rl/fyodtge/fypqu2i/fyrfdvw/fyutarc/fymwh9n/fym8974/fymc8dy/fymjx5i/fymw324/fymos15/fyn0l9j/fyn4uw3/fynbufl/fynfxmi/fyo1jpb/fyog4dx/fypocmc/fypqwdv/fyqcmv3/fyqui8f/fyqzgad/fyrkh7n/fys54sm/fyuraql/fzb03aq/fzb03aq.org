Junkyard feels very derivative of Worm in some ways - so no. Could be good if not for the shard thing.

Infinite Dungeon? Honestly sounds boring

Zenith? Feels like Gary Gygaxs books. Might as well use the same world as MoL.

Refuge. I wasn't feeling this one either.

I'd say go with Zenith, set it in MoL world to save time on world building and think of how to add a unique hook.
