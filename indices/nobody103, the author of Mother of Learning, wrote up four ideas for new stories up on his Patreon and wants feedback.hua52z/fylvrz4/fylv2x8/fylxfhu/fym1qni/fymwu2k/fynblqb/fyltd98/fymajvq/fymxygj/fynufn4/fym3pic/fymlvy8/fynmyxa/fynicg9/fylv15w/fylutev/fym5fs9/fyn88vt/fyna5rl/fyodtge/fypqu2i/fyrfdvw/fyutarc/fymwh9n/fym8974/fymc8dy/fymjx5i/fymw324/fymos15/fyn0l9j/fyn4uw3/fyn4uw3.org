If the choice is based on my gain as a reader, then Refuge in Void and King of the Junkyard as a sideproject, or just King of the Junkyard. The episodic slice-of-life-ish scenes were one of the best parts of MoL.

If nobody103 wants a challenging project to grow as an author, Zenith of Sorcery is the way to go, but I fear it won't be quite as good as the alternatives.
