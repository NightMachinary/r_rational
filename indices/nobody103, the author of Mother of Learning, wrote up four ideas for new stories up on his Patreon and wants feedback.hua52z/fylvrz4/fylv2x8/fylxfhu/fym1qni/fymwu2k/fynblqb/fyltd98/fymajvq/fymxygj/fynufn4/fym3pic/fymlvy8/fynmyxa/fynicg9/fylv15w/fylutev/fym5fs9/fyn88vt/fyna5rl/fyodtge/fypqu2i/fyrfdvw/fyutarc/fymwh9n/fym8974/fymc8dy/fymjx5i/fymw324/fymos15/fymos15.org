Oh God oh no.

First idea-urban fantasy and a sprawling world which seems multivaried with episodic pacing. Good

Second- straight litrpg. First off ewwww. Can probably be done well but it's been done SO many times I would skip. Doesn't seem at all original in any way. Inventive twists are unironically required for litrpgs at this point.

Third- op dude making moves and solving problems on a big scale. Seems ok. Making it about logistics and political stuff can be a pacing killer but I'd be down.

Fourth- character gets isekia'd (however you spell it) into a fantasy world with monsters and a dying civilization. Biggest problem is that the main character is described as an oblivious guy with no self awareness. I've seen this done badly too many times. He could probably do it well but idk.

Overall
