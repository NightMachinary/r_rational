Now I'm not tying from my phone while half asleep, a proper post. I'm hoping for The Infinite Dungeon with Zenith of Sorcery second.

King of the Junkyard doesn't feel like it's anything truly unique. An urban fantasy protagonist who sticks his nose in where id doesn't belong, I've seen that before.

The Infinite Dungeon combines many things I like: Dungeon delving, a great big mystery at the heart of the setting, progression. And with the sheer number of litRPGs where the protagonist wins because some deus ex machina [[https://i.imgur.com/3hxAhfz.png][hands him free starting perks]] (the whole point of an MMO is everyone starts equal...) it would be extreemly nice to see an author of nobody103's calibre show how to write a protagonist who wins fair and square.

Zenith of Sorcery appeals to me. I'm not a big fan of cultivation in general (Street Cultivation being a noticeable exception) because of the way the settings tends to focus on progression for the sake of progression, and the way the entire magic system tends to revolve around combat. But I'm not too worried that will apply here. And nobody103 does great archmages.

Refuge in Void: It seems like the lesser of the two litRPG proposals and the protagonist starting with perks is a red flag to me.
