I'd say Zenith is the most likely to be as good as MoL, but I'd love to see an original LitRPG done to his standard, so Dungeon or Void would be good risky projects.

Junkyard sounds like Wildbow's works injected into the Rick and Morty universe, which sounds interesting but is going to be so difficult to pull off well. Still sounds good though.
