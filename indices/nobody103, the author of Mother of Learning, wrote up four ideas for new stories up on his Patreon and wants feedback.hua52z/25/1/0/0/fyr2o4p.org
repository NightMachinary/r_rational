WtC is good but it has a chosen one protagonist and he's the only one with an RPG interface.

Also the philosophy side (which I love) is very different to what most litRPG readers are looking for. Mother of Learning however scratches many similar itches, so I'm hoping MoL quality in a litRPG could be influential.
