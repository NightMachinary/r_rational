Zenith of Sorcery is what I'd root for, because it's something hard to do well but this author has a decent chance of pulling off. But it's the "no guts no glory" option; it's the option with the most upside potential but also the most likely to bomb or be incredibly bland.

I think King of the Junkyard is the one I have the highest expectations for in terms of EV(interestingness).
