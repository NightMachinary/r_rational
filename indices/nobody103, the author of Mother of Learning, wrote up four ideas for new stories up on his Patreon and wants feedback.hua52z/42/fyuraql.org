I'm partial to "King of the Junkyard", even if it feels a bit like 40 Millenia of Cultivation meets Worm. Smashing together two excellent series, putting a fresh spin on it and giving it a writer equal to the task? Yes please.

The "Infinite Dungeon" story seems to lack a good reason to pressure the protagonist.

The heroes journey in the "Zenith of Sorcery" is likely to be stunted by the fact that the character has already risen to power, and so you get the narrative burden to exposit upon all of the character's powers, so that we can lean on Sanderson's second law, but none of the joy of seeing him get there. This just seems like a likely supply of overlong infodumps. Then once you finally get all that rooted and the audience gets comfortable you suffer the usual xianxia planeshift problem of abandoning all the character development and setting you just built and starting over fresh. I'm not saying it can't be overcome and done well, it is more that I'm saying that it hasn't.

"Refuge in the Void" seems like a perfectly viable story, it just doesn't appeal to me, personally. I have a hard time getting into lighter toned fiction.
