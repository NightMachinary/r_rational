I tried reading the Chronicles again more recently and was, mm, a bit put off. The writing is really macho, sexist, and Corwin comes off as an asshole to his sisters; some of the assumptions about their personalities and motivations could fit well in [[/r/menwritingwomen][r/menwritingwomen]]. So -- if that's what you didn't like about him, I totally understand. But the book is old; now verging on really old. I read it as a kid and (dating myself here) there was nothing weird about it at the time. I think today you'd have to read it sort of like a mix of old-school pulp and noir fiction, forgiving or ignoring the styles of the time.

As for what I still like about him, here's my pitch (spoilers included): the story is essentially about his relationships with his siblings and dad; although that fact is not immediately obvious, either to the reader or Corwin himself. Each person he encounters has a history with him that must be uncovered; old feuds and friendships. In the first story arc, Corwin builds up his power, gets an edge, makes his bid -- and loses. He's crippled, imprisoned, and left in prison to brood on his failures. Later, he escapes, makes a new plan and begins to win. But on the way he also begins to realize that, despite his advanced age, he really isn't fully mature, and that there's a great deal about the universe that he never understood. Ultimately, he gets what he wants -- but the weight of his deeds has built up on his conscience, forcing him to consider whether he's actually the right person. He concludes that he isn't, validates the character growth of one of his brothers by giving him the crown, and goes into the Shadows to fix his mistakes. It's a redemption arc, in short. To the point of this thread, the story would not have worked with a child protagonist. None of the siblings are right or justified, all of them know what they want from the start and pursue it without hesitation; there's no time wasted on immature fumbling around; but, everyone in the story still has character growth and is vastly changed by the end.

Sorry about the length, as they say, if I'd had more time I would have written less.
