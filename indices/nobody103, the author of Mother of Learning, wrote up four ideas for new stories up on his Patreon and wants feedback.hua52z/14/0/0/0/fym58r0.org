I feel like you're misunderstanding what mature protagonists can be? Implying that readers want a mature protagonist so that they can focus on power speculation and numbers going up just sounds like you've spent a lot of time reading poorly written wish fulfillment stories

Both adults and teenagers can have the same struggles, in terms of categories: needing to adapt to challenges regarding friends, lovers, and their approach to the world. Adults simply have pasts that create nuance. Kids and teenagers have to start off by making relatively predictable mistakes that we all make at that age -- and if they don't, then they don't come off as authentic kids. All that said, authors can screw up and write kids that act like adults, or adults who come off as wooden or uncomplicated, and progression fiction isn't exactly a wellspring of good writing about relationships and personalities to start with, so I'd really have to go outside the genre for most examples of what I mean.
