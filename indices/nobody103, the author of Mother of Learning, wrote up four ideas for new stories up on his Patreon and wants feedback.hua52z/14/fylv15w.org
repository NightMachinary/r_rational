Dang. I don't think I'm interested in these.

They seem to follow a more recent crop of progression fantasy type stories that eschew the coming of age aspect for an already mature protagonist that's experiencing "arrested development" in a power-level sense only, usually due to circumstances of birth or other misfortune.

I enjoyed Zorian a lot because I felt like his teenaged cynicism was genuine and well executed. I'm not sure I want to read about these guys.
