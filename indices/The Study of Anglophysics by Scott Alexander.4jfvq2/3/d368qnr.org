Since the last time this was posted to the subreddit was two years ago, and we have UNSONG (by the same author) constantly being posted to here, I thought this was worthy of a repost. Also if we are going to read a story about traveling to a world with drastically different rules of physics, then [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/hq/universal_fire/][Eliezer's rant]] is mandatory reading.

Side Question: Does anyone know of any off-line copies of articles from Scott's blog? I've been thinking about making my own copy of it, but I don't want to go through all of the work to make a nice version if one already exists.
