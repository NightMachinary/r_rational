Eliezer's wrant is just wrong, though. In Norse World, people still work, presumably through the power of an animating force, rather than through chemical reactions. It makes perfect sense for a chemical-human to be translated to an animating-force-human, and and for the chemical-match to be translated to a just-wood-match. Presumably people would be perfectly fine if they were placed into a vaccum-sealed chamber, because they never needed oxygen in the first place.

The rant is completely inapplicable unless something in the story shows that animating-force-people can't survive in vaccum-sealed chambers or such, but that seems unlikely.
