I just have to say, just to feel normal again; holy shit! Can you imagine if this concept was actually real? And there was some way to verify that it was the guy's ascended conciousness running the show in his new world? Not only would this resolve the Fermi Paradox (the creator of our world imagined an inhabited planet in a universe, not a universe filled with inhabited planets) but who would want to stay on Earth when you could, theoretically, essentially upload your mind to a new universe on your deathbed? EDIT: If all of the above was true, what would you do?
