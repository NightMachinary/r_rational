Also check out the interactive fiction game [[http://emshort.com/counterfeit_monkey/][Counterfeit Monkey]] by Emily Short if you like settings that run on linguistics.

You can play it online [[http://iplayif.com/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifarchive.org%2Fif-archive%2Fgames%2Fglulx%2FCounterfeitMonkey.gblorb][here]], but the standalone gblorb emulators like Gargoyle are less laggy.
