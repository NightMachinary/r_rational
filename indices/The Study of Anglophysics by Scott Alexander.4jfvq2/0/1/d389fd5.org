Do synonyms exist (as anglophysical reality)? Somon gave the True Names as "rock" and "wheat", not "rock or stone or granite or pebble" and "wheat or grain or seed or food"

  We tried the experiment again with a zinc vial -- zinc because it was implausible that there was an ZINC + E anagram lurking out there -- and ended up with a mat of eels. Through this whole time, we had been debating the problem of ambiguity -- who was to say that our granite was GRANITE rather than ROCK or even STONE -- and the answer seemed to be that Dr. Adwell -- or whoever was watching Upstairs -- was mostly sympathetic to our efforts. Well, the sympathy ended when we started trying to isolate single letters. ZINC became METAL and thence EEL MATs.
