Interesting rant, but there are plenty of solutions to that problem if you allow some kind of magic. In particular, I'm thinking of having magic work by subtly adjusting the laws of physics. Why would such a thing evolve. Well what if some parts of human physiology doesn't actually work in our universe. I don't really care why exactly, but it doesn't seem that impossible. It's not like we are in the habit of running particle accelerates through humans or even animals. If this was the case than it would be reasonable that chemical reactions inside a human would continue functioning as normal, but nothing would be known for sure about things outside.
