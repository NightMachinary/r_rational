[[http://craphound.com/down/download.php][/Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom/]] is one of his best - it's post-scarcity transhumanism through a (fairly) optimistic lens. [[http://craphound.com/rotn/Cory_Doctorow_and_Charles_Stross_-_Rapture_of_the_Nerds.html][/Rapture of the Nerds/]] is also pretty good, and was co-written with Charles Stross (most well-known for /Accelerando/ and /The Laundry Files/).

[[http://craphound.com/ftw/Cory_Doctorow_-_For_the_Win.htm][/For the Win/]], [[http://craphound.com/littlebrother/download/][/Little Brother/]], and /Homeland/ (sequel to /Little Brother/) are all YA, and I wasn't terribly impressed with them, though /Little Brother/ felt like the best of the bunch.

My favorite short story of his is [[http://www.infinitematrix.net/stories/shorts/i-robot.html][/I, Robot/]], which is his take on Asimov's Three Laws. I generally consider Doctorow to be a better short story writer than a novelist, but I'd have to track down which ones in specific I thought were the best.
