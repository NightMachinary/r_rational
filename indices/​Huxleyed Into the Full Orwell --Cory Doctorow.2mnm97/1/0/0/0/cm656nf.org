To someone with Doctorow's mindset, it goes like this:

1. People violate the DMCA.
2. People get arrested for that.
3. People protest in creative ways and engage in a media assault.
4. The protest gets widespread attention.
5. The masses widely agree that it's bullshit.
6. The politicians, now under pressure, change the policies in order to get re-elected.

This requires optimism at pretty much every stage - optimism that the media would give a shit about a protest, optimism that the masses would give a shit about the media, optimism that the political pressure could last long enough to impact policy, etc. I imagine that Doctorow is hampered a bit by the short story format (about 2,000 words here), but to "get" this story you have to buy into some of his worldview re: political activism and its results.
