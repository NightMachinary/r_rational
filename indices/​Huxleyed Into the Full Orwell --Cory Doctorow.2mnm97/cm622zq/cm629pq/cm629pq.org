The cynical (and in my opinion, probably realistic) view is that no one is really making that much of a difference. But given that it's Doctorow, I think the intended message is more along the lines of "together we're strong, and the message is unstoppable even though they'll try their best to stop it". They can put us in Free Speech Zones, and throw on riot gear, but that won't put a dent in our ability to be heard.
