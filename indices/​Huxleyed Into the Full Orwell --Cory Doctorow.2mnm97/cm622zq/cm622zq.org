I'm a bit confused about the message here. I think what just happened is that Kitty was arrested, so Shandra protested, so Shandra was arrested, so the narrator protests, so....

Is the implication that the narrator will actually take action there at the end? Or is it just a never ending loop of didn't-make-a-difference?
