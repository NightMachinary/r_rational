  It wasn't that Shikamaru couldn't run, it wasn't his legs that were damaged, after all, but that kind of sustained exertion was also really strenuous and wouldn't be good for him

Well, I confess I didn't expect an end here. Was a good cooldown scene with Anko relating her past few weeks to friends and lovers, struggling with guilt and grief and possibly anger while she did so.

As to writing stories, I've been doing so for a year or two now. Haven't gotten about to finishing any, but I have fun coming up with ideas and writing plots based on them.
