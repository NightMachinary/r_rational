Some criticism:

A. the interaction of Anko/Reizo/Ibiki wasn't well-written. The primary issue is one of over description. You explicitly write that Reizo is Anko's girlfriend and lover and that Ibiki is her boyfriend/lover, which isn't necessary given the scene that immediately follows. You could have simply written Anko arriving in her house, Reizo and Ibiki comforting her, and the reader would have made the obvious connections.

-you write:

"Ibiki and Reizo pressed close; Anko was a tactile person, and the best reassurance they could give was simple contact and a willing ear."

Here again you overdescribe. If Reizo and Ibiki pressing close, we can assume that Anko is a tactile person; we don't have to be told that.

"Having to do those things to her own students must have torn Anko apart. She still had nightmares every couple of months about Orochimaru's training; *she always woke up screaming and lashing out*" Again this part feels extraneous.

"Reizo smiled; the laugh was a good sign. No matter how broken Anko was when she came home, once she managed to find something funny---no matter how dark or disturbing it might be---there was daylight ahead. Sometimes a long way ahead, but ahead." Maybe some people enjoy the inner narration of characters in this way, but this seems obvious. Do the readers really need that spelled out?

"Reizo looked at Ibiki with a confused frown, *silently asking if the joke was another 'ninja thing' and could he translate for the poor civilian*? He shrugged, just as mystified. Why was it funny that Shino and Hinata weren't going to be allowed to see their families?"

Again this is pretty extraneous. Just have her look at Ibiki with a puzzled frown, he shrugs, and readers get the implication.

"A moment later her eyes popped open; she looked up at his face and there were no defenses left, nothing to shield the woman inside the ninja's uniform."

I understand that the theme of this chapter here is to show Anko's emotional vulnerability but again I feel as though a better way to write this would be to be more implicit than just outright basically saying "this chapter is where I show Anko has feelings by showing her being vulnerable with her lovers".

Anyways, I've read/skimmed the fic as a whole and while I don't really feel like going through and critiquing the whole thing I will summarize by saying that I think your writing would be significantly improved by working on removing some description. On the other hand, the fic would also be improved by fleshing out some scenes (the return to Konoha, for one) more, so I'm not sure that blanket advice to streamline is a good idea.

B. This is more subjective and related to the tone of work: I personally found the introduction of the Republic annoying. If we take Naruto canon feats (even before the hilarious serial escalation of the World War arc late in manga/anime) seriously there's zero way guns are threatening to any ninja post Chunin rank. I understand that lets you dramatically escalate the fic and throw new variables into the work, but was done rather clumsily.

Some praise:

I'll echo the others here in saying that Orochimaru and Kurama were pretty well-portrayed as more intelligent than others. Their plans were well-designed with lots of contingencies and they generally stole very scene they were in.

Congrats on finishing the story, its rare that a good fanfic gets completed.
