I might do a short thing about them at some point. My headcanon version is that:

- Jiraiya is more or less a match for Orochimaru in terms of cunning but has different priorities--he's ruthless and Konoha-uber-alles but not psychopathic. He fights with ninjutsu and seals, showing a preference for indirection.

- Tsunade is smart but not on the same level as her teammates, and lacks their ambition. She is, however, by far the most dangerous of the three in close-quarters fighting.

A fight scene with / between the three of them would be fun.
