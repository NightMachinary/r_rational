Simply stunning, EagleJarl. I'd have gotten to this earlier, but I'm in the middle of transitioning my mobile reading to a different app, and had not yet transferred about half of the in-progress stories I've been reading.

I think I've only seen an Orichimaru pulled off that well once before, [[#s][although]]

Your version of Naruto's world seems like a fun place for a whole new level of conflict once the muggles start getting mixed in, and I can't help but wonder at what the ninja might try to keep up. Basic alliances? Unseal secrets? Unseal Bijuu? Create another "Sage of the Six Paths"-like event?

I think interactions between Kurama and the other Demon hosts would be interesting, depending on possible host/demon awareness and interaction with each other.

I sat down and wrote for a short bit. If I were to title it, I'd tentatively call it 'Showman'. I'm not exactly sure where I'm going with it, but I'll let it play out. So far, it's about a guy with a custom Tarot deck he made himself that he tells stories with. Not sure where I'm going with it, but things are already popping up(Telling the future has a price, that the main character absolutely does not want to pay.) that seem interesting. Oh, and writing is a slow process for me and I tend to get sidetracked easily, so I got that going for me, which is nice. :/

I signed up to FictionPress to post it, but I need to wait half a day.
