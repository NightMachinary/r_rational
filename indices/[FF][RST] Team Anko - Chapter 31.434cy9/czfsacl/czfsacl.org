Alright...now that this ride is over, I need to know more about TA Kurama. Please eaglejarl T_T

How sincere was he? Most of his arguments were well put together, but we had a certain lack of context that skewed it heavily in his favor in a lot of instances, making them SOUND very persuasive, but, if examined, you realized their foundation lies in evidence you're getting from the person trying to persuade you. Big no-no.

Does he actually like Orochimaru as much as he seems? Is he sincere about being here to help save humanity from itself? I gots to know!
