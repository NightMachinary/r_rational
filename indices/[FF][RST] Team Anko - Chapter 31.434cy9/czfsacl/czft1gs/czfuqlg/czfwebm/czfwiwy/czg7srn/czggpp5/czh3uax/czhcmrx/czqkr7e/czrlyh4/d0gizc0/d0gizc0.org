Why not have the promise thing be a lie? Did you have a strong reason for that? Because, to me, it almost makes more sense for that to just be another lie, even if its rooted in mythology surrounding the Tailed Beasts, that could just be something Kurama himself started when he first was released.

Also, thanks for the reply!
