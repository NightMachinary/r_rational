Thanks for this story. The last few chapters were a perfect guide to "how not to play Black Crusade" XD.

One note about Japanese: they don't say "doctor-san". Doctors, along with teachers, writers etc, have their own honorific - "sensei". When you are addressing a doctor, you say "(name)-sensei", or just "sensei". Profession name, 医師 (ishi), isn't used in addressing.
