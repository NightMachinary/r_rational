Uuuuugggghhh. That was good. That was *very good*. Last few chapters felt extremely abrupt, and the transition into Anko's report to the Hokage practically gave me whiplash, but I very much enjoyed the whole experience.

It goes without saying that you have the best Orochimaru I've ever seen, period, and I doubt I'll ever find one that I like more than your's. He was a bit like [[#s][HPMoR!]] in that his arguments were so persuasive that I sometimes found myself overlooking his less-than-ethical deeds and sociopathy. He differed from him in that he (seemingly) did have a Ruthless Utilitarian ethical model that was effortless for him to follow because of his sociopathy, and he seems to be utterly devoted to pushing humanity forward and keeping it alive. Every time he casually drove a semi-truck through Team Anko's plans, just oozing that "one level higher than you" swagger, I couldn't really feel all that upset. This was true despite the fact that the part of my brain that was comparing this story to all the other pieces of fiction I've experienced was just kinda yelling that the antagonist was *not* supposed to be this utterly superior, and that clever plan-wrecking was the purview of the protagonists. For consistently achieving that sense of narrative wrongness, a solid gold star for you.

A bit disappointed to see it end here. It does make me desperately want a sequel to explore the sheer number of interesting plot threads left unresolved. I do really want to see more of Orochimaru doing his thing and actually turning out to be the hero that the world needs, to everyone's awkward realization.
