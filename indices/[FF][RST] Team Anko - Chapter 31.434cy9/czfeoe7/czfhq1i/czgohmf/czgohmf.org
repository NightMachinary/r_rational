/Blinks/ Your intended end from the beginning was Naruto mostly succumbed to the fox and trapped in Sound while the rest of the party is home, Hinata still having the same home problems that a lot of this happened because of, and tons of outstanding plot threads?

That seems like a particularly weird target end state if you have no definite plans for a sequel in mind.
