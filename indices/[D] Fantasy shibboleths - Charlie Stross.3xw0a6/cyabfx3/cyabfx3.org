I have a big issue with discontinuities of consistency.

If magic is wild and untamable how does some one get a consistent result reliably?

If you can create an object from nothing that is permanent? how does the world deal with that?

Really for me fantasy is frustrating when it seizes on these things.

I can sum it up as being a problem when I see "well it's exactly like this thing I'm already familiar with even though the things depicted in the story do not support the world having any stability longer then a DAY like this".

When stories say that kind of contradiction I get annoyed.
