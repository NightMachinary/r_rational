I think the point of this article is largely:

#+begin_quote
  The rules of the fictional world must be sane and consistent.
#+end_quote

Which is taken from our sidebar. Because Stross is a smart guy and extremely well-read, he tends to see the places where the fictional world isn't sane and consistent a lot better than we do.

But the issue with /race essentialism/ is that it's reprehensible, not that it represents a lack of rigor in terms of worldbuilding, pseudo-historical accuracy, sociology, etc. If orcs and humans can't interbreed, then I think it's perfectly acceptable to present orcs as being dumber, more violent, etc., even if I agree with Stross that it likely has its roots in a bad worldview.
