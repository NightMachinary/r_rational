Not a bad effort by Stross. I personally find things bug me in proportion to how much I know personally contrasted by how much the author shows his work - currency is honestly not that interesting to me, even though I did appreciate Neal Stephenson's Baroque Trilogy, and Pratchett's Making Money. If an author wants to gloss over the way currency works most of the time without dwelling on exchange rates and metals in coins and so forth then that's totally OK with me - contra the implied criticism in HPMOR, Rowling's children's novels are not worse children's books for omitting a 50 page treatise on micro and macro economics in a world of magic.

A longer series of rants about various aspects of fantasy in were written by Limyaael aka Arin i Asolde on livejournal and have been [[https://curiosityquills.com/limyaael/][archived]] elsewhere. I quite liked them for a similar, more voluminous take on the same sort of thing.
