Yeah, I think about the effects of magic on currency (for example, /Shadows of the Limelight/ has people with the ability to create gold from nothing, so the gold standard has to take a hike, which means being careful about wording) but there are precious few people who really want to hear about that sort of thing and it's rare that it makes for a better book. I think Stross is more upset about authors not doing even a little bit of due diligence in worldbuilding, whether that makes it into prose or not.
