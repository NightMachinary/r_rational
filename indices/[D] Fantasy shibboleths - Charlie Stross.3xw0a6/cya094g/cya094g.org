1:10:100 copper:silver:gold pieces aren't ludicrous. It's unusual for them to be that neat, certainly, but there were Roman coins with those proportions on several occasions.

Also, if you do what Rowling did and have more realistic, awkward proportions, you'll get critics complaining that nobody could use such awkward currency and people (presumably) getting thrown out of it when they lose track.
