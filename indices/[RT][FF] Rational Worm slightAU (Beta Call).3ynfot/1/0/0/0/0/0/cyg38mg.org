/Natural triggers/ do, yes. Cauldron capes are less clear.

  Scion IIRC cares about gathering as much combat data for his shards as he can.
#+end_quote

If you take a very generous interpretation of 'cares' (ie. 'I remember caring about this once. I should do a thing with that? I guess maybe.'), yes. He manages the shards because that's 'what he's supposed to do', but he's also very aware that 'what he's supposed to do' is pointless.

  But even so, Simurgh and Contessa are not omniscient and certain capes are beyond their calculations.
#+end_quote

True.. I don't know what you can do with it though. Say Eidolon wants to figure out how Contessa ticks, in detail.. Okay, probably doable if Contessa isn't actively trying to prevent it. Or figuring out the endbringers, even. But as soon as he starts looking outside that, to people and organizations that are not Contessa-immune / Simurgh immune.. what is really going on -- for example, whether any individual is truly competent or simply important enough to be managed by C or S for the time being -- falls into doubt.
