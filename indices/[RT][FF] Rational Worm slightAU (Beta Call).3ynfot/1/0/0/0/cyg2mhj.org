The degree of this influence is never actually made clear. It's easy to say it is mild, for the sake of the story. Even if you say that it is strong, it doesn't preclude writing a rational fic. It's also doubtful that Scion cares about doing .. anything ever, really, so he's not really a pressing concern in terms of agency, either, even if he had the best PtV in existence.

Contessa and the Simurgh, on the other hand, /are/ actively interfering, and are pretty much literal deus ex machina. "Basically everything was a Simurgh plot, except the parts that were Contessa plots" -- not disprovable. *Nobody*, aside from Scion and maybe endbringers, *has the power to figure out what is really going on* if Contessa or Simurgh don't want them to. I'm not asking for people to be totally free of influence, I'm just saying it has to be merely /possible/ for them to figure out what is really going on; they have to have some amount of agency higher than zero, rather than merely having the illusion of agency.
