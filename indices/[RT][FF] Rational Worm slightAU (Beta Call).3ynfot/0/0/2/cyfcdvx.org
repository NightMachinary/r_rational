  Don't you mean, "One of the most awesome things about Worm is the fights lasting for upwards of 20k words and still not boring or over long (except for the one with Echidna)"?

We probably have different preferences, because most of the major set-piece fights that went on for tens of thousands of words started to fatigue and then bore me. (I'm pretty sure that this is a common complaint, though people vary widely in which particular fights they felt the fatigue on.)
