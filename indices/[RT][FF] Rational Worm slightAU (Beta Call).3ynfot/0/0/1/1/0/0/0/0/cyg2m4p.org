IIRC rational fiction is not about EVERYONE striving for rational methods. Worm powers are constructed to drive conflicts, not to help people. That's why entities created them. If someone tries to do otherwise, Endbringer appears and puts an end to said activity (like with Mannequin or Dragon's creator). To change it you would have to basically write it basically from scratch. Also characters are not completely mindfucked by their passengers. They still have their own goals and reasons.

Completely rewritting particular setting to fit one's agenda doesn't seem very rational.
