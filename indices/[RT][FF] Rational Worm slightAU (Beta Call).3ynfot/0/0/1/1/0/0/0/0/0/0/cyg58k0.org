And if you take away these alien worms, what will remain? They are basically the centerpiece of Worm. Removing them is like writting Harry Potter without magic. Of course you can write a story, when both entities crashlanded, there are no Endbringers and everyone is working for the sake of humanity, but I wouldn't call something like that rational setting, but rather utopia. What did humanity IRL after discovering nuclear fission? Gave everyone in the world cheap energy? Nope, aside from creating some nuclear power plants they nuked Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Setting, where everyone is rational and uses his/her resources to help the world instead of caring about own gain doesn't seem very rational, cause it assumes all people to be "good".

Insult? Nope, I am just saying, that rewritting setting to fit particular ideas, that are conflicting it's basic idea doesn't seem to be very rational. If you felt offended, then sorry, it wasn't my intent.
