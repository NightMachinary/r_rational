  And if you take away these alien worms, what will remain?
#+end_quote

A story that isn't rational or isn't anything like Worm, one or the other.

  Of course you can write a story, when both entities crashlanded, there are no Endbringers and everyone is working for the sake of humanity, but I wouldn't call something like that rational
#+end_quote

There's some confusion here. I'm not suggesting anything should change about the story, I'm not suggesting any ways to make it more rational or utopia-like. I'm saying that it's not a rational story as written.
