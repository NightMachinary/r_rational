Not really.

Taylor is the only one who munchkins her powers. That one guy who made hands come out of things actually had to have her tell him "hey, you should carry around samples of stuff to make hands come out of."

No one actually uses their powers efficiently. Taylor should be pollinating fields and removing pests, not engaging in Righteous Face Punching by insect proxy.

The entire setting can only be made even vaguely plausible by alien worms in people's heads taking away their free will and forcing them to act in accordance with the plot.

So, no. Not terribly rational.
