Hm, I suspect I'd have been better served by sampling a different scene. In general, in the fic, there's insight into the characters through the exposition (though I'm obviously biased.) In that particular case though, neither Coil nor Christner were likely to reveal information necessary to the story. I'll taken your feedback into note though, and see if I can polish that bit up a bit. I actually had Coil having fun joining into the conversation talking about himself in an earlier iteration.
