It's not that I dislike infodumps, it's that I dislike super clunky ones. Three or four paragraphs into the story and the POV character runs into some random people having an "as you know, Bob" conversation which lays out all the differences from cannon for the reader?

Come /on/! This is supposed to be a rational story? People don't have those kinds of conversations in real life for the most part, certainly not so conveniently. What people actually do all the time in real life is go over some part of their situation in their head, explain it to themselves (at least I do this), to come up with ideas and fresh insights.

You've got a close POV on the thoughts of a character who is in the know. Use it! If you want to spice it up and make it interesting have Coil come to some unusual or unexpected or ironic conclusions. (Maybe, "I really value that Skitter, I think she will be the most useful of my minions, and will never use a deathtrap if I try to kill her because that might be very dangerous." Or a discussion of exactly why he will never let his soldiers carry grenades of any kind if he tries to catch Skitter in a death trap. Or something else interesting and kind of awesome.)

Don't do "as you know, Bob" between strangers just as he happens to be walking by. At this rate next thing you'll have the plot look in a mirror and describe how tall it is and how handsome or busty. If you've got to take an infodump, just take the dump, don't dress it up with devices that were clunky a century ago.
