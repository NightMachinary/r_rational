People have vastly different preferences when it comes to infodumps. I don't mind them so much, but some do. You can never satisfy everyone, and in the end only you can decide how much is needed, and how it's presented. That said, on the writing subs this is probably the most common criticism people have of every author ever. I don't understand it, and have grudgingly adjusted by toning down and camouflaging my own dumping, though that's much easier in original fiction, where the whole world is an unknown, than in fanfics, where the reader will assume they know things to be true unless you explicitly point out that it's not.
