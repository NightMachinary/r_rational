Anecdotal evidence time! I can report eventually giving up on Worm around Arc 16 or so specifically because I just couldn't take it anymore, despite really enjoying Taylor's character and story. I tend not to like the superhero genre in general for this reason.

Also re: "not over long" --- my feeling all the way from chapter 1.01 to wherever it was I gave up was that the story's wordcount could be reduced by about 50% with no ill effect. Which is fine! Wildbow was outputting chapters at a remarkable rate, and cutting excess verbiage is a task for the editing phase, not the drafting phase. But I absolutely found every chapter --- every paragraph, even --- overlong.
