This is the HPMOR!darkfic spin-off I didn't know that I needed. Very brilliant, very dark. The text does a good job with making us throw out all of our previous assumptions about Quirrelmort (his seemingly accidental rage filled toss of the Cauldron). This creates ambiguity and fear (will Harry die, will he torture's Harry's family in retaliation, etc.) In terms of getting an ending as Happy as canon, it makes it seem impossible, yet at the same time I want to see Harry try (although I would be interested in seeing this interpretation of Quirrelmort in action). Also, with the entire epilogue being an obliviated memory now, well did Quirrelmort know that was Dumbledore's real plan or guess at it? The explanation for Dumbledore's plan makes sense in hindsight, but did Quirrelmort fabricate this just to appease Harry's ego? If so, you will need an explanation for all of Dumbledore's weirdness, hopefully something more satisfying than senility and dementia. Remember that your are free to rewrite facts established as being merely part of the memory charm simulation, but at the same time, some readers may forget this so it will help to remind them.
