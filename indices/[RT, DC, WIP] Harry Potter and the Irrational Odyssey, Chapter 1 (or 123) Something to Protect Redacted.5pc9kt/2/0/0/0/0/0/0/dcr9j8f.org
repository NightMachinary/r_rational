Well, your Voldermort apparently has the capability to run thoughts of other people at subjective speeds around 100x normal, so it would make sense if he could partially use this on himself when he needs extra thinking time. And Harry is a mind copy of him, so if you really wanted to +handwave+ justify Harry's thinking speed, you could claim he subconsciously utilized an ability Voldemort had modified himself to have.
