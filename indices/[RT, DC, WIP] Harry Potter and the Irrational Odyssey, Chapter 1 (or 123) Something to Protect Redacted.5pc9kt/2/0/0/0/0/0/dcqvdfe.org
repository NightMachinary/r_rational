  in which Eliezer writes Harry as being frankly inhumanly good at thinking of such things

This. Eliezer seems to be operating under the impression that brains are computers which use algorithms and run simulations.

Brains are lumps of meat which process stimuli and form connections between areas that tend to work simultaneously. Human beings are a species of animal. We are not magical entities of pure disembodied thought.

  having Voldemort be a genuinely rational character that harms people not out of sadism or carelessness but because it's simply the most effective way to achieve his goals is a beautifully effective way of achieving this

Where was this in the final arc of HPMOR when Voldemort picked up the idiot ball and turned into a caricature?

I'm just adding layers. Voldemort isn't going to be exhibiting any further impulsive behaviours, this is the only shown breakdown. I don't know if I said it here or in response to someone else so I'll say it again, this is a very rough draft and I did a poor job of setting up that particular payoff. The whole "Voldemort genuinely realizing that Harry may be correct in evaluating that persisting in his psychopathy is in fact contrary to his own fundamental utility function" thing? That's what's supposed to have caused him to crack. There's a theoretical possibility that the entire structure of this chapter is going to be shuffled and rearranged, and Voldemort's breakdown might happen after the conversation about hedonics that I didn't include in this draft.
