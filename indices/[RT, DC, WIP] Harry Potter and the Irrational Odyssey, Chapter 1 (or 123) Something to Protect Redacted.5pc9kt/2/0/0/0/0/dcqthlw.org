I see, I didn't realize that Harry /doesn't/ in fact immediately realize that his experiences were faked, though looking back I can see what you were trying to convey. I sort of jumped to that conclusion because he immediately thinks Hermione is dead, which I imagined would only make sense if he thought the events of her resurrection were not true. I guess I have to say if I were placed in Harry's position, thinking that Hermione was dead would not be my first conclusion, I would think that some type of illusion or teleportation magic was at play (even despite the "melting" detail), and probably would continue thinking so until it was shoved in my face that it had all been an elaborate simulation, though maybe I'm not as clever as Harry.

While the desire for temporality is reasonable (I can agree that HPMOR is a bit long winded with Harry's thought processes in places, though I think it's understandable considering Eliezer's goals) I think you sacrifice a little bit too much and make it too hard to understand what Harry is thinking. There is something to be said for the fact that sometimes the speed of thought can be significantly faster than the speed of speech/text, such that it can be very reasonable to have a solid paragraph of thought description that only takes a second or two in "story time". I admit that it may be the case that I err on the side of enjoying an unrealistic level of description though.

Personally, my interpretation of the HPMOR canon was that Harry is a reasonably strong Occulmens, aided by The Enemy's adult thought processes being projected onto his immature mind. He seems to at least have satisfied a certified Occlumens instructor (though now that I think of it, I can't remember if it's ever stated explicitly whether or not Harry formally graduated from his instruction with Mr. Bester, though I know it's implied in several places). And I didn't mean to imply that Harry would have been trying to use Occlumency immediately upon being the room, just that he would have tried it after The Enemy explicitly explained eye-contactless Legilimency. While I concede I /am/ considering this from the comfort of my cushy armchair, Legilimency and Occlumency go together naturally enough in my brain that I thought of it /immediately/, which means I can't help but find it something of an oversight that Harry doesn't think of it at all. I appreciate what you were trying to go for with making him too panicked to think clearly enough to consider it, but I can't imagine that I'm the only one who's going to think that you missed something really important if you just don't mention it /at all/. Especially considering that you're branching this off of HPMOR, in which Eliezer writes Harry as being frankly /inhumanly/ good at thinking of such things ;)

I didn't want to bring it up in my initial feedback as I thought it a bit more of a quibble of subjective asthetics, but since you expound on it a bit more I have to say I'm not that much of a fan of adding impulsive behavior to The Enemy's base psyche. My interpretation of The Enemy in HPMOR is that while he is a narcissistic psychopath, he is at his core deeply rational, always choosing his actions based on maximum estimated utilions per expenditure of effort, and that he sees actions such as petty tantrums to be needlessly emotional and beneath him. In my opinion this unyielding rationality is a brilliant way of humanizing an otherwise very dislikable character, because even if you disagree with his values you can still admire his unflinching rationality (especially so considering the target audience of the story). Having some element of genuinely admirable character is an important part of making antagonists more than just clich√©d Evil People who do bad things Because Evil, and having Voldemort be a genuinely rational character that harms people not out of sadism or carelessness but because it's simply the most effective way to achieve his goals is a beautifully effective way of achieving this, imo. That said, I do think your exploration of Voldemort genuinely realizing that Harry may be correct in evaluating that persisting in his psychopathy is in fact contrary to his own fundamental utility function is a /fascinating/ one, and I'm interested to see more of that idea explored in the actual text.

Anyway, even if I don't agree on an aesthetic level with all of your choices, I think your decisions are reasonable and I'm looking forward to seeing how your story evolves :) Don't take my opinions as anything more than a single subjective data point, I just hope that I managed to give you some of the different perspectives you were looking for in asking for feedback.
