It may be a false memory in /my/ little branch of reality, but in the /main/ branch it really happened. If I'm going to make an assumption about how the resonance works in the main branch based on a Specific Thing that happens in the main branch, I feel like it only makes sense for the resonance to continue working the same way in an offshoot branch even though the Specific Thing doesn't happen in the offshoot branch.
