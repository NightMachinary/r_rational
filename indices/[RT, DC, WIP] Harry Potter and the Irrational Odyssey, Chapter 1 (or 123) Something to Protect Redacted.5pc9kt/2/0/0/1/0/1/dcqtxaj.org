While I admit this is all definitely open to interpretation, personally I think your evidence that Quirrell uses Legillimancy on Harry in the original series is sketchy at best, and all the other examples you list are not directly interacting with Harry. It's clear that Voldemort is immensely powerful, but that he's not capable of bringing his power to bear against Harry because it will resonate back against him with equal force. I stand by my interpretation of the original series that the resonance is crippling and potentially lethal to Voldemort if he uses any magic on Harry.
