A bit of feedback:

1) I would have included a bit more disorientation and confusion on Harry's part after he comes out of the simulation. I don't think that even a strong rationalist like Harry would be able to so quickly come to grips with such a world-shattering realization that the past few eventful days of his life were entirely fabricated, or even that such a thing is possible. It seems like he should at least momentarily consider some alternate hypotheses (maybe that he was somehow teleported somewhere and that someone was impersonating Quirrelmort for some reason) instead of having him pretty much immediately jump to the correct conclusion of a epic-scope memory charm simulation. I also think it would be far more impactful if Harry realizes that Hermione is still dead a tiny bit later on rather than being literally the first implication he realizes. I think you may be suffering a bit from the curse of knowledge of knowing the story you're telling ahead of time, as the scene you're trying to set up makes sense in retrospect, but the dots didn't connect very well for me on my first time reading it through.

2) I really think it's a pretty big oversight to not at least mention Harry's Occlumency. You could at least have Harry try to hastily throw up some Occlumency barriers and have The Enemy easily overcome them, thus demonstrating their irrelevance, but the fact that Harry doesn't even try to resist the eye-contactless Legilimency seems pretty sloppy to me.

3) You're missing a closing apostrophe after 'Friend' in the sentence <"Nothing," said the man Harry had once known as 'Professor,' 'Mentor,' and 'Friend.>

4) I realize you stated you're explicitly moving away from canon on this a bit, but I think there should be a few more serious ramifications for Voldie using magic on Harry, at least make using the memory charm visibly painful and laborious for him. Just having him use magic seemingly effortlessly on Harry seems like a really jarring break from how it's treated in the original series.

Overall really, really good for your first public work. Looking forward to more.
