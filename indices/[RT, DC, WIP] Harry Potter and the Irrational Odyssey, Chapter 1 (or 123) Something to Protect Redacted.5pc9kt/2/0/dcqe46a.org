I don't personally buy into that interpretation. I believe there's been a bit of a debate in the fandom about that for a few years now, whether "super-legilimency" is a real thing or a parlor trick.

This is my own parallel universe, which just so happens to resemble Yudkowsky's universe in every perceptible way up until a point of divergence. If there are an infinite number of universes, then there's a "you" out there in the multiverse who has, down to the atom, been exposed to all the same experiences and thoughts as you (and who's reading these exact words /right now/) whose path diverged significantly from your own at the word "significantly" when Princess Celestia opened an interdimensional portal into the alternate "you"'s bedroom.

As far as Harry using that justification in-universe, sure. If Harry hadn't been incredibly distracted, he might've been able to partake in witty banter for the audiences amusement, but "it is a sad rule that whenever you are most in need of your art as a rationalist, that is when you are most likely to forget it." Right?

And as far as the magical resonance between Harry and Voldemort, Harry clearly used "Stuporfy" on Voldemort in HPMOR and neither of them died. Maybe I'll have Harry have thoughts about the resonance and Voldemort can interrupt those thoughts with a lampshade. Voldemort /definitely/ crafted a False Memory Charm and stuffed it into Harry's brainhole, and he /definitely/ used Legilimency to pop in and do a bit of executive meddling. They are not inside the mirror.

Also, in much the same way that the original prophecy could've just as easily referred to Neville as it did to Harry, this prophecy could've just as easily referred to Voldemort as it did to Harry. I suppose I'll have to clarify that in the text. To be fair, it's 7pm and I woke up /yesterday/ at 2pm. I started writing this chapter at 2am yesterday, and I finished working on it about 5 minutes before I uploaded it. This is not the final version, I'm just trying to get some feedback.

In regards to your question about masks...

(I already typed this out before you deleted your comment and I really don't want to waste it.)

Oh but he didn't /purposefully/ discard any masks, they all fell off when he [[/s][spoiler]]. I tried to use dialogue tags and body language and such to show him putting on his Prof. Quirrell mask after the incident (so it would already be firmly in place after the Obliviation), and that trend continues up until the point when [[/s][spoiler]], but then Harry interrupts him.

His 'Voldemort' mask fell off, he regrouped, then put on his 'Prof. Quirrell' mask because it was the mask he was going to need a few moments later. There's no one else in the room listening, unless you count /us/ of course, and he's not currently aware of our existence.
