  Harry could have justified his disregard for Moody's warning

On the other hand, Moody is a very skilled dark-wizard hunter, so it would seem that he would at least get some evidence before taking this on hearsay. Legilimency should be usable in combat with enough skill right? If Moody fought Voldemort and analyzed others' memories of combat with Voldermort he should be able to tell this for sure. Harry was just carelessly trusting Quirrelmort's lie.
