Harry could have justified his disregard for Moody's warning, as I did when reading chapter 86, by assuming that everyone, as often, mistook common sense for Legilimency. Spreading that misinformation is totally in character for a Riddle - remember the finger snapping?

Also there was the part about Voldemort presumably not being able to use magic directly on Harry.

In fact this evidence is strong enough that I'm expecting you to reveal that he can't enchant Harry or legilimize without eye contact, this instead being a trick. For example, they might both be in the mindscape of a thrall of Voldemort's, or^{in^{the^{mirror}}}

Also if his death caused the end of the world it would hardly be "HE IS HERE. HE IS THE END OF THE WORLD.". If the heat death stuff was the true interpretation of the prophecy, Voldemort would recognize that, for he heard Trelawney's words and remembers Trelawney's voice - unless the heat death first needs to happen for him to recognize it?
