I see...

In my original draft, "Chapter 123" was relatively short, and then there was a line break and we moved directly into Chapter 1, just like this...

--------------

Chapter 1: "The Truth, Part 6: A Riddle Reiterated"

"Time is wasting," said Professor Quirrell. "Ask your questions, if you have them."

/Why, Professor Quirrell, why, why must you be this way, why make yourself the monster, why Lord Voldemort, I know you might not want the same things I do, but I can't imagine what you want that makes this the best way to get it.../

(fleeting disorientation)

A rush of adrenaline hit Harry's body like a Stunning Hex and he became accutely aware of a dull ache in his lower lip.

/Aw crap./

If Harry had needed to formalise the wordless inference that had just flashed into his mind, it would have come out something like, 'If I estimate the probability of what I just experienced occuring as the result of being Obliviated, versus the probability distribution for all the things that could happen naturally as a result of fluctuations in my body's various metabolic processes, then this experience is significant evidence that I've been Obliviated.'

But what Harry actually thought was, /Aw crap/.

/Question,/ said Harry's Ravenclaw side, /what are the chances that he isn't fully aware of the fact that we know we've been obliviated? You bit your lip before it happened, so you had to have known it was coming.../

--------------

That part is relatively final because most of it isn't mine, it's the beginning of Chapter 108 and I don't believe Chapter 108 plans on changing any time in the foreseeable future. Obviously I already did a "call back" to HPMOR with the "wordless inference" pattern so I'll have to rework that, but that's the flow of where this is going. The problem is that "StP: Redacted" more than doubled in length from what I thought it would be, it's almost a thousand words longer than HPMOR's first chapter; if I went through with my plan of having "Chapter 123" and "Chapter 1" be contained in the same chapter, my first chapter would almost /certainly/ end up /waaaaay/ longer than I intended. You have to hook people into reading, you can't just say "here's my first chapter, it's 30 pages long."
