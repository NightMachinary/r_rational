Ha, feel free to rip it to shreds. It's a little early to be beta testing because this is the only fully written chapter so there's not really anything else to read, but that's the main reason I did this. I've got 70 (+/- 5) chapters mapped out, but every time I tried to get deep into the details I ran into the problem of not knowing Harry's priors; I needed to know /exactly/ when [[/s][Spoiler]]. Now that I know that, I can continue.
