I think you're missing the fact that Quirrell is a high-level operator who makes fast updates on the fly. It's obvious that he was arranging for her to be at Mary's Place, but that doesn't necessarily indicate anything other than that he was going to wreak /some/ form of vengeance. I lean toward the interpretation that he had strong intentions but vague plans, and seized upon his /particular/ method of punishment only in that moment.

But whatev.
