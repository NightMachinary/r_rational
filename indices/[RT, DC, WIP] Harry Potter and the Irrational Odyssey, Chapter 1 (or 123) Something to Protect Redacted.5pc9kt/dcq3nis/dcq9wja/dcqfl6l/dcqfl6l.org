I didn't doubt that Quirrellmort has a deep agenda in that snippet. It just didn't seem like there's anyway that Harry has a place in that agenda other than a pawn. Based on what's presented: Quirell behaves in an antagonistic way (rather than like a mentor as throughout most of HPMOR); Harry is about to be mind-wiped and as such unlikely to be a threat to QM. If QM and Harry's goals were aligned, that wouldn't be necessary either.

Now, that's not to say that the story can't easily evolve into one with Harry as the protagonist and we witness his struggles against QM. Or anything else, like us slowly finding out what QMs 'third option' is. None of that would be particularly jarring. But as of the first chapter, it definitely does look like QM has won.
