I'm glad you're enjoying it :D

If you want a preview of what kind of trajectory this is going to take, this chapter is supposed to be a prologue to the /actual/ first chapter, and you can "ctrl+f" the word "reiterated" to find where I posted the first paragraph somewhere in this comments section.

I've actually left enough little nuggets of information in various replies here that you could probably make a pretty accurate prediction of what the first 5 chapters are going to look like.
