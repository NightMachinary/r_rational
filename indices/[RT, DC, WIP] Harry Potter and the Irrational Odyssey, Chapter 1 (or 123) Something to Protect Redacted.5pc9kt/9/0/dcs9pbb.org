Several people have expressed a similar concern. Harry hit Voldie with a Stuporfy and nobody exploded. Voldie has knowledge of all of Slytherin's secrets and is probably vastly more powerful than he lets on (the narrative notes that Prof. Q. seemed to "cast off a pretense of mortality" at one point). There are a few instances in HPMOR that appear to show Q/V knowing things he couldn't know without using Legilimency on Harry; Legilimancy is a subtle art, and Voldie is powerful; there's no reason to believe Harry would sense it at all if Voldie invaded his mind or that Voldie would suffer anything more than a bit of mild discomfort (if anything at all).
