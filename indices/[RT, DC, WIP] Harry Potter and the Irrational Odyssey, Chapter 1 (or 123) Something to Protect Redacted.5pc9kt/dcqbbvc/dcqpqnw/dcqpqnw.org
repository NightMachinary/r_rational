  Harry could have justified his disregard for Moody's warning, as I did when reading chapter 86, by assuming that everyone, as often, mistook common sense for Legilimency.

Yes, that'd be all well and good, but he didn't assume /anything/. Moody gave him his warning, and Harry didn't react to it /in any way at all whatsoever/, it was like it didn't happen.

--------------

Harry almost lost his grip on only pretending to hallucinate, only pretending to be the imaginary person that was screaming in shock and pain as the Legilimency tore apart his sanity and reshaped him to believe that he was on fire -

Harry managed to break eye contact, dropping his eyes to Moody's chin.

"You're out of practice, boy," Moody said. Harry wasn't looking at the man's face, but his voice was deadly grim. "And I'll warn you of this but once. Voldie isn't like any other Legilimens in recorded history. He doesn't need to look you in the eyes, and if your shields are that rusty he'd creep in so softly you'd never notice a thing."

"Duly noted," Harry said to the scarred chin. Harry was more shaken than he'd have admitted; Mr. Bester hadn't been anywhere near that powerful, and had never tested Harry like that. Pretending to be someone hurting that much had... Harry couldn't find words for describing what it felt like to contain an imaginary person in that much pain, but it hadn't been normal. "Do I get any credit for being an Occlumens in the first place?"

--------------

So I'll give him that, he didn't necessarily forget because he went off to cleverly play with his Time-Turner immediately afterwards. His thoughts are entirely centered on having his Occlumency barriers demolished, the immediately important concepts were /out of practice/ and /rusty shields/.
