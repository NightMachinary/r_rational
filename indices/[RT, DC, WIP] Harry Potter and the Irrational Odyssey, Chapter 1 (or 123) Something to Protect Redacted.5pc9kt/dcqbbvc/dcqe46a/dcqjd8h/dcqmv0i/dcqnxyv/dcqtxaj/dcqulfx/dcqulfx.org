That's fine, but an Avada Kedavra and a Patronus 2.0 collided, and Prof. Q. just threw his wand away and went animagus, and he was right as rain a few hours later. Nothing happened to Harry at all. Harry cast Stuporfy on Q/V, and no one exploded. Legilimancy is a subtle art. It might theoretically cause Voldemort a bit of discomfort, but I doubt it would be any more severe than that.
