  Just having him use magic seemingly effortlessly on Harry seems like a really jarring break from how it's treated in the original series.

I don't think it is. He brews the potion to extinguish the flame in the door to the Mirror room on the way in, but on the way out he effortlessly banishes the flame with a twitch of his wand. When he takes the newspaper from Harry to read the article about Rita Skeeter, the narration specifically says it was like he cast off a pretense of humanity, that he read each page in under a second. And there are multiple instances where Harry notes that Quirrell comes to the correct conclusion even when his priors are wrong, and I very strongly feel like those are references to Quirrell using Legillimancy on Harry. He has access to all of Slytherin's secrets. It isn't much of a stretch to imagine him being vastly more powerful than he lets on, and capable of effortlessly performing Legilimancy on Harry in spite of the resonance.
