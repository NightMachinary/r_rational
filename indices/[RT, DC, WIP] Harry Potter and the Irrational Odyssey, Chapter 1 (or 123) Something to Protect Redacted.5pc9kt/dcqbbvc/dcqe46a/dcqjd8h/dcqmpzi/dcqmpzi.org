Thank you for the feedback.

1) Disorientation and confusion is good, but I'm trying to maintain the illusion of temporality, I don't want time to stop while Harry has an internal monologue. Quirrellmort starts speaking to him before he's even fully out of the simulation, and Harry only has a few disoriented moments before Quirrellmort starts speaking again. I love HPMOR dearly, it has a special place in my heart, but it isn't perfect, and there are a lot of instances where the world stops moving to give Harry time to think. You don't have time to think in the real world. You don't have time to consider alternate hypotheses when The Enemy is speaking directly to you. However, based on your feedback, I will strongly consider reworking the "locate a hypothesis / locate a reaction / terrible realization" sentence to more thoroughly instill a sense of disorientation and confusion, but he only has about 4 or 5 seconds free to think, there are no free "momentarily"s in which to have considerations. I'd like to note that Harry never comes to a conclusion at all, much less jumps to the correct conclusion immediately. All he knows is that Hermione melted and then he was back in the potion room with The Enemy. I also disagree about the impact of the Hermione realization. I think that once he's had time to process that /something/ has happened and that he's lost two days, his first realization is going to be that he's lost Hermione again.

2) Harry is not an Occlumens, he's a little boy who fancies himself an Occlumens. Read the scene where Mad-Eye /immediately/ decimates Harry's barriers. Anyway, "it is a sad rule that whenever you are most in need of your art as a rationalist, that is when you are most likely to forget it." Right? That's the point. Harry is bewildered and disoriented and his brain is trying to mourn Hermione again, his brain is doing too many different things to retrieve the tag "Occlumency," he doesn't remember what he ate for breakfast that morning and he's certainly not going to remember anything to do with Occlumency. You might be proficient in the proper use of pepper spray, but if you turn around and see a Grizzly charging at you, your brain is going to flush everything that isn't a primal automatic reaction. That's kinda what I'm going for.

  but the fact that Harry doesn't even try to resist the eye-contactless Legilimency seems pretty sloppy to me.
#+end_quote

He never thought once about the possibility of eye-contactless Legilimency after it was first mentioned to him (indeed, he didn't even give the warning any recognition at all as it was being given). He was thinking his own private thoughts while Quirrellmort wasn't paying him any attention, he had no rational reason to suspect that Q was capable of doing it and it doesn't make sense for him to try to "resist" it, as if he's aware of it happening in the first place.

3) By Jove, you're right. To be fair, that line probably isn't making the final cut, I was just trying to be done with the draft while not falling back into "draft-style placeholder writing."

Once again, thank you for your analysis. I'm definitely going to take a lot of these things into consideration; just knowing how people react to certain things lets me know where I need to make changes, this is incredibly helpful.

Also, since I keep throwing random tidbits of explanation into all these different replies, I'll put something here too; I don't think a lot of people realize that Quirrellmort's last line isn't referring to any specific person's death, or to "death" at all. I'll need to make it a lot more blatant, I suppose... there's a "happiness" argument that I cut out of here that would've happened after Q says "Does that sound about right" and before he mentions the third option. There's a bit of an argument about "happiness" in HPMOR Ch. 108 that was going to be revisited with stuff about hedonics and "fun" that I would've had to dive heavily into The Sequences for and I just didn't feel like doing all that today, because that would've required me to make a decision about whether or not Harry is allowed to remember that conversation, and I don't trust "sleep-deprived Liz" to make decisions like that.

I'll go ahead and say it obviously, because it was /meant/ to be obvious, the audience is /supposed/ to be perfectly aware of Q's motives before Ch. 1 even starts.

The third option. Quirrell doesn't want to become empathetic, he doesn't care about Salomon's House or any other Baconian and/or transhumanism utopia nonsense, he does not /at all/ want to be "fixed" like the Confessor from Three Worlds Collide. Quirrell also spent 10 years in social isolation floating around in space, and does not want to be alone with his thoughts for trillions of years after the earth is destroyed. I did a bad job setting up the values dissonance between Harry and Quirrell in this draft, and I see now that there is no hope of this chapter being a 5 page introduction before the main event, it's gonna have to top out at over 10,000 words. It's meant to be understood that Quirrell let his mask slip and had small breakdown because he realized that Harry really /was/ right, that the whole transhumanism thing that Eliez- I mean, that HARRY has been preaching, really /is/ correct, that life has value and that /he's/ the one with the problem. Obviously, as a narcissistic psychopath, this is a most unpleasant dilemma. His one joy was killing idiots, and Harry has categorically proven to him that he was "happying" incorrectly. He no longer has any meaning in life and has realized that the only way to end his suffering is to cease to "be." But Harry and all his stupid little Muggles are going to Live Forever in a Science Fiction Utopia In Space, which he may have dreamed of as a very young boy in the orphanage. This fills him with jealous rage. Thus, he settles upon a NEW goal, which is very much meant to be known by the audience but not by Harry:

The cessation of Existence. Oblivion. The destruction, not of the world, not of the universe, but of Reality, and All Possible Realities. Voldemort's goal is to Bring About The End Of The All.

I see clearly now that simply saying "the third choice is the cessation of Existence" was a woefully inadequate attempt at explanation.
