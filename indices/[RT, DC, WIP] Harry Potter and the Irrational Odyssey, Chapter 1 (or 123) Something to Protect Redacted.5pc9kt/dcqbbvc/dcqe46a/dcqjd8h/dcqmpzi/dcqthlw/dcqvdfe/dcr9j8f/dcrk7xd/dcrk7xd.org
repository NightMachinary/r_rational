That's a very fair point, but 1) Voldemort actually /is/ a magical entity of disembodied thought (I think the narrative of HPMOR makes it very clear through "Prof. Q"'s "zombie state" that Voldemort leaves and enters that body at will) and 2) this is third person limited, the narrative is only aware of what Harry's aware of, Harry isn't aware of anything like that to "tell" and there's nothing you could do in the narrative to "show" it other than interrupt an action/dialogue scene with a 5 paragraph chunk of monologue, and the reader isn't going to attribute that to Harry having a magically enhanced thinking speed, they're going to attribute it to authorial sloppiness.
