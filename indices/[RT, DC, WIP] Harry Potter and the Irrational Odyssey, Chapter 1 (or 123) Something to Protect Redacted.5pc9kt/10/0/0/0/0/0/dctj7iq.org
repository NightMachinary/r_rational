Wait, really? Where did he say that? I guess that makes sense...

  Their last relevant memory was of Flume refusing to help them, though they couldn't remember what they'd asked him to do...

But in Chapter 25, he sighs and says "All right, what do you want?" which implies that he agreed and then removed their memories of him agreeing.

Yeah, wow, I just assumed it was Quirrell all this time. I don't think it changes a lot, he still couldn't've talked to Skeeter before Sunday so he had to have planned on her being there or else he wouldn't have said "I have to go set something in motion," but we've already covered that...

I really don't think there's any evidence in the text of HPMOR that supports the "Legilimancy without eye contact" theory other than Moody's warning. Quirrell and Skeeter were having a conversation face to face. I think the bigger issue that most people are concerned about is whether or not Quirrell/Voldemort can use Legilimancy/magic-in-general on Harry at all. I think the evidence is there, but I just finished reading HPMOR again like a month ago, I'm not gonna turn around and read it again immediately to look for that evidence.
