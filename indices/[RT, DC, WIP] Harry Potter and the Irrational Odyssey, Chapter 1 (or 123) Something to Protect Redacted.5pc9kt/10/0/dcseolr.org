Thank you, but I interpret that scene a bit differently.

Let's look at all the moving parts.

--------------

Rita's eyes narrowed. "Who do you think you are?"

"How very foolish," the man said dryly. "It would have been wise to memorize the face of the disguised Death Eater training Harry Potter to be the next Dark Lord. After all," a thin smile, "that certainly sounds like someone you wouldn't want to run into on the street, especially after doing a hatchet job on him in the newspaper."

--------------

she had a time and a place and a beetle to be. *She'd just* [emphasis mine] received an anonymous tip about Madam Bones making time with one of her younger assistants. That would be worth quite a bonus if she could manage to verify it, Bones was high on the hit list. The tipster had said that Bones and her young assistant were due to eat lunch in a special room at Mary's Place

--------------

"Miss Skeeter," said Quirrell, "I had hoped to find some lever that would prove persuasive. Yet I find that I cannot deny myself the pleasure of simply crushing you."

--------------

"Do you mind -" said Harry, at the same time as Professor Quirrell said, "I'm afraid I -"

Harry stopped, Professor Quirrell didn't.

"- need to go off and set something in motion, Mr. Potter.

--------------

The time was just before noon, and Harry and Professor Quirrell were seated at the foot and head of a wide, long, flat table, in a sumptuously appointed private room with thoroughly cushioned couches and chairs along the walls, and soft curtains hanging everywhere.

They were about to eat lunch in Mary's Place,

--------------

My interpretation of all this:

Chapter 26 begins on Sunday morning when the paper comes out

Harry leaves with Prof. Q. at 10am

they teleport to Diagon Alley

Prof. Q. leaves Harry and "runs into" Rita (who is there only because /he/ left an anonymous tip before they left to ensure she would be in the room at the time he scheduled)

He offers her the chance to retract her accusation against him before casting final judgement.

--------------

I might very well be wrong, but I think he already knew she was an Animagus.

Even though he's probably the one responsible for tricking her and therefore already knows the full contents of the article, he's not allowed to publicly know until Sunday, so he can't confront her before then. I'm about 99.999% certain that Act 6 of Chapter 25 happens during Chapter 26 when Prof. Q. leaves Harry by the newsstand; he had already made the reservation for Mary's Room by then, so it had to have been him who dropped the anonymous tip that caused Rita Skeeter to spy on the room. He already planned on her being there, he was just offering her a chance to repent.
