That sounds like it may work. Breaking his distinct voice is apparently what you are going for, but you still want his voice to sound British. I assume you are trying to make Voldemort sound a bit ruder and more causal as his ultra polite persona breaks? I wonder what British slang would work best here... possible British slang words to consider: prat, git, twit, twat. I don't actually know British slang, so I can't tell you what would best fit Quirrelmort-mask-cracking-but-still-British Voldemort but hopefully one of those will sound right.
