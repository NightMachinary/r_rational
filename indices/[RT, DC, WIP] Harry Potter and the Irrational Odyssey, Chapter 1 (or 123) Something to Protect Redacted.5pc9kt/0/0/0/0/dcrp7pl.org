I said this in another thread here last night:

#+begin_quote
  I don't know if I said it here or in response to someone else so I'll say it again, this is a very rough draft and I did a poor job of setting up that particular payoff. The whole "Voldemort genuinely realizing that Harry may be correct in evaluating that persisting in his psychopathy is in fact contrary to his own fundamental utility function" thing? That's what's supposed to have caused him to crack. There's a theoretical possibility that the entire structure of this chapter is going to be shuffled and rearranged, and Voldemort's breakdown might happen after the conversation about hedonics that I didn't include in this draft.

I have since then decided for certain that the chapter is going to be restructured/rearranged, and I have a pretty clear idea of how it's going to be done.

Edit: I agree with the point you made in the edit, and have made the change.
