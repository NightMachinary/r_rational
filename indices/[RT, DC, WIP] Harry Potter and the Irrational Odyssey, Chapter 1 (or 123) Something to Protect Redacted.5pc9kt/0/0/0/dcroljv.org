Two things: with "jarring," be very careful about the line between "makes people appropriately uneasy" and "makes people write you off, because you haven't yet earned their faith in an enduring manner (such that they trust that the wrongness has a reason)." This is how Eliezer lost a vast swath of readers in the first 10 chapters of HPMOR (e.g. "kids don't act like that").

Second, even with Quirrelmort being a mask, he spent the vast majority of his life in Britain, and the implications of /that/ should probably be adhered to, unless you want to take out screen time to justify him deliberately losing his native lexicon or whatever.

Edit: as long as I'm making a comment, tiny tiny ^{tiny} note ... use the em-dash (---) for jarring breaks, and ellipses (...) for trailing off. The very first sentence that's in all caps feels to me like it ought end with /DEAD---/ rather than /DEAD.../ because the latter seems to indicate lots of time and space, while the former seems to indicate cut-off.
