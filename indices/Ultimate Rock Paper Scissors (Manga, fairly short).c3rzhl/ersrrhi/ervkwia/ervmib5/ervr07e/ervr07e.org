  "Immortality is evil" isn't even a particularly weird anti-rational trope, it's fairly common and standard, so it makes sense for most characters in the story to feel that way, even without us assuming the author's beliefs.

Wait, since when is immortality evil? I've never heard this trope anywhere else, and I'm currently at Ch12 in this and haven't noticed it here either
