Characters still have competing values, even if they're "Good" or smart. "Immortality is evil" isn't even a particularly weird anti-rational trope, it's fairly common and standard, so it makes sense for most characters in the story to feel that way, even without us assuming the author's beliefs.

But keep in mind that this character, who is an absurdly rich oil tycoon who honestly believes money should be able to solve all problems and was okay with hiring a hypnotist to trick people into doing work without pay, is probably not the kind of person you want to become immortal by magic fiat.

Instead, his failure has forced him to fund a research organization dedicated to developing immorality through science, which is really the better-case scenario for everyone.
