Same here. In addition to there being a ton of interesting ideas, I was amazed by how /condensed/ it all was, like there was something new and exciting happening in every panel. I think you'd have a hard time cutting anything without making the story worse, which is pretty impressive.

The one thing I didn't like was the weird anti-rational tropes. Seriously, "we have to stop him from using his immortality for evil"? What does that even mean? And how would you "bring chaos to the world" by becoming immortal? It's always seemed bizarre to me how a writer who clearly put a ton of thinking into their work can still be so lazy when it comes to tropes like that. Seriously, just change the Macguffin from immortality to something that can more easily be abused, like the power to control the human body or something. It's not that hard.
