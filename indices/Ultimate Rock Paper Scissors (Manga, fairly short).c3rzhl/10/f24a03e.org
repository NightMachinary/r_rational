Late comment, but a mechanic I was totally expecting to see in the final round: Because the three card sets were cyclic, circle always beats triangle, triangle always beats square, and square always beats circle in any of the three sets. So when Mitarai says one shape, you can always choose the shape that will beat it by selecting another of the cards in the muscle guy's hands within 0.3 seconds.
