Adding nothing whatsoever to what's already been said, this was impressively distilled. A series of reasonably standard powers, assigned to a small cast of colorful personalities, and condensed into a small enough number of chapter that's something important is happening on every page. The (madness called) scheming quickly escalates to involve pretty much every character in every round, so characters are never really eliminated as such. In all, it's a brief but very engaging read.
