...you've never noticed "Immortality is evil" in any other piece of fiction? I find that genuinely shocking. It's like [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityImmorality][everywhere]], and often nonsensically. Like Dragonball Z, where only villains try to wish for immortality to the point where Vegeta stops caring about it after he's no longer a villain, or Dr. Who, where The Doctor can live for hundreds of years, if not more, but iirc when a villain-of-the-week starts sacrificing people to seek immortality, it's not the whole "Sacrificing people" thing that the Doctor focuses on so much as berating him about how living a long time isn't worth it because you lose the people you love, as if that wasn't just a reason to find a way to save them too.
