Here's the newest episode! Man vs Man is the shortest section because it's the most familiar to most people, and because our next episodes are going to be focusing on antagonists. Next week we're going to take a break, and might shift to a 3-episodes-per-month format instead of a weekly one.

Feel free to leave a review on iTunes if you can, and thanks for listening!
