Remotely over Skype. I use MP3 Skype Recorder as freeware to record our calls, which works pretty well for the most part (it did fail to record an episode once though, which was pretty annoying, so there's still some technical difficulties).

I use Audacity to edit the sound file and clean it up, then convert back to an MP3 for uploading. I haven't tested the recording software's conversion to Audacity with a 3-way call yet, but once I do, we've talked about bringing in guest speakers like yourself at some point, if you're interested and have a topic you'd like to speak on.
