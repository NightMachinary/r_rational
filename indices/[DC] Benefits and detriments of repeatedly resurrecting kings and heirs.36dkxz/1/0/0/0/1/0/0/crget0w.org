Why thank you. :D It occurred to me just as I was writing that post. I tend to be a bit of a rules lawyer when it comes to tabletop RPGs, but I like looking for FUN ways to play with the mechanics as much as stuff that's simply overpowered. If there's no flavor to it, it's not really roleplaying, is it?
