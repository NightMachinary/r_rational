PAO being dispellable is of course a valid concern, but D&D doesn't have rules for instantly dropping dead of old age. If someone does dispel it, you're just a doddering old codger with -6 Str, -6 Dex, and -6 Con. You're not dead, and you're still wearing a set of kingly magic items. The spell can be recast at a mage's next convenience (or could even be bound into a magic item so that His Highness can reassert it himself).

In fact the two loopholes can be combined -- Reincarnate the king when he falls, so that he's young and healthy but still bears the wisdom (and intelligence, and charisma) of years, and then polymorph him into his old body. This might even have the convenient side effect of making the king his own decoy: someone dispels the polymorph on the king and they think they've uncovered someone impersonating royalty, and they don't think he's worth a king's ransom.
