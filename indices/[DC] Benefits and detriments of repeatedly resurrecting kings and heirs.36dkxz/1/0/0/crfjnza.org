D&D 3.5 Player's Handbook, page 171:

#+begin_quote
  A soul knows the name, alignment, and patron deity (if any) of the character attempting to revive it and may refuse to return on that basis.
#+end_quote

The reason it's hard to find this particular quote if you don't know it already exists is because it's a general mechanic of bringing characters back to life (and is therefore in with the rest of the general spell mechanics like caster level and arcane spell failure) and not a specific feature of the spells that perform the job.

Also of note, Complete Divine states:

#+begin_quote
  The soul has a general sense of how long it's been dead [...] The soul also has a sense of which spell is bringing it back to life; it can tell how painful the return journey into a living body will be.
#+end_quote

If the deceased has reason to believe that he's going to be subject to torment, torture, or just plain bizarre circumstances (e.g. being resurrected decades or millennia later), they might not be all that interested in going along with it.

Of course, on the other hand, RAW does actually have a loophole for the old-age problem -- two of them, in fact! One: Reincarnation! You're given a new "young adult" class body. Two: Polymorph Any Object! Polymorphing into a younger version of oneself is (1) the same kingdom, (2) the same class, (3) the same size, (4) related (reflexively), and (5) same intelligence, so therefore the spell effect is permanent.
