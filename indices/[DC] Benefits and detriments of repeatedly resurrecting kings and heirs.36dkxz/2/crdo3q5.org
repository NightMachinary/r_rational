I'm a bit confused about which edition this is based on. Is there any version of D&D where Raise Dead and Ressurection don't result in level loss? That'd put a big damper on the whole constant Resurrection thing.

Sure True Resurrection doesn't lead to level loss, but she never mentions that and it's a 9th level spell, by which point the game is irreparably broken anyway.

Also, in the coup scenario, they'd probably just kill the king in a way that prevents easy resurrection. That's not hard to do.

Of course in 3.5, magic is so insanely overpowered that the only reasonable form of government is a magocracy.
