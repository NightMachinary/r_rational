I've always understood that the vanilla lich became evil due to the horrible things done in pursuit of immortality (non-issue here due to help from friendly necromancers) or due to massive influx of negative plane energy, then if the moral component of the alignment defaults to 'evil' the solution would be for ministers/family/assistants present on the ritual to use the helm or any handy alignment changing magic before releasing or waking their new undead king. (did this on a campaign to the BBEG's minions and it looked like a zombie movie in reverse. all the enemies that fell to us returned as part of our horde :D )
