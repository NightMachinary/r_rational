This was addressed obliquely:

#+begin_quote
  The King, his soul returned, lies in his post-battle glow for up to a week recovering from being hacked to pieces by the opposing army.
#+end_quote

In other words, yeah, it does result in level loss, because he has to recover, but on the assumption that he's carrying out kingly duties -- and considering that he just technically survived an encounter that was difficult enough to kill him -- he's got enough XP coming in to address that.

#+begin_quote
  Also, in the coup scenario, they'd probably just kill the king in a way that prevents easy resurrection. That's not hard to do.

Disintegrate's fun.
