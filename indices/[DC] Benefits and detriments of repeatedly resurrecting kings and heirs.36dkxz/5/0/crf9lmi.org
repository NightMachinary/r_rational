To some extent, I guess. A rough guide to topics:

- *Good:* Deconstructive stories (logical extensions and ultimate endpoints of "crazy what-if" scenarios)

- *Better:* Rational stories (see sidebar)

- *Best:* Rationalist stories (see sidebar)

Activity varies between:

- *Good:* Discussing stories that meet the above criteria

- *Okay:* Discussing scenarios that might serve as starting points for such stories
