A helm of opposite alignment is /permanent/, and triggered by its donning. That is to say, removing it doesn't do a thing. The magic has its effect the second the helm touches your head, and lasts indefinitely.

Furthermore:

#+begin_quote
  The curse only works once; that is, a character whose alignment has been changed cannot change it again by donning the helmet a second time.
#+end_quote

So, changing back isn't so trivial. But:

#+begin_quote
  Only a wish or a miracle can restore former alignment, and the affected individual does not make any attempt to return to the former alignment. (In fact, he views the prospect with horror and avoids it in any way possible.) If a character of a class with an alignment requirement is affected, an atonement spell is needed as well if the curse is to be obliterated.
#+end_quote

So there is a way to transform the victim back to his or her former alignment, but it needs some seriously heavyweight magic. It's possible, but far from easy.
