What authority do you have to demand that Sir Poley do anything?

If you're going to ping him, at least be encouraging.

Sir Poley, if you read this, I really enjoyed your characters and story in HP and the Natural 20. I think you had a great thing going, and would love to read more! If you want to get back into it, but need help that I can give (Editing? Amateur LaTex typesetting? Amateur web hosting/site development? Fact checking against canon/HPMOR? A few bucks?), then please reach out - I would be happy to contribute. If you've moved on, then thank you for the laughs, smiles, and memories.
