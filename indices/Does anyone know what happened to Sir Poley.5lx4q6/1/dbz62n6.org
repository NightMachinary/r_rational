Judging by his [[https://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/5loink/alright_lets_have_a_look_at_the_populoh/dbxf1ig/][most recent comment]] (from yesterday), he's been sucked into Dwarf Fortress. This is death to a fic.

In [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/59kpxu/what_is_the_most_original_harry_potter_fanfiction/d99akjc/][another comment]] from a couple of months ago, he mentions that he "hope[s] to get back to it one day". So, while he seems to be alive and well, I wouldn't be too optimistic about a HPN20 return in the near future.
