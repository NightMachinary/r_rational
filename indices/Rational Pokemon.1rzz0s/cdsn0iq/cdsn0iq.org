Don't suppose anyone knows how to get hold of an RSS feed for fanfiction.net stories? I've tried searching around and it sounds like they're removed the links to them, but that by constructing the right URL it might still be possible.

I want to follow this, but I know I won't necessarily remember to go and check on it, or check on a user account on the site, unless I can fold it into how I read everything else I subscribe to.
