I am the author of the piece in question and freely admit to bias. That said:

The story is a militaristic take on the school for supers genre. Additionally, the training is pragmatic and brutal. I think calling it violence porn would be overstating it, but the early portions of the story are probably the most violent and, if they bother you, I wouldn't recommend you continue. Both the setting and elements of the plot are fairly dark.

This is the second time it's popped up in a rationalist thread but it is not intended as rationalist fiction. I do make a deliberate effort to have characters act in a fashion that makes sense to them. As a natural result, there are a few individuals who make a concerted effort to better themselves, constantly improving, but only a few. One of those characters seems to be a fan favorite and that may be the reason Citadel appeals to some rationalist readers.

Citadel is a work in progress. The current intro, the two sections that have been most heavily discussed in this thread, are by no means final. The first two versions were each significantly worse and I freely acknowledge that there is a lot of room for improvement in the most recent one.

I prefer not to comment on the alleged Sociopathic Hero in depth. I'll simply say that, in my opinion, he does not fit the trope or the medical diagnosis. The trope is subjective but I am actually semi-qualified to say the latter.

Spacing. It seems a little unreal to me that this is an issue that prompted so many comments. I use the double-space because that's how I was taught to do it and because that's how many of the books I read in my formative years were written. I am aware that it is at least mildly anachronistic and has been for quite some time. Even the later typewriters did not truly need it. I intend to continue for two reasons: (1) it's what I'm used to and I'd rather put the effort required to change it into improving content instead and (2) precisely because it's old fashioned, double-spacing is what most of the large publishing companies prefer. I realize that those same companies will never touch Citadel, or anything else that's been put on the web, but I do intend to write and submit other works. Much as I value my current and future web readers, I'd prefer to keep my writing habits in tune with the publishers' expectations.

Regardless of anything else, I love feedback. Good, bad, so long as it's honest, there's almost nothing said about what I've written that can't help me improve. Thank you for what is clearly honest criticism.
