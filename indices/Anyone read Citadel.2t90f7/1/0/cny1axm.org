Hey, since my comment was the longest and most negative ITT, I just wanted to clearly say thanks for writing. Not everyone can put themselves and their work out there like this. Keep it up.

Not every story is for everyone but I meant every bit of my comment as constructive criticism. That's honestly what I felt reading what I did, and I would have said the same to your face at a writing workshop.

I'm super critical right now as a new writer myself and all of these issues are forefront in my mind because of that. That could make me other than an average reader, for better or worse. That's one reason I was so exact in my description of my reactions -- which a lot of people take really personally, and understandably so. It certainly isn't objective data. Maybe I had an off day. Maybe an undigested piece of beef lent affect more from gravy than grammar to something I read. However it happened, that's what my experience was.

That, I feel, is more useful than suggestions on how to write -- at least when it comes to style. As you suggest, without honest and personal reader feedback and opinions I don't think anyone can improve their writing very much. Those improvements have to be in your voice and direction, though, and it isn't like my word is gospel. So even though I meant it, and still do, take everything I said with a grain of salt. Which from your post, it seems you may have already. A healthy attitude.

  I prefer not to comment on the alleged Sociopathic Hero in depth. I'll simply say that, in my opinion, he does not fit the trope or the medical diagnosis.

Bravo. I was worried. Sociopathy -- which doesn't exist as a medical term, the correct DSM label is a case of /severe/ Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) -- is a strange tic fiction often has, and that you even /know/ that this is an issue, and a medical one, resolves a lot of my worries. I withdraw all possible concerns, though not of course my initial reactions.

  Spacing.

For perhaps the first time in my life, I think agreeing to disagree may actually be an appropriate and accurate way to describe the situation -- rather than, as is typical, an attempt at a social power-play. I will say nothing more, as you seem to understand and have stated all the issues involved, and that was all I was attempting to clarify myself.
