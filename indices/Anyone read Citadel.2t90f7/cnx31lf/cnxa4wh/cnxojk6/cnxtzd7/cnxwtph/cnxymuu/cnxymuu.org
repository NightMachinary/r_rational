If a 50k book contract landed in my lap, I would have absolutely nothing to do with sentence spacing. That's formatting, and formatting is the editor's job. The editor would probably be annoyed with me if I even mentioned spacing between sentences because I shouldn't even be thinking about formatting. I should be writing a good story.

I agree that this conversation is irrational. I was taught to double space decades ago, and I will always double space. If some potential future editor of mine doesn't like it, I guarantee you that they know how to use the find and replace all option on a word processor.
