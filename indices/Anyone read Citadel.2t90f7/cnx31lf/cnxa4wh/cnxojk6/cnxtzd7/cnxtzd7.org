I'm not sure why you are missing the coherent storyline that I see clearly. It's a school for people with super powers, where teaching occurs to train soldiers, not students. It's an extremely grimdark world. The author is showing it to us from the perspective of several characters.

Because the story is being told from the perspective of several characters, as if they were each main characters, it seems fragmented. No, it IS fragmented. But there's nothing inherently wrong with fragmentation.

Would I have written it that way? No. But I'm not the author. Am I saying you should like it? No. Like what you want. If you do not like the series, then you have a perfect right to say so, and perhaps give reasons. You did those things.

It simply puzzled me to no small degree that you latched onto something as completely trivial as double spacing to complain about. You had legitimate things to voice opinions on. Things that I can actually respect. Then you criticize for double spacing? and emphasize it? I just cannot wrap my mind around where you were coming from.

I am also a serial internet fiction writer. I, as this author also does, have gone back and made edits in recently completed work at the direction of readers who point out problems. My work was admittedly rather terrible when I started. FAR worse than this author's work is. That being said, my work has dramatically improved since I started, somewhere around 800k words ago. I have improved enough that I literally cannot go back and simply make significant modifications in prior work completed only a few months ago. If I do try to do so for anything more than a triviality, then I end up rewriting huge blocks of text. Which I do not have the time to do when I am also working on new content. Serial online fiction with regular, frequent updates simply does not work that way, with very few exceptions.

Let me be clearer. Despite the fact that I identify far more strongly with the writer than I do with you, I respect all of your opinions except the opinion on double-spacing, I don't agree with the others, and have explained why, with a little illustration.

I also double-space. I will not be changing that habit.
