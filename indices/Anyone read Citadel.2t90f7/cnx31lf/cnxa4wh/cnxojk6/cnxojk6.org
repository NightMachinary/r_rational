  I agree strongly that this can be confusing, but I like that the characters all feel different.

Fair enough. But not seeing them as such, or a coherent storyline, in the first two chapters? Bad show.

  Jason is indeed a bit scary. His power is extraordinarily OP to the point that he doesn't dare use it on humans directly, he can only use it to heal himself.

As predicted, then. Was I right about the morality chain and the inevitable "oh shit" moment when he /does/ use it on humans?

  Double-spacing after sentences? Really? That bothers you enough to comment on it?

It was literally the first thing I noticed about the story, as silly as using "thee" and "thou" in modern composition. Choosing it as a style in a digital medium is showing. That is a relic of a bygone age, related to font and typographical issues that no longer exist in the modern era. It is the worst sin I found in the first two chapters, showing a great ignorance or disregard of the medium, so of course I commented on it.

This suggests the author is either very young or inexperienced and trying to appear more professional (and failing), or is old and stubbornly stuck in their ways. Everyone else chooses to esche that unnecessary and distracting style. Given the clunky prose, it could go either way.

Hopefully it eases up later on and smooths out. One of the odd issues with serial fiction is that the style usually gets better as it goes, but that seldom gets back to the most important part: the first few chapters. Good authors writing serials go back and style edit if they care about new readers. I'm almost certain that hasn't happened here (yet) but the spacing thing immediately drew my eye to other style issues. Not a good first impression.

Smooth reading experiences help forgive a bevy of sins. Using words like bevy and double-spacing breaks that. Don't do it, certainly not early on, unless the composition can support the pretense. The first two chapters of Citadel don't hold up well to the extra scrutiny, in my professional opinion.
