Just tried it cold and couldn't get into the story. Writing is okay but uninspired. Presentation, plotting, and pacing have issues. Might try again later if someone who has finished it gives it +a strong+ an absolutely glowing review ITT. Here's mine for the first two chapters.

--------------

First of all, a hard to read intro chapter that does nothing but disconnected and emotional background? Not a good sign. A slightly-clichéd first-person intro from an interview or something -- a detail which I missed until half-way through before I went back to reread the right-aligned title line -- doesn't make a great first impression.

Serials have a habit of rambling and being padded with "atmosphere" and "gritty background." This one starts with both. I really want an idea of what the story is /about/ first. Bodies hitting the floor isn't a strong hook by itself. Unless the story is about bodies hitting the floor. Which...maybe that's what's going on?

The story screams shockbait and violence porn from literally the first chapter. That alone doesn't make a story either rational or interesting to me. The second chapter continues more of the same and finally mentions the titular "Citadel". And (/very/ briefly) introduces a cold, emotionless child pretending to be someone he's not, entering an elite training program. An adult immediately notices and suspects them because of a mysterious family background and unstated powers.

Oh wow, okay. I smell an incoming [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero][Sociopathic Hero]] (TVTropes warning), at best. Thinly veiled Ender Wiggin (or rather, Peter) at the horribly-clichéd worst. Leaves me looking for a female [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChain][Morality Chain]] to pop up at any moment -- and then either get kidnapped or straight-up fridged to continue "escalating," the latest watchword in by-the-numbers serial fiction. Meh. Maybe I'm wrong. But I don't think I am. It certainly points that way.

When I start reading a story, I look for characters I can care about and events that I want to see through to the end. A story needs to have a heart that a reader can latch onto, or least a protagonist to link to events. Here, I get disconnected mass deaths, some awkwardly-presented plot hooks, and a late presented, possible protagonist who is made entirely of power-fantasy clichés.

And worst of all? *Double-spacing after sentences*. On the internet. In 2014. No. Bad author.
