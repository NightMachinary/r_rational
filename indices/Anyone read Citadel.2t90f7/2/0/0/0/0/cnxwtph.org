  I'm not sure why you are missing the coherent storyline that I see clearly.
#+end_quote

In the first two, most important chapters? I'm not reading 20k words just to get into the meat. Maybe if I'd just read one more chapter, this wouldn't have been as much of an issue. But I didn't because I was tired of it already. Personal opinion, sure. But I think it is a real issue with these sorts of background and atmosphere heavy stories. You have to lead with both punch and something that matters to the reader. /Citadel/ misses the second part for me, hard, and accomplishes the first in a rather wincingly unsubtle way.

I appreciate all the tone defining you do in your reply, and I certainly don't take offense, but don't act like I am missing something. The storyline simply isn't there in those first two chapters. It is an excruciatingly slow start for all the violence and death.

  Then you criticize for double spacing? and emphasize it? I just cannot wrap my mind around where you were coming from.

This is very interesting to me. That is the only factual style issue I had, all the others being opinion, and yet it is the one you "don't respect." Because you do it yourself, of course, and think nothing of it. Which is your only argument for why it is trivial. Because you think nothing of it. Hmm.

As you say, it is a habit, and a bad one. Hardly "completely trivial" but clearly poorly examined. Which is why I spend so much time explaining this point. Not so much for you, who have already determined through the ever-logical process of "I will not" to never change, but to other authors who might make the same mistake. I wonder, if that 50k book contract landed on your lap along with an editor who holds this common opinion, would you still say "I will not?"

Double-spacing after periods is almost as bad as using too many adjectives, thus making it about as bad, in my opinion, as stretching out long, if strictly grammatically correct, compound sentences by overusing commas. It is something you just don't do in the modern writing world. We have perfect typeset now, not typewriter monospace. Extra spacing isn't required or desired. Unless you are writing intentionally ergodic literature, don't screw around with these sorts of things.

With the blocky sans-serif font the author choose for /Citadel/, it is especially egregious. If I don't notice it at a glance, it is obviously okay with me. I'm not some sort of zealot who searches for this. With the serif font on what I assume is your writing blog, I don't notice it as much. Possibly because that font it is designed for smaller typeface. But it is very, very noticeable in /Citadel/, and detracts and distracts. Which is why I brought it up. Also, because it is such a clear-cut rule nowadays.

This is something you and the author of /Citadel/ are both absolutely, flat-out wrong about. The majority of typographic experts, editors, and writers agree on this and there is no rational reason to go against that. No reader will be offended if one /doesn't/ double-space. If one does, some may be thrown off or take it as a signal for the issues I mentioned above. That was certainly the case with me.

The counter argument so far presented is, it is trivial and habit. Oddly, no discussion of my points on social signaling in writing style choices. Given those widespread and so far in this discussion uncontested public precepts, it seems really irrational to continue to hold a hardline policy on this issue.
