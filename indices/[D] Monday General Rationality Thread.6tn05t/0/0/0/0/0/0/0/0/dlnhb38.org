I believe I see what you mean. I almost want to call it dark rationality.

Feeling enlightened about realizing that people suck, they conclude that people suck because that's just the way it is, rather than wondering if maybe people suck because life sucks. Add to that a fanatical devotion to markets as the solution to all things, and you get someone who thinks a boot stamping on a human face forever is the rational choice.
