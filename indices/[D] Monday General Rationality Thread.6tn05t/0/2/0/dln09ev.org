  I second buckykat in thinking it's a better idea to isolate CW stuff to its own area (like SSC)
#+end_quote

This is not an accurate summation of my post. I did not suggest a separate CW thread, I suggested that if political stuff were to be banned, in one or more of the several existing weekly threads, it should not be banned in all of them, and the ones where it is should be clearly labelled so.

Quick edit: for example, one week 'general rationality' is labeled apolitical, the next week 'off-topic' is.
