Ah I thought you meant isolating CW stuff entirely, but instead what you're proposing something that's only a partial split.

Still I'm not sure exactly how useful a compromise like that would necessarily be, since the threads where you allow CW would have a higher than previous concentration of CW making them less appealing to people who still want to see if there's interesting non CW stuff there. Plus if the CW concentration gets to be a majority in those threads people may stop using them for other stuff making basically unofficial CW threads effectively.\\
Whereas if CW stuff remains a minority then if people want to avoid it they have to accept missing out on some good non-CW stuff in those threads. It sort of seems like a compromise that would satisfy very few people.
