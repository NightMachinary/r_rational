I second buckykat in thinking it's a better idea to isolate CW stuff to its own area (like SSC), however that seems a solution to a problem that doesn't exist. Though perhaps despite reading most comments on this subreddit it just doesn't stick in my memory because there's not really any flame wars.\\
Though I suppose this week's thread in particular is something of an outlier in terms of being politics heavy.
