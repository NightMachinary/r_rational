I mean it sort of depends on what you're hoping going for here. Constraining it to a CW thread /would do a good job/ ensuring nobody had to see it if they didn't seek it out, though it would probably increase the amount of discussion on CW topics.\\
So there's something of a question of whether it should really matter if it increases discussion of CW topics if it improves the experience of the subreddit overall (by isolating it), since presumably most traffic wouldn't be in those threads (we don't have the same readership as SSC so it seems unlikely to become the largest thing on the subreddit).

Either way that's neither here nor there since we seem to be in agreement doing nothing is probably best anyway.
