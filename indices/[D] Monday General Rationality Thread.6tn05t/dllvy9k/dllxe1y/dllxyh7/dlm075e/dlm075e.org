Not off the top of my head. We just endured the plague of flies, making sure to kill the visible ones before they could breed.

It might be possible to make a housefly trap, though I haven't looked into it. Probably harder than with fruit flies (put fruit in a cup with plastic wrap over the opening, poke small holes in the plastic), and at the very least you'd need a lot more space in your trap.
