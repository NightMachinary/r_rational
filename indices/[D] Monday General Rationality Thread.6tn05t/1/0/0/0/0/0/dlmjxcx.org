Buying spray and a gas canister. Time to gas them tomorrow morning. I can work from a cafe.

EDIT: Been spraying all over where they swarm to. There's something uncomfortable about watching living things die, but God I just feel less /itchy/ all over with these things dead. They're just /so damned icky/ and you never /know/ where they could be.
