Nothing but death to houseflies!

But seriously, we went away for a week, and now somehow there's a massive housefly infestation that we can't quite exterminate. WTF!? /Everyone/ was out of the house, and zero food or trash was left exposed. /How are they fucking hatching and living to adulthood!?/ HOW DO WE MAKE THEM GO AWAY!?

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
