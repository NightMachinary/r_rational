Given how SSC has worked out for inviting that thread /in/ (and I've been there a lot today, so I share in the shame), we probably wouldn't have one. Just allow that kind of talk in off-topic threads sometimes, and allow a rational, balanced talk about governmental affairs in General Rationality sometimes.
