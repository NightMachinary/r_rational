[[https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/6t8bte/culture_war_roundup_for_week_following_august_12/dlle036/][You should read this thread with a self-proclaimed SJW.]] It's /interesting/.

  while still insisting that this does not make them the allies of actual Nazis despite KKK members saying that is an indication that the President is on their side.

And, of great semantic importance, despite the "protesters" who marched /waving literal swastikas/ and yelling /literal Nazi slogans/.

People call for my resignation as a mod whenever I say "bash the fash", but come on, bash the damned fash when they're fashing it up right in front of you!

But that thread with [[/u/Summerspeaker]] /really worries me/. Along with a lot of things lately, it's giving me "double vision" or "epistemic bistability" about /why/ there's such a loud reactionary outcry against "social justice" and antifascist action. It really does seem that people on the inside of "SJ" have /no/ desire whatsoever to self-police about giving even nominal respect to the society they live in.

When you think about /one/ axis of oppression, that makes sense: who /likes/ the idea of living on stolen Native land, or of racially differential policing, except for an actual racist? Who /likes/ the idea of not having women in your workplace, except sexists?

But when you take it intersectional, you start having to deal with the Joint Probability Law. The more independent conjuncts you add to your intersection of oppressions and exploitations, the more of society overall you're declaring problematic, reactionary, or even gulag-bait -- including the people you need on your side to build a majority and win.

Eventually, you're actually invalidating such huge majorities of the population that they turn against your movement, because you /simply will not allow/ them to step forward for /their/ problems without stepping forward for /every/ problem, /every/ program that you've put on your activist agenda.

And nobody self-polices it. Nobody says, "hold on, we just drove Mark Fisher to suicide" or "hold on, why does the Labour Party have to sanction so many antisemitic party members" (hobby horse of mine). In fact, stuff like, "Britain's Labour Party cracked own on antisemitism, published a manifesto with mass appeal, organized like hell, and got a great result in the elections" becomes /exceptional/ rather than /normal/.

Because everyone shrugs and thinks to themselves, well, I guess that's somewhat problematic, but overall, we need to advance the movement.

The thing is, Nazis hate /most everyone/, and we all know it. There are only a few really committed Nazis, and some alt-light people even graze the Nazis and /get the fuck out of there/ when they realize what they've touched. Certainly most libertarians want nothing to fucking do with them by now. Meanwhile, Leninists and Maoist-Third-Worldists are far fewer in number, but "social justice" activists are /huge/ in number, and /they tolerate the authoritarian communists/ really, really willingly.

Then, since "SJWs" don't really self-police /at all/, they start picking up the more rabidly authoritarian or toxic ideas from folks like auth-coms, people-of-color nationalist movements, or sometimes even Islamists. Sure, very few people /actually/ think those are good ideas, but /massive/ numbers of people /tolerate/ authoritarian-leftist ideas in exactly the ways we all refuse to tolerate authoritarian right ideas.

  The more things like this happen, the more and more I believe that America is heading towards a new civil war.

People who've lived through Stuff Like That now turn and raise their eyebrows at the USA, so... yeah.

#+begin_quote
  as I see every single stereotype I have of my enemy proven correct...it gets harder and harder to not want to prove stereotypes my enemies have of me correct.
#+end_quote

That's a good way to put it. And the Nazis feed off SJ, and SJ feeds off the Nazis, while the center waits for Robert Mueller to get evidence about Russian election meddling.

  The fascists, even ones who call themselves populist or conservative, believe they are being subjugated by liberals and will do whatever it takes to end that subjugation even if it means destroying our democracy. That makes me want to subjugate them, to fight in that civil war and create a future where espousing these beliefs is a crime. I don't want that, but it seems more and more morally acceptable to do as this goes on.

Welcome to the lives of our grandparents. It's time to put another stake through the vampire's heart, another bullet in the zombie's head, /until it fucking dies/.

#+begin_quote
  Is that what it will take to destroy fascism? Do self-righteous liberals like me need to finally decide that these people have broken the social contract and must be considered violent threats to ourselves?
#+end_quote

Probably, yes.

  Can we take the leap of declaring hate speech to be under the exception of "shouting fire in a crowded theater" and criminalize it without becoming what we hate? Is that a world that I should want to live in?
#+end_quote

Germany has actual post-Nazi hate-speech laws, and has managed /not/ to collapse into a dystopia of state censors everywhere. Just saying.
