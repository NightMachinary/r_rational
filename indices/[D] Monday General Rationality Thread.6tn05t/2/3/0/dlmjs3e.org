  Germany has actual post-Nazi hate-speech laws, and has managed not to collapse into a dystopia of state censors everywhere. Just saying.

This is true, but I do want to point out that those laws go back many decades (looks like 1952, at least, according to a quick google search).

It might not matter on principle whether you ban something right after it's an issue or half a century later, but I'm willing to guess it impacts how often it's abused.
