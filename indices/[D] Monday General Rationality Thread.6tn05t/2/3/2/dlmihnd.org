While this is basically true and major problem for the SJW scene, note that various local SJWs have called out a Leninist group here in Albuquerque, the Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL). Various anarchists go hard against tankies. On a less sanguine note, I think there may be more Leninists and Maoists out there than you realize.
