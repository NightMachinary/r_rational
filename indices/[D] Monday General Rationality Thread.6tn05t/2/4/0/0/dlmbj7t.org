Why war? Have you exhausted peaceful methods of reform? Perhaps you should consider a future in politics and you should become the change you want to see in the world. Maybe start a non-violent form of antifa, doing community clean up, hunger strikes, and passive resistence and civil disobedience. More blood, more dying, its awful to contemplate that as the end result of this current trend that we could loose people like you, who are smart enough to make real contributions to the future of our great nation. Do you feel you've exhausted the other options? If you are truly asking and do not know, then no, you should not get involved in any terrorist organizations attempting to unlawfully overthrow the government. You are considering implementing a law, which if it was in effect, you would likely experience prison or worse for the comment that you just made.
