I think there's a whole shit-ton of people who aren't ideologically committed fascists or reactionaries, but still for some reason feel /threatened/ when confronted with the "Blue Tribe" or its related adjacents /in general/. It's not just that they want autonomy of a sort for them and theirs (a very traditionally American form of crazy: just secede from society and build utopia yourself!). It's that they want Blue influence /expunged/, and feel /violated/ as long as that remains undone.

Fucking hell, they feel threatened and violated by anyone from their own tribe, in their own spaces, who isn't purely Red enough. I have some net-friends out in weird Middle American places who I'm actually pretty worried about now, because they can't pass a Red Tribe purity test any more than I can pass a communist purity test.

Except that communists aren't a "tribe" who basically control the Party that controls, well, almost all of the government.
