Personally, I think that the problem lies with our systems of information and socialization.

1. People naturally create *filter bubbles* by looking at things that they like looking at and not looking at things that they don't like looking at. Internet and media companies help this process along by doing their own predictive filtering.
2. Internet communities *exclude moderates* because moderates are too close to the edge of the bubble. This causes radicalization all on its own. I've been kicked out of a number of communities for being a moderate.
3. It's far easier to engage in *intentional radicalization* than ever before, because you can present your own worldview to people and unless you have a dedicated and intelligent opposition, you have all your best arguments stacked up against people who don't understand what they're arguing.
4. It's far easier for *the radicals to find each other* than ever before. In 1950, if I had some niche fetish for leg amputees, I would /probably/ be out of luck without a lot of effort. In 2017, I can just type a search term into google and *bam*, I'm in the middle of a group of amputee porn connoisseurs. Same thing applies to political/social views. I think it probably goes without saying that radicals in groups are more dangerous because of their ability to segregate responsibilities (intentionally or otherwise) and egg each other on (see above, radicals make each other more radical).
5. We *hear more* about radicals than ever before, both because of the ready access to information and the perverse incentives for people to give coverage to radicals.
6. *State actors*, *major corporations*, and *private individuals* are all actively pouring efforts into the black arts of radicalization for their own purposes. This has always been the case; now it's a lot easier than it was.

I'm generally against more restrictions on free speech than already exist, but that's at least partly because I'm conservative in the sense of "don't change complex things without thinking about it a lot first, and never if it might be a symptom instead of a cause".

I am not sure that any of the above actually has a solution, but I don't think more restrictions on free speech are it. Instead, I would probably say that a solution has to be found in a restructuring of our information society to deliberately expose people to whatever is outside of their bubble and therefore curb extremism, but I don't know how such a thing would be implemented and that might be an even bigger infringement on free speech than simply banning wrongspeech. Also, the Constitution doesn't allow for it and there's no political will to get it done.
