  Tell me more, as a person that is more on the conservative side I'm very scared by your statement, especially here on the Rational sub.
#+end_quote

Even I'm worried that [[/u/trekie140]] feels pushed towards Antifa, and /I like Antifa/. As in, I usually assume I'm kinda crazy and too likely to impulsively join a radical movement, so I measure what's /objectively/ acceptable by what kinder, gentler people are willing to accept.

When the kind and the gentle are reaching for the sticks with nails in, /yikes./

  I hate that this situation occured, but I have trouble seeing that it is different from any other situation caused by an extremist.

If we rephrased it in 2000s, War-on-Terror-era language about Extremist Ideologies and Organizations, would people's worries be more understandable? You don't need the broad mass of white people or Christians to /be/ terrorist extremists to /have/ a terrorist, extremist organization capable of doing disproportionate damage to society, usually by dramatically increasing the probability that any given individual they don't like will be targeted and hurt.

  There are extremists in all groups, antifa, muslim and christian, black panthers, alt-right and conservatives.
#+end_quote

What I find funny here is that you've treated Antifa, the Black Panthers, and the alt-right as "normal" factions that /have/ extremists, when the rest of us would call them extremist factions unto themselves. And again, I like Antifa. I have a friend in Antifa, and have applied to join my local Antifa. I might even do it.

But I know damn well that they're a bunch of anarchists and a few communists looking to get into street fights. /Of course/ they're extremists, and joining them requires /really believing/ that the /correct/ position is one society currently considers extreme. Likewise to the alt-right, even in their "mild" incarnations. They can go ahead and have beliefs, but we all know those beliefs are extreme relative to our society's current mean beliefs.

  I don't feel your solution would be effective at all, I think what would be more effective is using the laws that are already in place, and focusing on removing biases
#+end_quote

The courts can probably be part of a real solution, but they /have/ been politicized over the past 30 years or so. Hell, white supremacists themselves have /always/ worked to infiltrate law enforcement.

  holding politicians accountable, also electing people that can provide results.

This is where we have to have a serious dispute. IMHO, the USA's electoral system is mostly captive to the Republican Party, and doesn't really legitimate the regime. That is, when majorities of people support Democrats, Democrats do not get elected, districts get redrawn. Numbers of wasted Democratic votes are very high. Overall, the partisan layout of the system is /heavily/ disproportionate, /towards/ Republicans, and we have strong evidence (see: the book /Ratfucked/) that this was done deliberately to make Republican victory the systematic default.

To me, it stinks of a one-party state, a Soviet-style government of party bureaucracy. I can only hope the Republican Party is now overextended and will implode from within, because elections will probably never unseat them in the next generation, at the rate we're going now.
