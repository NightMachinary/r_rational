What I'm implying is that you cannot get one without the other. Let us assume that Trump himself is out of power by the time this hypothetical democratic candidate is voted into office, and he or she is incredibly careful to not abuse the laws that allow them to restrict freedom of speech (I don't think this would happen, but let's assume).

What happens when someone more like Trump gets elected later on?
