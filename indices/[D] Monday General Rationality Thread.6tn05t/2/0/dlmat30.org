Instead of arguing that free speech is an ideal to hold at all times, even for people who are horrible individuals (because I think lots of people are making this argument), let me give you a very practical argument.

Given the speech Trump gave this weekend, accusing "both sides" for the violence we saw in Charlottesville, and the current administration's willingness to scapegoat and point fingers at minority groups/political opponents for it's own failings, are hate speech laws likely to be enforced against:

A.) Wanna-be Neo-Nazis and white supremacists

or

B.) People who criticize President Trump, his allies, and political groups that oppose him?
