But these laws protect speech that encourages violence. How do we stop the violence if the ideas that cause it are allowed to spread? I don't want to suppress freedom of speech, but then I see Nazis holding protests where bystanders are hurt and killed only for people who voted for the same guy as the Nazis to decide not to do anything more about the Nazis they claim to hate. I'm losing my faith in the laws that are supposed to protect us because they aren't working.
