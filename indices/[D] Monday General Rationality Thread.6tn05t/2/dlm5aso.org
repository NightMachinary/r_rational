It is impossible for me to not fear for the future of my country in the wake of Charlottesville. In response to the murder of a progressive protestor at the hands of a white supremacist, my President choose to condemn both sides for engaging in violence and [[/r/AskTrumpSupporters][r/AskTrumpSupporters]] completely agrees with that decision, while still insisting that this does not make them the allies of actual Nazis despite KKK members saying that is an indication that the President is on their side.

The more things like this happen, the more and more I believe that America is heading towards a new civil war. The political divide in this country is proving to be utterly irreconcilable even in situations where people are being murdered by Nazis. These people believe there is a moral equivalence to this situation and even if I could comprehend how that is possible, they respond to this event by demanding absolutely nothing be changed or their political leaders do anything different.

From the moment I first heard of the anti-fascists and their agenda to limit free speech out of fear of fascist rhetoric, I became afraid that I would become one of them. I don't want to believe that people I hate don't have civil rights, but as I see every single stereotype I have of my enemy proven correct...it gets harder and harder to not want to prove stereotypes my enemies have of me correct.

The fascists, even ones who call themselves populist or conservative, believe they are being subjugated by liberals and will do whatever it takes to end that subjugation even if it means destroying our democracy. That makes me want to subjugate them, to fight in that civil war and create a future where espousing these beliefs is a crime. I don't want that, but it seems more and more morally acceptable to do as this goes on.

Is that what it will take to destroy fascism? Do self-righteous liberals like me need to finally decide that these people have broken the social contract and must be considered violent threats to ourselves? Can we take the leap of declaring hate speech to be under the exception of "shouting fire in a crowded theater" and criminalize it without becoming what we hate? Is that a world that I should want to live in?
