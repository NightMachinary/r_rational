  A law that can be directed against speech found offensive to some portion of the public can be turned against minority and dissenting views to the detriment of all. The First Amendment does not entrust that power to the government's benevolence. Instead, our reliance must be on the substantial safeguards of free and open discussion in a democratic society.

-Justice Anthony Kennedy, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matal_v._Tam][Opinion on Matal v. Tam]], January 2017.

The trouble is not the rhetoric, it is not beliefs, it is not fear. These are things that can be opposed by other rhetoric, beliefs, and fears. The trouble is actual violence, which is already against the law.

A government which can declare hate speech a crime can be taken over by exactly the fascists you now want to subjugate, and can be used to imprison the very people you desire to protect for the crime of speaking their minds.

Oppose speech with speech. Let laws be laws.
