Tell me more, as a person that is more on the conservative side I'm very scared by your statement, especially here on the Rational sub.\\
I also worry about our country's future, but the events that brought that on go back much further then this recent election. Do you feel that all groups whos members could be violent/terrorist should be "brought to heel?" I hate that this situation occured, but I have trouble seeing that it is different from any other situation caused by an extremist. There are extremists in all groups, antifa, muslim and christian, black panthers, alt-right and conservatives. Homosexuals have some organizations that in my mind are scary (Especially as a gay man). There are gangs, and look, even at how certain police departments act.\\
I don't feel your solution would be effective at all, I think what would be more effective is using the laws that are already in place, and focusing on removing biases and holding politicians accountable, also electing people that can provide results. Tell me more of what you think please.

Please forgive my reaponse of errors as it is on mobil. Also, [[/u/alexanderwales][u/alexanderwales]] please chime in as well. I've read your post history and absolutely find you clever and convincing, and am interested in your perspective if you have the time.
