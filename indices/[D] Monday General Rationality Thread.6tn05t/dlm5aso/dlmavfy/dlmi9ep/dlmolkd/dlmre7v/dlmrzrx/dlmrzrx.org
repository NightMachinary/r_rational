You know that joining Antifa will likely result in you either participating in or signaling implicit support for, violence. I dispute that the proper response to even admittedly frightening uncertainty is violence. I think that the burden of proof for support of street fighting ought to be higher.

EDIT: I would like to note that I completely appreciate the position of uncertainty. As the designated Person Who Knows Things in my meatspace social circle, I have recently been unable to discharge my duties with any accuracy. For example, I repeatedly tried to comfort my worried friends by insisting that Donald Trump would not win.
