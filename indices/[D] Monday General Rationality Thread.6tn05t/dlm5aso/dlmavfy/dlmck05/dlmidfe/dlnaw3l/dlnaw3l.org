Speaking as someone looking at this conversation from a point of view entirely outside America...

...I'd consider the Free Software Foundation to be a great example of an /ethical/ radical response to a perceived injustice. Perhaps take a good look over how they handle things and consider adapting that to fit?

(Remember also that ethics are not /easy/. The unethical solution is often easier because it is both easier to find and easier to implement in the short term).
