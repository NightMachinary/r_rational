Thanks for explaining the sociological causes of this, but pointing those out doesn't stop me from being caught up in it myself. I know that my thought process is what leads to people becoming radicalized, even if I'd never consider committing violence myself, but the more I lose my faith in the humanity of people who disagree with me the more I think a relatively radical response may be necessary to stop this maddness.
