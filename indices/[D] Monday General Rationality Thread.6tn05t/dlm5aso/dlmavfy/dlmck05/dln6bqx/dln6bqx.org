Thank you for your statement. I think that your points address the "logistics"? of the problem, and how we can be more mindful of sources. I am especially intrigued with point 6. as that is my current largest concern and while politics for me is a fruitless endeavor as I have no immediate rerurn, I recognize the deeper duty that is required for me to vote and participate and thats why I still attempt elementary discourse.
