I agree with you on free speech, but do you have a solution? The alt-right is small in number, but they're still growing. We assume the democratic ideals that protect us are strong, but at the end of the day they're just words on paper, enforced by organizations that people with as much power as either the President or Congress could subvert if they put enough effort into it. What really protects us are the fragile norms that our politicians adhere to because they were raised in American culture, and those norms are degrading as democracy is eroded by the growing extremism of the right wing through gerrymandering, voter suppression, the nuclear option, refusing to hear Supreme Court nominations, playing games of chicken during debt ceiling raises, etc. If Trump was more cunning and diplomatic, our Constitution might not be enough to protect us. He could use high popular support to pressure Republicans to support him to expand and pack the Supreme Court with conservative justices, purge likely Democrat voters from voter rolls to ensure Congressional victories, and command the military (most members of which are Republican, and many of which voted for him) to enforce his will. He could fire Mueller, pardon anyone being investigated other than himself, fire any replacement for Mueller that was appointed, etc.

At the end of the day, our democracy is quite fragile when faced with people willing to violate every norm. We really need a second bill of rights with stronger protections against these kinds of tactics, but amendments are difficult to pass, and I doubt even ones that should be bipartisan like this would be agreed on by both parties.
