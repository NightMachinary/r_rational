Sounds like you have it under control, then. I'm sure I got more enjoyment out of the new passages than I did minor surprise from a few typos!

I was thinking about why I liked this book more than Six Sacred Swords (which was still fun), and I think it might be because the tournament scenes allow us to follow so many more characters than just the main few, and a large part of the fun in a series like this one is seeing various characters do their own crazy-powerful awesome things.

Is there any chance that we'll get to hear from some of the other major characters at some point, either in a multiple point-of-view book, or short stories or something?

If I recall correctly, she melted a lake in a duel... if it so happens that that duel took place in a certain tournament, then I'm looking forward to seeing it!
