I have watched videos like those, and I've been doing LARP and SCA style combat myself. My combat isn't written to be realistic. It's written with JRPG/anime physics and pacing.

This is a big part of why you see things like length dialogues in the middle of combat, swords cutting through armor, etc.

I write what I enjoy reading. I find realistic combat scenes uninteresting in written form.
