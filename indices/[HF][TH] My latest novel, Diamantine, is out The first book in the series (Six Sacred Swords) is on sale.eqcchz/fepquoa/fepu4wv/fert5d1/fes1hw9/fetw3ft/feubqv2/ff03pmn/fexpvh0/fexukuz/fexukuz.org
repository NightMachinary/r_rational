  I enjoyed this book. It felt more similar to the Cradle books than to Arcane Ascension, which isn't a bad thing. Lots of cool characters doing their own crazy overpowered awesome things.

Yeah, I agree. This series in general is more of a fun action-adventure, rather than the slower pace and heavy world building focus of Arcane Ascension. I enjoy both reading and writing both styles and I'll continue doing more of both. =D

  I felt a bit ridiculous that it took me a while to recognise

You're actually the first person who has mentioned this so far, and you're correct.

  This is a very minor point - far less important than the book being very enjoyable - but it did have several spelling and grammar mistakes. I don't know anything about how the self-publishing process works, so I don't know how easy it would be to improve your process for catching those.

This is largely a consequence of me adding additional content right down to the wire, including after my editing passes on the book were completed. I did this because one of my last-minute beta readers pointed out some things that felt missing from the manuscript, and I agreed. Unfortunately, I also have a delivery date to get it to my audio book publisher, and I didn't have enough time for another whole editing pass before that.

So, I chose to make the additions, knowing that I would likely be adding mistakes. I had a couple beta readers go over the new content, and did a couple passes myself, but that clearly wasn't sufficient.

(To give you an idea, the largest and last new section was the entire opening ceremonies scene, which is why that section has far more errors than the rest of the manuscript.)

For the moment, I'm collecting and rapidly fixing errors people find using the typo thread her: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/ClimbersCourt/comments/eqbv8h/diamantine_typo_thread/]]

When I get around to Arcane Ascension 3, I intend to give myself roughly twice as much editing time, and I'm going to try to avoid making any last minute changes like I did on this one.
