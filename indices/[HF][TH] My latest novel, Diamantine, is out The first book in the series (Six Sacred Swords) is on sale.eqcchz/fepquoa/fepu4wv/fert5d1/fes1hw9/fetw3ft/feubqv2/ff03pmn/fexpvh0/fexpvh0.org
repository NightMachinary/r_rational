I enjoyed this book. It felt more similar to the Cradle books than to Arcane Ascension, which isn't a bad thing. Lots of cool characters doing their own crazy overpowered awesome things. (I like the Arcane Ascension books a little more, this is just to say that it was fun in a different way)

I felt a bit ridiculous that it took me a while to recognise Professor Meltlake

This is a very minor point - far less important than the book being very enjoyable - but it did have several spelling and grammar mistakes. I don't know anything about how the self-publishing process works, so I don't know how easy it would be to improve your process for catching those.
