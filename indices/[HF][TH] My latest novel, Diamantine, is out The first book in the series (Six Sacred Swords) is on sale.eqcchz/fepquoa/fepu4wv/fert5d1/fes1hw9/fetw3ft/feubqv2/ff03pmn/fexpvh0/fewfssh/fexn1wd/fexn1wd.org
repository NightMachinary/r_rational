That's valid feedback, thank you.

My primary audience for Six Sacred Swords is readers coming in from either the linear route (finishing WOBM Book 3) or the frame story lead-in from Arcane Ascension book 2, both of which will have context on Keras and the Six Sacred Swords.

For new readers, the synopsis is vastly simplified to avoid trying to explain too many things at once. Keras doesn't actually start the book searing for the Six Sacred Swords: He's sent to an unfamiliar continent as a forward scout on a mission to gather information and resources before the rest of his team arrives. When he stumbles on the location of one of the Six Sacred Swords, he learns that they are not only potential keys to the long-term success of his team's mission, but also potentially intelligent - and in need of help. His motivations to gather the swords are a combination of practical and ethical.

I felt that this style of summary was both too complicated and potentially too "spoilery" for the early chapters of the book, where his motivations are explained and he first learns about the sacred swords.

Anyway, thanks for your feedback! No worries if this isn't your cup of tea.
