That's perfectly fair, and even I have specific anime style things that bother me. For example, I get irritated when I see people parrying greatsword with kunai in Naruto and that reach is seemingly never a factor for taijutsu and kenjustu. I think everyone has specific things they like and dislike seeing in combat scenes.

I generally visualize even anime style combat as looking "real", just operating under different rules. If you've seen movies like The Storm Riders or TV shows like Once Upon a Time at Lingjian Mountain, that's roughly how I picture book combat for more anime style books like mine or Cradle looking.

Yes, I'm a reader for Delve, but I haven't read the latest chapter yet. Thus far, I visualize the setting as being more like a Western MMO, as opposed to something like a JRPG. I'll have to check the recent chapter to see what you mean.
