Your sales pitch fell flat with me.

This isn't about the quality of your stories; I haven't anything to judge those by. But your synopsis tells me very little about /why/ the character wants these swords. Even the Amazon link says little more than, "The swordsman's current sword is broken, and no one has collected all six before."

Personally, what draws me into a story is the characters: their motivations, their flaws, their relationships with other people. If you want me to pay money for a book, that's what you'll have to pitch to me. And a story about some person going around collecting things for no better reason than because they're out there to be collected (which is how this story is being sold to me) just doesn't seem interesting.

Again, that's not a judgement of the story itself; it may just be that the synopsis doesn't do a good job of selling the character elements of the story. But the synopsis is all I have to go on, so, based on the information available to me, the only decision I can come to is not to buy your book. The advertising copy just doesn't make it sound enjoyable.

Sorry.
