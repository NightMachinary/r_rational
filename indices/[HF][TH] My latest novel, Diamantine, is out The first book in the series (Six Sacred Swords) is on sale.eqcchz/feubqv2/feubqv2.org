Off topic I'm sorry, but if you have the time you should check out some historical combat youtube channels like scholagladiatoria, chadiversity, hema in general etc. I feel like your books would be right up my alley but I couldn't enjoy arcane ascension because of the combat.

A bit more realism would go a long way, I get it it's supposed to be fantasy and just fun and cool but my suspension of disbelief can only go so far.
