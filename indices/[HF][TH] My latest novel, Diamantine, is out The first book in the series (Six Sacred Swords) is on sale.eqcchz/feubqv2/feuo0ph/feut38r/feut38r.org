Fair enough. I guess I'm just not the target audience then, while I enjoy anime combat and frequently watch anime, in written form that combat style bothers me..

It's somewhat interesting, maybe we differ in how we visualize / interpret written content, to me that's IRL, to others it might be anime or a format where their suspension of disbelief is lower.

PS. Have you seen Delve ? The most recent chapter has a fantastic realistic physics combat scene between very powerful individuals, like they can run faster than sound individuals, you may find it interesting. I loved it..
