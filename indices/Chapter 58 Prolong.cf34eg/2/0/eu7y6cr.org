Your own point in favor of the Twilight Ways as the place for Cardinal invalidates one of your points against. Specifically, because the Twilight Ways exist, it doesn't matter where on Calernia you put Cardinal, anyone can get there or get out through the Ways. Procer and Callow can't control access to the city when anyone can essentially just teleport in.

While I agree with you that locating the city in the Ways would add a measure of physical defensibility, it would also require some form of metaphysical defense to prevent someone from just unclipping the shard from Creation and casting it adrift with plenty of Named and most of Calernia's preeminent scholars stuck inside. And there's nothing to say they can't still use the Twilight Ways as a stronghold of sorts to retreat to in the event of attack while still making use of the benefits of keeping the main city in reality for day-to-day operations.

I think this Washington DC solution where the land is granted from two member nations but becomes no longer a part of either is probably for the best given the situation that had Pilgrim put on the crown. If Cat had shaped the realm instead, it might have ended up perfectly designed for what you're suggesting.
