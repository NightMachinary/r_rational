I think it's a mistake to place Cardinal anywhere on Calernia. Not only does this leave it open to siege and conquest from conventional armies, it also gives the very groups you don't want to give more bargaining power - Praes and the Free Cities - a ready-made grievance to bargain with. Giving Procer and Callow easy access to what will become the capital of the continent while everyone else must trek through would also make it easier for future rulers of either nation to gain the kind of undue influence which would lead to civil wars.

The Twilight Ways are therefore the obvious choice. Not only are they territory unclaimed by any nation human or fae, they're also far closer to every point on the continent than anywhere else you could choose. The concept of distance exists in Arcadia, but it's been noted before that travel through the realm is faster than any other means. A portal opened in the Free Cities will be closer to the ruins of Liesse (the obvious place to put Cardinal just for sheer narrative weight) than anywhere else you could place the city, and the same could be said of a portal in Ater or Keter, assuming the displaced Empire Ever Dark manages to settle the Crown of the Dead.

This would also serve to cement the city as /the/ place to be for mages. After all, you need to have access to mages to even get there! They'd be a vital part of the city's infrastructure just due to location. Keeping the city connected to the world would give ambitious mages something to do, distracting them from flying fortresses and giving them ready-made cushy prestige positions as gatekeepers. Only being accessible through portals also gives the city an additional defensive perimeter and the ability to cut off trade and mages from rebellious states. It might even defend the new center of Calernian governance from the gnomes, should they appear again, as they were noted for their technology, rather than their Arcadia portals.
