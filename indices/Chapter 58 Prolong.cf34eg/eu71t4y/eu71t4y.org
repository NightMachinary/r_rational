I don't really trust Black here, at all. Like, he's always been the exception to Cat's weird 'everyone I fuck over becomes my minion' ray. He doesn't want to reform the grand game, he wants Below to win a round of it. He isn't about to betray the Empress. I think he's just telling Cat what she wants to hear, getting himself out of her camp alive.
