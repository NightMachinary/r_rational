  Specifically, because the Twilight Ways exist, it doesn't matter where on Calernia you put Cardinal, anyone can get there or get out through the Ways. Procer and Callow can't control access to the city when anyone can essentially just teleport in.

Two points:

Cat could just consecrate more connections in callow than in anywhere else. There is still the physical distance required to travel /to and from the Calernia side of the portal/.

Arcadia also does /kinda/ reflect the real world. There could be many reasons why real world distance might also impact average travel time.

Of course, if real-world distance doesn't matter when it comes to the Twilight ways, then the whole discussion is moot. They could locate the city where Cat suggests while having it be connected everywhere that matters through the ways.
