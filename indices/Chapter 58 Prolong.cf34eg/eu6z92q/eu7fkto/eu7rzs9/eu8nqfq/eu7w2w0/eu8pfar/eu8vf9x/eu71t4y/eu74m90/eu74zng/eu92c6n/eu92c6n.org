Black told Cat that his deepest desire was that, in 500 years, heroes would sit around the campfire on dark nights and whisper tales of the days when Good was not enough. It's true that he isn't like Cat. He doesn't upend the board and reassemble a winning position from the pieces as a primary strategy. But make no mistake: upending the board is exactly what he must do in order to achieve his desires, he knows this, and right now Cat is the one who's doing the upending. He knows she's the expert at that, moreso than even he.

The only reason to question his loyalties is the fact that Alaya is still the Dread Empress.
