I never really bought or cared much about the "Magical neutral super-academy in the middle of all nations" much. Fun to read, but more in the "Don't think about it too hard" way.

Even when the background is explained in more detail, those stories still read like a convoluted explanation for the author getting to play the school setting.

PGtE really changed that up for me. Living vicariously in the current, seeing how desperate everyone is to get the wars to stop, it really makes the school settings seem not only possible, but the best possible plan they could come up with. I think I'll enjoy school settings in any work a lot more now :)
