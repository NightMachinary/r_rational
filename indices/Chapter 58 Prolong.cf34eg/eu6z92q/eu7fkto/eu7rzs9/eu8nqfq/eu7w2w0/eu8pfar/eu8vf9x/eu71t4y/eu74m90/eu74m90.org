This would be changing the rules of the game and as we already saw in the fae arc that in itself is a win for evil.

The status quo is evil losing in the end. This is evil not losing, that is a win for evil even if good doesnt lose aswell. Edit: and showing that non zero sum games are posible, were 1 side losing is not required for 1 side to win, is the moral of the everdark arc
