While in all honesty the greater political sentiments are out of my wheelhouse, i do still love Amadeus' line "It is not enough to be correct in /principle/, Catherine. If you cannot offer a practical way to deliver on your beliefs, then they are wind." I also love how upfront he is about the fact that she's dictating as if she was the conqueror as if it wasn't on the table that she still could be.
