Grace is, much like the rest of her former squad, sort of a pitiable wretch of a person at this point. She's sacrificed all of her memories, all of her relationships, all of her /humanity/ in pursuit of her goals.

Unlike the rest of her former squad, I find her goals largely admirable and I think her success would, on balance, make the world a better place. Don't get me wrong, she's done some nasty shit and she's /incapable/ of feeling regret at this point, but she's really the only character we've seen who truly recognizes the injustice and inequality that is at the core of this society and is willing to sacrifice her own well-being to fight against it. She's willing to sacrifice the well-being of /others/ as well, which is no bueno, but at the end of the day I'd much rather live in a world where Grace achieves her goals than live in a world where our "heroes" stop her.

Edit: HOLY SHIT THAT'S WHY HER NAME IS TUNNELVISION
