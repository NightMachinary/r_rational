  Well, I guess they could always break into a body store and steal a new body, and skip the "money" part. I mean, I know this world is pretty cyberpunk, but there's no way corporate warehouses will have more security than the headquarters of a major terrorist organization, right?

My in-universe answer is that since Paragon Academy is so uptight about security, they'll probably need proper documentation when a student changes bodies, so Ana can't just steal a new one - she needs the paper trail and verification that a legitimate purchase provides.
