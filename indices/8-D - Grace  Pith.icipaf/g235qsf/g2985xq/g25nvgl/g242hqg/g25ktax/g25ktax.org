Egress is probably a top secret Epistocrat spaceship plan. I recall in a previous chapter that it was mentioned that the world had around 6 years left before there was literally zero land left due to the sea level rise. Humans might be shit at long term planning but there is no way people with the kind of money and power these guys have wouldn't have some plan.
