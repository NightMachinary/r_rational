  “Because it won't work,” said Grace.  “In the event of an emergency, all perimeter guards are to stay at their posts, and increase their vigilance.  And the wires on the electric fence are connected to an alarm system.  If they get cut or the circuit gets broken, it sends off an alarm.  You wouldn't make it a mile.”

Wow. The functional security system just makes the death camps seem even bleaker.

  It had taken two more years to escape the camp.

Well fuck.

  The most remarkable thing in the whole building, of course, was the bearded man in front of her, wearing a bathrobe, bare feet resting on the smooth wooden desk, sipping tea and reading a book.  A gramophone played a smooth piano song, and he nodded along with the rhythm.

  “If we solved one problem for them, they'd expect us to fix everything,” Tau said.  “And do not imagine they'd be grateful for your help.  The thoughts of a Humdrum are close-minded and stubborn and prideful all at once.  If they found out people like you existed, many would try to burn you at the stake.  They'd try to burn all of us.”

I had noticed the parallels before, but this chapter in particular is seriously /Harry Potter/. With extermination camps.

(which makes me wonder if Tau is doing the "pretending to be senile" gambit)

  “These include directions on how to travel through the mountains to the Principality's lines!  Do not linger!”

    “You went mad.  You burned every Humdrum in sight, soldiers and civilians.  You created mountains of ashes.  They're calling you ‘The Pyre Witch' now.”

I kind of get the feeling that the Principality straight up exterminated them to sell the lie.

  Even in the middle of a war, Paragon could spare three whole top-ranked squads to hunt down one of their own.

Here we see that Tau's rhetoric about his hands being tied was bullshit. Suddenly, when their personal power is threatened, they can find troops to spare.

  “About Buttercup Lodge,” said Grace.  “And Egress.”

Anyone get what that part means?

  ‘Ernest Chapman', a Grey Coat assistant at Paragon Academy, is an imposter, a girl with the mask of a boy.  Her real name is Anabelle Gage, a three-time failed applicant who attempted a body theft from cargo ship 9187, crate serial 541256h, attacking and nearly killing two students in the process.
#+end_quote

Nooooooooooo.

(still a little surprised that Tunnel Vision has that level of info on her, yet Ana is still alive)

Well, I guess they could always break into a body store and steal a new body, and skip the "money" part. I mean, I know this world is pretty cyberpunk, but there's no way corporate warehouses will have more security than the headquarters of a major terrorist organization, right?
