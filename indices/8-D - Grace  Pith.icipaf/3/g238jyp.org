Were there any hints who the real boss of Commonplace might be? Has she appeared before under another name?

She forbade the Nudge terrorism attacks Grace got up to.

Maybe Grace just follows her, because she believes in the boss' vision?

We have apparently seen her in [[https://pithserial.com/2020/07/14/7-c-the-blue-charlatan/][7-C]]:

  A hooded figure stood next to Tunnel Vision, wearing a faded green military long coat, the kind you'd see in photos of the Shenti War, or older.

  One of her thumbs had been cut off at the first knuckle.

  On the podium, the hooded woman turned towards the storm of projectiles, impassive, not even trying to run or dodge.

Then Grace protects her throughout the fight. Ana does not see the boss contributing.

If that's really her, she has a maimed body that she keeps. Why? Is she a Joiner, unable to leave or does she just keep it for sentimental value?

It seems to me that she is probably a prisoner Grace freed during her campaign through Shenten. Probably not even a projector. Have we seen anything that contradicts this?
