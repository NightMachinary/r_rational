On Akhara's Gate:

Akhara is mentioned in [[https://pithserial.com/2019/11/25/3-c-the-empty-book/][3-C]]:

#+begin_quote
  Rana the Monk. Akhara the Polymath. Tegudar the General. And, of course, Darius the Philosopher. The Four Eternals. The most famous of the Great Scholars, the ideological foundations of the world's nation-states.
#+end_quote

I don't think that it's clear which nation Akhara is associated with.

One side of the gate is anchored inside Grace's submarine while the other contains what is clearly a metaphorical representation of her pith (shaped by the redemption camp and constant modifications carried out by her Vocation). Which it makes physical. Which then Grace made into her office. (Which is pretty metal.)

Akhara's Gate might be a vocation or it might be an artifact.
