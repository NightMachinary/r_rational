Seems irrational for Harry to pay for information that Dumbledore will soon be giving him for free. There's no real cost to Harry just assuming that he can't get out of the tournament, so even the slight delay doesn't provide much of a justification. Dumbledore would of course be much more thorough than any student in finding relevant information, as well.

Additionally, Harry maybe should have bargained harder. He paid much more money than he should have. It would have been easy for him to, for example, point out that if she forced him to pay the bounties individually, he would then refuse to use her as a source in the future. The good will or slight trust of the Boy Who Lived is worth a lot more than the galleons she gained, he should have pointed that out and used it while negotiating.

Wow, that test is really smart and sneaky, awesome.

As always, I'm very glad to see this update.
