Good characterisation. Good worldbuilding. Near-canon competence porn. Best treatment of wandless magic I've ever read. Excellent treatment of magic generally, including obscure stuff like Occlumency and the cultural reasons not to require an unbreakable vow from every student never to harm another person.

The main points of divergence are subtle enough that it feels realistic, and the author feels no need to visit the stations of the canon - some /similar/ things happen, but there's usually good reason.

It's a very strong rational fic, without being rationalist.
