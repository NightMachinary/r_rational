I have seen this reccomended a few times - what are the reasons that I should be reading it? Awesome action scenes, heavy emotion, good characterization ... ? 150K words (and incomplete) is enough that I'd like someone's analysis of /why/ I should read it rather than just being told I should read it.

Edit: Not to mention that the first chapter was apparently published in 2007, which means that it's probably never going to be completed.
