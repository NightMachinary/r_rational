er, basically a bit like hpmor(/..ish/) only with canon!Harry, Ron and Hermione. The divergence point being in the second year where he fails to save Ginny. And it changes everything.

My memory is a bit scratchy from the two month of hiatus from the last time I read it though. So I'm afraid I'm not the best person to ask about this - not until I get the chance for a second read through at least.

From what I do remember though, it was pretty good. Devoured it in the first setting like I do most interesting things. The writing's great, felt very much true to canon's narrative. And I liked how the trio began to rationally approach everything. Lots of fantastic little deviations from canon too, the wizarding world depicted a bit more realistically.

You can give [[https://www.fanfiction.net/r/3557725/0/178/][the reviews]] (from 1st ch) a look if you like, and then give the first few chapters a try.
