I feel like it's only like hpmor in that it is a fanfic about harry potter that is reasonably good. There are some changes and divergences, and you can tell the author is trying to write a better world than the canon harry potter world but still reasonably contained with in it.

I wouldn't consider it to be like hpmor because it focuses on three characters, not one, and other reasons. It will certainly seem like hpmor in some ways, but only because of the limitations inherent in writing good harry potter fanfic.
