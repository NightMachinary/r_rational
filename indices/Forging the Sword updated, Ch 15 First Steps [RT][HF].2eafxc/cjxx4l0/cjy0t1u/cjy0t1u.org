As a matter of public service we need to make a habit of updating tvtropes entries as we read.

I always cringe when monster of a reads updates once in a blue moon. For I know my schedule for the +day+ /week/ is utterly ruined to accommodate the fat reread that I am like, honor bound to inevitably do. On top of my wonderfully obese backlogs. I think I'd still be struggling through the Dungeon Keeper Ami update weren't for the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/DungeonKeeperAmi][trope summarizations]].
