DataPacRat's [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AU8o3wSAiufh-Eg1FtL-6656dNvbCFILCi2GbeESsb4/edit][Self Insert]] in a post singularity future. Cannot recommend it badly enough.

On the main reasons I'm such dreadfully slow reader is because I'm guilty of playing out all the friggin scenes in my head.

Peter Kump's Breakthrough Rapid Reading is looking good.
