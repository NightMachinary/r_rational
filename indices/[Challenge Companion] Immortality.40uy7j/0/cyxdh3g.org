Writing about Immortality is hard because, when you include it, the incentives which drive human society just... dissolve. It's like including someone truly omniscient, where the sheer power of the ability distorts the fabric of text-time around it. To have immortality requires some method of balancing its presence, with a flaw (like Vampirism) or a counter-force (Werewolves), or something else.

And, in the end, immortality doesn't even add all that much to the story, because the reader can't hang around all that long, even if they wanted to. I'm sure we'll get literary advances in this area as life expectancies rise and rise, but not until then.
