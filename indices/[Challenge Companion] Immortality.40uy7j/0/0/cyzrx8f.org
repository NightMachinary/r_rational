I've got to disagree.

The "incentives which drive human society" are /always/ imaginary. Turning the minutia of our everyday lives into life-or-death struggles is an intellectual exercise as much as it's an evolutionary throwback or a hormonal impulse.

Fear of death is the /cheapest/ fear. What about humiliation? Imagine knowing that all of your immortal friends will remember that stupid thing you did /forever/. What if that thing was hurtful instead, and you fear being shunned? Telling yourself that "nobody will care in 100 years" isn't going to feel significantly better than telling your mortal self the same thing. You'll have to experience the misery and loneliness of the next few weeks just the same.

Yes, immortality makes threatening the life of your protagonist impossible. There are other threats.
