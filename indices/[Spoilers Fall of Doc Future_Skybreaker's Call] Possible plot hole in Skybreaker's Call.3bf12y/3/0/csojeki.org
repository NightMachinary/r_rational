So for positive feedback:

I thought your first depiction of Flikkers true speed (when she flits to london to save her friend) was an unparalleld feat, showing us the life of a true speedster.

Later I saw the Quicksilver scene from Xmen: days of future past and I think they are pretty much equal in awesomeness.

So thank you for providing much entertainment.
