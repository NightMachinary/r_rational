Quote from chapter 26 which is found at : [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/96437734176/skybreakers-call-chapter-26]]

  "Eighteen ships now being tracked,” said DASI. “Velocity about 2,030 kilometers per second towards Earth, with slight variations.” Doc almost stumbled. “That's huge! They must have jumped through with it.” "How soon will they be here?“ asked Jetgirl. "Depends on how soon they start decelerating, and how fast. Two and a half hours for a flyby if they don't. Or impactors. DASI? Any sign--”

EDIT: Numbers:

According to the quote, the fleet are traveling at 2,030 kilometers per second when they are first spotted, and they will arrive at earth in 2.5 hours if they do not slow down.

(2,030 kilometers per second * 2.5 hours) / c = 60 light-seconds away.

Flicker has shown she can get to the moon in less than 60 seconds during the music video.
