This is specifically mentioned earlier in Skybreaker's Call (one of the Lizard children suggests it). It's very hard, maybe impossible, to make a containment suit that lets her operate at speed, and if they don't approach from the same side as the moon, she's a total sitting duck for the jump home.

EDIT: Found it. [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/81156411972/skybreakers-call-chapter-15][Chapter 15]]. And note that in the actual attack, they quickly surround the planet, so those fears were well-founded.
