It was mostly a joke, but I think it lays it on thick. I have some issues with over-emphasizing with fictional characters and suffering emotional exhaustion.

And the characters are really intelligent, but all have Wisdom as the dump stat and that really pisses me off. It's like reading Romeo and Juliet, only with superpowers and word crisis instead of romance.
