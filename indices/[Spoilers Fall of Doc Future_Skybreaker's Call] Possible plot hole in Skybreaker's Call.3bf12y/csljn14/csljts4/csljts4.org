Okay, then the plan could be: establish some underground moon bases with oxygen tanks (if necessary) and communications equipment. As soon as the invading fleet is spotted, go to the moon right away and wait to be signalled to attack?

EDIT: Actually if she is both vulnerable and unable to throw all of the rocks from the moon due to lack of entropy then she would be unable to get back to the Earth to destroy all the ships.

However, now that I've read the next couple of chapters, she does actually destroy all of the ships from the Earth and it's not an extinction event, so I fail to see how it could be possible that she couldn't have done it on the moon.
