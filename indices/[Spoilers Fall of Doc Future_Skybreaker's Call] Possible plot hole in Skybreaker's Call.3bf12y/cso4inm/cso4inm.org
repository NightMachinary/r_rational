Well, nice to know my work is inspiring discussion 8-). An early commenter on chapter 14 asked about the going to the Moon method, so I added a discussion of it in chapter 15. One of the problems was that the Moon is quite a long ways from Earth--farther than Flicker's effective range to hit maneuvering spaceships with rocks, and wasn't in the right part of its orbit to be between Earth and the approaching fleet. Other problems I went into more detail about in chapter 15.

For the comment about romance: I understand that it won't be to everyone's taste, and I can certainly sympathize with over-empathizing and emotional exhaustion, but one of the things I was trying to portray is plausible relationships--and those don't necessarily get easier at the far right end of the bell curve, even in the absence of other problems. Doc was suffering from chronic sleep deprivation and was actively sabotaged by a powerful probability manipulator as a teenager, Flicker had multiple traumas and a completely asocial childhood, and Stella was a serial killer. In addition, the only major viewpoint character who is remotely neurotypical is Donner. They're bad at it for good reasons.

I'll take "like reading Romeo and Juliet, only with superpowers and world crisis" as a compliment, whether is was intended as one or not 8-)

Thanks to everyone who took the time to read and comment. Seeing the different ways people react to my work helps give me perspective as a writer.

Edited for clarity.
