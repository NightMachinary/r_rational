Also, on the topic of wonderful absurdist pieces of media, today I learned that [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34708/romantically-apocalyptic][/Romantically Apocalyptic/ is now on RoyalRoad]]. It's not even remotely rational-adjacent---perhaps, this is the most irrational /good/ thing I've ever read ^{^{/Cordyceps/}} ^{^{are}} ^{^{not}} ^{^{irrational,}} ^{^{fight}} ^{^{me}} . But it's really good at what it does: delivering a unique, fascinating, darkly humorous story that hints at very solid worldbuilding hidden behind piles of random events.

Also, the photo manipulation illustrations there are /gorgeous/.
