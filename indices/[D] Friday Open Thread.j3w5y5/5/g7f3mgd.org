Workings as a "solutions engineer", loving it. I want to explore joining-or-creating a professional association for these sorts of customer-facing technical positions; and I want to connect with folks working these kinds of jobs at companies that're making sci-fi real - for example, SpaceX and Commonwealth Fusion are making SF real, but they're not going to be doing the b2b tech products that make for the roles I'm thinking of.

Just spitballing here. RN, the various big data offerings (snowflake, spark) kinda fall into this category, and then I realized the DWave (and other quantum computing companies) also fall into it.

Any ideas / comments / suggestions? (TBC: NOT looking for new job, JUST looking for networking)
