I don't specifcially want to argue about the community as a unit. This is just some.of the more particular type ones deep in the hpmor/miri potion.

Do you want like, a twitter thread where everone is agreeing with Bill Gates philanthropy positions side by side with to doctors explaining how it doesnt help and then no one updating thier priors? I can try to find some stuff but I haven't been engaging with those people for a ehile because it is disappointing.
