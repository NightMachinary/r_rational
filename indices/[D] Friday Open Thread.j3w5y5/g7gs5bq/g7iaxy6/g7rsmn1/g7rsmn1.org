It's very good, but I always felt the first one was almost the opposite of a fair play whodunnit- it sets up a handful of mysteries E.g. what happened to all the kids, why does no one age or die, why only 8 million people, Spend more than a little time referencing them and having characters talk about them, Then ends with an infodump about how the mysteries didn't matter and the author forgot to edit a typo

Also, even if it did a good job exploring some aspects of it's society, I don't believe that even faced with infinite time a person would spend thousands of years doing the same thing without end just to eke out every possible, convieveable micron of entertainment. The human psyche doesn't work that way, you just get bored and want to play something else.
