NaNoWriMo is coming up, and I've heard that some folks like to have an editor who can quickly process each day's output. With that in mind, I'd like to offer my services as an editor.

In short, *the package is this*: Proofreading + General Feedback (at least a paragraph's worth) every day for $15 per day (a total of $450 for the month of November). You send me what you wrote that day, and I'll get it back to you within 24 hours.

I'm flexible on the payment plan. You could pay every day, for example, or every week, or you could pay $225 in the beginning and then $225 at the end. You could also pay for the whole thing up front (this would be especially useful if you want an extra motivation to finish NaNo---if you fail NaNo, I can reimburse you for the $$$ not used, but I could /also/ donate it to a charity instead if you think the financial loss would motivate you).

*Important caveat:* The response speed assumes that you're doing the normal NaNoWriMo rate of approximately 1,666 words per day. If you skip one day and then make it all up on the next day, then there /may/ be a delay (there might not be a delay! I just want to allow for the possibility).

If you are looking for an editor, but not for NaNo, then I'd still be interested in discussing a gig. I'm familiar with both fiction and nonfiction (especially college papers, which I will provide feedback and counsel on but /will not/ write for you).
