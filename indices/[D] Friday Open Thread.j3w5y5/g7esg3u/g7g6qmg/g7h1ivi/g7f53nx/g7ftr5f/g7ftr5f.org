“Cleverness fiction,” for people who like watching cleverness unfold. It covers all three types, including things like Doctor Who, Thursday Next, Rick Cook's Wiz series, The Edge starring Anthony Hopkins, the later parts of Eragon/Inheritance Cycle, CSI Vegas, in-universe in-genre crossover fiction like Ivanhoe, Into The Woods, Shrek and Toy Story, and pretty much anything that's been adapted with Martin Freeman playing the everyman.
