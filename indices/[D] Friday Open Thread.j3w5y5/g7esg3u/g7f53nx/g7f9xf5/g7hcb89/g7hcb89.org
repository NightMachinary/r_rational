If you want to do it:

[[/r/ratadj]]

1. It's good to connect it directly to [[/r/rational]], because then you might somewhat lessen the chances of splitting the (already pretty dead) sub. I regularly visit the subreddits for my country and city, and whenever I check on one for news I immediately go and check on the other too, and I think the direct connection will help anyone who finds one and likes it want to go and check the other, both when they first discover it and regularly afterwards. I think having the more direct connection makes it much more likely that it won't fizzle out right at the start, unlike /r/insertpositivequalityhereFiction.

2. It doesn't have to be purely rat-adjacent works if you don't want to limit it, even with the name; you can have a sidebar explaining what most people consider "rational adjacent" and say "post things you think fit into this or that people who like this would also enjoy".

3. [[/r/rationaladjacent]] is too wordy and [[/r/rationaladj]] is a cowardly half measure.
