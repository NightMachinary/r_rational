I've been around the sub for a decent while, and I've kinda noticed that there are 3 groups of people in this sub.\\
1. Rationalists. Big fans of Eliezer, prioritize reading 'rationalist' works.\\
2. Rational readers. Enjoy well thought out and complicated stories. Bothered by plot holes and idiot sticks.\\
3. Quality/Deep fiction readers. The 'oddball' on the sub. Enjoy a lot of different things, and are on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] because the other subs like [[/r/webserials]] and [[/r/FanFiction]] just aren't very popular/good.

This kinda makes me sad, as I'd categorize myself as somewhere between 2 or 3, but 3 doesn't really have a home anywhere. Am I missing some critical sub? This community has grown up to have some actually fairly diverse taste by my metrics, but a lot of this is because it doesn't limit itself to rational[ist] works, or genre, or even fanfic/webserials. Is there interest in seeding a new sub to cater specifically to 3? Not to get them/us out of the sub, just to create an adjacent/partner community that isn't centered around rationalism, and is more accessible/discoverable to newcomers?
