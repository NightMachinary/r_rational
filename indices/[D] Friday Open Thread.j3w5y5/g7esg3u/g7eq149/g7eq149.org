Played Star Wars Squadrons as soon as I had the time to sit down. Haven't hopped in multiplayer yet (got a few years of rust I need to knock off, plus a new joystick to adapt to), but it otherwise appears to be the X-wing/TIE Fighter sequel for the modern age that I've been dreaming and idly designing myself since I played those games in the mid-90's.

11 hours from now or so I'll post a twitch link if anyone wants to watch me dig into it now that I have most of my controls set.
