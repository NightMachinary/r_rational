[[https://www.reddit.com/r/chestertonsfence/comments/j4ax1h/fix_your_graphs_storagereviews_unusual/][I wrote about a Chesterton's Fence.]] Chesterton's Fence is a parable about how the reasons for a thing's existence may not at first be obvious, but may still be important.

  There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: “If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.”

Does anyone else have good examples of concrete Chesterton's Fences?
