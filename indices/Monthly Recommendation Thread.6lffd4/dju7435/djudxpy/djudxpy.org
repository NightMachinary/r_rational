I feel guilty for having mixed feelings towards Young Wizards as a whole, especially because I find it difficult to explain why. Some of the books I love, others I find really boring. /A Wizard Alone/ is definitely my favorite because I relate to the portrayal of depression and autism, but I was so disappointed in /Wizards at War/ that I put the series on indefinite hiatus for myself. The books used to make me happy, but now I feel ambivalent towards them.

When I started the series, I found it to be unique and entertaining even when I thought it could be better, but over time I've become more and more frustrated to the point where I'm no longer certain if I will enjoy reading more. For some reason, I've enjoyed all the story arcs that are just about Nita, Kit, and/or Dairine than the ones that involve grouping up with other wizards. Am I just biased against high fantasy tropes?
