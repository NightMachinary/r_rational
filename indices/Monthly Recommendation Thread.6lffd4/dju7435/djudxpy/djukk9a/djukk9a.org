It's OK not to like stuff! Instead of feeling guilty, find something else you enjoy reading - or, yes, reflect and discuss what you didn't enjoy to get better suggestions ;)

Personally, I don't feel that YW is quite High Fantasy; more a kind of fantasy-flavored YA urban scifi with extra themes stirred in.

Anyway - if you like the smaller-scale, character-focused stuff, you will like /Interim Errantry #1/ and love /Uptown Local/ and /How lovely are your branches/ and /Not on my patch/. Canonical short stories are the best :)
