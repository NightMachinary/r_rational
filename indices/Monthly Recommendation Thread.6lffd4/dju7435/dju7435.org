[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ring-maker-worm-lord-of-the-rings-alt-power.517894/page-267#post-36635851][/Ring-Maker/]] is a /Worm/ fic, where Taylor has (a portion of) the essence of one of the Maiar, and makes rings... among other artefacts. Features notable armour, swords, spears, rings, and names - including as the new Ward, /Annatar/.

The /Young Wizards/ series remains excellent, and has lots of extra snippets over at [[/r/errantry]] - two out of three mods agree! (and AlexanderWales might too, I suppose, but the rest of us are mods there too)

/The Martian/ is a better book than it is a movie, at least for people who like their scifi diamond-hard - IMO it's the best such book since Clarke was writing SF prior to most of our interplanetary probes.
