I recently read [[http://royalroadl.com/fiction/8463/the-arcane-emperor/][The Arcane Emperor]] [WIP], which invokes what I thought was a tremendously fun overpowered plot device; sleep learning.

It had a lot of other system-breaking plot devices that I didn't care as much about, and the writing is a bit of a mixed bag (the way they used third person omniscient and tell-not-show could sometimes be a bit jarring), but I felt like overall it was a pretty decent overpowered-protagonist xianxia-style LitRPG adventure story. The level of power reached tends to be matched by equally powerful baddies, so even though he power levels like crazy the main character is still challenged at every turn.

Another fun story I read was [[https://royalroadl.com/fiction/10519/the-bound-dungeon][The Bound Dungeon]] [WIP], which is about a kid who is turned into a dungeon and munchkins their newfound monster creation abilities for mana.
