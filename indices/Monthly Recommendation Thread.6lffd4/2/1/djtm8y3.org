[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/192821-cradle][Cradle series]] by Will Wight. Recommended in my parent level post.

[[https://royalroadl.com/fiction/5701/savage-divinity][Savage Divinity]] by ruffwriter. I think it hits exactly the spot you mention.

[[https://royalroadl.com/fiction/10286/the-good-student][The Good Student]] by Mooderino. You've probably seen it posted here before. I anticipate the next volume will focus explicitly on magic.
