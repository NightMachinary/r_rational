I strongly disagree with you. The first chapter alone contains the following, with pretty much no real explanation or setup:

  Ignoring the anger as he always did, Naruto raised a hand and greeted his teammate happily. "Oy, Sasuke-teme, what's up?"

  His answer came in the form of one of the best right hooks the Last Uchiha had ever thrown.

  Not even remotely expecting it, Naruto put up no resistance when his fellow member of Team 7 beat him to within an inch of his life. The loudmouthed blond boy had NEVER been subject to so much violence from this boy, who he'd often considered a friend, even a brother, and caught between his initial surprise and trying to keep his towel on, didn't put up too much of a fight.

  Finally, the brooding avenger wore his arms out and left without once having said a word the entire visit, his knuckles split and bleeding, toes sore from too much kicking, and annoyed that Naruto had absorbed it all without dying.

And that's far from an isolated thing. Kakashi and Sakura aren't quite as physical, but are treated pretty much the same by the author (again, this is just the first chapter).

We're supposed to just take it on faith that three characters are completely and fundamentally altered from their canon selves, with no justification given. Regardless of whether you want to read a story like that, it speaks ill of the writer's ability if they hamfistedly alter every character to fit into an awkward trope without even an attempt at explaining why it's different from canon. PL, in particular, doesn't even seem /aware/ what he's writing is non-canon, which speaks of a much more fundamental mischaracterisation.
