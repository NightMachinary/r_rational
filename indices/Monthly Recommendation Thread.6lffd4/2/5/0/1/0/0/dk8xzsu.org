  We're supposed to just take it on faith that three characters are completely and fundamentally altered from their canon selves, with no justification given
#+end_quote

A character with a different personality from their canon version doesn't always have to be justified or explained as long as these differences from the canon character are consistent throughout the fanfic itself. This only makes the story into technically-an-AU. Granted, if wouldn't be for everyone's tastes, but it by itself wouldn't be a bad writing trope.

  criticism regarding Kakashi's, Sasuke's, and Naruto's appalling behaviour at times, which even seems to clash with their portrayal in the rest of the fanfic itself
#+end_quote

This is a more valid criticism, but still not enough yet to warrant a recommendation of avoiding the story entirely. There are many fanfics generally worth of reading that still contain one or two bad things like this. Dealing with such stories is more convenient through a “+red+ yellow card” system than through a one strike blacklisting.

--------------

That being said, this particular story had so many bad things about it that I wanted to expend on your negative review to make it stronger.

1) The story often zig-zags between maintainging a more “sane” pacing and degrading into crackfic logic and crackfic scenes. During these cracky scenes everyone suddenly starts behaving out of character; and the whole plot advancement starts feeling like a delirium-generated train of thought.

  Naruto had started to use Body Switches to pull other things into his place just when Kiba was about to hit him. He'd started off with stones and logs, but pretty soon he'd gotten creative and Kiba was punching at him only to suddenly hit a very surprised head examiner, or Kakashi, or the Hokage.

  In the face,

  Hard.

  Several times.

  Naruto repeated those switches over and over again. Then he'd gone a little nuts, and, using his wires, had grabbed Sasuke off of the witness balcony and used him as a mace to club at Kiba, missing more often than not, but still very satisfied to be smashing the Uchiha about like a mace, smashing apart the walls and even injuring that big stone statue some.

  Sakura had called out fierce objections, only to get caught by more wires and added to the fun. Maybe her face would look normal someday, if the medics cared enough to fix it, but maybe not.

  The Uchiha was never going to be pretty again.

  [...] Some of the rookie genin had called out objections from the balcony, that it wasn't fair for Naruto to involve so many other people in his own fight, but Naruto's short, curt, “A ninja tool is anything a ninja uses,” the head examiner had agreed, around his bruises, and quickly called the match in Naruto's favor.

and here's the author's note for that chapter, lol:

#+begin_quote
  You know, I never would've believed how HARD it was to write that fight with Kiba. [..] Maybe I'm traumatized, I don't know. But the last time I had a big fight scene in this fic I took up a whole chapter on it, spent loads of creative effort, and got like three sentences in reply on that in my reviews. Most of them totally ignored the bulk of that chapter to go to great lengths to tell me how upset they were over a stinking comic relief paragraph tacked onto the end, which really left me feeling unrewarded for my work. Which probably means we won't be having another big fight in this story, not if they are this blocked. Sorry, I'd love to include them, but if they continue to be like this we certainly won't be seeing another.

2) Almost no fight scenes, and from 25% onward likely no fight scenes at all, if the above-mentioned A\N is to be believed --- which makes most of the self-improvement study and training scenes rather useless.

3) Cracky harem scenes during which characters turn into pzombies.

4) A metric ton of inane decisions and descriptions, like of the protag learning how to make armor, cloths, dresses, how to give massage, and so on. Maybe go for it if that's what you're looking for, but this story's nothing more than a fluffy crackfic with a repulsive protag.
