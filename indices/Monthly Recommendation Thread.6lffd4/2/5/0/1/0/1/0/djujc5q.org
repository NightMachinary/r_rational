Of course the enjoyability of the story matters, but you'll note that my main argument was that someone unfamiliar enough with the source material to make the sort of accidental changes PL makes, and who thinks that that sort of characterisation makes for a good story, are warning signs that the story is likely to be bad because the author lacks skill.

I mean, presumably some people enjoy CED, but I don't think there's much overlap with people who enjoy rational fics - I'd go so far as to say the two are anticorrelated. CED doesn't have particularly good, or even (imo) decent, prose.
