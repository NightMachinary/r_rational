  Regardless of whether you want to read a story like that, it speaks ill of the writer's ability if he hamfistedly alters every character to fit into an awkward trope without even an attempt at explaining why it's different from canon. PL, in particular, doesn't even seem /aware/ what he's writing is non-canon, which speaks of a much more fundamental mischaracterization.

If the author wants to write a goofy AU in which characters are wildly and obviously OOC, what's wrong with that? Why should I care about whether or not /the author/ thinks it's a goofy AU or a true reflection of canon? [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_the_Author][I don't care about the intent of the /author/---all that matters is the enjoyability of the /story/.]]

/Chunin Exam Day/ is an enjoyable goofy AU of /Naruto/, just as /Atlas Shrugged/ (or /Mein Kampf/ or /The Protocols of the Elders of Zion/, probably, though I still haven't gotten around to reading either book) is an enjoyable goofy AU of real life. Enjoying /Chunin Exam Day/ doesn't mean you have to agree with Perfect Lionheart, any more than enjoying /Atlas Shrugged/ means you have to agree with Ayn Rand or enjoying /Mein Kampf/ means you have to agree with Hitler.
