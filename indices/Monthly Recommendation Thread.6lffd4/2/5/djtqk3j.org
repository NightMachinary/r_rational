  Time Braid also has aspects of this; I suspect that time loops work well for this type of story.

I would point out that /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411][Chunin Exam Day]]/, which inspired /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/ and many other stories, also has a lot of this in its earlier chapters (e.g., chakra-control exercises), before it gets bogged down in Sasuke/Kakashi/Sakura bashing and harem shenanigans.
