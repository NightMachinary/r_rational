[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ascent_of_Man][/The Ascent of Man/]] is a documentary series about the history of civilisation. The presenter also wrote [[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/461104.The_Ascent_of_Man][a book]] by the same title, which goes into a bit more detail about some parts while being essentially a transcript of the documentary. It's not precisely rational, but it's close, and I think a lot of people on this subreddit would enjoy either the TV show or book.

Some of the science is outdated, since it's from the 70s, but the presenter (Jacob Bronowski) has a very elegant way of bringing together history and modern knowledge, and comparing and showing the similarities between art and science.
