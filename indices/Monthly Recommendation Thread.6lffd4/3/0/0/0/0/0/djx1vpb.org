I definitely oversimplified and I admit that the description of it sounds really good on paper, but I just didn't find Memeki or any of the events surrounding her interesting. I predicted every single story beat in advance and didn't care about the characters enough to enjoy the arc anyway. I never found her struggle to find the will to rebel against the dystopia she was in to be compelling. It wasn't badly written or anything, I just found it boring and unsatisfying.
