Sorry for how epically long this turned out to be. I spend way too much of my time analyzing my feelings toward stories I read and haven't had the opportunity to discuss this in detail with anyone, so I just spewed forth all the thoughts that I've been dwelling on for over a year with no outlet for them. I really want to finally discuss this series with someone and you finally gave me the chance.

--------------

I think of it as high fantasy because a lot of the story arcs seem to be about very powerful yet archetypical characters going on straightforward but epic adventures against The Great Evil and learning some life lesson along the way. It's seems like it's intentionally made to resemble fairy tales, and for some reason I don't really like that. Sometimes the story is imaginative enough or the character arcs complex enough to carry it, but other times I found it repetitive and predictable.

Case in point, there's a heroic sacrifice in every single book. After the first three it stopped being surprising for both the reader and the characters, so I think /Wizards at War/ tried to subvert the trope but then I found the Deus Ex Dog ending narratively unsatisfying. At times it feels like the story is too rational for its own sake, the characters become so self aware and critical of their own narrative that the sense of discovery is lost and events start to feel contrived. Things just happened because that's the way things are.

If there's one word to describe the universe of the books, it's /boundless/. Like all great fantasy worlds, I just wanted to explore it more to see what was there. After a while though, it all started to seem rote and mundane. The worlds they visited and the adventures they went on stopped felling like something I hadn't seen before and the themes explored stopped being interesting. /A Wizard Alone/ completely bucked that trend and I loved every minute of it, but then it came right back in the next book.

When I recommended the books to my friends, I described them as the anti-Harry Potter. Instead of leaving for a world of magic, all that wonder is brought into our world and makes the mundane seem more wonderful as a result. That is, until that world started to feel mundane in its own right as the characters become more knowledgable about it. So then we get incredible new threats unlike anything they've ever seen, which the Powers That Be decided to not to tell them about for some reason.

I mean, even when there isn't an in-universe justification it's usually easy to come up with one, but after a while the rules of the setting start to feel arbitrary when they shouldn't. /Wizards at War/ broke all the rules by putting the whole universe at risk, having that somehow make everyone more cynical, leaving all adult wizards powerless to stop it, bringing back almost every major character from previous books, and giving our heroes more power than ever, all for the sake of going on a quest with the ones I found the least interesting to save a princess from an evil overlord because she had the power to save the universe.

It's just...you have the grand scope of this universe and that's the best plot you can come up with? It was just so boring and I thought the climatic defense of Earth was even worse! I'm guessing you like the book because your username is Peridexis, which I admit was the most awesome thing in the book, but I disliked the story so much after already being disappointed in previous books that it made me worried that the rest of the books aren't worth my time to read. I got none of what I had gotten from past books and nothing new that I wanted.

What I would've liked to see instead of the main trio going on more adventures that are supposed to be even more treacherous than before but come across as rote is to see them just...grow up. They make a big deal about how their power is declining as they get older and will have to choose a specialized job to do for the rest of their lives, and I'd really like to see them just do that. I like slice of life and overcoming simple personal challenges, which the books have pulled off before.

Instead, I just keep seeing the character whine about growing up and losing power while still going on fantastic adventures. The intention is probably to show the awkward transition that is teenage years, but with the exception of /A Wizard Alone/ the lessons they learn from those adventurers aren't growing with them. Granted, the themes were pretty mature for a kids book at the start, but I still expect more as time goes on.

It's that kind of disappointment that makes me look back on the books I like and notice flaws that didn't bother me before, like how Nita's bullies play such a pen unimportant role in /So You Want to Be a Wizard/ or that Dairine's computer has an interface out of the 1980s despite being set in the 2010s (I'm reading the New Millennium editions, which the author says are the definitive versions). It makes me question whether the series was ever as great as I first thought it was, or if was /just good/ and won't get better.

I'm tempted to blame the premise itself for being too high concept for its own good, part of me even thinks it would be better as an item-based Magical Girl story just so the magic system would have consistent limitations appropriate to an adventure fantasy, but it seems unfair to the author to think she isn't imaginative enough for write her own story. In the end, I want there to be more Young Wizards that I will enjoy reading but I'm too afraid of being disappointed some more to keep reading.
