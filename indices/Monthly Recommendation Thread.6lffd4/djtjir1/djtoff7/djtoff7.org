All these have their good and bad parts, but overall are worthy of being recommended, imo.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid][/Time Braid/]] (Naruto universe)

  - ∑ Sakura keeps being sent back in time. Eventually she discovers that Naruto and Sasuke are also being looped in parallel with her. Sometimes some (or all three) of them end up in the same time thread.
  - + good fight scenes and character growth, good lore and naruto-verse magic exploration.
  - -- has some painful-to-read parts, some blunders made by the protag (IIRC), some readers have expressed their disapproval regarding some sex-related content that involves minors.

- [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RyuugisTheGamesWePlay][The Games We Play]] (The Gamer × RWBY crossfic)

  - ∑ one of the RWBY protags discovers that his [[http://rwby.wikia.com/wiki/Semblance][semblance]] allows him to RPG-ify the surrounding him reality.
  - + good fight scenes, good RPG mechanics (surprisingly, better than in any /actually published/ LitRPGs that I've seen so far --- which is disappointing on the latters' behalf), munchkining protag, good characters, good overall plot.
  - -- the story's too rushed, especially the second half where the protag gets too OP too quickly.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][/HP & the Temporal Beacon/]]

  - ∑ Harry and Hermione manage to create something like a game save checkpoint near the end of year 3, and then return to said checkpoint each time they die or something goes too badly in their current iteration.
  - + lore exploration, visible growth between the iterations, original developments in each iteration.
  - -- unfinished and abandoned story, some characters (e.g. Dumbledore, Snape) are flanderized into their manipulative stupid selves.

- [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ReZero][/Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu/]] (original anime)

  - ∑ an [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent][OYASH]] finds himself in another world, and each time he's killed he's being sent back in time by a day or two.\\
  - + an above average quality anime that's pretty entertaining to watch, has some good fight scenes.
  - -- still a seasonal anime, so expect for the villains to pick up the idiot balls \ villain balls sooner or later, for fanservice to be happening, and for troll logic and drama balls to be showing up from time to time.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter][/Many Deaths of Harry Potter/]]

  - ∑ each time Harry's killed, he gets sent back in time by an unpredictable amount.
  - + it's a finished story, the premise has similarities to that of Re:Zero.
  - -- too many idiot balls by both the protag and antag.
