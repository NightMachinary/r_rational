Goofy and ridiculous can sometimes be used interchangeably, but goofy has connotations of intentional comedic elements and ridiculous does not. To call Atlas Shrugged goofy is to imply that it's comedic, a farce knowing full well its own absurdity, instead of the deadly serious even if ridiculous book it is.

In either case, though, we've cleared up all the confusion on what you meant by 'goofy', for the purposes of the statement you made. We don't need to agree on what constitutes 'goofy' or 'ridiculous' since we have a clear picture of what you were conveying by it.
