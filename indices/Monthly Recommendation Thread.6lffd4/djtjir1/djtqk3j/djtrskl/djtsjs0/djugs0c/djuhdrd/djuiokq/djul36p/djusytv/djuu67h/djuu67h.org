I reiterate my opinion that, while the first half or so of /Chunin Exam Day/ /definitely/ is worth reading, the worthiness of its second half is significantly less certain. I also concede that the final, utopia-describing portions of /The Shape of Things to Come/ are somewhat boring (IIRC), and that the later portions of /Atlas Shrugged/ have some boring conversations and monologues.
