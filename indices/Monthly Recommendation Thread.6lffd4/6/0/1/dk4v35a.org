Thank you for your advice! But in fact I've looked through [[/r/noveltranslations][r/noveltranslations]] already, along with Qidian International, wuxiaworld, zenith novels and many other websites. It's just that I don't know how to find a translator who could also enjoy this novel. A rational fic like this is far from popular in China, while the amount of references needed in C-E translation is no less than HPMOR in E-C translation. I saw the recommendation of a similar fic 修真四万年 here and decided to have a try. Without target readers, I doubt I could find a translator...
