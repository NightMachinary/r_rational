[RT][WIP]Could I recommend a Chinese webnovel here? [[http://book.qidian.com/info/3406500][走进修仙]] (Approach Cultivation) by 吾道长不孤 is a great rational fic that deconstruct typical xianxia genre. In this novel, modern cultivators are also researchers. They study natural laws to strengthen themselves and do experiments on supernatural beings. Their society is nearly as enlightened and industralized as our world.

The protagonist is Wang Qi, who was a researcher at the University of Copenhagen with double major in mathematics and physics. After reincarnating into this xianxia world, he lost everything and depressed for years. Then he met modern cultivators, realized that this world is still logical while his knowledge of science could still be applied. Soon afterwards he becomes the most promising cultivator in his generation.

The worldbuilding of this novel is on a completely different level with typical xianxia. For example, this formula: E^{chi=mc^{2}} and the law that chi goes to where ordering degree is higher are the base of modern cultivation. The heart sutras and attacks are based on maths, physics, chemistry, biology and so on. Besides, unlike most xianxia novels in which "The whole world" is no larger than a planet, there are lots of alien cultivation civilizations in different life forms, and one of the greatest mysteries might have something to do with a certain Kerr black hole...

The story is also highly entertaining. There are powerful cultivators whose name and biography nearly identical to scientists in our world, and there are xianxia-versions of Internet, PDA, video games and even tablet games. You can also find a lot of short out to Japanese anime, science fiction and games, including Yu-Gi-On, Naruto, Jojo, Type-Moon, Karmen Rider, The Threebody Trilogy, etc. You will never find it boring.

Is there anyone here who can read Chinese? You've seen that my English is poor so it's impossible for me to translate my favorite novel. But if someone could translate it, I'm willing to help to the best of my ability.
