Travelers Gate was kind of a mixed bag in my opinion. It initially looks good because it appears like it's going to deconstruct the done to death fantasy orphan cliche, but then it embraces that cliche, and becomes exactly like a shounen anime in all the worst ways. I really, really disliked the way the powers evolved book to book, and how the house of chains became so ridiculously overpowered. It was his first series and it showed.
