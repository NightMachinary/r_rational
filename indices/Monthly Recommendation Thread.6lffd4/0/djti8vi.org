[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/192821-cradle][Cradle series]] by Will Wight. Western take on the chinese xianxia genre(Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon + Magic). Actually the only xianxia that I've enjoyed, now that I think about it. The only con is that the books feel short as hell. Not particularly rational. Highly recommended.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/40800-second-sons][Second Sons trilogy]]. It feels a bit like a desconstruction of your typical fantasy story, in that it has [[#s][Spoiler?]], and a fairly rational one at that. The only cons I can think of is that the political intrigue is a bit simplistic and the worldbuilding makes the world feel kind of small.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8680.Fierce_Invalids_Home_from_Hot_Climates][Fierce Invalids Home from Hot Climates]] by Tom Robbins. A hilarious story that's not remotely rational. A lot of the charm is in the writing and his descriptions, to the point where at times it feels like it's a prose-focused story rather than character-focused. Only con is that the story stalls a bit 2/3 of the way through.

Junk food reading(if you run out of stuff to read and that stresses you out):

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/200650-lion-s-quest][Lion's Quest]] series. Probably the best LitRPG I've read so far (not as big an endorsement as it sounds). Well written and addictive. The only character-based i've seen so far in the genre, I think. First book is very slow, mostly entirely setup.

[[https://royalroadl.com/fiction/8945/life-reset][Life Reset on RoyalRoadL]]. Another LitRPG, the premise being that the MC is trapped inside the game through a bug after being betrayed by his entire guild. I'd say its well written and enjoyable if you can suspend disbelief a bit.
