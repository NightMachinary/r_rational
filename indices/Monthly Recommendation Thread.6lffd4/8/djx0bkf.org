Let me recommend [[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/the-legend-of-sun-knight/][The Legend of Sun Knight]], or at least the first two volumes. As Sun Knight, the protagonist has a clearly defined persona to play in public, and the conflict with his real personality is amusing.

The series has an overarching plotline that kicks into gear with the third volume, and while it's not bad I think I got the most enjoyment from the first two.
