I'm sure most people on this sub have already read and reread (or watched and rewatched) Death Note, but if anyone hasn't, hop to it. I would say it's the archetypal ratfic, a story with a clearly-defined set of rules and an absolutely brilliant protag/antag duo who play a twisted game of human chess against each other. By far my favorite anime, and one of my overall favorite stories.
