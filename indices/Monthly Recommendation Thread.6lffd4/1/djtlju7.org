[[http://www.themixedsix.com/][The Mixed Six]] is, hands down, my favorite podcast. It's two highly educated nerds (and sometimes their producer) drinking six craft beers and having six intellectual conversations about subjects both serious and silly. They're both funny, very clever, and highly articulate even while inebriated. They fully admit that this podcast exists so they can make money off of their alcoholism, and I happily donate money to their [[https://www.patreon.com/themixedsix][Patreon]] for extra content because I love listening to them talk even when I /vehemently/ disagree with what they say.

I was introduced to the podcast because one of the hosts (Caleb) and the producer (Ross) are part of [[http://actualplay.roleplayingpublicradio.com/the-best-of-rppr-actual-play/][Role Playing Public Radio]]. Caleb ran my favorite games and always played my favorite characters, and he is quite a character himself. I would describe him as a rationalist who devoutly believes that humans, himself included, are inherently irrational and never can completely overcome our biases. As a result, he is a person who believes himself to be a little bit insane and embraces it as part of who he is, which I find very interesting even when I disagree with him.

The other thing I know Caleb for is his new indie tabletop RPG [[http://redmarketsrpg.com/][Red Markets]], where he combines the zombie apocalypse and economics to tackle subjects that are all too real and too rarely examined: The horrors of systemic poverty, institutionalized exploitation, the conflict between moral values and incentivized behavior, and humanity's penchant for self-destructiveness. If you want to listen to the game in action, RPPR has posted two full campaign recordings with Caleb as [[http://actualplay.roleplayingpublicradio.com/the-brutalists-a-red-markets-beta-campaign/][the GM]] and [[http://actualplay.roleplayingpublicradio.com/fallen-flag-a-red-markets-campaign/][a player]]. If you're an aspiring game designer yourself, I recommend their series [[http://slangdesign.com/rppr/2013/09/game-designer-workshop/game-designer-workshop-episode-1-concept/][Game Designers Workshop]] where you follow the creation and publication of Red Markets at every single step of the process.
