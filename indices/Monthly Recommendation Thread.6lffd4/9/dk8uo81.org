Just finished the conclusion (for now) to R. Scott Bakker's The Second Apocalypse series [consisting of The Prince of Nothing trilogy and its sequal The Aspect Emperor quadilogy). It is ... amazing. A masterpiece. A first course in nihilism told through the lens of high fantasy, writ in a world where redemption itself is an atrocity, salvation's meaning obscured between an impossible choice between warring obscenities. The titular character is (very minor spoilers) the best rendition of a not-entirely-value-aligned superintelligence - in fact, I recently read [[https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/6leoub/the_case_for_superintelligence_competition/][this comment]] by [[/u/works_of_memercy]] and it brought to mind nothing so much as this series.

  And that has a literal, almost technical meaning rather than being a figure of speech: the idea is that the AIs would be able to understand human motivations from observation totally. Like, you study ants. You learn that ants are attracted to sugar, you learn all the pheromones ants use to direct other ants to sugar. You understand ants completely, meaning that from observing an ant you can construct a model of an ant that has 99.9% predictive power, all in your mind, it's simple, they want sugar, they mark pathways with pheromones, they react this way or that to pheromones. You can say, OK, I put a piece of sugar here and the ants would go for it, then I'll let them take it back to the nest and mark the way, and then I'm going to put a Spike Pit of Death on that way, but I would allow a diminishing number of ants to return with sugar, exactly as many that would be necessary to keep that route being their preferred route. None of the ants' interesting evolutionary adaptations would help them, because you understand every adaptation and know how to counter it in advance.

The book is heavy on the world building, and this means heavy on lists of names, lineages, and locations. The author has stated he wanted to write something in the style and heft of the Old Testament - each of the author's choices is with purpose, and rewards. I cannot recommend it highly enough.
