Welcome back!

There's plenty of limitations you can throw at an earthbender, like skill in shaping, aiming accurately at an active enemy combatant's feet (small surface area), difficulty of bending earth into spikes quickly enough, enemy tactics against a known earthbender (constant movement / keep earthbenders' feet off the ground -relatively easy for a firebender), line of sight limitations (blind/hide with fire).
