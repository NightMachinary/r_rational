Thanks for replying. I guess I'll go with skill in shaping, aiming accurately, and line of sight. It's just I saw the scene where Toph fought Aang and other Earthbenders and she was summoning spikes and different shapes the entire time.I thought every Earthbenders could do that considering she could do it at 12 but I suppose she's also a prodigy.
