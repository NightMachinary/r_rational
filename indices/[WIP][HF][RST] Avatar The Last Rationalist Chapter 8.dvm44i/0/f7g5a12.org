I think the problem you may have is in perspective. 90% of the earthbending you see in Avatar is from Toph, who is an earthbending genius, or Aang, who eventually becomes one. [[https://youtu.be/t6ISa9pUEN8?t=370][This video]] (started at a relevant timestamp) seems to imply that your average earthbender has more difficulty with fine shaping--they can pull up rock in "natural", square or circular shapes, but anything more complex like that looks like it's already pre-cut. They also only manipulate earth pretty close to their feet before shooting it out, which could imply that actively shaping further off earth is an advanced technique.

So it may well be that the kind of instantaneous fine shaping that those two pillars of earthbending can do is just straight up impossible for the normies. Most other earthbenders shown also only can shape one piece of earth at a time, so maneuvers like making an instakill bear trap would be impossible for a singular bender, setting aside the possible distance issue.
