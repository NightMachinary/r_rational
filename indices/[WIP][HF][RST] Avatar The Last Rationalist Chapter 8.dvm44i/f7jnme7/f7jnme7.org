I'd have to agree with all the other posts pointing out skill in shaping. Not to put too fine a point on it (cough) but think about the shape of a spike of rock jutting from the ground. It starts with a small, sharp cone which widens to a solid base. Consider how difficult that would be to perform compared to a square or round protrusion of constant section. The wide, solid base would need to push up through the ground, displacing or bending the surrounding dirt, while creating a vacuum behind unless additional bending were to create vents. So either one extremely powerful thrust of bending or two or three separate bending efforts. All that along with correct aiming, fine shaping, and enough power left over to do damage.

Theory about why there are those pre-defined shapes (most often a circle with a square in the center, earth nation symbols) that seem to be preferred by regular earth benders: perhaps the surrounding material is some very porous dirt or gravel or even finely shaped stones with vents to alleviate the vacuum issue. The shape could also be pre-bent into the short cylinders so all the bender needs to do is lift the stack and take the next slab. Come to think of it, spurs of rock would need to be bent under the stack to keep it from falling back down.

Earth bending seems to have a lot of mechanics that require thought to appear as it does in the show, much more than the other elements. Not necessarily power or control, just sheer mechanics.
