Story still pretty good and still lots of things going on in background. Am looking forward to more chapters! And more thinking lessons and stuff, really like Zuko experimenting.

As for Earth bending limits I would say it come down to control and speed, remember that in the show people either manage to avoid rocks coming at them or tank the effort, same here but with IRL combat conditions, as in you cant really spend time on fine details like turning ground under enemies into quick sand (like Bumi) or spikes unless you got time or really good skills, otherwise you get taken out by a quick flame jet or water whip or rock.
