Welcome back. I'm really craving more :)

I think the energy has to travel from the bender or just like a projectile/wave. I like to think of bending as being to project "hands" around your body that can effect the element. The size of the hands and the distance they can be projected can be individual traits that can be developed over time, but some people have genetic advantages.

Also, the hands can do things like push and pull with a different shape. Because of the angle required to pull or push spikes under your enemy, the force required would be like shutting a door by applying force near the hinges. Possible, but difficult.
