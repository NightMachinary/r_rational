Your scenario requires some extreme leaps of logic and events that could never happen in our world.

People don't just IPO ideas, stock prices don't rise that quickly even if the algorithms saw an advantage in them doing so, because of how they work and how risk / reward is calculated.

By the time we had perfect information algorithms trading in our markets which is never, but let's assume near perfect then, we'd have ai automated hiring if there was still a need for people to work by then.

And you should also keep in mind, most business are small and private, they couldn't care less about stock prices. We just get this skewed view of public companies as being more relevant than they are because they are public companies and therefore more media attention is put into them.

> If you have significant number of people spending a significant amount of their disposable income at McDonalds, then in the long run you've got a very advanced McChicken.

This is just incorrect, things don't improve because they are popular or good products. To improve you have to risk it getting worst because that's how you improve, by testing different methods.

If you are winning you have no reason to take the risk for a marginal improvement, and you have even less reason to allocate the time and resources to seek said improvement, because you're already winning.

Winning harder is not the goal, the goal is to win with the lowest possible costs so you can have the highest possible profits.

> So, when some sociopath corporate guy with a drone fetish comes up with the idea to manufacture lethal drones to use against civilians?

This never happens because we have something called laws, regulations, rules, governments, UN intervention...

And even in the impossible scenario that it did pass through all these obstacles it would last long because civilians would destroy it themselves. 5 dudes that had family killed by drones; bomb the business, kill it's leadership etc. This is far more likely to happen than anything else that would have to happen to create said scenario in the first place.
