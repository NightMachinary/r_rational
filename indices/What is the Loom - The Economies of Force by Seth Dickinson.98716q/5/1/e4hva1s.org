My interpretation of the story was that the Loom was an idea. Something that our brains would interpret as being incontrovertible. A truth hard-wired so deeply into the structure of the brain that no argument could possibly reach out or change it once it was activated, and, once activated, people would have the urge to spread the good news, by force and revolution if necessary. And whatever the idea at the heart of the Loom is, it's clear that people are willing to die for it.

Whether said "truth" is actually true or just a logical fallacy that can't be thought past by a human brain isn't made clear by the story.
