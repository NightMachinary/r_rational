I agree with you. Like I said, that was not my point to begin with.

This is besides the point but maybe you should check out rational optimist. Basically it's a book about how things are getting better in our world.

Of course that doesn't mean bad things stopped happening, it just means that statistically speaking less bad things are happening on average than they did in the past. And the trend is for it to continue.
