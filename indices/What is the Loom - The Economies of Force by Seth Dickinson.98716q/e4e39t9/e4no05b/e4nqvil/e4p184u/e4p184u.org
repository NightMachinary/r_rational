  Sure I shouldn't have said never, but it's very unlikely to happen.

this is naive first world upper middle class thinking, unfortunately. A lot of us grew up in very stable feeling environments. Things were mostly peaceful, mostly prosperous, mostly orderly and law abiding.

Most of the world and history isn't like that. Most of it is full of people killing the shit out of each other for some resources or land or political influence or slaves or religious conflicts.

If you think this stuff isn't going on, that corporations aren't abusing the environment and their customers and poor developing countries to the full extent they can get away with you aren't paying attention. And yes that includes killing people, even today, even in the US, even though there are laws, and they are getting away with it.
