My interpretation of the story was that the Loom was some kind of rival network. The author of the story repeatedly mentions fractals, and in fractal geometry, similar patterns recur at progressively smaller scales. I thought the ending of the story was basically implying that the "competitive model" of Rade's world, with its trading algorithms and so on, was also occuring at a higher meta-level between the drone network and the Loom network. Whereas the drone network is portrayed as uber-capitalistic, I interpreted the Loom network as more socialistic (although that was left kind of unclear and I might be reaching).
