Humans are black box neural-network intelligences as well, just natural instead of artificial.

Corporations can be thought of as limited-liability neural-network-guided paperclip maximizers, where paperclips = profit. As the Grenfell Tower fire illustrated, the difference between £24 per square meter for fire-resistant materials and £22 for combustible materials can be enough for human profit-optimizers to decide to drastically increase the odds of letting the building and its occupants burn to death to save a little money.

AI is not scary because it might kill us or let us die for profit. We're already dealing with that from other people. AI is scary because it can do it better. Because it can replace us. And because it will disregard our lives once we're no longer needed. Profit is just another type of paperclip.
