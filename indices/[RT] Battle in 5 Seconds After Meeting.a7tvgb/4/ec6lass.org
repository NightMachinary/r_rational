The writing is very heavy handed, it took me a bit to realize that the text bubbles must be read right-to-left despite being in English and therefore the individual bubbles being left-to-right, and the art is frequently confusing, but I got the gist. I would have stopped reading much earlier except that I wanted to know what his ability is.
