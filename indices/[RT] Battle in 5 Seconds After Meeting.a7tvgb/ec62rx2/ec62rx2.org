Thanks for the recommendation! Binge read what's there so far and bookmarked for later. I think the series has potential so it'll interesting to see how it shapes up. Also has one of the more interesting main character abilities I've seen. One thing I don't appreciate is the unnecessary fan-service stuff it has going already, but I guess I can put up with it as long as it doesn't get worse.
