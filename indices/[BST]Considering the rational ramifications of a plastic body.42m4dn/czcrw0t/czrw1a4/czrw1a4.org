I have been considering weaknesses and limitations for him. Heat, for instance, weakens him greatly. Solvents can kill him in sufficient quantity. Sufficiently intelligent and prepared normal humans could give him a hard time. That's not to say normal humans will normally be a challenge to him, but it's very plausible. I had considered him as an amoeba body with enough control to appear human. The idea of organs that are important and susceptible to injury is definitely worth thinking about.
