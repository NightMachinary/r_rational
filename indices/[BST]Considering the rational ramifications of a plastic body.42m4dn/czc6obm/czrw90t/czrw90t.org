Firstly, I understand your concern, but I believe you are reading the rules too strictly here. You are suggesting an irrational approach to story writing. Almost every successful writer will happily tell you that starting to write before brainstorming leads to writing garbage at worst, or taking a MUCH longer time to write something good at best.

There is a section under posting tags [BST] and I used it. I have been musing about this story in my head for more than a year. It will be happening. After 'Set In Stone' is edited. The editing of that book has been delayed due to my leaving the house for two months, and bringing a Scrivener file with me that was not the correct version. I have about three or four weeks before I can do anything except brainstorm.

Please excuse missing letters - I'm using a horrible laptop.
