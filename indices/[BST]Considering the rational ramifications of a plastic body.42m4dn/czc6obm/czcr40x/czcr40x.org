Farmerbob1 has written and submitted some extremely good rational fiction so far, (ever read Symbiote?) I'm inclined towards giving him the benefit of the doubt. I think it's far more likely than baseline that a thing he proposes will end up existing.

Edit: That, and he should have an exemption ready for his last published chapter.
