I think you should write and post some /finished rational fiction/ - a first chapter, prologue, snippet, whatever (doesn't need to be a full story) - before brainstorming posts.

This is a sub for *rational fiction*, not ideas for something that may or may not ever be written. Please see the rules in the sidebar.
