He can give himself the rough outline of a human body implies he doesn't start with the rough outline of a human body. Mr Fantastic's base form is human, can this character just shift around his base form? He sounds almost more like a plastic ooze.

When you say, he has loose control is that as in broad control? He just lacks the detail work? He can still stretch limbs? Go under doors? Flatten himself and pretend to be the carpet only to rise up and devour whoever stands on him?

Is he essentially !superhero [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blob][The Blob]]? Cause I'd totally read that.
