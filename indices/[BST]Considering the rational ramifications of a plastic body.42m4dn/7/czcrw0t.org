  What do you folks think about the initial concept?

My instinctual reaction is "eehhhhhh". That's a tough one to make work.

The difficulty of damaging him makes it a complex proposition to put him in meaningful danger against a range of different opponents. It seems more likely that he'll alternately steamroll against people with no way of damaging him, and then in turn get steamrolled right back by people whose power hard counters his own, or end up in pointless fights where neither can harm the other. Tension would be very hard to make happen in either case. There is a reason why some of the best stories are about heroes who could theoretically get taken out by a lucky shot, for example in Worm or your story Symbiote a high powered round to the skull would have been all it would take.

I would suggest building in a core, a series of organs or something else that are vital to him and cannot be easily regenerated. Perhaps this is the part of him that turns food into plastic.

I am interested in the various horrifying ways a plastic body that dissolves people could be abused in combat. That seems like solid ground for munchkinry.
