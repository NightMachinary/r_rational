  He is always hungry. He has no limit on his physical size, but as he grows larger, his mental processes slow down, and he has less control over his reactions to hunger.

Am I misinterpreting, or is there the potential for a vicious feedback loop here, where growing larger makes him less able to control the urge to eat, making him grow larger and thus even /less/ able to control the urge?

I'm imagining a tipping point where his mental processes are slowed to the point where they are no longer an effective brake on the situation, and then he just mindlessly grows and consumes like an outbreak of grey goo.
