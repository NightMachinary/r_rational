The bad news here for your setting is that body fat has comparable energy density than gasoline (less energy per mass, but more energy per volume) and between three to eight times the energy density of gunpowder. Worse yet, a piece of wood contains more energy than an equal weight of gunpowder. Unless the burn rate (which is especially high for gunpowder - it mostly goes off all at once) is more important than the total energy available, the soldiers and the trees are going to be more explosive than the actual bullets.

So. Let's go with the premise that while magic can make a given fuel source ignite, it cannot make it ignite all at once (unless, as with gunpowder, the fuel source is inclined to do that anyways) and has difficulty in causing ignition comparable to that required to ignite the item normally. Aluminum is quite safe, trees are fine and people are fine if a wizard isn't setting them on fire right now, but gasoline is too dangerous to use and gunpowder is right out. This suggests that we're looking for an energy source which contains a great deal of energy in a vary small and easily warded space, but which does not release said energy very quickly no matter what you do with it. This suggests that we make the switch over to, god help us, radiothermal generators and betavoltaic batteries.

Consumer electronics are basically no problem. We have the technology now to run a laptop using a betavoltaic cell, and those are considered weird novelty items rather than a backbone of consumer electronics. Presumably in the universe where lithium ion batteries are grenades even if you /don't/ bend them, we'll have worked out even more of the kinks involved in their manufacture. Smartphones, streaming video and the internet are all still available. We probably make the switch over to fiber optic sooner rather than later.

Running an oven costs about 2 KWh per hour, and running an air conditioner costs about 3. A cheap strontium-90 generator (not the sort that uses a critical mass, the sort that relies on the fact that radioactive metals are naturally quite warm no matter what) can easily generate 5 kWh per hour with a 12kg machine over the course of a 25 year lifespan before you have to bring it into the shop to have the isotopes swapped out. (You would not do this inside your house because of the beta emissions. It's the sort of thing you'd wear a special suit in a lead lined room to do.) The average home probably still has solar panels on the roof as a supplemental option and to keep the lights on when the generator is on the weak end of the cycle, but it probably isn't hooked up to the grid, even on a local level.

An electric car wants around 80 kWh/h to use, which can helpfully be provided by a half kilogram battery that runs on polonium-210. This is actually safer than the strontium generator (less beta particles), but has the decided downside of having only a ~3 month lifespan between isotope replacements. Still, given the setting, it's safer than trying to use a standard car battery. I imagine most people will switch over to bicycles if they can, as radioactives are both scary and expensive, leaving them as a tool for the rich and powerful. Your Uber driver is some dude on a rickshaw, but he still has a working radio.
