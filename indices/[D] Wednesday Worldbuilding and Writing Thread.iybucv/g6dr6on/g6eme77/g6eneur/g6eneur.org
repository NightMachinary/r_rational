You totally picked out the largest major form of transport. Enchanted Bicycles. :)

People are safe as souls inherently resist foreign influence within their domain, a mage /could/ kill them through energy release immolation, but it would be less effort to just telekineticly stab them.

Thanks for the pointer on Wood. It indeed would become dangerous if the tree has died, so using it in construction is a bit of a no no. Although using magic to weave a still living frame construct would be workable for the super wealthy that like that aesthetic.

Thanks for the generator breakdown. Electrical Current is another form of energy that is very easy to screw with, but everyone essentially accepts that risk because well, its electricity, you kind of need it. If you don't have to worry about Warding your generator, you can spend that same money to maintain a Ward of your wiring, so I'll make use of radioactive decay generation. Thank you.
