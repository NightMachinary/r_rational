Magic makes it a /little/ easier to f*ck things up.A typical lightning mage with about 30 years training would be able to form a conductive link between all the electrical grid of a block of houses and all of its occupants and then violently discharge the entire current carrying capacity of that local grid directly into all residents bodies whilst simultaneously frying whatever parts of the grid they didn't want to keep for further defensive or offensive purposes.If you chose to keep potential explosive industrial components unsecured (as in, not magically secured) throughout a city, then it would only take a single fire mage flying overhead in a glider to essentially carpet bomb half your city.

edit: Mages are rare. But when a half dozen carefully selected mages can bring the infrastructure of a city to a standstill while killing a sizeable portion of its skilled labour... adaptions have needed to be introduced to mitigate such risk.
