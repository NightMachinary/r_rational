I'm pondering a science fiction background and could use some feedback on this: if you (a super-advanced race capable of moving stars and faster-than-light travel) knew the universe was going to expand forever and eventually everything would die, but you had the capability to reverse it, causing the universe to enter a cyclic state of Big Bangs that conserved energy practically forever... But the process would cost some appreciable percentage of all life in the universe... Would you find it rational to do so?

Assume the process is essentially indiscriminate and instant, i.e. you cannot feed only willing volunteers into the hopper. Your scientists cannot find any alternate means of preventing the eventual heat-death of the universe.
