I need inspiration for fantasy trees that have difficult or costly requirements to grow in a way that produces the highest quality fruits.

I have kind of hit a dry patch with my ideas and need new ideas to shake something loose.

The goal is fantastic trees that can be used to produce really cool stuff but won't result in crafters having entire forests of them. The trees will be used in relation to crafting in a VRMMO, so I prefer difficulties that are not necessarily hard game mechanics but not too soft.

For example a large thirsty tree that prefers blood over water and produces different fruits depending on the blood. Getting enough dragon blood for one tree is a rough challenge but doable, not so much for a larger group of trees.

Or a mangrove tree that depends heavily on the special qualities of the water. Getting a pool of special water might be doable, but a whole lake? Difficult.

Or a tree that only grow in the deep deserts in small spots where an ancient war has turned the sand magical. Those areas might only hold one, or very few, trees (leading to turf wars), and while shipping enough sand for one tree to be grown in a more defensible position is doable, it does not scale easily.

Or a tree that only grows on the floating rocks of high-level Splorgablorg, which means all kinds of logistical and defense issues, and no option to relocate to a more advantageous location.

I welcome any ideas!
