Some really good ideas that I hadn't thought of. I especially like the "magic feeding" one as it fits one of my missing pieces nicely.

The vermin has potential, but would have to be combined with something else to prevent crafters from simply planting the trees in regions that do not have the vermin.

Thanks!
