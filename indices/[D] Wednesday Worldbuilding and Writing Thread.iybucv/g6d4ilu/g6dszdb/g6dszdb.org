Also, just spit balling here.

If you want a foundation to form some hard magic rules off. A scientist could somehow definitively prove the currently laughable idea that quantum mechanics is the source of consciousness. They do this by measurably affecting quantum results with their consciousness, demonstrating a reciprocal relationship between the two.

Fast forward as far as you like, a foundation like that can be used to justify all sorts of energy conversion, redirection (moving objects, generating heat or electricity) as well as mind based powers (thought acceleration, illusion, scrying) and construction (matter reinforcement, physical property switching). You could build the system into whatever you wanted. Put in place any hard limits you want on the system justifying them as universal limits related to quantum theory.

I would happily laugh at and enjoy if the manifestation of magic users power in both its scope and scale was directly related to their psychological profile. All of a sudden the 'soft science' of psychology would become a geopolitical arms race to understand the human mind and how to shape it into the perfect tool.
