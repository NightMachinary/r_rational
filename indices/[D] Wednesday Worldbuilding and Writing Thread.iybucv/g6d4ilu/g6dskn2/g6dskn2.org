A lot of stories like this that I read have a very linear progression through the magical tech. A -> B -> C -> D -> E.

Whereas actual research, study and implementation involves unforeseen failure states. Dead ends that seemed promising before a fatal flaw was found. People getting lucky and stumbling across more effective methods than the currently accepted best.

In short, a golden age of magi-tech discovery would be messy, with many competing theories of the underlying 'truth' of how things work. Different people and thinkers rising and falling from prominence.

As an author you know how it actually works, try not to give your characters a clairvoyant homing beacon that allows them to follow perfectly in your footsteps.

Also, unless you have an underlying reason for it, a modern revival of magic would be a renaissance of global collective study and collaboration. There is currently in place a massive global cooperative community of scientists that would serve as the foundation should such a monumental discovery such as this take place. Some would horde knowledge, particularly if it was dangerous or affected their mind to make them do so, but the vast sum of current technical magic understanding would be a simple google search away.
