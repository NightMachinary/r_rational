One of my stories that I've been developing for a couple of years has a major conflicting intersection between technology and magic. Essentially, using high energy density chemical reactants in all but the most secure situations is suicidal because magic finds it laughably easy to prematurely detonate any such large densities of potential energy, often also diverting them along unintended paths.

The most obvious outworking of this is that modern ballistic weapons, while invented, are seldom used. Carrying around ammo is essentially carrying around a bomb that any enemy mage can detonate on your person from a horizon's distance away.

You can ward against this, but you need to be both more skilled, more powerful and have more time than the mage trying to interfere. In practice, there are more efficient uses of magic than trying to keep chemical reactant weapons feasible in all but edge cases.

I'm pretty solid on how this has impacted military strategy and all its outworkings.

Economically I could use some hole punching. What major industries become totally unfeasible due to the risk of energy sabotage. Some examples of adaptions already in use;

* All electrical grids are localised to at most a suburb in size. Limiting the scope infrastructure damage that a single lightning mage could do by violently discharging out the power lines.

* Most large scale battery use is stored kinetically, the most stable and least easily magically exploitable kind of potential energy.

* Heavy industry and manufacturing is typically done far underground outside the reach of a mage on the surface. Necessitating infiltration of a facility to ruin its machines. This hikes up production costs significantly, which is thankfully /mostly/ offset by magic. Things are not quite as cheap as they are in our world however due to the flow on economic effects.

* When use of chemical reactants is just too useful to replace, efforts are focused on Information Security, both through standard measures and magical Warding against detection. So while the technology is still used a lot more than the public is aware, it is on a strictly need to know basis (especially strict, given that every person that knows about it makes it easier to find through magical scrying).

What other major adjustments would society as a whole need to make? Magic allows for improvements in efficiency, storage and overall maintenance that could render obsolete replacement technologies back to being viable. Solutions that rely on a complete magical replacement are nearly as vulnerable as what they are replacing, so would only be used to do something that technology literally cannot, and even then, only if it was entirely necessary to remain competitive economically or militarily.
