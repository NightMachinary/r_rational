The [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Erythrina_lysistemon%2C_habitus%2C_Uniegeboutuine%2C_a.jpg][Greater Mophete]] is a large woody tree popular among craftsmen for the numerous and nearly indestructible spines which grow inside the fruit. Unfortunately, this species only pollinated by the Dire Hummingbird, a highly territorial species which requires several acres of [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Lonicera_sempervirens_close_up_bloom.JPG/1024px-Lonicera_sempervirens_close_up_bloom.JPG][Bloomtide Creeper]] vine or similar as a supplementary nectar source. Care should be taken to periodically purge the creeper groves of any insects greater than 20cm in length, as these compete with the Hummingbird for nectar and may injure it during feeding if allowed to excessively colonize the Bloomtide Groves.
