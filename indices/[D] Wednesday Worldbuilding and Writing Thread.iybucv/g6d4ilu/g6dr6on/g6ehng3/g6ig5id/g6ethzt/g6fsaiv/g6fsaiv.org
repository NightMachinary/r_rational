A tree that takes in large quantities of air pollutants in order to produce beautiful crystalline 'fruit' that are valuable for the industry which happens to create those pollutants. Unfortunately, each tree creates a 'dead-zone' of pollutant-free air wherever they are planted, meaning that forests are essentially impossible to create in a way that leads to high-quality crystals. Additionally, the industry needs to cluster in order to produce enough of the pollutant for a single tree, so evenly spaced fields with small clusters in each area won't work out. Whether the feedback loop is by design or an unforeseen consequence of evolution is unknown.

A tree that walks on its roots, with animal intelligence, and is /extremely/ territorial. Any interaction between two members inevitably results in one dying in the fight and the other succumbing to its wounds soon after. Alone, they are rowdy, but can be coaxed into letting their wondrous leaves be harvested in small amounts. Unfortunately, the trees have remarkable senses - and if they can detect the presence of another of their kind for miles around, they'll go out of their way to combat them. Additionally, if they're constrained artificially, they'll die.

A tree which can grow in a variety of locations. Its sap can be distilled into a reflective liquid that is ideal for divination and precognition. However, said liquid only enhances those skills for the place of harvesting - divination only looks there, and precognition can only be performed there. Additionally, if multiple trees are planted close by each other, the visions their sap allows for become muddled, almost as if they're trying to show multiple futures or locations at once in a way that makes it incomprehensible. Thus, while it is possible and plausible to have a lot of the trees all in one location with a bit of maintenance, the act of allowing it makes the desired product useless.

Hope these ideas help!
