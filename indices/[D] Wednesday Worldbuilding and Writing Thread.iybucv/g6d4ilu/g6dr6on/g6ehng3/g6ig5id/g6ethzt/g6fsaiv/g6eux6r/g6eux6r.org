The tree could be vulnerable to some sort of vermin. Sure, perfectly healthy magic trees could produce the best magical staves. But ones riddled with magic eating termites?

Or magic eating parasitic vines.

Or the creature could be perfectly fine with the trees, using them to aid in breeding, but is a vermin to other areas, causing the people in those areas to want to destroy forests.

Or those people could just be Anti-magic luddites and could try to spray magic devouring herbicide on large concentrations of the tree.

Alternatively, growing trees could just grow slowly and tiny: A magical bonsai, as opposed to a magical poplar or magical seqouia.

If magical quality is proportional to age, you can HAVE entire forests planted, but they'll be for low grade single year items, not for high grade 300 year old items.

If the tree sucks up ambient magic as part of its own feeding cycle, concentrating it for powerful items, it may simply be impossible to grow them too close together: It would be like having two normal trees to close, where one grows a bit faster and then it's shade takes up too much of the sunlight the other tree needs to live.

But if it sucks up the ambient magic for miles around, any creatures or casters that also use ambient magic might not take kindly to a tree in the area sucking up a resource they were planning to use and might try to destroy them.
