You also want them to be magical, and carry weight, so.. Grave Trees. they only grow on grave sites, take centuries to grow, cutting them down is a no-no, only careful harvesting of branches, and the wood only keeps its properties if worked by descendants of the dead. I am here assuming you just want to keep items of this kind moderately scarce, and not the sole-province of kings or the like. This way, the game keeper can have a magic bow, but it is not something s/he picked up in a shop, it is /important/ to said game keeper, and he or she wont have half a dozen magic items unless they are the solve survivor of a bloodline that got nearly annihilated
