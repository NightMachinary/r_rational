Depending on how MMO-y you're going, I could /definitely/ see the *Nine Wise Hazels* working out really well, since they're essentially a leaderboard, but with the bonus that it's possible to sabotage other players.

If you're going especially MMOish, with a bunch of frequently-respawning mobs that one must grind, you could probably pull off a variant of the *Wraith Banyan* that's dependent on those mobs (and disrupted by players grinding)
