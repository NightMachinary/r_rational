The *Imperial Poplar* is the single specific tree which is heir to the Throne of Aspen, having reigned from its home at the Garden House in Cumberance, West Cornalia for the past 129 years. Upon its death, long may that day be delayed, all of its titles and magical potency shall be transferred to its heir through the traditional method of lineal primogeniture. To this end, Garden House maintains a dedicated chivalric order, the Knights of the Emerald Aegis, to defend against any lumberjack-assassins sent by rival claimants. Other members of the lineage have only modestly useful properties.

The *Nine Wise Hazels* are a set of magically created trees which endowed with oracular power through a technically simple but logistically demanding ritual - one simply needs to plant a hazelnut in the midst of a great deal of knowledge gathered all in one spot (in the form of written documents, educated scholars, chalkboards full of equations, etc.) and recite a certain well known poem. The trick to it is that the quantity of knowledge required increases by an order of magnitude with each new Wise Hazel currently in existence. As such, nine is not a hard limit, but rather the current world record.

The *Wraith Banyan* is a species of strangler ficus which is the unique beneficary of ectopollination, the fertilization of a flowering plant by ghosts. As such, it is only capable of being grown along the haunting paths of ghosts, a process which (due to the nature of the banyan as an epiphyte) first requires the growth of a suitable set of trees along the route of the ghost in question, followed by the seeding of the Banyan itself. Care must be taken not to disturb the haunting, as this will result in the Banyan failing to fruit properly if the ghost's haunting path begins to deviate.
