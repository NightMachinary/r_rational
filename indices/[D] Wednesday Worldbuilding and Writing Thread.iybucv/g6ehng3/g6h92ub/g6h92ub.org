First tree I was thinking of something along the lines of [[https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/pano-one-worlds-largest-organisms-dying-180970579/#:%7E:text=Weighing%2013%20million%20pounds%2C%20Pando,known%20as%20a%20%E2%80%9Cclone.%E2%80%9D][Pando]], where there's thousands of trees making up the organism. One of these trees would then be the origin tree collecting all the magic power from it's clones to create something of truly high quality. You can then decide on how fast a new origin tree spawns after the previous is cut down, and how much it's power should increase with age.

You could also draw inspiration from the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hura_crepitans][sandbox tree]] which has exploding fruits. The magic of the seeds could dissipate as soon as they hit the ground so you'd have to catch the 160 mph seed to get anything magically viable.

The Cerberus Saliva tree could be a tree that only grows in the den of a three headed Cerberus dog. The monster drools a lot from it's three heads and due to the magical nature of the saliva a magical tree will grow in any place exposed to larger quantities of it. Could also be some other monster that drools a lot, but a drooling dog is quite classic.

A Lightning tree could be a tree that has survived being struck by lightning three or more times. As it gets struck more times a constant thunderstorm will form around it. The storm could reach the power of hurricanes as the tree grows in power.

The Magma tree would grow in places that only has free flowing lava and an active volcano, maybe even in the center of a lava river where some of it has hardened to rock. The [[https://youtu.be/68Ix3YIhmlI?t=11][environment]] could make for quite the challenge to get to it and a a hazard in case of unforeseen eruptions.

I could probably come up with some more if you need
