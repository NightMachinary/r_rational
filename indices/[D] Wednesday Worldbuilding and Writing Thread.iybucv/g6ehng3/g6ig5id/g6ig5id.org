Having not read the other answers, apologies if I hit something that's already there:

- A tree that grows more powerful with other trees around, meaning that the limiter is that you want to keep them from going critical, so can't have too many together in one place at one time. If you want too many at once to be less catastrophic than my first thought, then you could just have trees that refuse to fruit when there are others nearby, which might be mediated in different ways.
- A tree that doesn't fruit without pollinators doing their work, where the pollinators are something rare and exotic, like a specific type of bee.
- A tree which cannot survive on its own, requiring specific flora and fauna to be planted/raised with it, in a delicate chain of dependency that's /just/ on the right side of feasibility. For game mechanical purposes, you could suppose that each tree requires a costly artificial biome of a certain size, expertise to keep it running, and a fairly large footprint.
- A tree that requires a specific type of highly skilled labor that absolutely does not scale well, for one reason or another. A tree that needs an opera singer every two days would be highly expensive, and opera singers are in relatively rare supply, with not enough of them to make a farm unless you start training them up yourself.
- A tree that fights others of its own kind, in some way or another. You've already mentioned resource scarcity, but I'm thinking more about the idea of adversarial trees that will make active attempts at killing each other, perhaps through spores, perhaps through poisons, or in some other way. (This would seem maladaptive on the face of it, but there's probably some way to justify it.)
- Trees that upset the local ecosystem to such a degree that you can't have more than one or two of them close by. Resource scarcity is a good example, but there are lots of different directions you could go with it. For example, a tree that takes in so much carbon dioxide and pumps out so much oxygen that three of them together can asphyxiate a whole forest of regular trees. Or trees that output hydrogen gas, which above a certain threshold will cause explosions. If you wanted to go really exotic, you could have trees that feed on gravity (too many of them and everything nearby will start floating), or that feed on time (too many and time dilation means that they never end up fruiting), or something weird like that.
