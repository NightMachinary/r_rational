  Does anyone know of some common mistakes that gets made when writing these types of stories.

I don't know about a common mistake in /this/ kind of "scientific advancement" story, but in alternate history stories it's very common for people to overlook how some obvious advances just...didn't happen at the earliest possible moment for one reason or another, and other advances were sort of happenstance and easily could have been delayed if the stars hadn't aligned.

So, the principle I'd take away from this is: consider leaving some low-hanging fruit that remains unpicked just because circumstances went in a weird direction for some reason (politicking, different departments or fields not communicating with each other, a crucial resource not being easily accessible, etc).
