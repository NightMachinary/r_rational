1 - Line up the hero's problem with the reader's curiosity.

If your hero doesn't need magic in their life, they might spend half the story not looking where the reader hopes to go. Don't do that. Make your protagonist need to go where the reader wants to go. Give them a practical need to go where your setting is coolest.

Obviously, there are lots of reasons to "go toward the magic." You can do a literal "magical investigator for hire". You could do "the city's new magic is messing up my job, so I have to look into what's going on." (Asimov's /Foundation/ does this, only with political changes instead of magical ones.) Or "I'm dating an entity from the magic dimension, and now I need to learn everything about his entire species": now you have comic romance. Or two-fisted engineering: "I'm refitting our magic-powered starship, but only a deal with a demon is going to get us back to Earth before our oxygen runs out."

Whatever your hero wants, make it point toward the good stuff. That's easy advice in a fast-changing or magic-ridden world, where almost any problem drives your heroes into weirdness. But you're going with the slow burn; choose your POV so it won't mean a slow book.

Beware of protagonists who can get away with ignoring the setting you'd like to show off. Give them a challenge that /forces/ them to investigate.

2 - Develop your magical organizations, whether social, economic or military.

People are motivated by other people, and big discoveries breed big organizations. For both storytelling and plausibility, you probably want some organizations built around exploiting or investigating magic.

In mundane terms, who in this world is the NASA or the DARPA of crazy moonshot projects, and who's the Caltech churning out freshly minted magic-engineering graduates to work on them? What kind of work pays off your magic-student loans? If you have a crazy-bad job posting, what kind of magical contract work do you get stuck doing, and who is the scariest boss you could have?

In novelistic terms, who are your Jedi Knights, Bene Gesserit, Magical Girls Association, Hogwarts School, Seldon Psychohistory Foundation, Lunar Revolutionary Society, or Hunger Games Tournament Administrators?

If your protagonists work in organizations, it's a whole lot easier to hand them problems or bail them out. It also makes the world more believable.

Of course, your protagonist is probably in a /badly functioning/ organization, or else they wouldn't have story-sized problems. Classified information, budget cuts, secret conspiracies, who knows? But for you, the author, the bad personnel practices of a Hogwarts or the Jedi Knights may be just what you need to get your hero in good trouble.

Never underestimate the power of inadequate budget and excessive expectations to get someone into a hero-sized jam. (Whether they get a raise after it's over depends on just how badly functioning you want their organization to be.)

3 - Your magic will be as convincing as its constraints.

Readers' quickest belief comes for problems, not fixes. So the more time the characters spend working around the /limits/ of their magic, the easier it is for the reader to believe in the magic.

Of course, classic fantasy loves to make magic something the /enemy/ has, so it's always a problem, not a solution. It's no accident that Frodo doesn't dare use the One Ring, or that the tradition is "evil sorcerers and heroic warriors" and not the other way around.

But if you want the good guys to have magic, and you want the reader to buy it, figure out what the /limits/ are. Figure out why those limits keep being a problem.

Classic constraints include "magic causes madness," "magic uses an expensive power source," or "magicians are government-regulated and your protagonist has to stay hidden from the government."

Since you're doing an optimistic-over-time story, you might go with "power source." The spice must flow! The unobtanium must be obtained! And stop using up our limited supply before we get back to base, hero!
