I'm starting the groundwork for a story where magic slowly gets introduced to a modern world. The main focus is gonna be on how to use the increasing magic in the name of science to further the human race, but also how humans slowly expand the ways to personally use magic. In short, it's gonna be magical engineering + some action/adventure.

Does anyone know of some common mistakes that gets made when writing these types of stories.

I also haven't figured out how the magic system works yet, but it's gonna be on the hard side of the spectrum to help the magic science make some sense. Any ideas for this would also be welcome.

General thoughts on the subject is also much appreciated.
