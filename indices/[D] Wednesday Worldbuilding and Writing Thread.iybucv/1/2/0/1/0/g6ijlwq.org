Ah yes. There is plenty of motivation going around, society is rather fractured. Individuals being able to accumulate so much personal power without having to rely on institutions and rule of law to maintain it has not lent itself to the most stable of geopolitical situations. Sabotage from foreign actors is a consistent and necessary ongoing consideration in all facets of design and production. The primary goal is to make it more costly to try to infiltrate a mage into a foreign population than it is to simply deploy them on a battlefield. So, assume any low hanging fruit for damage, will be plucked unless secured.

It's hardly a day to day occurrence. But when one security hole can lead to decades of economic damage for the affected population, severe precautions must be taken.

My fault for miscommunication, people don't mistrust their immediate neighbors, but their nations.
