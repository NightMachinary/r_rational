Ease is not the question, motivation is. What you are describing is basically arson. And however easy arson is, it does not generally prevent us from building things out of wood. If you saw a real world city built from the ground up for fire-proofing to the extent that there was no wood anywhere, you would assume that something was really, really wrong, no?

A local fire cult, or terrorist org dedicated to burning the world down, something.
