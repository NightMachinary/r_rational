Hit the nail on the head. The people of this world would not really understand the concept of DEmilitarized.

Humanity has clawed its way out of endangered status tooth and nail in an immediately hostile and unforgiving environment.They are a strange mix of immense loyalty to the human race as a whole while being internally divided along geo-politcal lines. Often going through phases of uniting against an outside threat, before falling back into factional infighting.

So culturally, they take all these necessary adaptions as just that, necessary. It's honestly a bit fascistic, although in this case the threat doesn't need to be fabricated with propaganda because it actually exists.
