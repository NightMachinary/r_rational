I think that's all fine as long as it's established that for whatever reason, something like that has happened or happens often. Maybe the country or countries in focus are highly militarized. Otherwise it seems over the top in some respects.

I think IRL explosives are generally not that expensive to make, and as far as I know require minimal training and/or understanding, but we don't take special precautions against explosives in most cases.
