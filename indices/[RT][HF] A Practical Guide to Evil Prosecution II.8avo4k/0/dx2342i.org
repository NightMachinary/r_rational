I'm really liking how the heavens are being depicted. The seraphim's notion of justice is inhuman and terrifying, but can also see how it can be appealing. The benefit of justice without human flaws.

Seems like the Heavens in this world aren't “good” in the sense mortals see the world, they have their own separate and absolute notion of justice. More of an Order vs. Chaos clash, than Good vs Evil. Though Evil in this seems to be less about purely chaotic smashing everything than in most depictions of a clash like that. Maybe something more like nietzschean individual will to power.

I suspect from this and the prologue the Gods will be increasingly a part of the plot in this book, not just a background feature of the setting. It would be interesting to find out more about the gods Below as well, since they are often referennced but never really discussed. (Cat is surprisingly chill about her Power coming from an alien source she doesn't understand. That may end badly)
