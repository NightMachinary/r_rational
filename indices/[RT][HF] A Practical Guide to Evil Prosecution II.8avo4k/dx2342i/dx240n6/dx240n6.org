  More of an Order vs. Chaos clash, than Good vs Evil. Though Evil in this seems to be less about purely chaotic smashing everything than in most depictions of a clash like that. Maybe something more like nietzschean individual will to power.

I believe the author actually described the primary difference between Good and Evil as being society versus individualism. Heroes surrender their will and are empowered to help others, Villains reject all restraints and are empowered to chase their own desires.
