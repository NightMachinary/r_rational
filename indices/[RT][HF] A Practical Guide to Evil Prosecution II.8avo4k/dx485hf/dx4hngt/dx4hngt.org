That coin is the mother of all Chekov's Guns, though. And every time it comes up swords, as expected, it adds a little more powder.

It's pretty much guaranteed to come up with an unexpected judgement and go off at some point. The question is: unexpected swords, or unexpected laurels?

Unexpected swords could happen a bunch of ways: Robot Santa (all are naughty and deserve death), condemning a child, condemning Hanno, or one or all of his team (Bard sounds like a good candidate)... but that's not so fun to speculate about.

Much more fun to ask: who might the Choir of Judgement unexpectedly /spare/? Cat's the obvious choice, and thus should be discarded (I said "/unexpectedly/ spare," so she doesn't qualify (unless /that's exactly what they want us to think/)). So, who /else/ might the coin spare?
