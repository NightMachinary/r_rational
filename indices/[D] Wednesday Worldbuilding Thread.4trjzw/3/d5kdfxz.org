Anyone have any serious experience with higher dimensional math? I am looking to more formally settle an idea regarding spirits/souls simply being being material in higher dimensional space.

The issue is determining how many degrees of freedom are needed above the three spacial dimensions (and one temporal). Ideally they would be Euclidean as I understand the rules for that but I may have to change that based on how things work out.
