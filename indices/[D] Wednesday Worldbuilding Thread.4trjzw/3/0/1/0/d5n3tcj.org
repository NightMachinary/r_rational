  Yeah in regards to degrees of freedom I guess the main idea is that the asymmetry would arise from the interaction with the temporal dimension. This idea is that the spacial dimensions are biased by an arrow of time where as there is no such analogue in regards to the "astral dimensions"

OK I think this means you're choosing option (B). So you've got an nD spacetime that is symmetrical and works in a particular way, but then you've got this 3D physical world floating around in it. Matter particles are bound to the physical world by some kind of forces, while other particles (the ones relating to souls or whatever) are not so bound. Maybe you'd say that my soul is close to my brain.

  My understanding of higher dimensions is relatively limited as in my studies I kind of take 4D spacetime for granted as a matter of math (or once told how to handle problems there I can't say I could accurately extrapolate to higher dimensions as from what research I have done it is not possible to simply extrapolate to higher dimensions mathematically.)

If you're willing to learn a bunch of new maths to deal with higher dimensions, I'd recommend you refresh your knowledge of linear algebra (matrices, subspaces, linear transformations; you would have done some of this in your physics degree) and maybe follow that up with an introduction to Clifford Algebra. That will get you thinking in such a way that n-dimensional space is not much more complicated than 3-dimensional space. [[https://slehar.wordpress.com/2014/03/18/clifford-algebra-a-visual-introduction/][Here's a quick introduction to Clifford Algebra]] and [[ftp://www.biophysics.uwa.edu.au/pub/Mathematics/Alder/GeometricAlgebra.pdf][here is the course I learned on it]]. The author of the latter was a terrible lecturer but wrote excellent course notes. For manifolds, you could read [[ftp://ftp.physics.uwa.edu.au/pub/Mathematics/Alder/DiffGeom.pdf][these course notes]] by the same guy, especially Remark 2.3.1 about astronauts watching ghost penguins skating on the north pole.

For a less mathematical view on higher dimensions, you could try [[http://hi.gher.space/classic/introduction.htm][this introduction]], which is pretty basic but handy for writing fiction.

If you're interested in the higher dimensions in string theory then I recommend Brian Greene's "The Elegant Universe". It's very good, it's a non-mathematical book but it has occasional footnotes "for the mathematically inclined reader". The idea of branes would be especially helpful for you. Don't bother reading anything mathematical about branes at this point though.

  From the larger universe as a whole it could be treated as a point particle where as in regards to the local(i.e. microscopic) scale the dimensions would have some leeway.

I don't think this is an effective way to look at it. You wouldn't look at a line or a plane and say "from the 3D universe as a whole we can treat this plane as a point particle". The physical universe could still be very large compared to a being outside it, despite being a lower dimension. If you died and your soul escaped the physical realm, you and I would measure the same distance between Earth and Jupiter. It might take you less time to get there, but only if you're very fast, or huge, or if space is curved in a very strange way.

  My idea wth regards to the physical universe is that the degrees of freedom are only limited in motion sort of liek an atom bound in a molecule. The larger structure limits how it can move yet it can still vibrate in all of the physical dimensions(which is enough to move around and live etc.)
#+end_quote

Are you saying that the physical universe is itself a kind of physical object, and all the atoms are bound to it by forces? That seems reasonable to me, and consistent with the "brane" idea in string theory.

  Edit-to give a more precise description of my starting point I have been thinking of local motion as a perturbation to the larger macro scale stationary object(with regards to the three "physical" spacial dimensions) So in this regards I started from applying the method of perturbations from quantum mechanics.

That sounds interesting, can you elaborate on that?
