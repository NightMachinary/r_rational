Ah I guess I should reply to articulate the points a bit more and I have been able to improve it a bit thanks to your help!

basically the three spacial dimensions are identical to three of the astral dimensions however the physical elements are effectively bound to be static with all motion(such as inhabitants moving around). So to an extent the amount of variability allowed for astral particles is so large compared to the physical equivalent that the physical matter can be treated as a effectively static solution with some small perturbation terms added onto the static solution. (So basically starting with the static physical dimension tensor and add on a second perturbation tensor). Thus the distinction between astral and physical has more to do with the forces involved than separate dimensions(I had a bit of confusion on handling this part) The denizens of the world however do not make the distinction behind this separation however they view the astral dimensions as separate as they can not see the "astral particles" only feel their effects.

You do give a good argument why the point particle analogy wasn't the best analogy. and indeed this world would be organized around galaxies galaxy clusters and super clusters. The exact circumstances of the planet's location in the universe (i.e. a galactic merger event) would have drastic effects on the culture and religion of the world in question. (Astrophysics is my personal area of interest.) Basically from the perspective of the physical universe spirits/souls/mana if not interacting with physical matter via mutual forces could be treated as non localized as they are outside the arrow of time and thanks to heavily utilizing "spooky action at a distance" i.e. Quantum entanglement where two particles can interact regardless of the distance. This at this point would be relatively meaningless for the story world outside of several magics.

As for regards to Branes in string theory I do find the idea quite interesting however the so far lack of any, falsifiable predictions does keep it from being more than an interesting thought. It does paint a nice picture of dark matter though but so far it hasn't given any predictions that can really be tested to my knowledge. The similarities to be honest were not consciously linked to Branes however it is a very good analog to the sort of universe that anything in the story would happen in
