Yeah in regards to degrees of freedom I guess the main idea is that the asymmetry would arise from the interaction with the temporal dimension. This idea is that the spacial dimensions are biased by an arrow of time where as there is no such analogue in regards to the "astral dimensions"

The hope is to however ground and alter my idea as necessarily as I lack the viewpoint of a mathematician in regards to the viability of this. My background is a BS in physics so the highest dimensional I have worked with personally is Schwarzschild metric. Where euclidean geometry breaks down as it is too idealistic.

I guess I could say I am looking for a way to handle the complexity of higher dimensions in the simplest way possible. We have 3 spacial degrees of freedom but spirits need to have several unique degrees of freedom (including the ability to oppose the flow of the arrow of time) in exchange for only indirectly affecting the other dimensions.

The description of the physical world as a sub manifold is probably pretty accurate towards what I am trying to do however I don't feel I have a good enough grasp on that class of mathematics hence why I asked for some review from some with more experience.

The latter questions of trying to properly manage the interactions is where I kind of want to go but I don't know how many degrees of freedom I would need as I don't have experience with submanifolds really.

The current idea structure is that the physical world is being dragged temporally so anything moving with respect to those dimensions is dragged along with the flow. Sort of like a plant attached to a flat plane would be dragged along by the motion of the two dimensions of the plane but free to move in the third spacial dimension outside the plane.

My understanding of higher dimensions is relatively limited as in my studies I kind of take 4D spacetime for granted as a matter of math (or once told how to handle problems there I can't say I could accurately extrapolate to higher dimensions as from what research I have done it is not possible to simply extrapolate to higher dimensions mathematically.

My idea wth regards to the physical universe is that the degrees of freedom are only limited in motion sort of liek an atom bound in a molecule. The larger structure limits how it can move yet it can still vibrate in all of the physical dimensions(which is enough to move around and live etc.)

Thus in analogue the physical world would be a object with a vectorial direction moving in higher dimensional space. From the larger universe as a whole it could be treated as a point particle where as in regards to the local(i.e. microscopic) scale the dimensions would have some leeway. I am however not sure if this approach is mathematically viable(as I would not know where exactly to start calculation wise as it is above my mathematical background)

Edit-to give a more precise description of my starting point I have been thinking of local motion as a perturbation to the larger macro scale stationary object(with regards to the three "physical" spacial dimensions) So in this regards I started from applying the method of perturbations from quantum mechanics.
