you sir, use a lot of incomprehensible words. I looked up all the words I didn't understand and the explanations are almost impossible for me to understand (damn you, and your long winded explanations Wikipedia!). If it's not too much trouble could you explain some of the terms you use? I find this pretty interesting. Here's the terms/sentences I don't understand:

- so this confused me the most (probably because I can understand it partially while everything else I can't.) for the first part I understand the infinite symmetries for infinite space but not the part about no absolute axes scale or origin, can't you designate an origin? as for the second part not understanding the first part doesn't help:

#+begin_quote
  Euclidean space has many symmetries and no absolute axes, scale or origin. You can't point in some direction and say "that's the 2nd dimension".
#+end_quote

- what is the difference between space and time? You state this without saying anything but the symmetries are different (are we talking about symmetries relative to itself or towards other dimensions?).
- submanifolds (looked this up on wolfram alpha and all i got were more math words.)

Thanks! edit: still figuring out bullet points.
