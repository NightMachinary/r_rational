Thanks! I appreciate you taking the time out of your day to explain these concepts to a non-mathmatician.

I understand a lot more than before (not all, but that just requires more googling on my part), especially in regards to manifolds and submanifolds.

I've always found dimensions interesting ever since I watched [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyuNrm4VK2w][flatland]] on youtube. Sometimes what mathmaticians do just confounds me.

I remember watching some video explaining a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_w4HYXuo9M][problem]] in only three dimensions that I could just not understand how they could possibly come up with a solution, much less several. Though I do know on an intellectual level that they use math to accomplish this there is a dissonance on what I think math can do (basically caused by me extrapolating what math I DO know does.) and what it actually is capable of.
