I'm not entirely sure what you're asking, but dimensions are pretty much synonymous with degrees of freedom. A 3-dimensional space has three degrees of freedom, a 4-dimensional space has four degrees of freedom. A simple way to define the dimension of a space is "how many numbers do I need to find a point in the space?"

Euclidean space has many symmetries and no absolute axes, scale or origin. You can't point in some direction and say "that's the 2nd dimension". Minkowski space (3 space + 1 time) has different symmetries, there is a clear difference between space and time.

If you have a sort of 5D (3 space + 1 time + 1 spirit) spirit world, such that the physical world we see is a 3+1-dimensional cross section of that (technically, probably a submanifold) then you're introducing an asymmetry. Either (A) that asymmetry is a fundamental aspect of how space-time-spirit works, or (B) the asymmetry is simply a consequence of the fact that this physical world submanifold happens to be sitting there. If it's (A) then your space is not going to be Euclidean or Minkowski space, it'll be something fundamentally different because of the new asymmetry.

If it's (B), then you could make things work like simple 4+1 (or higher) Minkowski space if you want to. So at least you'd know how light works in the spirit world. Then you'd just have to figure out the nature of the physical world submanifold. How does matter in the higher space interact with the physical world in such a way that it /seems/ like spirits and souls, and how does all the regular matter stick to the physical world instead of floating away? It'd be really cool to see good answers to those questions.
