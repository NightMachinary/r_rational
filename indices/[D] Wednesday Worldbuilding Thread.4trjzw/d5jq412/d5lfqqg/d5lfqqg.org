Use multiple methods for maximum certainty, obviously.

Have the king seal an object in a jar; place the jar in a public place and guard it. He must later predict what will be inside.

The king invents a rule; he provides various nobles throughout the land with examples that fit the rule and writes some down. When he produces the rule, all can test that their example fits.

Have a secret sign that he must make once acknowledged as king, or you'll know it's an imposter and to go looking for the real king. Obviously don't tell anyone.

There are a dozen variations on "the king must know the password" - choose correctly from a bunch of objects, give the right response to a code question, know the way to unlock a code lock etc.

Have the king hold an in-depth conversation with one of five priests, randomly chosen, each day. Pick one of them and have her interview him on the day.

Come up with an amusing story and tell it to the king; make sure he remembers it. The story is intended as another password. Don't tell him this, and tell him multiple such stories, so it's impossible to betray under torture.
