If emotions are only partially in the soul, you could implement something like the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner#Voight-Kampff_machine][Voight-Kampff test]] to compare autonomic reactions (breathing, heartrate, blood pressure, sweating, eye-movement) to somatic ones (words, gestures, facial expressions). Instead of focusing on empathy to find vat-grown brains, the test would probably include emotional moments from the emperor's life and could be compared to his known soul's previous results on a similar test.

There is some risk a significantly traumatized emperor could fail his own test, so it might be best to include other methods as well.
