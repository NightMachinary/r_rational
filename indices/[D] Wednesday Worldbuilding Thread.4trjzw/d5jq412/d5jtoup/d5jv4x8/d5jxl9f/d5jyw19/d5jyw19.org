The solution that I'm currently planning on using is a council of 7 with at least 5 having to agree that it's actually the emperor. Didn't want to poison discussion by saying that outright though, and I think it's got its own problems to be thought through (such as whether you need to confirm the identities of the identity confirmers).

You can have a complex artifact stored securely somewhere, though the technology level I'm using is pre-computers. (If you have a post-computer artifact in mind, I'd still like to hear it.)
