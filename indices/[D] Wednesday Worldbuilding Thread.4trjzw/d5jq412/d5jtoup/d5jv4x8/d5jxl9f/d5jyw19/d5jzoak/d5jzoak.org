  The solution that I'm currently planning on using is a council of 7 with at least 5 having to agree that it's actually the emperor

Wait, wouldn't the emperor just execute the two councilmen who lie about his identity? (it might not be a lie if the verification is through personality tests instead of reciting passwords, but you know what I mean)

  (such as whether you need to confirm the identities of the identity confirmers).

If stealing someone's soul and replacing it with another one without anyone noticing is possible, then organized governments would probably have routine identity checks, so the vetters probably have to be vetted as well at some point.

  You can have a complex artifact stored securely somewhere, though the technology level I'm using is pre-computers. (If you have a post-computer artifact in mind, I'd still like to hear it.)
#+end_quote

What stops them from using written, sealed passwords? As long as the seal is easy to authenticate (for instance, a complex, unmovable, publicly visible piece of masonry inside the palace), no one will doubt the results no matter how untrustworthy the councilmen are.
