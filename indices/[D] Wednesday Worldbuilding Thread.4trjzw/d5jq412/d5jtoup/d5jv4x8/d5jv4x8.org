The idea has been considered in advance, and there are no ways of reading minds. (Speaking to a soul itself is impossible; you can only speak to a soul-body pair, as a body without a soul is vegetative, while a soul without a body is inert.)

The problem I have with call-response pairs is that you place a whole lot of power into the hands of the questioner, who can simply say "no, this is not the emperor" to get rid of the emperor, or can give the answers to some third party to take over the emperor's seat (or, if the answers aren't written down anywhere, simply pretend that the correct answers were given). Worse, there's a possibility that the emperor could be coerced into giving up his half of the pair if he's left alone for long enough (because souls can be taken out and put into different bodies, there are quite a few forms of torture available).
