Okay so to start off, I have only read one of your works none of the summaries for the others interested me it was called [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/two-bodies-one-mind-original.24622/][Two Bodies, One Mind]] I can't put in words how much I loved it. The only problem is that not many others shared my opinion and you abandoned it as a result. So with this story I'm hoping the premise will be similar i.e. it will be a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManIndustrialRevolution][one man industrial revolution]]. Anyways, onto my thoughts of the story. So the biggest thing that stands out to me is that you seemed to have not thought that far ahead. Not saying that you haven't, you may have just wanted to withhold spoilers but I still think it's worth mentioning what direction you intend to give the story instead of focusing on the beginning. Moving on, I don't really understand what connects the realities you said:

  When he jumped to that particular reality, he didn't jump into another Earth, but literally a different planet.
#+end_quote

From what I can take from this you're saying that realities aren't connected by branching realities but instead you have two different realities and in these realities they started off completely different (maybe branching off when the universe was created). Eventually an instance of the protagonist comes into being and this is what the shard latches onto no matter where and when in the universe it is. whatever the case it'd be best to make this more clear.

There are other things I can say but I want those things clarified first.
