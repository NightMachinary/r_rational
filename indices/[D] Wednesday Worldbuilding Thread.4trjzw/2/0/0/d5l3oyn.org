/Okay so to start off, I have only read one of your works none of the summaries for the others interested me it was called Two Bodies, One Mind I can't put in words how much I loved it. The only problem is that not many others shared my opinion and you abandoned it as a result. So with this story I'm hoping the premise will be similar i.e. it will be a one man industrial revolution. Anyways, onto my thoughts of the story. So the biggest thing that stands out to me is that you seemed to have not thought that far ahead. Not saying that you haven't, you may have just wanted to withhold spoilers but I still think it's worth mentioning what direction you intend to give the story instead of focusing on the beginning. Moving on, I don't really understand what connects the realities you said:/

It feels odd to write about a bubbly female character with social life, with a prince for a boyfriend. I am your sterotypical nerd stuck in his parents' basement, you know? Totally opposite of the rocket scientist girl. So...someone like it? Wow. Anyway, I abandoned that story because I do not feel confident in my understanding of rocketry, space program, and a whole bunch of worldbuilding. It's also abandoned because typical-me never finish a story, though I am now on the verge of completing a really badly written fanfic! Developing a consistent work habit is totally a game changer in how much work I get done.

Anyway, my story will take place in the same setting, with some names changes(Yipang instead of Jipang) and hopefully more developed worldbuilding.

It looked like I have not thought that far was because I am focused on developing only the first arc, worrying about everything else later. If I ever progress beyond the first arc, it won't certainly be a one-man revolution(or rather many-man industrial revolution), because I felt that is not a realistic or rational path. If there's a natural path, the story will write itself. I could hold if off for maybe a year or two before our protagonist caved in from pressures or someone else other than him disclose it.

/From what I can take from this you're saying that realities aren't connected by branching realities but instead you have two different realities and in these realities they started off completely different (maybe branching off when the universe was created). Eventually an instance of the protagonist comes into being and this is what the shard latches onto no matter where and when in the universe it is. whatever the case it'd be best to make this more clear./

I would say that the universe are completely unconnected causally? Universes are coming in and out of existence all the time. I don't have a full grasp on multiversal cosmology.

The whole idea is that given enough universes, enough matter and spacetime, there will be instances of our protagonists. The universe could be three billion years old, an Earth located in a double binary system, and so on. It doesn't matter. The shards all managed to find instances of our protagonists thoughout the multiverse.
