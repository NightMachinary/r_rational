Once again, building on a yet-to-be-revised badly written [[https://github.com/kiba/Writings/blob/master/gaia/plot.md][plot summary]] for a trans-dimensional story...

I am considering options to resolve the sheer coincidence of our protagonist encountering his doppelganger mother.

The best resolution I can think of is that it's actually peculiar to our traveler's method of travel.

When he jumped to that particular reality, he didn't jump into another Earth, but literally a different planet. That means he didn't travel into another universe that happens to just branch five second ago(or really just nanoseconds). That would be 'closest' if we take closest to mean the most similar realities.

Trans-dimensional bullshit handwavium rules doesn't do traveling to branching timeline. That is impossible. In that sense, for all intent and purpose, there is no other 'version' of our protagonist from a different timeline taking a different path resulting in a slightly different outcome.

It is technically possible to travel to an adjacent reality that doesn't branch off from ours, though it is very difficult to do so.

Most realities resembling ours have a difficulty rating of 10 out of 10. You would need extremely advanced capability in order to travel to ours...or there is somehow a process or a unique ability to bypass that restriction.

Our protagonist have that unique one-of-a-kind ability to navigate to worlds. He acquired a trans-d shard that allowed him to travel all the other shards, more importantly understanding the physics of how trans-d work, which allowed him to engineer the trans-d drive to allow him to jump in the first place. It is also one of very few shards that's actually in any working condition. Most shard are broken, sometime even driving their host to madness, or to the point of causing a failure cascade in a particular reality on a fundamental level. (No, there is no maliciousness or any sort of agencies. So you don't have to worry about evil space whales, but there is a need for a story of sort to explain where the shards come from)

Therefore:

- There are many versions of him across realities with basically the same base personality and DNA. The shards fuzzy match all instances of our protagonist.
- It isn't strange for him to repeatedly encounter his mother across realities as that where the shards are. Details can change, sometime dramatically.
- Travel will take him to places far and wide across trans-reality, and close to his reality as well as the shards, finite in numbers, are spread across reality.

Other than that, I don't have any concept for the background story of the trans-reality shard, or if different shards has different mechanics. I don't try to dwell too much because my stories tend to be limited to a few worlds at most, but I do feel that should be some kind of background.

One proposal in my mind is that the shard are created by a form of magic by wizard instance of our character as a form of 'fuck you' or a final desperation move. Or maybe he could have done it to gather power, reasoning that instances of individuals like him will eventually meet up and work to build an empire? I guess if the shard are broken, the process for making it is either flawed or rushed.

Anyway, I hope my justification for the sheer coincidence of our protagonist meeting his mother works good enough.

P.S. It appears that it took me thirty minutes to write this post? That's work, I guess.
