The symmetries I'm talking about are space translational symmetry, rotational symmetry, and time translational symmetry. The laws of physics are invariant with respect to translations and rotations. If you do a physics experiment in empty space, then you do the same experiment 10 metres to the left, rotated clockwise, and a week later, you should get the same results.

  can't you designate an origin You can designate an origin if you like, and you can then point in a direction and say "that's the x axis", and so on. But I could do the same thing in a completely different way and there's no way to say that one of us is "correct". That's what I mean by the axes and scale not being "absolute". Of course that doesn't mean that designating an origin isn't still useful.

In Euclidean space, we have what's called a "metric", which is basically just the Pythagorean theorem: sqrt(x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2).} After you choose your axes and I choose my axes, we can define the distance between two points using Pythagoras. Even though we have completely different axes, we will agree on the distance between two points.

Minkowski spacetime has a different metric: sqrt(x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} - c t^{2).} This gives us a "spacetime distance" between two events. Even if we have different coordinate systems and reference frames, we will always agree on the spacetime distance between two events. The fact that c t^{2} has a /minus/ sign instead of a plus sign is what makes time different from space in a fundamental way.

A manifold is something like a curve or a surface, or a higher dimensional surface. The basic rule is that the closer you look at it, the more it looks like a line or a plane (or higher dimensional equivalent). A submanifold is just a subset of a manifold that is also a manifold.
