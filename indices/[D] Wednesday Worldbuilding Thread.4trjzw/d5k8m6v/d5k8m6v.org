I'm in the process of practicing a lot of futurism for the city of Pittsburgh, PA.

As such I've been digging into the available city planning, exploring the city via street view, poking at blogs about how they hate the city. poking at blogs of people that love the city.

And just spending a lot of time thinking about my own (nearly twenty years out of date) impressions of that part of the country.

Anyone have their own suggestions or resources or anecdotes about Pennsylvania/Pittsburgh that would be useful to build a more accurate projection of the next thirty years of history for that part of the world?
