/As for the importance of thinking beyond the first story arc, I think it's really important for later on. It doesn't have to be anything concrete, just several directions you might want the story to go. I find this important because with my stories I find that if I have a direction that I really want to go I have to go another route to prevent plot holes./

/However, if you really are just seeing where this will take you that might not be necessary. It however bothers me a bit because you should be able to tell readers what your story is about, 'dimension traveling' is just a mechanic the way I see it what the protagonist will end up doing with it is what the story is about, but then again this thread is just worldbuilding./

What our protagonist will do with it is less important than what other people will do with it. We're talking about nation-state actors getting into the business of trans-dimensional travel.

The way I do storytelling is thinking "what if X happens?" and then thinking "Y will happen because of A and B reasons".

I write stories where the logical conclusion takes me.

If I try to say...force a direction, that will end up with a lot more work for me, because then I have to contrive a scenario where doesn't happen.

/This part needs more elaboration, I don't really understand what you mean by 'difficulty rating of 10 out of 10'./

You normally need sufficiently advanced technology in order to travel there, otherwise trans-dimensional travel is almost impossible. A shard open up that 'region' of the multiverse for easy travel.

/as for this part, I thought shards were just anchors to different universes containing alternate selves?/

Shards don't just provide anchor points, but abilities as well. Our protagonist cannot come up with trans-dimensional travel on his own.
