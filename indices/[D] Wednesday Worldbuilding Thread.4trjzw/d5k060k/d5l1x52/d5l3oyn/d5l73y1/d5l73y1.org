When I said I liked the story, really I only meant the premise because of how much I like that trope I mentioned earlier. the romance and gender confusion was just an interesting interaction.

I can definitely understand having trouble writing out a person that's the result of two minds merging and that's not considering creating factually accurate worldbuilding.

As for the importance of thinking beyond the first story arc, I think it's really important for later on. It doesn't have to be anything concrete, just several directions you might want the story to go. I find this important because with my stories I find that if I have a direction that I really want to go I have to go another route to prevent plot holes. However, if you really are just seeing where this will take you that might not be necessary. It however bothers me a bit because you should be able to tell readers what your story is about, 'dimension traveling' is just a mechanic the way I see it what the protagonist will end up doing with it is what the story is about, but then again this thread is just worldbuilding.

Moving on,

  Most realities resembling ours have a difficulty rating of 10 out of 10. You would need extremely advanced capability in order to travel to ours...or there is somehow a process or a unique ability to bypass that restriction.

This part needs more elaboration, I don't really understand what you mean by 'difficulty rating of 10 out of 10'.

  It is also one of very few shards that's actually in any working condition. Most shard are broken, sometime even driving their host to madness, or to the point of causing a failure cascade in a particular reality on a fundamental level.

as for this part, I thought shards were just anchors to different universes containing alternate selves?
