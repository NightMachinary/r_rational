Things you get from your body:

- Muscle memory

- Looks

- Some amount of attraction (pheromones)

- Some varieties of mental problems

- Most instinctual responses

- Sex

Things you get from your soul:

- Most emotions

- Rational thought

- Memories

- Some amount of attraction (intellectual)

- Some varieties of mental problems

- Gender

Souls by themselves experience nothing (since senses are biological) and cannot communicate (because they cannot experience or move).
