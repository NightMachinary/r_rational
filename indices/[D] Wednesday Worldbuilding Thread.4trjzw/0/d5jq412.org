How do you set up identity confirmation?

Here's the story so far: someone has stolen the emperor's soul, leaving him in a vegetative state. After some hard work, the soul has been recovered. However, because all souls look alike, it's impossible to know whether it's actually the emperor's soul without having some method of identity confirmation. Obviously it would be a disaster if someone else's soul was put into the emperor's body and they began to rule in his stead.

Ideally, this method of identity confirmation would not be possible to circumvent or subvert.
