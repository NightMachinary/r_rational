... Audience room. If you want to petition the emperor, you must wait there for seven days. No, wait, I have a better one - High-ranking marriages only have legal force if preformed by the emperor. You still get stuck in the room for seven days, tough. All facilities are arranged so that you can tend to bodily needs with a view of the room, and without technically leaving.

This means there is /always/ a crowd of important personages present, and it's effectively impossible to coordinate things so that all of them belong to any particular faction.

A third of the way down the room is a line which only the emperor may cross. 3 meters from the back of the room is a blackboard on a pivot. Before preforming the marriages that have completed the ceremony of waiting the emperor announces what is on the blackboard today, spins it to show the truth of that statement, then erases it, spins it away from the crowd and puts something new there.

For extra hilarity, it is considered very good luck to have your wedding day be one of the occasions where the emperor feels compelled to sweep the inviolate third of the Hall of Marriage because it's just gotten too damn dusty.
