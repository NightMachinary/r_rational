  Wait, wouldn't the emperor just execute the two councilmen who lie about his identity? (it might not be a lie if the verification is through personality tests instead of reciting passwords, but you know what I mean)

The emperor would have to be pretty short-sighted to do that. If everyone is going to vote "yes" out of fear of execution, then the verification council doesn't actually work. The council needs to be able to vote what they actually believe to be true.

  If stealing someone's soul and replacing it with another one without anyone noticing is possible, then organized governments would probably have routine identity checks, so the vetters probably have to be vetted as well at some point.
#+end_quote

I'm sort of on the fence about how often routine identity checks need to be done. Taking over a person's entire life seems like it would be quite difficult, since if you're the imposter, you need to know virtually everything about the person whose life you're taking over. That means a gathering a huge amount of intelligence. So maybe for people high up in the government, but I think it would be kept fairly simple, unless there's a strong insurgency that has a history of trying to take over bodies. There's a trade-off of security and inconvenience, not to mention that a culture of paranoia comes with its own costs (like false positives).

  What stops them from using written, sealed passwords? As long as the seal is easy to authenticate (for instance, a complex, unmovable, publicly visible piece of masonry inside the palace), no one will doubt the results no matter how untrustworthy the councilmen are.
#+end_quote

Sealed passwords work. There is a fairly significant problem of them only working /once/ though. For example, if the emperor's soul is taken and a soul is recovered that's believed to be his, once the authentication fails, the password is now known to several people and you're back in the same position of needing trust (beyond the trust you need to place in your guards and whoever is doing the verification to ensure that they won't make a new password with a new seal under cover of nightfall). Sending in a sacrificial lamb has a lot of costs for whatever conspiracy you suspect might happen, and you can mitigate the possibility somewhat by sealing in multiple passwords ... I don't know. It depends on how many levels of play and counter-play are expected, and which direction the conspiracy is expected to come from. (You don't just worry about those who would try to replace the emperor, you worry about those who would use an opportunity to get rid of him.)
