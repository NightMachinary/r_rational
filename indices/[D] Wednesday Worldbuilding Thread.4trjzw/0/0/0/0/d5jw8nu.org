The simplest solution would be a password stored in a sealed box kept in a secure enough place. You have the emperor write down his password, then you break the box, and anyone can check whether the emperor gave the right password. Add in a second coercion-specific password just in case, and you have a secure-ish system, especially if the emperor writes and seals the password himself.

Inventive solution, a bit more costly: recover the Emperor's journal. Have a trusted aide read through the journal, and designate a random event of the Emperor's life that he would undoubtedly remember upon prompting, but potential torturers probably wouldn't think to ask. The process should be done in a way that lets everyone confirm that the event does come from the journal, but doesn't let anyone but the aide actually access the rest of the journal. This one is less reliable than it sounds since memory isn't as accurate as we tend to think.
