Honestly when I reread the whole thing a few days ago books four and five both felt pretty slow. Book four less interesting because of the strange pacing (we go from fighting a crusade to dead King drama to forty chapters of the everdark that end pretty abruptly). But book five too just kind of went on - we had the seven princes and one then nothing much happened the rest of the book in the main story line (interludes provided a late amount of plot worthy content)
