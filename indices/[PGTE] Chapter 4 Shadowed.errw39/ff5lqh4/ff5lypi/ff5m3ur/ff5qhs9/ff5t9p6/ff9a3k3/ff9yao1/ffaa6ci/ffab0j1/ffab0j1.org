Cordelia no longer has political opposition in Procer. The Bard's ultimate plan to kill the Dead King has just been screwed beyond comprehension and we're all running around improvising. Kairos and Best!politician are dead and the White Knight is crippled. The Bard's plan was to use a sword of judgment to kill the Dead King and no one has any idea what's gonna happen if we use it, and we're likely going to need to. The Legions of Terror are mind controlled by Malicia are out of the war. Black has crossed the threshold and is going to kill Malicia with Rangers help. Scribe got fired by her waifu.
