I think Scorchio's death is an excellent example of what I'm talking about, actually. He was taken down efficiently, almost instantly, and Neshamah revealed a new resource in the process. He's taking actual existential threats very seriously and exterminating them the same way Black spent 20 years doing in Callow.

But he isn't putting the same effort into the war at large. He's being slowly pushed back into the Kingdom of the Dead. According to Cat, the Grand Alliance is seeing success on all fronts. Brutal, costly success, but success all the same. We've heared of a few Revenants like the Lord of Bones, but nothing he hasn't been known to use before.

He's had at least 400 years to experiment and develop, but he's sending the same Bones, Binds, and Revenants now as he did for Triumphant. And we know he has developed. Why isn't he sending armies of shapeshifting, amorphous undead who can eat an entire legion with barely any sign? That messenger Cat recieved back in Book 3 that impressed Masego so much, why aren't we seeing more of those? The seeded plague might be new, but a child with a barely developed gift and one unusual trick entirely neutralized it. /Neshamah isn't trying./

Just as the answer to the question, "Why didn't Voldemort owl everyone hand grenades?" was answered by, "He wasn't trying to win the war as Voldemort," the answer to the question, "Why isn't Neshamah using all his resources?" is, "Winning this war is suicide." The war is the play he's putting on, rather than an end in itself.
