I never talk about HP canon anymore because all the characters are idiots. It was still a relevant question in HPMOR, though, and should have clued us into his motivations not being of the traditional world-conquering type. I think the same is happening in PGTE. Someone known to have zero moral compunctions and immense power and intelligence isn't using his resources in the manner which would win him the war. Which means he wants something other than victory.
