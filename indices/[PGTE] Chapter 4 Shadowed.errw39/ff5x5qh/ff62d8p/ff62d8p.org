On the other hand, we get the benefit of only seeing the most important things that happen to Cat.

That priest had a perfectly plausible reason to be there; the vast majority of the time, when one of Cat's trusted subordinates is acting slightly unusually, there's a perfectly good reason and the subordinate is not, in fact, a shape-shifting undead abomination who ate the actual trusted subordinate and took their appearance. It's not like the priest wasn't part of Cat's group, or like she gave orders that nobody approach the Apostate.

Given that her only hints were "these people have ill-fitting clothes" and "this knight went into a fight I wasn't told about", she caught on rather quickly, all things considered.
