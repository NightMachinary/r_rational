It probably says good things about my narrative familiarity that loud warning bells went off in my mind when 'it' happened.

Perhaps a little odd that, once knowing both motive and opportunity, Cat couldn't guess (abnormally slow on the uptake) that the semi-major war asset she was escorting had been targeted in her absence until it had been pointed out to her.

Specifically:

Reader: "AHHH someone is doing things to the semi-major war asset while he's unconscious! Check that he's okay! ...What, he's suddenly barely breathing now when he was unable to sleep restfully before!? That's even worse! Why aren't you worried!?" --later-- Cat: "This man and the man who were doing something to the semi-major war asset just now are both TOOLS OF THE DEAD KING! Got it!" This man: "By the way, you seem completely clueless, but the man who was doing something to the semi-major war asset just now... DID SOMETHING TO THE SEMI-MAJOR WAR ASSET!" Cat: "What, he did something to the semi-major war asset! Oh NO! Curse my inability to put two and two together without being spoon-fed the answer by my enemy!"

(Actually, why give her warning and a dramatic standing-up at all, when the effect would be better with surprise from behind? What's the Dead King's game here, or is he being controlled by rules like the Fae were?)

In any case, more silliness before I end this edit:\\
"Hum! I realise now that you and that person who earlier fed me that weird-tasting soup were both assassins! Happily, while I still have my full health, I fear no enemy! Why are you laughing? What, you're telling me that that weird-tasting soup fed to me by that other assassin... was poisoned!? Curse the unfathomable depths of your scheming!"
