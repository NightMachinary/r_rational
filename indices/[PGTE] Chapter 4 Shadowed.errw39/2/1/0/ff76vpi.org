That's his contingency plan, I think. It's not a bad one, and keeping a constant pressure makes it possible for him to dictate terms of engagement -- just as the epigraph in chapter 1 said: /"“In the conduct of war offence is commonly preferable to defence; for in attacking a general acts according to their own designs, while in defence they act according to the designs of the enemy.”/ The Grand Alliance is dancing to his tune, and since this is still the early game, he can shape the mid- and end game as he chooses.

However, consider the raising of the hero with +10 sword of DK slaying -- didn't Scorchio fit that groove perfectly? Special kind of magic that seems to disrupt the Dead King's ways, a mysterious heritage and a magical sense for plague and plague carriers. Finds a tainted village at the last hour, sacrifices his personal looks and health to prevent disaster, then is found by the premium warlord fighting the Dead King -- who just happens to share about ten thousand plot-relevant points with the kid.

Scorchio was basically a dagger with "Kil ded king pls" engraved on it, handed to Cat on a silver platter. Promptly taken out at earliest convenience. At the perfect time, later on Cat and Scorchio would be surrounded by other Named and soldiers paying attention. Before Scorchio would have probably gotten away from a direct assault or even an assassin if sent directly at him.

It blew my mind to consider that /this is what he's been doing for millennia./ There have to have been dozens, hundreds if not thousands of Named rising from his atrocities and /he killed them all and raised most as Revenants./

It also can't have been 700 years, Triumphant was something like 400 years ago? Less?

In any case, this is his best shot in all of Neshemah's existence, probably the best one he's going to get, ever, with several of his enemies also being the enemies of the Bard, the political and military situations being what they are as well as the greatest Heroes being on the rise or past their prime. The Bard's greatest plots shattered, the nets around him gone.

I believe that Neshemah might be gearing for a completely /new/ endgame. Death ruling over Calernia, a permanent Creation-residence for him shaped from half of Procer, a completely new form of existence, something like an Evil Choir? I have no idea, but I think simple existence shouldn't be considered his endgame.
