The Dead King is taking a few pages out of Kairos' book, or more likely the Tyrant took a few out of his. Remaining alive as an active villain requires that you stay plot-relevant, and the best way to do that is to directly interfere with the main characters and make sure your interference is known. If you avoid the heroes, you're liable to lose relevance and die offscreen. If you infiltrate their camp and never make the infiltration known, they'll be discovered at whatever time is most inopportune and you'll not gain much. If, however, you create a dramatic scene where the heroes catch on only just too late and cackle about your brilliant genius as your newest minion rises to slay your pathetic foes, you remain /highly/ relevant without endangering your physical person.

Neshamah has survived this long because he's carved out a niche as the thing which goes bump in the night. He's the greater power which could always be behind any plot (but usually isn't), the nightmare whispered of in campfire tales, and the reminder that all humanity stands forever on the edge of annihilation. This is an incredibly safe position for a villain to take, as it requires him to take very few risks. He doesn't even need to leave his Serenity to maintain that story...except when it begins to fade.

At the beginning of this tale it had been 700 years since Calernia had last heard from him. His relevance was fading into myth, and so to prevent himself from also fading he had to remind everyone why the Hidden Horror is called a Horror. He'll prosecute a brutal war, kill millions, pick up a few new Revenants, and then retreat back into the Serenity for another 700 years, the myths sustaining his Role revitalized and his position as the Greatest of Evils cemented.

And so he's going to make mistakes. Obvious ones. He's going to play up the role of the fiendish foe to five ferocious firebrands, escalate rhetorical as well as military tension, and become remembered once again as the King of Death. Because all of this is an act. His victory comes in /losing/ the war, in his foes escaping annihilation by the skin of their teeth before he's forced inch by inch into retreat, pyrrhic victories for the heroes secured each step of the way. To win this war militarily would be suicide, as that would just guarantee the raising of a Hero with a +100000000 Sword of Dead King Slaying. Losing this war, slowly, and with great sacrifice from the heroes, will win the battle in the only conflict that actually matters to him: that for his own continued existence.
