I would heavily disagree with this. After the drow arc the quality goes up but it never achieves the peaks of the previous books. Its now on a downwards trend for me. I still read it but mostly because i kinda want to finish and see where it will go in the end,not out of my true interest. I am kinda disapointed that this still gets posted here. Its not even "rational" nowadays. Just pure narrative wank and it bothers me. While the comments are filled with fanboism.
