Unrelated to this chapter... I've just finished the first book and I have to ask, does Cat ever start using her position as Evil to do good (not Good)... or is this just a story about someone joining a conquering empire and then killing innocent people? As . of the end of book 1 there isn't much established arc for the protagonist actually having a net positive impact on the world.
