  But he isn't putting the same effort into the war at large. He's being slowly pushed back into the Kingdom of the Dead.
#+end_quote

Could be simply because of Scorchio, and what he implies. A lull in the fighting, with the living allowed to reclaim the ground, means that Named will be found there and then, instead of during a heated battle where they come from behind to save the day. It's as simple as controlling the engagement.

In addition, he's fighting war in at least four fronts, based on the Prologue. Or more. We don't know how much he delegates, but we can probably surmise some independence in his undead.

  He's being slowly pushed back into the Kingdom of the Dead. According to Cat, the Grand Alliance is seeing success on all fronts. Brutal, costly success, but success all the same.
#+end_quote

Debatable. Sounded like they're bleeding soldiers on all sides. They're not even in Keter and they're down pretty big numbers.

#+begin_quote
  We've heared of a few Revenants like the Lord of Bones, but nothing he hasn't been known to use before.
#+end_quote

Because they're too many to name. Hanno fought two interesting Revenants in Winter 4. Sure, they won, but they lost 20,000 in Cleves. With the Dead King using minor tactics and bottom-of-the-pile Revenants. Cat says straight off that if Razin and Aquiline meet a Revenant they're just dead.

  He's had at least 400 years to experiment and develop, but he's sending the same Bones, Binds, and Revenants now as he did for Triumphant. And we know he has developed. Why isn't he sending armies of shapeshifting, amorphous undead who can eat an entire legion with barely any sign?

Apologies in advance for wall of text.

- *Reliability.* Cat could have wielded a magic sword, or a crossbow or something /more advanced/ than a sword but she just wielded a regular blade. Why? Because it gets the job done, you can replace it easily and when you're expecting to fight Named, reliability and /inevitability/ is what you go for, not the flashy things, because they will break when you actually need them.
- *Resources.* If it takes him 1 effort to raise a troop of special undead and 0,0001 effort to raise a few shambling corpses, and those shambling corpses still kill some of your opponents, why on earth would you NOT spend less for more? Heck, this book started with the Dead King maybe getting a hundred or so minor undead behind enemy lines, they got into a village, slaughtered them all, raised and boom, instant army. Resources used: about zero. Resources denied to enemies: Some. Death and destruction: Gained. A few of them spreading plague for funsies, hey why not?
- *He actually does.* Cat mentions that there would have been massive casualties and collapsing fronts already. Who's to say he doesn't use those there?
- *Strategy.* You don't use your best foot everywhere. You have specialized troops for special purposes and have a generic approach for most situations. Case in point: Shield walls. Assassins, shock troops, fliers, Neshemah uses all of those, but they're force multipliers, not basic troops in an of themselves. His go-to tactic is the same Bones Ghouls and Shufflers. And why not!? It still works, and it would have eaten the north if Cat hadn't showed up.
- *Named.* We should always remember that Nessie is used to fighting a side with a large number of Named. That requires a special style. A basic pressure from zero-weight undead is more than enough if you just have enough of them. And Nessie certainly does. Named will get tired and make mistakes. All the while the regular soldiers are dying.
- *Morale.* How do you beat an enemy that doesn't stop? That just keeps coming day and night? That requires an iron will, and keep on doing that fight for years and yours will be sapped. Oh, and the /one more trick/ the Dead King has? Cat mentioned that horror is a pit, and the Dead King is slowly, inexorably, dragging everyone in it.
- *Each trick has value if played separately.* This plague thing is a bottom-of-the-pile zero-value fire-and-forget effort. Let's not forget the Dead King reminisced to the Bard how he was foolish enough in his youth to think that plague was an actual tool. His minor effort, low value off-the-cuff blow killed hundreds and could have killed thousands and ended any progress the Grand Alliance would have had for months if not a year. Neshemah can just go over his list of monstrosities slowly, each trick eating up a Hero or a Villain or a few thousand troops, all the while grinding away with his basic troops. It's a plan with inevitability, just the way he likes them.
- *Again, morale.* So someone sees a new type of ghoul or a spell or a revenant, it kills a few hundred or a few thousand /(heh, throwing that out like it's nothing)/. Then the next trick comes. And the next. And the next. It becomes a question of how many does he need vs how many does he have.

However, all of the above is chaff. The real reason he's not using super undead... is because he doesn't have to. He's got the Grand Alliance where he wants it with minimal effort and he's not in a hurry. Also, the Iron Prince mentioned that against the Dead King even a single mistake could turn into a complete disaster. So it would seem that his general method is to keep the pressure on and capitalize on any and all mistakes and win in the long run.

  The seeded plague might be new, but a child with a barely developed gift and one unusual trick entirely neutralized it.

As I mentioned earlier, he doesn't think of plague as being anything beyond a curiosity.

    “I was young,” Neshamah fondly remembered. “And still believed plagues to be valid method. You were quite severe in chiding me, I recall.”

This was a joke, and it still cost the Grand Alliance a Named dagger aimed at Neshemah's throat and almost cost it thousands of lives and half a year.
