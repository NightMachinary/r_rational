I really don't care what Morey's up to.

Guy in plot armor and tons of magic goes to a slave economy nation. I'm unfazed that this ended in slave revolts and a civil war, wooo.

Edit// I highly doubt that this story is willing to go dark enough to make this story thread make sense, slavery in the real world was ended rather peacefully by britain, popluous upraisings on the other hand go extremely poorly, they are killing "aristocrats" sources of order and education so are there going to be mass stravation like the Soviet revolution? Will there be a reign of terror that collapses on itself like the french revolution?

I don't see this writer doing either
