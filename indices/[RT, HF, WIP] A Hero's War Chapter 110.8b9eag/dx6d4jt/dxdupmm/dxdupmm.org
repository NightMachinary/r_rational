Morey has tried to limit the damage to the economy by focusing the sham trials on finding those who were abusive. Most of the mid-level business owners who owned slaves, only had one; those guys didn't get killed. Inequality in slave ownership is just as sharp as inequality in wealth.

That said, most of the government of Illastein and much of the law enforcement (who are also military here) did die. The ISL military is trying to turn into law enforcement or go back to their lives. Hence why the Inath Queen sent a whole bunch of bureaucrats to the country to help create a government.

RE economy and starvation:

Previously, most of the territory were already farming villages and upwards of 3/4s of the population was in food or food related industries so with most of the revolting peasants returning to their farms, there is no threat of running out of food. The villages are self-sufficient, the trading towns where the excess food is sold won't run out any time soon and cities tend to be surrounded by nearby villages (though the population fleeing the cities would have happened).

Do also remember that this planet has extremely mild seasons and thus crops can be planted at nearly any time. At medieval tech levels, there's no way only 2/3s (this was the ratio in Minmay pre-Cato) of the population farming would have worked. In general, food is a little easier to get here than on historical Earth. Subject to water and soil of course, Illastein needs more farmers because it's a poor sandy soil and drier.

RE government and chaos:

To a large extent, a republic is basically a dream of Morey's. His reputation as ISL leader, and storybook Hero, means that any time he opens his mouth, he can overrule the entire government because the well-armed populace all listen to him. The top is currently made of ISL faction leaders, who won't like it when he does that but they can't do anything. It's basically a monarchy right now, with him at the top.

Morey is not happy about this.

The country won't stabilize for many years due to how bloody the revolution was and without Amarante's aid, would probably fragment into city states and ungoverned territory. (Two cities already broke off to form their own countries)
