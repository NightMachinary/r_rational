My main problem with this scenario is that it doesn't seem like the precommitments that come up are in any way fundamental - why would an alien mind also settle on these?

This leaves you with no real incentive to pre commit, since the reciprocal commitment could easily be incompatible.

A secondary problem is trust - both parties would have to allow access to verifiable source code to rule out betrayal, and you basically get a prisoners dilemma with a massive power differential and unknown loyalty.

I just don't see this working.
