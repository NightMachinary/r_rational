An absolutely heartwrenching exploration of transhumanist ethics, /Mortal/ is one of the most beautiful novels I have ever had the privilege of reading. It has a one-shot sequel, [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/134664/mother-of-nations]["Mother of Nations"]], set centuries after the events of /Mortal/, and a trio of deleted scenes collected in [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/85197/lunar-orbit][/Lunar Orbit/]]. I found that listening to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg2Plw8CFOc]["The Passage of Emptiness"]] on repeat while reading really enhanced the experience.

Also, awesome Crabapple is awesome.
