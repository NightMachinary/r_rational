Not bad, definitely the kind of MLP fiction I'd rather see on here. A good intro to some transhumanist debate. The arguments on both sides were a little more emotionally charged and a little less logically grounded than I'd have liked. It would have been nice to see some of the consequences actually play out in longer form. I think I'd have enjoyed it more if it had been longer- which is probably the highest compliment I can pay a fic, come to think of it.
