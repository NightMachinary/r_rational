This chapter needed to happen.

I like malicia being very clear that she didn't want to build a Callow that would be intact and able to declare Independence. I also like how she got pissed at cat for not letting the knightly orders die on their own.

That said, there was a lost opportunity in this chapter. We know that Praes is composed of three human cultures plus greenskins. It seems like Malicia's goal is to make Callowan the fourth human culture of Praes, like taghreb or soninke. Those two cultures are still distinct with different languages and homelands but both accept the tower and being part of Praes.

I wanted Malicia to explore that idea more.
