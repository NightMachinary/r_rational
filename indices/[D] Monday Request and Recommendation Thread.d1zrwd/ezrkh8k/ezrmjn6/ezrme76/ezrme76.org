I am looking for good humor fics for any fandom.

I have been reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3124159/3/Just-a-Random-Tuesday][Just A Random Tuesday]], a HP fic set during Order of the Phoenix. If you like the scene where the Weasley twins prank Umbridge you will probably like it. Some other good HP humor fics are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]]. Another thread on humor recs [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6mfrkv/rational_comedies/][here]].

None of these are particularly rational, just funny.
