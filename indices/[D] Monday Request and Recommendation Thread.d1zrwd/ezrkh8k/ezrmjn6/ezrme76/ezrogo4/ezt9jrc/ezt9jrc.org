I'm going to second the rec someone made for [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/continue/368986][Message In A Bottle]]. (I want to say it was in a monday recommendation thread, but I can't seem to find it to credit whoever gave the recommendation.)

Excellent first contact/sci-fi fic that just so happens to feature ponies. Though I only found the first 300k words worth reading, as after that the proper plot is concluded and it moves on to side stories.

Also, as far as current season anime go, I recommend:

- Vinland saga (reading the manga beforehand just made it even more hype.)
- Cop Craft. (Fish out of water story that's also a buddy cop show+fantasy.)
