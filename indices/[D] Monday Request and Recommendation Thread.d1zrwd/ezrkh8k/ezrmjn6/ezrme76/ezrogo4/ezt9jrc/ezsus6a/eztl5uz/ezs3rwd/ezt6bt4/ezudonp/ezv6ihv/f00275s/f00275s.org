  [[https://www.royalroad.com/fictions/best-rated]] is hit or miss, but if you haven't at least skimmed the list you might be missing something you like. It has stories like Threadbare, Mother of Learning, and Delve, but the first page of this list also has awful works like Azarinth Healer and Metaworld Chronicles.

I agree Azarinth Healer is pretty bad, but what's wrong with Metaworld Chronicles? It's not the best thing I've ever read, but it's not terrible.
