Some old favorites have updated!

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/327551/changeling-space-program][Changeling Space Program]] is a My Little Pony story about the changelings in a space race against the other species to be the first ones to reach the moon. There is a sequel crossover with the Martian, [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/396744/the-maretian][The Maretian]], which is about the Equestrian crew crash landing on Mars and sharing in Mark's challenges and woes. Heavy on the sciencing one's way into space with some political drama/comedy.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/break-them-all-original-precross.12960/][Break Them All]] is about exploring what happens when modern science is applied to a magic system which resembles magic used in stories like Harry Potter and similar systems with quirks like gold being hard to conjure, old artifacts/spells are stronger than modern day magic, and other fairy tale like qualities. Fairly slice of life while exploring magical consequences.

The sixth book in a series I follow, [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074CGH284?ref_=dbs_r_series&storeType=ebooks][Nightlord]], has just came out. It's about a guy who gets turned into a vampire and then tossed into another world with magic set in a medieval era where he spends time wandering around as a hero before sorta accidentally-on-purpose becoming the king of a newly founded kingdom.

Despite the cliche wish fulfillment sounding summary, he acts very much like someone from this community where he spends time investigating his powers as a vampire and as a wizard (plus the magic to cross alternate worlds), puts serious thought into the ethics of a modern person as a king in a dark ages society, and has genuine relationships with one woman at a time instead of the standard harem.

One issue that might put off readers is that the books are very long and the plot...sort of meanders around a little. Very often the protagonist sets out to do one thing in a subplot and ends up starting another entirely different subplot. The story always gets back to the old plots, but it's evocative of real life where events are messy and don't ever have a neat, self-contained arc or episode. I liked it, but I know it's not to everyone's taste. The books are also very long. As in each book is as long as a trilogy for any other series. A short one, but still.

Preorders for [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X8ZH6BS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_o01?ie=UTF8&psc=1][Uncrowned]] is now out for anyone who is a fan of the Cradle series.
