Repping a manga I saw trolling the last few weeks' archive: [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/102690/Deatte_5-byou_de_Battle][Battle in 5 Seconds after meeting]]

It falls into a genre I've taken to calling "power battler", whose qualities are:

1. Characters have various special/unique abilities or powers, usually supernatural

2. Conflict in the plot is solved by the application of powers or their loopholes

3. Downtime in the plot involves theorycrafting on power strengths and weaknesses, and trying to forge alliances with powers that complement one's own or exploit a weakness in the enemys' powers.

Examples: [[https://mangakakalot.com/manga/be919195][Ultimate Rock Paper Scissors]], [[http://luminous.elcenia.com/][Luminosity]] (and possibly Glowfic, though I haven't gotten much into it), [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]] (Superhero stories lend themselves to this)

If anyone has any manga/story recs in this, please tell.
