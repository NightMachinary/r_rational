I highly recommend this completed fic [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/365588][The Scientist]], the first two in the series. It's one of the very few fanfics in Undertale that doesn't follow the protagonist in the game.

I believe the cover summary describes this far better than I can:

#+begin_quote
  Monsters have been sealed underground after the war with humanity. The new Royal Scientist, Dr. W.D. Gaster, thinks he can do something about it.

  Follows the life and eventual downfall of the man who speaks in hands.

In other news, holy shit there's so much porn on AoO. I filter out obvious red flags like rape, paedophilia, and sex and tens of thousands of stories gets cut down to a few hundred at most.

There's a few nuggets of gold like the ones I linked above but the mountain of shit I have to dig through is frightening.
