I agree, popcorn fic is a good word for it. Good in short bursts, but if I think too hard about it I get annoyed. I used to be able to just power through any story if I liked the premise, but then I started writing. And the thing is, nowadays if a story could've been great but was executed horribly, I get /ideas/ I don't have the time to get out of my head and on to a page. So they fester, and that sucks.
