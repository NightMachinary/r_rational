Thanks for recommending this. I agree the pacing is slow, but it was still very readable. The refreshing thing for me is that the author has a concept, establishes rules and runs with it, even when that is at the expense of what authors would ordinarily do or "good writing." A story that is well fit for [[/r/rational]] I think.

An example was that at one point [the author] justifies the magic system using some logic which is sort of almost reasonable. This was actually negative to my suspension of disbelief - the argument was not enough to /actually/ be reasonable (of course), but enough to engage my instinct to evaluate things rather than just treating it as technobabble like most stories do. That is certainly something I'll forgive though. As light entertainment goes, you could do worse.

Maybe something for authors to remember: don't try to justify why your built world is the way it is. Just say "them's the rules" and then have the in-world characters introduce their theories (or not) as appropriate. Having an argument as to why your world is a certain way is not necessary: the real world certainly doesn't.
