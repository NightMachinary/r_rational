  still worshiping her non-existent god.

I would just like to point out that it's mentioned that the reason Earth doesn't have any magic at all is because a god managed to gain power beyond all other existing gods and sealed Earth off from access to magic. It's implied that the most well known gods are also the most powerful and what god is more well known than the Christian god?

There is some weak evidence that her god is real.
