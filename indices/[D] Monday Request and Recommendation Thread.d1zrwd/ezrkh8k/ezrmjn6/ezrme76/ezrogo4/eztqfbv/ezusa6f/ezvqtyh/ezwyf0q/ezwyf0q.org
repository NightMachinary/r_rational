On the other hand, the isolation between dimensions isn't absolute, since she herself managed to cross from one to another as a mere mortal. So it'd be reasonable for her to assume at least likelyhood of her former god keeping tabs on her and punishing / rewarding her based on her actions in the new dimension. “Commandments jurisdiction outside of the default dimension” sort of thing.

Though reading a story with such a premise and such a protagonist likely wouldn't be for me as well.
