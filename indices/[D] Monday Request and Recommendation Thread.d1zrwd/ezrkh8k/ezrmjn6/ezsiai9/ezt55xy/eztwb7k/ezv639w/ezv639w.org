Sadly, I think the tale will never be finished. Rothfuss already started another novel set in the universe, but his editor was like "Fuck no. Finish the damn book." Rothfuss' response has been to play videogames and sweat over minutia for almost a decade. I legit think he was too slow, missed out on his most creative 5 years, and now he's not the type of person that can tell that story anymore. I really, really hope I'm wrong. But he hasn't published /anything/ for five years.
