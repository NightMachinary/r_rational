That was a review of the series that truly mirrored my own. From sort of enjoying the first book, but not enough to recommend it to outright being unable to finish the second.

I also loved the length comparison to The God of Small Things, which is one of my all time favorites, and a book that has the most magnificent writing I've ever read.
