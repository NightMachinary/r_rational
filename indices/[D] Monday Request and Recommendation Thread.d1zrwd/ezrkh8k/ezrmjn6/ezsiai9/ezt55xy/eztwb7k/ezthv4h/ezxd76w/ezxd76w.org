There's a review linked further down which really expresses my annoyance with the books in a far better way than I could : [[http://web.archive.org/web/20190422041712/http://ferretbrain.com/articles/article-751]]

I do think they had the potential to be great, and each section was very engaging. I think for me, it ended up in an uncanny valley, being worse than most literature in terms of prose, while being awfully plodding for a fantasy novel.
