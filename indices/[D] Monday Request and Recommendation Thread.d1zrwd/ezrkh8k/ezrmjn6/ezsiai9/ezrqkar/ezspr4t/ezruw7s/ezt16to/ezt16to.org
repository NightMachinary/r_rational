If you're quite loose with your definition of "academy", you might like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krabat_(novel)][Krabat]], about a boy who runs away from home during the 30 years war to start an apprenticeship, and finds out he accidently hired on to learn Black Magic. Not rational.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game][Ender's Game]] is about a boy who is groomed from childhood to become Earth's premier general, who will once and for all beat the aliens who almost destroyed humanity. Not strictly rational, but pretty popular around here.

In general, you could look for works in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildungsroman][Bildungsroman]] genre.
