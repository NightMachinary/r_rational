I havent read canon in a long time but as a kid i remember thinking books 5-7 were the best. After reading hpmor it opened my eyes to how illogical they were. If i were you id read canon, all of canon, first then hpmor because hpmor builds off and references some characters and plot in canon.

It is not essential however and if you are time limited id invest the time reading some other fantastic fanfiction like anything nonjon has written (Yudkowski gets the name david monroe from "a black comedy" which i recommend even higher than hpmor for sheer entertainment value) and "harry the hufflepuff" featuring a harry that had been called lazy more than a freak and tries to live up to his reputation.
