I'll de-rec both of these. Metaworld is worse even than Randidly Ghosthound, which is saying something. Readable in short doses, but taken as a whole it's just bad but fun nonsense. Heretical Edge /might/ have some sort of big overarching explanation for the multitudes of plot holes looming over the premise, but I dropped it before that point. The protagonist never questions the major plot holes, even to herself. This is offset slightly by the story actually being competently written, but it's not at all rational.
