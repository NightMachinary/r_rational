I'll assume you mean the problems I have with the start of the story? They're mostly about tone and promises. The thing is, the beginning isn't bad on its own. It grounds the reader's expectations but also sets the main character up as someone competent and experienced. And that's why it doesn't work at all with the rest of the story, because the main character is simultaneously an intrepid, calculated risk-taker and a wide-eyed fish out of water. It's /jarring/ to see this person who's shown to operate in high stress situations and roll with the punches just /freeze/ for entire paragraphs of internal narration and description. And the yelping, what's with that? She yelps way too often.

Got off track. The point is, the start of the story promises some detective shenanigans---Scooby Doo stuff, or Sherlock Holmes. Down to earth, nonmagical. And then all that's immediately thrown out of the window, both character building and tone.
