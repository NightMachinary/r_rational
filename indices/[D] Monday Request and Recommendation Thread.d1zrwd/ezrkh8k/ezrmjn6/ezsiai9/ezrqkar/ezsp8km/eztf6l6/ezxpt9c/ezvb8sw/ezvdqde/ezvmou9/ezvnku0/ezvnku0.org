#+begin_quote
  •Irrational Use of The Heretical Edge
#+end_quote

Somewhat addressed.

Spoilers: Killing too much too fast fucks your head up, and the people in charge want to be as sure as possible that their recruits are gonna be on their side.

#+begin_quote
  •Worldwide Interaction
#+end_quote

Sort of addressed.

Spoilers: Basically there's an extremely powerful external party and later main antagonist that is basically forcing things to stay the way they are. They want individual heretics to get strong, but humanity as a whole getting strong is like their greatest fear.

#+begin_quote
  •Eden's Garden of Idiots
#+end_quote

Sorta the same deal as with the heretical edge.

#+begin_quote
  •Magic is Programming
#+end_quote

Yeah this is basically a big ol' plot hole. You could say that magic is still super hard despite the freedom it allows, but it's hard to believe that would limit it as much as it seems to in the story. I'm much more of a fan of restricted magic systems fully explored than supposedly open magic systems being underutilised. It would have been better if the magic abilities and properties of material was the only magic in the setting, IMO. Even a little bit of magic is overpowered in a rational context, though, so it's pretty hard to find stories with actual magic realism.

  •Oh No Killers But Let's Not Be Too Hasty
#+end_quote

It's been ages so I can't quite remember, but basically:

SPOILERS

It's all(or mostly) part of a huge conspiracy to fuck over the mc. It's better than that makes it sound, though.

#+begin_quote
  •Guy Kills a World And It's Fine I Guess
#+end_quote

Addressed.

Spoilers: Yeah they all already know about him pretty much.
