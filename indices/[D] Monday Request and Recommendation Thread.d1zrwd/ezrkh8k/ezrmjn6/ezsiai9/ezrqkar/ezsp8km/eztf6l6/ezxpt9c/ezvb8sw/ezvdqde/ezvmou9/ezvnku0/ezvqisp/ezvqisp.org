  Killing too much too fast fucks your head up, and the people in charge want to be as sure as possible that their recruits are gonna be on their side.

See, if only she'd /asked/ that could've been kept a mystery. And even then: that just means they gotta set a killing schedule, yeah? Otherwise people are going to be hunting and killing as much as they can. This is the kinda thing you warn people about.

Like, all or most of the things I bring up get addressed later and I /know/ that, but no one treats them rationally. Even after they have an explanation it feels forced because there's nothing that makes the surprise seem inevitable. That's the key to making a good plot twist: surprising, yet inevitable. The first component's there, but what the story is now doesn't really work. A bunch of the more open ended elements should've been pared down in the editing phase, and the story reworked so that the different plot points fit together. (I have some problems with the beginning of the story too.)
