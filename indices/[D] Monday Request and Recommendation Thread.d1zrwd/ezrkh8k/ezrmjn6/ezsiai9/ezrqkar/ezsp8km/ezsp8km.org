I'll second Metaworld Chronicles as a tasty junk-food, Isekai story with rational elements. The school setting isn't heavily present---it serves more as a plot device to launch the characters out into the world, the world-building is that of humanity being repressed by a slew of different types of fantasy monsters that control entire swathes of continents, also: alternative history.

The first forty chapters have been edited and are being sold on amazon for a paltry price, which I recommend reading instead of the royalroad chapters since there's typos and the author's still learning how to write.

The author is well read and references famous literature/films. The author doesn't deconstruct tropes or satirize anything, it's predictable, but it's as good as anything if you're looking for something to binge.
