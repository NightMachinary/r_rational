Unfortunately I don't think anything like this exists. Sites which provide recommendations are generally incredibly bad at it. I think this is mainly because they assume "good recommendation == work similar to what the user has read before in some way." I don't see any reason to believe that in general, although you can get some kind of results that way. I suspect those results are worse in practice than uniform random sampling weighted by popularity though [allowing users to pick filters to limit the set of works considered and obviously removing things they have already read + things they have marked as not interested]. Companies who definitely have the technical capability to do better than the current situation typically don't have any incentive to.

An example of how I might approach attempting to do better than random (not as easy as it sounds!) would be:

1. Get the entirety of the posts & comments on [[/r/rational]] and extract user->recommendation pairs from the posts
2. Apply something like PageRank to build a map of the works which are most recommended
3. Recursively add works to the map by seeing what [[/r/rational]] users recommend elsewhere and also by finding users who recommend the same works in other subreddits and seeing what else they recommend
4. You then have a starting point for "works which are likely to be relevant to [[/r/rational]] users". It's almost certainly the case that you would have read almost all of the top suggestions; this is good as it allows you to immediately rate them. I personally would probably use 3 options for rating read works: "high quality," "guilty pleasure/readable but nothing special" and "bad." Also as you suggest "won't read" for works you haven't read.
5. Based on the ratings, weight the contributions of individual users to build a map which is directly relevant to you. Possibly also show which users have a good track record so you can pay attention to future recommendations from them.

Although I can't prove it without actually doing this, I feel like this would be very obviously better than any other recommendation system currently out there. Conceptually, to sort things based on "generalised word of mouth". I have some confidence that this would work given how huge an improvement google search was over anything else when they first started up and the main thing they did differently was use PageRank.
