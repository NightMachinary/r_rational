I would like to recommend Lazy Dungeon Master. I stumbled upon the [[https://mangadex.org/chapter/448527/10][manga]] last week, and while there are only ten chapters, I liked it so much I started reading the [[http://zirusmusings.com/ldm-toc/][light novel]]. Manga ends at chapter 32.

It's about a guy who gets summoned to another world to be a +hero+ dungeon master. Ie, to work for the other side. It's not rationalist, but he does get creative in fun ways with abusing the systems. For one thing he plays around with a "Create Golem" skill to create lots of different kinds of machines nobody else can replicate. When chosen to be Issekai'd he also gets the power to understand all languages, which is only moderately useful... Until he realizes that incantations for spells are just commands issued in a long dead language... Which he can now speak...

That said, he's not very ambitious, so he mostly uses his powers to protect/upgrade his dungeon and live in luxury. Still, it's entertaining.
