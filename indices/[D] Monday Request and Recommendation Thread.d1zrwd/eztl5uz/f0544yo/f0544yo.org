You might enjoy [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/][Dungeon Keeper Ami]] which somewhat resembles your description. It's a [Sailor Moon / Dungeon Keeper] fanfic (what are those? no idea. who cares.), extremely long, and, I think, becomes very good in terms of plot, writing, and novelty (skimming the first ~10% is possible).

Anyway, thanks for the recommendation.
