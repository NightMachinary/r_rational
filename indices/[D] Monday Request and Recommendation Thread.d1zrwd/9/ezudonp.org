I'm not looking for a specific book. I'm looking for a better way to search for books to read.

I have a list of books I like and have rated, both on amazon and on Goodreads. What I want is a good recommendation engine that can take a look at all of those books and spit out similar books that I might like.

Amazon supposedly does this. But it cheats, and the way it cheats makes the recommendations really shitty. Instead of looking at all my books, it just looks at the most recently read books. And then it only looks at one book at a time. Which is fine as a recommendation engine if I want more stuff in the same series (stupidly easy to find), stuff by the same author (also very easy to find on my own), or some vaguely similar new releases on kindle unlimited (hard to find, but very hit or miss in terms of quality).

List of things I want from a recommendation engine:

1. Take into account my past reading.
2. Allow me to filter down the list and remove items I have decided not to read (Amazon doesn't seem to let me remove recommendations which is frustrating as hell).
3. Not have any strong biases that I don't care about (amazon will recommend new stuff over old stuff 9 times out of 10, but I have no such preference).
