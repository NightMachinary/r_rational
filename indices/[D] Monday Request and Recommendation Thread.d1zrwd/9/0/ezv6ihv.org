[[http://rationalreads.com/]] supposedly does this, but the database of works isn't really big enough to tell.

[[https://www.fimfiction.net/]] has a ton of extremely useful recommendation features, such as also liked and related boxes if you scroll down from a story, a powerful and easy to use search function, and a clean, intuitive interface. I wish it accepted more than just MLP fics.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/100705.Rational_Fiction]] has a hundred and twenty-five books recommended by the rational community. If you haven't checked it out, you should do so.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fictions/best-rated]] is hit or miss, but if you haven't at least skimmed the list you might be missing something you like. It has stories like Threadbare, Mother of Learning, and Delve, but the first page of this list also has awful works like Azarinth Healer and Metaworld Chronicles.
