The main character is just way too powerful for the setting. Nothing's a real challenge, which could be done well but not with the plot as is. You could have something like /Significant Digits/ where you have the plot based more on scientific advancement and finding out the hidden bad guys, but naw, straight power fantasy. She's just /given/ tons of rare items for no reason, because why not, and gets a bunch of powerful friends, because she's just that good I guess. Everything feels like it revolves around her, where in a good story you'd pick up that other people have their own lives. This makes everything she achieves feel unearned.
