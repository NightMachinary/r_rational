That... is a totally fair gripe to have with the story! I guess I'm somewhat inured to it, since what you describe is prevalent in Xianxia which I'm generally willing to read, and increasingly common in other webnovels.

It makes for a decent popcorn fic if you can put up with that - it's competently written, with some nice worldbuilding - but if that's a dealbreaker then be assured it doesn't improve much in that respect.
