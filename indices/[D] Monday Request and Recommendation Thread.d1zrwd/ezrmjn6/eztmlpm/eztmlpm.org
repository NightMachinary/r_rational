[[https://tiraas.net/2014/08/20/book-1-prologue/][The Gods are Bastards]] doesn't just focus on the school, but one of the groups of protagonists is a group of the most powerful and important kids of their generation going to a college run by a legendary ex-adventurer. It's got good worldbuilding and fun character interaction, though it's a long ways from being rational.
