Meh. I wouldn't read HP as an adult, unless you feel like you're missing out on the background for some shared memes or something. Books 1-3 are incredibly predictable and thus boring, and the characters are really not that interesting. Not even because they're children - His Dark Materials pulls it off much better. They're just... very basic archetypes 'brought together' by 'friendship' yada yada.
