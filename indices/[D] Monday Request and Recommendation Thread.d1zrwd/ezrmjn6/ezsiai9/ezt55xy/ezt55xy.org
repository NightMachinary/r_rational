As a mild counter, I was not a fan of this book. This book appears to be very divisive, and I have a few complaints, mostly about it's pacing. It's epic in length, but not in scope. It's a single book squeezed into a trilogy, to paraphrase Ebert. Keeps you on the hook about amazing deeds and then spends a whole book on his early teenage years.\\
You'll need a fair bit of patience to enjoy the indulgent story-telling, which I don't think necessarily resonates with this sub. The prose is better than most fics posted here, but not brilliant when compared to most published prose.
