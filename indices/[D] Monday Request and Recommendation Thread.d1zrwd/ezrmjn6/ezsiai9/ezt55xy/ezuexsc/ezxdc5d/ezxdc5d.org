I'm definitely not the only one. I remember once looking up reviews after reading it, because I couldn't believe that it was so highly rated and noticed a lot of 1 star ratings. It's not divisive I'm that half loved it and half hated it, it's that you either loved it or hated it, very few lukewarm reviews.
