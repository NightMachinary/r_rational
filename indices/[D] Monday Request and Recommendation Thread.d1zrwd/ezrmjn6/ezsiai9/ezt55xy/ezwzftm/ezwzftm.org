The book is not divisive at all. It came out to major critical and general public acclaim and is thus both popular and highly regarded by critics. And in my opinion botht the critics and the public are right, its a pretty great series.

Now, I'm not going to claim it doesn't have big problems, the main character is a massive Mary sue, the fact that the third (and final) book in the series will never be released, the pacing in the second book isn't the best ever. But none of these are dealbreakers to me, and I don't think any of these will be dealbreakers to the typical readers of this sub (eg. most of us read fanfictions/webnovels where the MC is also a Mary Sue, will likely never finish and have shit pacing).
