I'll mildly counter that mild counter. On a plot level the books are all over the place and move slowly. Rothfuss is probably the most successful author I know at using beta readers, though, so you'll generally find any given segment to be engaging. I think the prose is actually quite good for the standard of a commercial fantasy novel, the only current fantasy author that I think is a better technical writer is Abercrombie. Agree that it might not be a 100% fit for this sub, but they're worth reading.
