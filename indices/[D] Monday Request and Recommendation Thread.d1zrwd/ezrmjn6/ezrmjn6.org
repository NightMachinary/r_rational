I was wondering what good "Academy" stories are out there not necessarily rational. By academy I mean a group of people join some sort of academy for some amount of years, sometimes with some seasonal events for each year. Examples of the top my head of are [[http://www.drewhayesnovels.com/superpowereds][Superpowered]] which used to be mostly a web novel and of course, Harry Potter.

I had quite liked superpowered and was wondering if what else was out there that has a similar story structure. even a link to a TvTropes page about these kinds of stories with examples would be apriciated.
