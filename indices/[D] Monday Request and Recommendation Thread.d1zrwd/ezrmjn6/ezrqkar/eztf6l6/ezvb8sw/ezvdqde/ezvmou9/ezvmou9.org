It's been a while since I got caught up on reading Heretical Edge but the reason they don't just line up tons of monsters for the kids is because it's explained that easy kills for the Reaper-based Heretics drives them insane with bloodlust

The useless administration is also explained but I'm a little more fuzzy on it, IIRC there's a lot of high level conspiracy stuff like half the staff is secretly brainwashed and/or aliens and the actual non-compromised staff can't do anything for their own reasons

Honestly, I can see where you're coming from. A lot of Cerulean's work is like this, where plot points are set up over multiple arcs, and it can get really frustrating waiting weeks or months for a real explanation as to why an otherwise semi-rational story has such a glaring plot hole.
