Okay, here are a few of the bigger plot holes:

•Irrational Use of The Heretical Edge\\
In nature, there are two main strategies animals use to make the next generation. The first is mainly used by predators or larger mammals, where each individual offspring is cared and provided for as much as possible so it grows up real strong. The other strategy is numbers. With thousands of offspring, what does it matter that hundreds of them get eaten before they're even out of the egg? /Neither/ strategies are used in story, when both would have been the best. You could have the Heretical Edge active constantly by going around the world and going “hey, wanna be a magic person?” Then let them sink or swim on their own merit. Meanwhile, the normal screening procedures in the story let people go to magic island school where they're given a constant stream of high level monsters to deal the last blow to until every one of these students has their bases covered. The latter scenario happens /once/ to give everyone a small amount of regeneration. And apparently these weak kills /stack/! But no, only give one weak toad monster to each person.

•Worldwide Interaction\\
I get it, the author was too lazy to figure out how magic teleporting mirrors would have impacted shipping and the economy and all that. Still, at least a mention of /why/ they couldn't sell magic mirrors would fix this. Or even an idle thought from the main character. Sure, the monsters have an antimemetic effect, that's all well and good, but the magic itself isn't inherently unknowable. Set up magic healing thingies and call them technology. Save lives.

•Eden's Garden of Idiots\\
At least this one requires a presumably slow growing fruit instead of being flashed by a big light to become a Heretic, but come on---none of these guys give the newbies free monster kills either. Everyone's supposed to be a badass killer from the age of like nine or whatever and even these guys lack a few caged dinosaurs that the kids can poke to death.

•Magic is Programming\\
The story uses this trope and then does nothing with it. Exploding stones? Sure. More complex devices? Not even mentioned.

•Oh No Killers But Let's Not Be Too Hasty\\
So there's sabotage meant to kill someone, an ambush meant to kill someone, a teacher is dead, and the staff isn't pulling everyone out of class to personally be interviewed with Super Lie Detector spells from day one. That Heretic who's supposed to be investigating is only mentioned in passing and then does nothing because we can't have authority figures actually being useful.

•Guy Kills a World And It's Fine I Guess\\
Hey protagonist, this guy murdered an entire planet. You gonna tell your teachers, or ... no, okay, guess not. Good luck facing him later. Alone. You moron.
