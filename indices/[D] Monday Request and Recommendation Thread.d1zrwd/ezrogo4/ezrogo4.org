I posted this just before in last week's recommendations:

If there was a isekai version of Dungeon Engineer with an intellectual and rational protagonist, check out [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26977/second-life-as-the-sister-of-a-goddess][Second Life as the Sister of a Goddess]].

The MC was a 60-something year old fitness instructor before being reincarnated as a non-human (avoiding spoilers) baby. Instead of engineering and terrariums we get neuroscience and developmental biology, along with magic and mythology.

The story is extremely well written so far, however the pacing is somewhat slow, with occasionally multiple PoVs of the same events. I do think it's slow because I'm comparing it to other isekai stories that skim through early life, and it would be better enjoyed with an open mind.
