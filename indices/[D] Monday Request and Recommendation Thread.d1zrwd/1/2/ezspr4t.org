[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21188/forge-of-destiny][Forge of Destiny]] and [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25562/though-the-heavens-should-fall][Though the Heavens Should Fall]]? Both of them are cultivation fantasy instead of superpower, and I have neither read Superpowered nor Harry Potter so I can't say how similar they are.
