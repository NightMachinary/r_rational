Some people like book five. Some people even like the whole series up until the end. But, in my opinion, it gets worse every book after 4.

The first three books shouldn't really be read as straight fantasy. They're a little more in a fairy tale genre. You're not really intended to think of the Dursleys as abusers any more than you're supposed to think of the evil stepsisters in Cinderella as abusers. I mean, you can use that lens, and it applies, but its not the lens that the stories themselves assume you'll apply. Same with the ridiculously unsafe castle (they get sent to a deathtrap forest for detention, for example) and the somewhat fairy-tale last act to the first book. Starting with book 4 there's a bit of a genre transition to straight fantasy, the books become much longer and they lose the fairy tale quality.

Also, was just kidding, life is short and there's no shame in choosing not to read something. But good that you started the series!
