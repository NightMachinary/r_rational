  The protagonist never questions the major plot holes, even to herself.

I feel like this is a result of the plot being planned out and having been gone over by the author so much, without enough awareness of things other than the plot. I think at a certain point they kinda forget that the character should be questioning stuff like this, because they the author know the answer so it doesn't even occur to them. Definitely a flaw.
