  that just means they gotta set a killing schedule, yeah?

That's definitely something I was thinking at first, but potential traitors are already given too much power just by being heretics in the first place. They can't actually truly test people's loyalty for whatever reason (I would imagine a combination of limits of magic and heretic families not standing up for invasive methods (I think these are sorta indirectly mentioned)) so it wouldn't be a wise move to guarantee that traitors get maximum power I guess?

But then again, the on average the people who kill more are likelier to be more loyal just as it's already set up, so I don't know.

And yeah, I get what you're saying. There's a difference between a story with rational explanations and a rational story. On the subject of plot twists I guess I get what you're saying, but I don't know if I agree how much it applies to HE. I'm sure there's lots of what you're describing, but since it's been so long since I've read the early parts I basically only remember the standout twists, the best of the best.

  A bunch of the more open ended elements should've been pared down in the editing phase, and the story reworked so that the different plot points fit together. (I have some problems with the beginning of the story too.)

I'd be interested to hear you elaborate on this.
