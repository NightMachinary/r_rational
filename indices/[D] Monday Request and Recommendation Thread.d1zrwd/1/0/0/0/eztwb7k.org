The KingKilller Chronicle is flawed, I agree. Certain sections remind me a little bit of the Inheritance Cycle, where time passes very slowly in great detail before passing very quickly with significantly less detail.

You also hit on some of the positives, the quality of the prose and story, the grandiose drama and passionate behavior of each plot point.

It is the type of story near every fantasy nerd has read, the type people loved in the first reading, recommended to all their friends, then spent the last few years loving to hate online and in person.

The moment Doors of Stone (putative book 3) is available for pre-order, I think a lot of the hate will dissipate and turn to excitement. The only way you could frame the story as rational would be by claiming Kvothe is really changing the details of the events he is narrating. The high fantasy setting, the complex, powerful, and seemingly unlimited magic shown by various parties, they all make the story both less rational, less believable, and more entertaining.

I would love to see the world experienced through other perspectives. /The Slow Regard of Silent Things/ was so different, so unique, and so rewarding that I would hate to see the universe Rothfuss has created be scrapped after Kvothe finishes his tale.
