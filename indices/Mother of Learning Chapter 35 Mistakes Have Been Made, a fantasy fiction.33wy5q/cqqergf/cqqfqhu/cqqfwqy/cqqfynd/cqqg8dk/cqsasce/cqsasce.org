What he knew was that he'd dealt with the two in front of him, there were some coming in from deeper in the dungeon, his retreat route was clear, and he could outrun the attackers. It made sense for him to run.

Once the other aranea popped up to block his escape route and started smashing at his mind shield, that would have been a good time to suicide. He wasted a few seconds there, but I'm quite willing to put that down to "no one wants to suicide and he was in the middle of a combat situation so didn't have time to react with perfect rationality."
