Mental abilities, ridiculous levels of mana shaping, a pretty wide variety of offensive and defensive spells, divination, several loops worth of alchemy and library magic, some soul magic, teleportation, monster knowledge and combat experience due to dungeon spelunking... Zorian is admittedly not particularly deep into most of what he knows, but he does have a wide skill set, which seems to count for a lot in this universe.
