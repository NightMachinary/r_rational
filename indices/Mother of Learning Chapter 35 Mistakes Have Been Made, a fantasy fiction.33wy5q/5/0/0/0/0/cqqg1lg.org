The issue with multilayered defences like this is that two of the layers are made out of the same sort of thing, magic. Something that can take out egg shields can probably take out mind blank. He'd be better off going to a mind blank or an egg shield depending on the situation (human vs spider foes, egg shield isn't anywhere near as strong as mind blank since he can kill spiders easily with magic), and spending his free time casting an offensive spell that reduced the danger of those around him.

Each layer takes time to power up.
