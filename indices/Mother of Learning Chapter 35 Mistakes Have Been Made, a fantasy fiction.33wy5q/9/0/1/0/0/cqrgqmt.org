The longer he fights the more risk he has of an adverse reaction or of failing to carry out the suicide plan. I'm doubtful that the additional risk of failing and becoming a mind slave is worth 12 days, especially since a few seconds isn't long enough to do a risk calculation. I think he balanced it far too much towards risk.

Plus, even if he waits to fight for a few seconds he might be injured in those few seconds. He lost an entire restart compared to just losing 12 days.
