True, but he's not deciding between "fight to the death" and "immediately suicide". He can fight for a few seconds and see if it's easy to escape and fall back to the suicide plan if that fails, which is what he does. I agree he balanced it too far toward risk, but not quite as much as it seems at first glance.

In either case, keep in mind the worst-case scenario is not just permadeath, it's the success of the undead invasion.
