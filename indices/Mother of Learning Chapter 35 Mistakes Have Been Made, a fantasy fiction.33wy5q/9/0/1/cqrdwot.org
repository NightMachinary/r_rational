He should be carefully weighting his resource expenditure based on predicted outcomes. Suppose each day is worth 1 utility point.

If he becomes a mind slave that would likely be at least 1 gone. -1 utility points. I think that's a massive underestimate.

Consider his probability of escaping. Suppose he has a 70% chance of escaping. This seems rather high, but whatever. He was about 18 days through a loop. He would gain a utility of 12/30*0.7=0.28 if he escaped with his life.

The 1 lost loop plus the lost time in this loop would lose him 0.3 * 1+0.3 * 12/30=0.42 utility points. So even based on that incredibly conservative case he'd be worse off.

Realistically, he could easily lose more than 1 loop, and he probably didn't have a 70% chance of surviving. If he lost the next eighty years and only had a 50% chance of surviving then it would be an extremely bad idea.

He shouldn't go in with an "I have finite time to work with, better risk it" attitude when facing threats to his long term survival. I can't imagine any probability calculation that's going to say it's a good idea in most cases. He should minimize his risks as much as possible, knowing that he needs to take some risks for his long term survival.
