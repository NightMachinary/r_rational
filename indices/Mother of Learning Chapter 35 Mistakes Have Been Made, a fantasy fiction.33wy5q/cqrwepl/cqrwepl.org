The way I see it, the spiders were suspicious of Zorian, made some investigations of their own, discovered that the whole Cyoria web was dead, decided to do a deep search of Zorian's mind to find out his involvement, knew they weren't going to get his cooperation and so decided they'd have to play rough. The original timetable for getting back to him was two days, that it took eight days is pretty significant.

Since I only recently started reading this, and have only participated in some of the discussion on an anime forum, I'm curious about how popular certain theories are:

- Zach's guardian (Tesen Zveri) as Red Robe- Someone Zach might have turned to early in the loops who he didn't realize was untrustworthy, after somehow securing his place in the loops could have messed with Zach's soul/mind. Also has a "Z" name, and the invaders are thought to have had agents in place in the government. He also could have hid the fact if Zach was in a coma for Zorian's first 7 loops, but wouldn't have been close enough to the school to know that Zorian had spent a number of loops like that as well.

- The aranea are just kicked out of the loop, not actually dead.

- The loop is a simulation of the next month based how things were at the beginning of it, caused by the Sovereign's Gate, and no actual time travel is actually happening.
