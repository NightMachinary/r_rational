I think you may have misread what Haslush said. He didn't say he had spells that would absolutely determine what the function of an object was. The sort of examples of where he has used divination on objects has revealed things like that the watch was for ward breaking, or that repair magic was used in the smashed up house, or that there were blood stains lying around.

That seems to be more how the magic functions. You look at an object, you suspect it has some particular function, you cast a spell to detect known markers of that function e.g. to be covered in blood it must have blood on it, you get a yes or a no.

We also haven't seen any real depth to these divinations. The divination looks for repair magic. He didn't seem to learn repair magic from that, he didn't gain anything from that scan, he just got a y repair magic is present in that object. We've seen no feats of the power you are talking about anyway.
