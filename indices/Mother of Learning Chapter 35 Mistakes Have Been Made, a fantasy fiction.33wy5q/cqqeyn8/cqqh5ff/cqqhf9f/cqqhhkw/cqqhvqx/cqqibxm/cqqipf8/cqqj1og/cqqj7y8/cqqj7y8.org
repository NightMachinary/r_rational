A function doesn't exist as a physical thing /at all/, so you aren't scrying for it. The divination is looking at the object, working out what it does, then beaming that information into your brain. It could just as easily look at the spell effect you want, work out which spell formula would most easily accomplish it and beam /that/ information into your brain.

No time travel involved.
