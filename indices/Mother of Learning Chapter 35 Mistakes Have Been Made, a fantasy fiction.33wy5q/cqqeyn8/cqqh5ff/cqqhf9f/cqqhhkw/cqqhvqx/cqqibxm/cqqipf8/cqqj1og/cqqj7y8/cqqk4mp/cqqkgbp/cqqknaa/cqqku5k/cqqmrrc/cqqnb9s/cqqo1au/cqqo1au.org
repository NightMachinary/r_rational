"Divination is one of the trickier magical disciplines, because failure is not obvious. You could perform a divination flawlessly and still get nothing out of it. You could mess it up totally and not even realize you did something wrong. Ask the wrong question, interpret the results incorrectly, or fail to take an important variable into account and it's all just wasted effort. Experience can help you minimize those kind of issues, but it helps to be naturally perceptive."

Based on that, I read that it's heavily about using intuition to interpret spell results.

We went over it, I disagreed. I believed that the power was strictly limited to pattern recognition, while he seemed to believe that the spells plucked information out of nothing. That means either the information is being produced by the spell (super intellect) or that they can find information that doesn't exist yet (time travel).
