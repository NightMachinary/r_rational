Just had a thought:

Divinations exist in this right?

Spells that pluck information out of the void, that you didn't know before you cast them?

Well, apart from the obvious (never go full Contessa), you could maybe make a "Calculate Spell Formula" spell to let you invent new spell formulae with near-zero effort. And once that's done you can effectively break the game.
