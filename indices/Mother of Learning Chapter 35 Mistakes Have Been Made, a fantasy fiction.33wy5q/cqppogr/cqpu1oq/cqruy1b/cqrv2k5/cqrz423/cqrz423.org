I guess I should have clarified, when Zorian first explains about grey hunter he states:

#+begin_quote
  It could run faster than a hasted mage, jump incredible distances, shrug off regular firearms and lower-level attack spells like a duck shrugging off water, outright *ignore most direct-effect spells* and bite through steel.
#+end_quote

The question is not "is mental magic a direct-effect spell?" (mind-crushing and bodily control certainly are.), but rather, "does mental magic fall under the category of *most* as far as grey hunter magic resistance is concerned?"

Since human mind mages are so rare, much less a natural empath like Zorian, I doubt it would ever be considered a viable approach outside of his particular circumstances, even if does work.
