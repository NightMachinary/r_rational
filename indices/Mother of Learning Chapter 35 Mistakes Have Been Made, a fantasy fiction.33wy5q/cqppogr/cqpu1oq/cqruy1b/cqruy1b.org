I remember your name from the 17thshard forums. I started reading this story a few weeks ago.

I was hoping that the grey hunter's ability to shrug off most direct attack spells wouldn't actually work on mental magic, so that at some point in the story he can deliver the egg to Silverlake by just walking the grey hunter up to her while the spider was under his mental control. (The same way the matriarch used the worm in one of the loops to fight off invaders.) He still hasn't managed to truly shock any of complete hardass teachers yet. And that eventually he'd use the grey hunter against the invaders directly.
