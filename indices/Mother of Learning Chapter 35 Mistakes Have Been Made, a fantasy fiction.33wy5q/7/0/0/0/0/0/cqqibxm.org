Divinations can find out information about what objects have done in the past, yes, but only with an example of the object at hand. You're not making information out of nothing, you're taking information out of an object at hand so you have a marker, the object, at hand. Divination spells like this extract information e.g. where is an object what is it doing when you have an example of the object at hand.

The north finding spell finds what direction is north, likely using a magnetic field. It extracts information from the magnetic field surrounding you most likely.

The library divination finds objects surrounding you that have particular words. You need to know what words to search for.
