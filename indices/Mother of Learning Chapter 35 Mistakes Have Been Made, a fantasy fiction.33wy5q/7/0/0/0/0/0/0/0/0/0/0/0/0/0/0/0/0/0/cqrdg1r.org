Why would I not believe my argument? All the evidence I've presented supports my argument, and you and the other guy have presented no evidence or quotes, you've just told me that something is super heavily implied. I could tell you that the evidence super heavily implied that the main character is secretly a vampire, it wouldn't mean anything without evidence.

If you don't present any evidence for your case, predictably, I'm not going to agree with you.
