Well, if you're going to say a marker can be an example of an object which the information is about (rather than a specific magical marker eg. the tag on Zorian's soul) and we remember that magic that interacts directly with minds exists, then why can't your mental image of the effect of the spell formula you want to create be the marker for the spell formula?

A function and a spell formula have exactly as much connection as a function and an object do.

We're just reversing the order of input to output.

In one case we have "physical thing>function of physical thing", and in the other we have "function of physical thing>physical thing".

I don't see why there should be any difference.
