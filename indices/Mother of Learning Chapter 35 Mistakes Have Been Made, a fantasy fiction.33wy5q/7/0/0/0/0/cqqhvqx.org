The detective who taught Zorian some basic divinations.

He talked about divinations that can analyze objects: what their function is, who touched them last, etc.

There's also the north finding spell and the library divinations from earlier chapters.

None of those involved markers.

And since spell formulae seem to be engineering-natured rather than woowoo-natured, it would basically be a Divine Function spell in reverse (which is admittedly a /lot/ more complicated, but it still doesn't need markers).
