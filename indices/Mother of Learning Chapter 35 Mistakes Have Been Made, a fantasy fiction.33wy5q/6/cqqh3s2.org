Zorian is shockingly sane, compared to most other protagonists in time loop stories. He seems to have unshakable values. I hope Zach has a similar disposition.

Looking back on the story, I can't help but feel Zorian's progress has been a little underwhelming. I don't ever want him to reach god tier, or even demigod tier, but at this stage in the game I feel like he ought to have several moderately powerful tricks under his belt. But all he has is his mental abilities.
