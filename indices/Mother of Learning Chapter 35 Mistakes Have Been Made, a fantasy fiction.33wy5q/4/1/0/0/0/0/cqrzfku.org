What I suspect he might be able to do is to use the slower method of trying to find a hole or a weakness in the defence, as Enthusiastic Seeker of Novelty did with him. I could easily imagine, after he's been trained by the Aranea, that he has some tense scene where he's desperately trying to avoid the grey hunter eating him while he tries to find a hole in its defences, ending with it inches from his face under his control, fangs dripping with venom.

Or that it takes him two or three restarts to get mental control of it, as it tends to seek and attack him when he tries to take control.
