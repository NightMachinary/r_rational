(Preventative typo apologies: I'm on mobile) I found it entertaining popcorn book. I gave it a half my attention first listen through today: it has some spots with poor pacing and there is a rather glaring strawman of anti-upload ideology repeated by more than a few characters, but overall if you've read the first two you will enjoy this one.
