  Each universe only needs to be big enough to simulate reality for the population of the the inhabited planet it starts with, and the simulated reality needs to expand no faster than lightspeed.
#+end_quote

Well as mentioned the loss of efficiency could be big enough so that even with a full universe you couldn't simulate a single planet..

  I don't think that anyone has claimed you can't simulate a quantum system in a classical computer
#+end_quote

I didn't claim it is impossible, it just needs to be unreasonably inefficient to do so, an example which i think shows this possibility, even if it is not the exact same as what we are describing is shor's algorithm for factorization, just imagine that in order to simulate the system you need to perform something which has a similar difference in efficiency between classical computing and reality..

  and it only needs to simulate reality to that level when someone "requests" it by making an observation
#+end_quote

This Btw also brings another assumption which i believe is baseless, you assume it is possible to simulate a world well enough(i assume that when you talk about simulating you include all of the 5 senses, as well as reality which is of no lower "resolution" then is perceivable by a human being, meaning you wont simulate an 8 bit universe where everyone are 2d sprites that can just see as simple 2.5d world with sounds coming from all around them, but instead simulate a world in as good fidelity as human beings are able to perceive, so when you dig in the send on the beach you will feel the heat and touch of the sand, when you build something in the sand it will continue to exist after you go home, and the waves will slowly run it down.

Even if we assume that the world will not continue to exist when a human is not there(what about a bacteria? an insect? a mammal?) just real simulation of all of the 5 senses at the moment is something we have nothing to suggest as possible. Today simulations which encompass such large scales take -huge- shortcuts which significantly lower the fidelity of the reality they offer. it is just fake, its good enough for people -trying- to immerse themselves in the world, but it is nowhere close to reality.

  There's no reason to simulate minds by simulating brains below whatever level is required to get the same results, for example.
#+end_quote

we do not even know if there is a more effective way of simulating human minds, it is just a guess.

#+begin_quote
  Most universes wouldn't find it necessary to do that

What makes you think most people will prefer being uploaded to not being uploaded?(that question was what brought this entire discussion in the first place, and you implied that for those people you will make the simulation identical to reality, presumably until you managed to convince them to "upload" and then be able to tend to their values more freely)
