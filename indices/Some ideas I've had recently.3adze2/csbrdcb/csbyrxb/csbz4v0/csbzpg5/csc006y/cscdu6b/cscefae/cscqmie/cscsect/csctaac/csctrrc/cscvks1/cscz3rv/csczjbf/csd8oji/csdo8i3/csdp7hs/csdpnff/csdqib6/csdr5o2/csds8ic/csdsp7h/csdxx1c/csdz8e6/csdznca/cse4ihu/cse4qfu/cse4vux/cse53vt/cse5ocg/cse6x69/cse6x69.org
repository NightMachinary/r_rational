  i was under the impression that you were saying you would upload people without their knoledge and convince then to upload ex post facto

Yeh, I get that's why we were talking past each other.

  Btw is there any kind of proof\indication that "uploading" would ever be more efficient then a brain?

Depends on how much of what the brain is doing is thinking, and how much of what the brain is doing is maintaining living cells that do the thinking. What's the computational element in the brain? Synapse? Something smaller? How many gate-equivalents are a neuron? Is it less than building that many gates out of technology T?

Given that neurons were developed from little self-repair-and-replication factories, and they still have all that overhead, it seems much more likely that they can be simulated with something smaller even if that's general-purpose enough to be programmable.
