  you are forgetting that we just said that infinite doesnt mean that you have infinity of it at any moment

Each universe only needs to be big enough to simulate reality for the population of the the inhabited planet it starts with, and the simulated reality needs to expand no faster than lightspeed.

  the universe seems to be running on a quantum ruleset, it is not proven that it is possible to build a quantum computer

I don't think that anyone has claimed you can't simulate a quantum system in a classical computer, and it only needs to simulate reality to that level when someone "requests" it by making an observation. Most of the simulation can be fairly low resolution most of the time. There's no reason to simulate minds by simulating brains below whatever level is required to get the same results, for example.

And simulating the whole universe /undetectably/ is a thought experiment you suggested, not part of my original plan. Most universes wouldn't find it necessary to do that, and besides people would catch on that something was going on when they quit aging and dying, or they started consciously reincarnating, or whatever hack I came up with to destroy death for that population.
