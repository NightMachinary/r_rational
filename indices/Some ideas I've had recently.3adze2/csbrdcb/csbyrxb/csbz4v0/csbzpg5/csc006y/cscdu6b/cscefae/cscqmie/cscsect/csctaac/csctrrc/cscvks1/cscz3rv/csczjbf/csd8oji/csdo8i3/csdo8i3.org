infinite energy doesn't, but i don't see how the technology for backing simulating, and backing up said simulation, reality to the level we discussed is any way easier then just backing up reality and manipulating it.

I don't think any one really complains about the laws of physics themselves, only about what they prevent us from doing with our current technology. now you could say that sufficient technology won't necessarily enable us to do -everything- we want, and to that i would reply that advanced technology won't necessarily enable you to simulate reality to the level that you are talking about either, or at least won't enable you to simulate it in any way which would be similarly efficient to reality..
