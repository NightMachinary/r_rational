Manipulating atoms on a large enough scale to back up and restore, say, a human? Yes, I can see that being possible though it wouldn't be instant and would probably be a destructive process. You'd need to change the laws of physics to "scan" a human at the atomic level non-destructively.

You also need to do the backup regularly, because the restore would lose everything that happened since the last backup. How often are you going to volunteer to be broken down into atoms and rebuilt?

Or you can take a less complete backup, maybe just scanning the neural connectome, and rebuilding the body from a template. That would feel even less like a "backup". I dunno, I'd rather just go through that once.

And that's just for a human. In a simulation, you can roll back whole planets to a recent snapshot.

  And anyhow infinite energy doesn't mean infinite amount of it available at any time, if a simulation is a 10 orders or magnitude less efficient then reality it would mean that the universe you will be able to maintain would be 10 orders of magnitude smaller.

First, my original post had the universe the simulation was running in growing perpetually, so you can just wait until it's big enough for whatever you want to simulate.

And don't forget, the simulation is running on simulated time. It doesn't matter how long it takes to page in bits of the universe. The simulated world will never know about it.
