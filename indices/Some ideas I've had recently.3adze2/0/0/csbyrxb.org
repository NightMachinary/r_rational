An interesting proposal. Unfortunately you forgot the part about asking everyone what they wanted.

Also, I'll clarify some limits on the pocket dimensions for everyone here: They have a finite amount of space, and have to be maintained through outside energy. The larger they are, the more energy it takes to maintain them.

I'm also more interested in initial strategies rather than the main end goal. Especially since, even with ftl, searching the entire known universe for sentient life will take a very very long time. And this ftl is of the gotta go fast rather than the portal variety. The fastest you'll ever get is a few months between galaxies, and that would require a great deal of improvement to the stuff you start with.

Edit: Thanks for the suggestion, btw. I didn't realize that other people wouldn't think of the same thing when I said "pocket dimension".
