  I can simulate whatever they want. Problem solved.

I don't think you're quite taking this seriously enough. This is the Big Problem. The fact is that a lot of folks won't want to live in a simulation, no matter how nice it is. I'm one of those people, to be honest.

The whole purpose of this exercise is to achieve some degree of harmony between vastly different value systems. Not just doing your best Celestai impression and insisting that this whole simulation thing is an absolute must for every single being in the universe. You can only ignore the desires of individuals/species if they are completely incapable of cooperation, not just if it would be more convenient to.
