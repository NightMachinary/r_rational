we are talking here about theoretical technologies, a full blown universe simulation is also something we do not know how to do at the moment, or even if it will be possible to do it. in the end you are suggesting guesses into what will be possible and not possible in reality, but taking the less positive possibility as the likely one, while doing the opposite for a simulation.

its not just that it would be slower, you have limited memory, you cannot simulate more then a certain amount..

i will give you though that from subjective aspects if you need to chose between a pure good world running in a simulation which is slower in real time it would be preferable to me over the real world running faster, but from a global perspective that might not work as well..
