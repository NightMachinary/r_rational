    An interesting proposal. Unfortunately you forgot the part about asking everyone what they wanted.

  I can simulate whatever they want. Problem solved.

Correct me if i am misinterpreting what you said, but it seemed to me like you implied by this that you can simulate the world in a way they will not be able to tell, so it is somehow better to forcibly upload them without them knowing then to let them live in reality.

If we assume that this is possible, but that doing so is using more energy then actual reality what possible reason could you have to simulate them? because you seem to imply it is better, and i cannot see how that will be better if it is less energy efficient.
