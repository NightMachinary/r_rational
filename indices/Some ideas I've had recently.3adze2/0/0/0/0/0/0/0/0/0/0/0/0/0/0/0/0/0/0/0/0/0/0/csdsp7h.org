  A full blown universe simulation is more likely than being able to do anything we can do in a full blown universe simulation in the real universe. Even Iain M. Banks Culture Minds don't have that kind of control, and that's about the most powerful civilization I can think of. They do have human level backup and restore, though it's not instant or perfect and has failure modes you wouldn't have in a simulated universe.

What are you basing this claim on? It seems awfully arbitrary to me. if we were talking about some kind of simplified universe(like in FiO) i could maybe see the argument, and to be honest even that kind of a simulation might not be possible. but i honestly cannot see any argument for a simulated reality being in any way more likely then a manipulated reality...

  I explicitly covered the "limited memory" issue. Twice now.

where? i saw you said that the univrse is ever expending, to which i answered that it might be expending and infinite but if your simulation is less efficient then it is possible that your virtual universe will be smaller, to which you responded that you could simulate slower then in real time, thus being able the simulation overcome some of the limitations, and i metnioned that even with such shortcuts you will have limits. not saying its a dealbreaker but i didnt see you mention anything that changes these limits.

  The global perspective is the simulation, it has no connection to our physical entropic universe.

When i said global vs. personal perspective i meant that as a single person i wouldn't care if in order to sustain my virtual universe with the rules i like only 10 people could stay alive in the universe, but from the point of view of whoever is designing that system deciding between 10(i am exaggerating here) 100% fully satisfied people running in a simulation which consumes all the resources of the universe, vs a few billion people only 90% happy running using those same resources seem preferable.
