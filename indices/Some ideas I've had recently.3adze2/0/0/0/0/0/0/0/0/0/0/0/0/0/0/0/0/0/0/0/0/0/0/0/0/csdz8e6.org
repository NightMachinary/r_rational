  If there is some limit to the compute structure, because that's the only reason an infinite or indefinitely expanding universe with infinite energy supplies would need to defer execution. There is no limit to the storage: energy = mass, you could literally build an infinite tape Turing Machine for storage.

you are forgetting that we just said that infinite doesnt mean that you have infinity of it at any moment, only that as time passes you have more, and that it is not limited. you could store an infinite amount of data, assuming you have infinite time, but it does not mean that at any moment you have infinite storage.. so the arguement that your virtual universe could be 10^{99999999} smaller then the actual universe it is running inside stays true, also for the people inside, it is possible that with all the resources in your universe you will only be able to simulate a cube of matter which is 15cm^{3..}

and the universe will multiply itself every 10^{10000} years, so in 10000 years you will be able to simulate 30 cm^{3,} of course that is also assuming that simulating more matter isnt exponentially more resource intensive..

  You build a cellular automaton that implements a simple computer. It doesn't matter how inefficient it is, because it's either infinite in extent or grows indefinitely so you can simply pause the simulation until you have enough resources. You run a simulation of physics on it, again, it doesn't matter how inefficient it is, because you can allocate as many processors as you need to any volume of space however small.

the universe seems to be running on a quantum ruleset, it is not proven that it is possible to build a quantum computer, thus it is possible yourinefficiency in calculation will be so big that with all the matter in the universe at your disposal you still won't be able to simulate more then a tiny amount of matter. the point being that unless we are literally talking about infinite amount of energy available to you immediately, loss of efficiency -is- important.

  You're not getting the whole point of infinite resources, are you?

i hope that with this post i clarified what aspect of "infinite" i have a problem with in your argument.
