i didn't reference that point because it has no bearing on the question of uploading people. as i said earlier, in case i misunderstood you you were free to correct me.. i was under the impression that you were saying you would upload people without their knoledge and convince then to upload ex post facto.

if what you actually suggested was: a. spread onto the rest of the universe b. prepare "computronium" so upload is possible

and thats where your plan stops then cool..

Personally i am still not sure if a simulation of reality would ever possible\effective in any way close to reality, but maybe you will convince people to live in downgraded worlds so its a non-issue

Btw is there any kind of proof\indication that "uploading" would ever be more efficient then a brain? i can see some better energy efficiency in large scale brain storage, but can't really see any inherent efficiency increase in "visualizing" the brain.. I see the concept of "uploading" is so entrenched in this circle i am just wondering if its pure fantasy or if there ever was an indication it might have something to do with reality..
