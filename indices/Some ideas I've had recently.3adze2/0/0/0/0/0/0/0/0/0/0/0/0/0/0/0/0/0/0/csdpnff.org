  The latter almost certainly requires changing the laws of physics.

If your definition of manipulation is changing the energy of electrons then yeah sure, if you definition is any kind of human related concept you could probably do it without changing any underlying laws, it won't be "real" but the effect as far as you will be able to tell would be indistinguishable.

  Once you've abandoned connection to our reality, and have infinite energy, efficiency doesn't matter.
#+end_quote

The point is that if you can achieve the same with less effort then it makes more sense then to go about a more difficult and less efficient approach.

And anyhow infinite energy doesn't mean infinite amount of it available at any time, if a simulation is a 10 orders or magnitude less efficient then reality it would mean that the universe you will be able to maintain would be 10 orders of magnitude smaller.
