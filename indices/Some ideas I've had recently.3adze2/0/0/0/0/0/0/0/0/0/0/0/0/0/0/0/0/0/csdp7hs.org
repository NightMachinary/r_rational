  infinite energy doesn't, but i don't see how the technology for backing simulating, and backing up said simulation, reality to the level we discussed is any way easier then just backing up reality and manipulating it.

The latter almost certainly requires changing the laws of physics.

  i would reply that advanced technology won't necessarily enable you to simulate reality to the level that you are talking about either, or at least won't enable you to simulate it in any way which would be similarly efficient to reality.

Once you've abandoned connection to our reality, and have infinite energy, efficiency doesn't matter.
