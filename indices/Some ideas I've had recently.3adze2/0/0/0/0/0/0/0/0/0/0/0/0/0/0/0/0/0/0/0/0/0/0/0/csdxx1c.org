  i saw you said that the univrse is ever expending, to which i answered that it might be expending and infinite but if your simulation is less efficient then it is possible that your virtual universe will be smaller, to which you responded that you could simulate slower then in real time

If there is some limit to the compute structure, because that's the only reason an infinite or indefinitely expanding universe with infinite energy supplies would need to defer execution. There is no limit to the storage: energy = mass, you could /literally/ build an infinite tape Turing Machine for storage.

  but i honestly cannot see any argument for a simulated reality being in any way more likely then a manipulated reality

You build a cellular automaton that implements a simple computer. It doesn't matter how inefficient it is, because it's either infinite in extent or grows indefinitely so you can simply pause the simulation until you have enough resources. You run a simulation of physics on it, again, it doesn't matter how inefficient it is, because you can allocate as many processors as you need to any volume of space however small.

Done.

  from the point of view of whoever is designing that system deciding between 10(i am exaggerating here) 100% fully satisfied people running in a simulation which consumes all the resources of the universe, vs a few billion people only 90% happy running using those same resources seem preferable.

You're not getting the whole point of infinite resources, are you?
