1. A full blown universe simulation is more likely than being able to do anything we can do in a full blown universe simulation in the real universe. Even Iain M. Banks /Culture/ Minds don't have that kind of control, and that's about the most powerful civilization I can think of. They /do/ have human level backup and restore, though it's not instant or perfect and has failure modes you wouldn't have in a simulated universe.

2. I explicitly covered the "limited memory" issue. Twice now.

3. The global perspective /is/ the simulation, it has no connection to our physical entropic universe.
