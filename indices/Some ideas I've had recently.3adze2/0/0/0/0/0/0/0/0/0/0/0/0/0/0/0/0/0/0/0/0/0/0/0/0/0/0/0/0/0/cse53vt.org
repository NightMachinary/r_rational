I was being flippant. My full response was:

  Build N robots with copies of my mind-state uploaded into them... well, I guess I'm already one of those... and then send them to N star systems to do the same thing. Within not too many cycles I'll have one of me at every system in the galaxy, and let these instances proceed as needed for that specific circumstances in that system. Meanwhile, repeat in the next NN galaxies until copies of me are managing the whole universe.

  Probably going to end up turning stars into more efficient energy sources, plus computronium to upload people into.

That's long term, and not certain, which is why the "probably". I mean /really/ long term. It's kind of the only option to save any current mind-states more than a trillion years or so, because supporting a whole ecosystem for the sake of two-pound chunks of fat is way less efficient than building a dedicated computational platform to run them.

Which is why I wrote:

#+begin_quote
  Regardless, getting copies of me in every place they could be needed is an obvious first step whatever the long-range plan is.
#+end_quote

Which you proceeded to ignore.
