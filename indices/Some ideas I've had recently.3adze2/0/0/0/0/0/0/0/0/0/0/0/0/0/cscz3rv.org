  Correct me if i am misinterpreting what you said, but it seemed to me like you implied by this that you can simulate the world in a way they will not be able to tell, so it is somehow better to forcibly upload them without them knowing then to let them live in reality.

In the context of my original post, yes. Because I was creating non-entropic subspaces that were growing as fast as necessary to provide enough processing time and storage to run the simulation basically forever. Really forever. Like in the Greg Egan novel /Permutation City/ I previously noted.
