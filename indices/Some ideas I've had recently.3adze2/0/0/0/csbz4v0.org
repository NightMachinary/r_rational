  An interesting proposal. Unfortunately you forgot the part about asking everyone what they wanted.

I can simulate whatever they want. Problem solved.

  They have a finite amount of space, and have to be maintained through outside energy. The larger they are, the more energy it takes to maintain them.

Build N robots with copies of my mind-state uploaded into them... well, I guess I'm already one of those... and then send them to N star systems to do the same thing. Within not too many cycles I'll have one of me at every system in the galaxy, and let these instances proceed as needed for that specific circumstances in that system. Meanwhile, repeat in the next N^{N} galaxies until copies of me are managing the whole universe.

Probably going to end up turning stars into more efficient energy sources, plus computronium to upload people into.
