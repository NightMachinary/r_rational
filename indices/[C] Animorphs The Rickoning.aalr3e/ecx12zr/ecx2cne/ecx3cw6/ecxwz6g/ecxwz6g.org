Best complement ever, thank you! Especially coming from the author of my favorite rationalfic since HPMOR. Besides the short "stories" that I've previously posted in [[/r/rational]] (see my post history or [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/aalr3e/c_animorphs_the_rickoning/ectxs84][xamueljone's comment]] above), I don't really have original fiction posted anywhere, but I may start in the future. Writing is /time-consuming/ though.
