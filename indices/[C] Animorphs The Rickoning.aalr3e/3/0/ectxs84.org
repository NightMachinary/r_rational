This coming from the guy who wrote [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7obnf7/fw_admin_message_from_god/][FW: Admin Message from God]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5v5f4i/i_feel_like_theres_a_lot_of_potential_for_a/][a Netflix series about us]], and the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/7shgd2/if_the_media_in_the_19th_century_talked_about/][article comparing flight to AI]].

I only wish I could think of writing the things you do.

Anyway, enough of the praise. Onto the helpful criticism.

You definitely have talent and from what I can tell, you are good at writing about absurd situations and finding humor in people reactions. You are also good at allowing your characters to behave and react appropriately to the event instead of becoming morons for the sake of the joke like we often see in sitcoms. Basically your settings are absurd, but your characters are not (which is why I like what you write so much). Other than Rick, but he's more of a plot device than a character anyway...

From what I can tell, this is your strength and weakness. You write very well when things are still shocking and new to your characters, but once your characters have adapted to the situation, things end very shortly after. Once Rick and Morty had a handle on things the story ended very quickly in chapter 3. I was actually expecting some sort of scene of Rick and Morty relaxing after their adventure, but we only saw their reactions and then the credits rolled.

That was fine for this short story since it seems to be very similar to how a Rick and Morty episode plays out (from the one episode I've seen so far anyway). This advice is only if you want tips on how to write a longer lasting story in the future and isn't really meant for /Animorphs: The Rickoning/. When your characters have been through a major event, give them downtime. Stories need peak and low moments. The peaks are dramatic moments that we love to read such as fight scenes, mystery reveals, and cliffhangers. While the lows are the moments in between where characters develop relationships between each other, spend time pursuing a favored hobby, and having regular slice-of-life events that teach the reader what their personalities are like.

Don't really know if this is helpful since it's not stuff about what you posted (it was perfect and I couldn't think of a single thing to improve), but I hope it's useful for when you might want to write longer stories.
