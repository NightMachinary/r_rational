I'd love to do this, but I probably won't, due to life stuff and other writing projects. I have a plan for at least one more Rick and Morty fic, but I haven't been able to fit the plot with any existing ratfics. It's shaping up to be an original high concept sci-fi tale with some Rick and Morty humor. If I write it, it will probably come out at least 6 months from now. I might be able to do a Mother of Learning crossover for the opening scene, but I don't think the whole plot can take place there.
