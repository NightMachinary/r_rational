  That's not really something I'd expect to hear from Rick and Morty. It's way too technical and specific.
#+end_quote

Agree. These versions of Rick and Morty have somewhat diverged from the show stylistically, for a variety of reasons. In the particular part you quote, sounding technical and specific was exactly what I wanted to go for.

  In any dramatic story, that reveal would either be the big climax that the story built up to (everything you knew was a lie!), or a part of the premise that the characters spent the whole story digesting. ....

  In crackfic, it's just something to get out of the way in one paragraph so we can go fight dinosaurs.
#+end_quote

Yup, totally agree. If I approached this as a regular story I would never have skipped over that part so quickly. (Also, it would be 20 chapters long, I'd still be writing it next year, and I'd have gone insane by chapter 10.)

  this is essentially the point where I quit
#+end_quote

Totally get it - this style fic most definitely isn't for everyone. However, I do think that in chapter 2 I actually addressed your criticisms within the limits of what is possible for a short frenetic crackfic. Styled fully as a series of short r!Animorphs chapters, the thematic point was to show realistic character psychologies when confronted with the absurd. I mean, Esplin gets 3 POVs in that chapter and Marco gets 2, all of which are extremely reflective as compared to ch. 1, and I could have written much more but I had to stop myself.
