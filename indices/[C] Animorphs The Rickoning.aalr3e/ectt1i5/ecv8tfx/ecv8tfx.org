Well, I'm not a real writer either, but here's some feedback:

  Morty: Rick? Can you please pre-target the portal gun to the blender dimension?
#+end_quote

That's not really something I'd expect to hear from Rick and Morty. It's way too technical and specific. Like, in the episode where it's introduced, the joke about the "Blender dimension" is that it's something that sounds ridiculous and incredibly specific and unusual, and yet the characters act like it was an established part of their everyday life. "Portal gun to the Blender dimension? That's the oldest Rick trick in the book!"

It's not a joke you can repeat a second time, by definition. A better joke would be something like:

*Morty:* Rick? What's the baddest, darkest, most terrifying dimension you have? Like, like, if you really want to get rid or something, like, like throw it into the sun except worse? I mean-

*Rick:* Oh, I've got a ton of those. There's the blender dimension, the black hole dimension, the dimension where everyone looks like Hitler, the carnivorous planets dimension, the tentacle monster dimension, there's, there's, like, a ton of those, Morty! I mean, forget that last one, you're probably a little too young for that last one, but any other dimension, sure, there's a ton of them!

*Morty:* Okay, then, just set the portal gun to one of these things you just mentioned.

*Rick:* Why?

  The Animorphs morph into birds and fly above the treeline, making sure to watch out for any predatory Pterodactyls in the vicinity. They find a ledge on a high rock formation and alight. A few minutes later, they've all morphed into Morty. A few minutes after that, most have demorphed in abject horror. Garrett starts vomiting. Rachel morphs into a bear and destroys a nearby shrub. Jake and Marco remain in Morty-morph, absorbing every detail. Finally, they demorph. Tobias is the first to speak.

That paragraph represents why I don't like crackfics, cross-overs, SI fics and basically every other weird-but-codified fanfiction concept.

In any dramatic story, that reveal would either be the big climax that the story built up to (everything you knew was a lie!), or a part of the premise that the characters spent the whole story diggesting. In r!Animorphs, for instance, both Visser 3 and the gang spend entire chapters doing nothing but considering past revelations (humans getting the morph cube, the fact that the war is manipulated by omnipotent gods, etc) and thinking through their implications.

In crackfic, it's just something to get out of the way in one paragraph so we can go fight dinosaurs. The revelation barely has any weight because everyone just acts shocked for ten seconds, then just rolls with it for the rest of the story. I don't really want to say it's /bad/ writing (but it totally is); in any case, it's really not for me, and this is essentially the point where I quit.

(this is also why I've stopped reading /With this Ring/, and why /Worth the Candle/ is the only SI story I still read)
