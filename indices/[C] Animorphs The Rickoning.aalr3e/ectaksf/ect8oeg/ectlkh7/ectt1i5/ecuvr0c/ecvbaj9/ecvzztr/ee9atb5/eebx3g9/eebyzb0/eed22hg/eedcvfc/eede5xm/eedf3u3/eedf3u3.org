Got it. I recommended them in part because of how well the authors do "multiple rational characters each with their own personalities" that you might find similar to Reckoning, if that's a major appeal of it for you beyond the Animorphs setting (it certainly is for me), but there's definitely some commitment to get far enough into them. Interested to hear what you think if you ever do!
