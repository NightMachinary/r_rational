- The structure of chapter 1 is directly modeled after a Rick and Morty episode, but the events differ of course.
- The last little scene before the credits is essentially taken directly from the show
- Portals in the show can do essentially arbitrary things, but all the weird physics is post hoc rationalization by me.
- Morties are treated similarly in the show with respect to Ricks, although there is none of the "Rick-Morty bond" stuff. There is an episode where a particularly evil Rick uses a ton of Morties as a shield against being located.
- Unity is a real character in Rick and Morty who has dated Rick, though she is not portrayed as an Eldritch god.
- The general tentacly weirdness is present throughout the show.
- The show has songs of comparable weirdness. Look up "Terryfold" on youtube. Edit: Oh yeah, and Get Schwifty is just directly from an episode.

Edit 2: Oh yeah, and Rick is still a genius alcoholic nihilist in the show, and also Tiny Rick is from the show. (If you thought Tiny Rick was weird, there is an episode where Rick literally just turns himself into a pickle and goes around doing stuff as a pickle)
