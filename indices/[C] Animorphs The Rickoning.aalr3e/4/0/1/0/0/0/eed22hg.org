Hahaha, I would love to, except...

...I was never that into Pokemon so I haven't read your Pokemon fanfic...

...sorry.

I'm really only on this subreddit for r!Animorphs. However, the next installment of the Rickverse will probably be called "Rick and Morty: Into the Rickverse," and it will be a sprawling high-concept sci-fi epic with plenty of room for Rick and Morty to briefly visit the rest of the rationalverses they haven't already. I'm sure I can Cronenberg up "Pokemon: The Origin of Species" somehow...
