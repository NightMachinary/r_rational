Yeah, I'm not generally into other fanfiction. When I saw r!Animorphs here a few years ago, I just had to read it, because I loved Animorphs as a kid, and thought it was fertile ground for the HPMOR treatment. That's the only reason I started posting on [[/r/rational]]

The only other fic I follow here is Mother of Learning, because a friend strongly recommended it to me. I think MOL is just alright, but I'm committed until the end now.

I have glanced at Worth the Candle and read several chapters of Practical Guide to Evil. They seemed fun, but they didn't hold my interest enough to read through them any time soon. I have lots of books to read on my Kindle already. Thanks for the recommendations, though!
