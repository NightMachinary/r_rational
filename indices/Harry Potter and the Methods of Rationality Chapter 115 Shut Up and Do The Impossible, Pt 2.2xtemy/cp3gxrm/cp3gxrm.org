I know it wouldn't fit the narrative, but I was hoping for a certain kind of outcome. When the chair was created I was seriously hoping for a moment when Harry would hide Quirrel, sit in it and call people to him. Voldemort is apparently dead, the death eaters are dead, Hermione is alive. His most potent enemies are destroyed and his friend has been resurrected
