  So what's the purpose of putting on this big, elaborate lie? To hide the Philosopher's Stone from those who would want to take it from him? To hide the fact that he's a murderer (even if it's justifiable)? To hide the fact that he's at least partly Tom Riddle?

Also, to give Tom a chance to grow up normal. If the Wizarding World knew that V wasn't really dead and this other guy is a mindwiped V, they'd try for vengeance, kill him themselves or otherwise treat him in such a way that he'd go Dark due to a lack of other options.

EDIT: And what would Harry be without a Dar- an apprentice?
