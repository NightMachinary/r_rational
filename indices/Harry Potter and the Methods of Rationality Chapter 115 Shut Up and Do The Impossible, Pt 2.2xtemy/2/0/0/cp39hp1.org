Prophecy suggested Harry might free people trapped in a mirror. I think it is not impossible he will free D. before story's end - we still have significant wrapup chapters. Possibly he will send the now-current time's D. to stand in the mirror, and then appear with Quirrellmort, then release him from the mirror all in a subjective 2-3 minutes from Dumbledore's perspective.
