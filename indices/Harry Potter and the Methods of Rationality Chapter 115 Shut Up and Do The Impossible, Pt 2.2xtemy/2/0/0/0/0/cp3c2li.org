Ch. 110, Dumbledore to Tom Riddles:

#+begin_quote
  "So I am sending you outside Time, to a frozen instant from which neither I nor any other can return you. *Perhaps Harry Potter will be able to retrieve you someday, if prophecy speaks true.* He may wish to discuss with you just who is at fault for the deaths of his parents. For you it will only be an instant - if you ever return at all. Either way, Tom, I wish you the best of it."
