I wonder who Harry will allow to know the truth - certainly he can't let it be public knowledge for fear of biasing Riddle again, but it would do the next generation a disservice to deny them the truth. Maybe he'll tell Dumbledore as a backup (in case the immortality-for-everyone plan doesn't work out), and ask him to let visitors know it after Riddle has either died or grown into an ethical person.
