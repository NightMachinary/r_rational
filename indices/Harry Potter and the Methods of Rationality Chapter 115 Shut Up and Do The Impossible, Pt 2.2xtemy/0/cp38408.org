I'm not sure what Harry is playing at, setting up a story here. Or really, /why/ he's setting up a story. Voldemort is dead. The Death Eaters are dead. Dumbledore is stuck in time. Hermione has been returned to life. Harry has the Philosopher's Stone.

So what's the purpose of putting on this big, elaborate lie? To hide the Philosopher's Stone from those who would want to take it from him? To hide the fact that he's a murderer (even if it's justifiable)? To hide the fact that he's at least partly Tom Riddle?

He does all of this without really having an internal monologue of /why/ he's doing it. And if this weren't so close to the end of the story, this is the sort of thing that I would expect to backfire horribly.
