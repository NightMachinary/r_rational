Every "good" nation is already waging war with her. Every "evil" nation is either already on her side (Praes), impartial (King of Dead atm) or to my understanding indifferent towards surface dwellers (King Under/Drows). Only entity that remains is Free Cities but they are atm mostly doing their own thing.

I also think that it would be good deterrent against future wars. If enemy knows you can pop up anywhere in their country they will think twice before attacking. This could also be good to support any allies.

Regarding heroes. This seemed like a bit wobbly argument to me even when they talked about Liesse. They are facing Crusade, I would think this means that all Heroes on continent are already stacking against them.
