Yeah I know it sounds bad, but last time she choose to back of from drastic measures it resulted in 100k dead Callowans. Here she has the opportunity to take war to Procer, to force Procer forces to back out or face extinction and to show she is willing to go for mutually assured destruction.

It just grates on my nerves that she allways says that people of Callow are her first priority, but anytime there is choice to be made, she always chooses the way that results in more damage to Callow and more dead Callowans.
