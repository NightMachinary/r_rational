  I also don't like her reasoning. She has secret weapon for second time. She has a way to avoid spilling Callowan blood and she is not going to take it. Because it would make rest of Carelia her enemy? The rest of Carelia is waging war with her. She has 14 heroes on her doorstep. Did she learn nothing from Liese and Akua?

Oh yeah, all she has to do to stop the war is to burn dozens of cities to the ground and kill tens of thousands of civilians, over the course of many months, until the enemy country collapses. And hope the 14 heroes go away on their own after that, and that Procer doesn't kill immense amounts of Callowan civilians as retributions while she's busy razing the Proceran countryside.
