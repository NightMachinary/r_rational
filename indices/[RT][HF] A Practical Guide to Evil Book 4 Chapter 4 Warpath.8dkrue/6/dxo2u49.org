I have to say I don't see the end game of this story. South of Callow is in ruins, north is about to be fucked. I have no doubt, that someone is going to release that demon in Harrow and that most of norther part of kingdom is going to be fucked. Even if she wins she is going to rule over dead and ashes.

I also don't like her reasoning. She has secret weapon for second time. She has a way to avoid spilling Callowan blood and she is not going to take it. Because it would make rest of Carelia her enemy? The rest of Carelia is waging war with her. She has 14 heroes on her doorstep. Did she learn nothing from Liese and Akua?

Also why that reluctance to massacre Procean troops (even if she could)? Procer cant wage protracted war on her. They have other threads to worry about. Cordelia said that herself in one of her interludes.
