I had a theory on this series for a while now. The reason for the success of the calamities and the woe is that they put themselves into the roles of heros. Hero's fight for a cause greater than themselves. Hero's are merciful and self sacrificing. It does not matter quite as much as people think it does to BE a villain vs a hero. It is much more important what you are based on the story you are a part of in the moment. I believe that the Calamities and the Woe are decent evidence for that. So from the perspective of the story, this is not a crusade, this is the invasion of a soveign nation by an evil empire. Farther the hero's are not hero's but assasins. They are villans, seeking to depose of a rightful and relitively popular ruler, bringing chaos to the kingdom in preparation for an invasion. Cat farther solidifies that by welcoming the hero's and offering mercy to them, which they throw back in her face, just as a villain might.
