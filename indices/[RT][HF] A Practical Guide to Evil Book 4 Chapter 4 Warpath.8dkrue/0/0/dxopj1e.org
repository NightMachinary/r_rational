They're not used to working together-the ones Thief managed to get info on are all solo heroes. Cat's plan is probably to skirmish and defeat them in as small of groups as she can get them, all along reinforcing the narrative that she's the rightful ruler trying to defend against invaders and getting them to sue for peace. Not a good story to be going against as heroes-the righteousness of their cause falters as soon as they meet the average Callowan on the street, a good person that doesn't want their country burning and is FINE with Cat as a ruler. She'll rip right through them until Grey Pilgrim does some mentoring shenanigans.
