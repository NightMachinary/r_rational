There are already hints that the Saint had bones to pick with the nobility since her last act before going into a decades long training montage was to turn into sashimi a prince. Furthermore since the Saint will be acompanying a very corrupt, self serving and little "e evil" noble. I can expect that she will get tired of dealing with the noble's shit very soon.

The ony thing Cat have going for her is that the heroes suffer from Conservation of Ninjutsu and that maybe Cat can take advantage on the fact that the world runs on Plot-onium to reframe the story from "Crusade to off a Tyrant" into "Rightful Ruler fights off Invaders"

Cat is planning to turn the war into an atrition campaing to convince procer to fall back (Russia's General *Winter* vs Napoleon/Hitler) when i read that my mind blew up. maybe there is somekind of prediction there maybe not, but the concept of cat summoning gral winter to her cause sounds fun.
