Up to and including the fourteen heroes in the party. I seriously hope the Saint of Swords will have some kind of long-term conflict with one of the princes getting resolved in the middle of the campaign, because if the Pilgrim takes the point for this story, we may well expect stuff like story-mandated resurrection during a climactic battle.
