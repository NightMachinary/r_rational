Cat's gambit is extremely risky but I can see it paying off.

If the Dead King and the Tyrant attack the Principate and Cat doesn't totally butcher the invading army the First Prince would likely reevaluate Callow's usefulness. If the Big Bads are powerful enough an alliance would make political (and narrative) sense - the good guys have to ally with a lesser evil in order to defeat a greater one.

It strikes me that the purpose of the monthly meetings between Cat and Cordelia might have nothing to do with diplomacy or even with seizing each other up. Rather, Cat used is as a way to make herself sympathetic.

Hardly any time was spent on diplomacy - essentially both sides reiterated their position - but Cat talked at length about her mistakes, her motivations, her idea of ruling. Trying to find common ground in history and having an honest discussion about principles of governance... she was courting Cordelia for a future alliance.
