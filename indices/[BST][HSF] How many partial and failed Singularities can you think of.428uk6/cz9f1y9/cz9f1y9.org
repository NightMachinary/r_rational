There are some potential issues that could become important when Max Plank's "Science advances one funeral at a time," is fully considered in this context. If you either reduce the rate of funerals, or increase the rate of revolutions, I think you would run into the same problem. Economic pressures would be brought to bear against the existing culture of Science-with-a-capital-S, and presumably the culture would fall apart first.

There's little (but not zero) reason to suppose that the resulting cultural collapse would leave the parts of science that we like, mass publication and sharing of technique, popular and common after the idea of a "Scientific legacy" was disrupted. A less-collegiate atmosphere itself could retard advancement.
