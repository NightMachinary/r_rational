What exactly do you mean by "Singularity"? Your concept of it seems to include a lot of stuff that is not included in my concept of it.

When I say "Singularity", I am referring to the moment that a system that is better at designing systems than its designer was starts iteratively designing better systems. I don't know what it would mean to partially do that, or to fail to do that in some nontrivial way. I can /conjecture/ lots of things that may follow from that event, but the event itself is reasonably unambiguous, I think.

Is one of us using the word wrong?
