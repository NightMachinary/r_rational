Creation of brain implant that gifts to all humans photographic memory. Fifty years or so of accelerated research, since more readily accessible information means more potential connections and insights. Assume effective immortality in the form of agelessness is invented. Knowledge generation slows down as scientists become able to leverage their gained years into financial success, and thus can self-fund their own research, leading to highly insightful and innovative science being conducted in many parts of the word in secret; as a result, the level of knowledge found in public domain publishing of new experiments, while now decentralized, becomes the metaphorical undergrad to the scientist-recluses' post-post-grad.
