I know - I specifically meant the colloquially referenced photographic memory, not eidetic memory.

I should have specified before, but I also mean something a bit more powerful, beyond the ability to read a page and then recall the image of the page later, to read once more sentences forgotten (I almost had the ability when very young, so I know what you mean). I should have rather said the ability to /glance/ at a page and read it later; such a person could glance at the pages of physics textbooks from introductory to graduate level, then go lie down, and mentally read the pages at an advanced rate, focus allowing. Since it'd be an implant of artificial neurons, once a subject were understood, that understanding wouldn't go away, and any memories of confusion could be forgotten.

The primary advantage is in having expert-level understanding of many different fields, with which the brain could draw many insightful connections; the present day equivalent is two experts from different fields working together on a project, and chance sparking insight into the mind of one of the experts. Google Search does not assist in the generation of insight in human brains: without connectomes already containing information, insight of one connectome's relation to three other connectomes can't be drawn in the first place.

Granted, inability to do complicated calculations in one's head limits the usefulness the implant might have to some fields' experts. Assume another implant solves that problem, twenty years post-singularity.
