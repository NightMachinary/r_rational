  You think that if you're not a natural at something, that means you'll just have to live with forever being bad at it.

Not exactly, no. The point I'm making is that the memory thing doesn't help with technical skills any more than having a medical textbook on hand will make you a surgeon. Quite the contrary to the quote, though, I never had this problem. Whether by pluck or narcissism, I usually only accept that I'm bad at something as a result of overwhelming evidence. This has happened exactly once, with music composition, after about a dozen songs, reading everything I could find on the subject, and about twenty hours total of trying.

  I read something in a fanfiction where one character asked another to do something, and got back "I can't". The response was something like "you only think you can't because you didn't immediately know how. At the absolute minimum, spend 5 real minutes - by the clock, no cheating - giving this your absolute attempt.

The fanfiction you're thinking of is probably HPMoR. From chapter 25:

  You /never/ called /any/ question impossible, said Harry, until you had taken an actual clock and thought about it for five minutes, by the motion of the minute hand. Not five minutes metaphorically, five minutes by a physical clock.
