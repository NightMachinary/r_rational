I agree that you're underestimating, based upon your comment history ("cloning but metabolism" meaning mitosis is a nice insight) and that you said yes to the second. The second is more important for generating insight, as it can be applied to one's knowledge manually via introspection.

I sympathize with you on being slow on the uptake. At times I have to model others' understanding of a given situational context in order to grasp the salient topics, though I'm sure you have it ten times as bad. That said, having had and lost acumen in memory, I'd still say you're lucky.

Why the difficulty with public tranportation? Enough fidelity to access the potential memory you seek to recall, but not enough fidelity to be certain whether the recalled memory is accurate or conflated?
