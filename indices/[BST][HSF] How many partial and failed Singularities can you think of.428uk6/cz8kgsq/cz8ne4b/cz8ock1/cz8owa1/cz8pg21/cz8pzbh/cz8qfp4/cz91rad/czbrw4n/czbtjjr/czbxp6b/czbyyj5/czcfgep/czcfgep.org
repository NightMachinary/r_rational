People have google maps which does provide directions for public transport in Toronto, provides the direction where you travel and plots the course on a map which should be all you need. Street view is an added bonus.

Consciously altering a mental direction whenever you turn is what I do when I'm going down unfamiliar streets, it doesn't require necessarily require good multitasking skills just that you take a second to mentally review where you are in relation to some known location or location whenever you take a turn or enter a new street. Knowing the rough direction of a area you are familiar with helps avoid getting lost. It is improving your navigation skills through deliberate practice. When you navigate in the same place often enough it becomes unnecessary because you can just recognize the area and remember where it is.

It's not necessary in familiar areas or small places like a grocery store (It's not like you are going to forget which way of the store is the front and even if you do you can just look up and around to reorient yourself in the store).

Just because they are not going the same place as you at the moment doesn't mean they have never gone there before and remember the route. If they have been in the city for a while and take public transport often then eventually they will get familiar with most places.

What I'm saying is that the best way to get familiar with public transport isn't to memorize all the schedules. You just need to learn the routes of the buses you need, take them and remember where you went.
