Understanding of city layouts doesn't have to be intuitive. You just need a decent local map.

The online planner should tell you the stops. Each stop individual stop is only one side of the street. All vehicles on that side of the street are going in the same direction.

To keep track of directions without a compass you just need to work out where the direction is in relation to the direction you are facing and then consciously alter it whenever you turn into a different street. It becomes unnecessary only when you are familiar with the area.

People become familiar with a route once and then don't worry about it again. The people who you are asking didn't learn because they memorized all the bus time tables. They learned from using an online planner, asking a bus driver or friend. Alternatively they could have called the public transport help line. Once they learn the route they start taking it and it gets solidified in their memory. When they screw up they learn from their mistakes.
