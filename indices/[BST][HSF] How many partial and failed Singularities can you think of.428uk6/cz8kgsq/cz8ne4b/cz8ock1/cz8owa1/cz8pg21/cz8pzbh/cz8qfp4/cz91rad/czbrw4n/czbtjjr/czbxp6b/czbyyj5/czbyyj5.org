For the first two, I haven't seen anyone use a physical map in almost a decade, and in my part of Toronto stops are almost always on both sides of any given street (and often at all four points of an intersection), with the lines going on the same route in opposite directions sharing a name.

As for consciously altering a mental direction whenever I turn, I've seen people struggle to /count/ while doing other tasks. Are you suggesting it's normal for a person to actively mentally keep track of which direction is which while, say, grocery shopping?

As for the fourth point, as a rule anyone I ask for directions is going to a different place than I am. They never consult the internet, ask directions themselves, or make phone calls. Without exception, I lack the information to derive the solutions myself.
