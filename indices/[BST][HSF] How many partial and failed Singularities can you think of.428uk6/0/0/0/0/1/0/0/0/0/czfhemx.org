Hm, I was off mark, then. And yes, hpmor is definitely where I got it from. You can see how my memory of the understanding, not the specifics, influenced how I said it.

I'm still curious about what your thoughts are for long term memories.

Also, my theory is that our lifelong patterns and specialties are formed due to the perceived ease or difficulty when trying different things. It's perceived because we're comparing our skill to others to determine if we're better, and who we're compared to matters. You saw you were better at memory, so you focused on how to use it to solve problems, which led to bottom up thinking. I saw I was better at understanding, so I went to bottom up thinking.

I suppose I'm trying to get an answer to "Are you able to separate how a better memory affected you verses how being better than your peers affected you?"

Because the whole point of this discussion is to determine the viability and complexity of writing about a global increase in memory, which is exclusively that first category. If you can't even tell between them, this whole topic is unwritable (unless you used it as an example of something you can sort of but never fully understand, like a world of color blind people learning to see color.)
