Interesting, because I'm largely the opposite. I'm a programmer, and phenomenal at learning new things and great at remembering understandings but horrible at remembering facts. I've started organizing notes in different ways, since I'll remember that I was convinced of something but not remember how. If I don't make the notes, I'll also forget the why. I'm actually incapable of doing heavy memorization roles, like biology or history or a foreign language. I don't genuinely remember something until I use it practically.

I wouldn't expect you to learn things faster, but I'm wondering if that's different the second time you learn something similar. The way I get better at things is to remember what worked last time and repeat it until I figure out the pattern of successful behavior. This is limited by how much I can remember, so I feel like I would gain more from every experience just by retaining more to think about later. The first time you try something, you're on equal ground, but you get more knowledge per experience, so you'd outpace others.

I'm also curious about the much longer term effect. I've been out of college for three years and I can name 2 college professors. Memories of childhood friends are feelings and faces. No places, words, event specifics, or sounds carry over decades.

Not just long term facts, but also long term understandings. I can't do long division by hand without needing to reverse engineer it. I forgot how to write some letters in cursive. I couldn't tell you how to build a computer after ordering all the parts, because all I know is the last 7 times I did this I figured it out without extra help and in 3 hours, so I can reasonably assume I can do that again. You can just remember the steps.

This also might have shaped us into our specialties: I rely on repeatable understandings (how to build a computer) and you get a more detailed layer (the arrangement of steps in the manual). If the computer is a different model, though, you have a lot more work than I do to incorporate it - when things change, the patterns that normally work for you might suddenly not. You remembered that in the last computer model, you plugged in the power to the motherboard first, then hard drive. I remembered vaguely the power needs to be plugged in, and then look for where it fits. For me, a different model changes at a level below where I care about, because I'm remembering the category, not instructions. Nothing about the categories changes in a new model, so I don't see it as additional effort just because the model changed this time. Replace computer with something that changes less, like a biology textbook, and that's why you find yourself better at it.

This is also top down (understanding the concept for identifying the missing facts) vs bottom up (using the existing facts to create an understanding). I pretty much exclusively think in top down, and it sounds like having a memory like yours teaches you to think bottom up. I'm great at hearing "make a new car" and imagining all the separate tasks as prioritizable categories, and you're great at getting a list of car parts and figuring out what model it is. This is irrespective of natural talent of a particular skill, too.

Also, the tone of your response rings bells in my head. You think that if you're not a natural at something, that means you'll just have to live with forever being bad at it. I read something in a fanfiction where one character asked another to do something, and got back "I can't". The response was something like "you only think you can't because you didn't immediately know how. At the absolute minimum, spend 5 real minutes - by the clock, no cheating - giving this your absolute attempt. To say you can't without at least one meaningful attempt is wasteful and will lead to perpetually underestimating yourself ." I've since taken that to heart, and found that my lifelong "I can't draw, I can't play music, and I can't write" was totally shattered by - for what was probably the first time in my life - actually trying. I'm not quite sure what about your responses makes me think you could just this advice, but maybe it's helpful.

This worked too for silly things like yoyos and hula hoops. Really, I'm a lot less specialized to computers, math, and programming than I thought. I just only learned this when I read that advice, a year ago.
