I can't separate everything well enough to say for sure, and I'm extremely high-variance (high neuroticism, high scrupulosity, high Dark Triad, abnormal emotional traits...). That said, as a rule, I'm on average better at things that have cross-disciplinary synergy like painting, writing, solving riddles, rhetoric, philosophy, biology, and so on, but not subjects with lots of prerequisite knowledge, like physics, chemistry, and math (obviously these aren't mutually exclusive). This is bearing in mind that I'm actually pretty good at math, just not as much as you'd expect if you guessed based on my ability at biology.

Within subjects, I tend to pick up theoretical knowledge much faster than practical or technical ability. For example, my brushstrokes are horrible, but my composition is spectacular.

The issue stems from there; I don't pick up /technical/ abilities any faster than normal, and everything /non/-technical is just a glorified magic trick. Past a certain point, I have no choice but to learn the technical skills, so I have a broad theoretical knowledge but more-or-less average ability within my actual areas of expertise. Which brings me back to the Google Search point.
