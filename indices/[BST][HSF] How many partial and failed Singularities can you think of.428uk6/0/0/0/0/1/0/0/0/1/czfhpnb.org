Also yes, I fully understand a medical textbook on hand doesn't make you a surgeon.

My point was that on average, I'd want my surgery from the surgeon with the figurative textbook on hand, rather than the surgeon without one.

Separately, my wandering thoughts were about whether that means all surgeons would do better with better memory than without it. And then which professions or situations that it is concretely always better in, which led to "what does better memory affect, before personality and culture and job specifics join the equation?" to "is this question answerable?" to where I was with my other posts.
