No to the first, yes to the second. Disparate facts don't associate themselves unless they're directly addressed, so while I can pick up on obscure references and solve riddles pretty quickly, I almost never make long leaps of logic, even if I have all the pieces to a given puzzle. I'm actually pretty slow on the uptake, in large part because I have no idea what I'm expected to know and way too many potential matches to go through. It's like trying to find matching socks in a drawer with ten thousand pairs. It took me weeks just to figure out public transportation, and even then I still stop to ask directions pretty much every time I ride the bus.

I can't say whether it'd be easier to learn from a memorized text, because I can't memorize or visualize images with high enough fidelity to read them. The closest I can come is reconstructing old memories based on the shapes of letters and lengths of words.

For the last point, I have no idea. Typical Mind Fallacy would suggest that I'm way underestimating how much I rely on my memory, but at the same time I think the information itself is less important than the ability to make the inferences. Everyone who came before Archimedes had all the tools they needed to work out the volume measurement, but it took more than that to make the connection.
