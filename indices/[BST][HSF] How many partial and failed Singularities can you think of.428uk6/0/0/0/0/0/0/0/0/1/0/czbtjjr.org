That doesn't match anything I've seen. For one, I use online planners as well, often writing out or memorizing the exact route I need to take. Unfortunately, there's never any indication of which direction the bus is going, meaning that just knowing I need to take, say, bus 95B, doesn't help in and of itself unless I also know where I am, which direction is which, and how those two things relate. For another, when I stop passersby to ask directions, they usually have an easy time figuring out how I should get where I'm going.

Putting these two together, this would seem to suggest some sort of "obvious" information that I'm missing, such as an intuitive understanding of city layouts, or the ability to easily keep track of directions without a compass or any particular effort. It could just be that my proverbial river is full of red herrings, or it could be a straightforward deficiency, or anything else under the sun; I have no information to go on.
