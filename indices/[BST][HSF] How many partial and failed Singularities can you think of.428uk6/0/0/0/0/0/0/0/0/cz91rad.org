I have no idea why, actually - or rather, I don't know how other people have such an easy time with it. The only way I could imagine getting the level of understanding everyone and their mother seems to have is by sitting down for half an hour and brute force memorizing all the bus schedules. Which is ridiculous, because obviously everyone else who rides the bus never did that.

That might be a personal quirk, actually. It could very well be that my memory isn't the cause, but a mitigating factor.

EDIT: Relating to your first point, here's how my thought process worked: cloning but metabolism, sounds like cloning but you have to eat a lot, sounds like you eat then clone then eat then clone, sounds like mitosis, but for people. Unless my attention is drawn to a specific subject, I can and usually do fail to draw the link. Someone smarter than me might have an easier time with it, but by and large it seems like that logical leap is the limiting reagent here.
