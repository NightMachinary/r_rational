Does your memory allow you to associate many superficially disparate facts with each other with little effort? Do you notice unique patterns because you have more knowledge to inform split-second analysis? The answer to those questions informs the viability of the scenario.

I think the second underlying assumption is deep understanding can be more easily achieved when reading mental images than when using eyes. If that's not true, then the scenario has little credibilty.

I say little, because for a smart person who's excellent at drawing connections but has a horrible memory, the implant would greatly assist the degree of intellectual insight they'd be capable of producing.
