That's sort of my point, though. I can give you specific details about books I read decades ago, and even recite passages verbatim. I accidentally got the wrong Intro to Sociology textbook in my first year at university, and I still got top marks even though half my grade was based on information from a book I didn't have - because I'd run into most of those experiments before and still remembered them. I can draw an accurate geographic map of the world from memory, though any detail I've never explicitly noticed will be absent and Sri Lanka will probably be in the wrong place.

And, despite all of that, I /still suck at calculus/. Those things I mentioned are parlor tricks, just like everything else an 'eidetic' memory can do. All that rote memorization is useless without a deep understanding of the subject material, and believe me when I say that it's no easier if you have the book in your head than it is if you have it in front of you. And again on the Google Search point, because you can do all of those things too; all you need is a computer so small it fits in your pocket.
