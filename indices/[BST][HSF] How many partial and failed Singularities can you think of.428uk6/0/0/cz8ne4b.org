Real 'photographic' memory isn't all it's cracked up to be, and even the kind of perfect memory you describe wouldn't do much. I have something moderately close to that (I know people tend to exaggerate on the internet but I actually do have a classic 'photographic' memory with measurable effects), but it doesn't help with academics past precalculus. It's also considerably less powerful than Google Search, so you shouldn't expect it to revolutionize anything in a world that already has Google Search.
