- Al-Hazard : the civilization was on the way to breaching Singularity-after-Singularity, ever-accelerating... until something went Wrong. Maybe it two Singletons-to-be planned too far around each other, maybe some completely unexpected event pulled the rug out from the main actors, maybe someone got just a little too much power, or maybe someone decided to put far too much [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_refrigerator][computational power into a toaster]]. Maybe the Singularity itself was a dead end, and someone built an AI that paved over most of the planet to print out a proof Riemann hypothesis. But whatever there was is broken, and it's left its bones nearly everywhere.

- Not Dreamed of in Your Philosophy : There was a gap in the machine. Maybe the AI's maximum word size was too small, maybe too many things were excluded from self-modification, or maybe the folk that bootstrapped themselves up were a little odd. But while the overwhelming majority of the solar system has turned into computronium, or vacuum tubes, or paperclips, the Planet Earth has had a slightly odder time. Some portion of the people were Outside Context Problems to the Singularity itself, and what we see today are the remainder who survived from its escape from the crazies.

- The Closed Box : The folk who "have bad understandings of infinity" won, and the Singularity put 98% of the populace in a shoebox. In a couple billion years it might move to another planet, but there's no /hurry/.

- (On and Off) The Nature Preserve : The Singularity left people behind /intentionally/, either because the dominant groups excluded them, or because they were given the option to not sign up. There might even be communication or travel between those who went along and those who stayed behind, but the difference in timescales and desires and interests is so vast that it's pretty uncommon. The sky is filled with God's Dust, but Earth and the earth was inherited by the meek and the Amish.

- Scientific Progress Goes Thwack: There isn't a Singularity, not in the Kurzweil sense. The technology scales upwards, endlessly, and culture changes dramatically... but people stay the same. A time-displaced protagonist might not understand the language, or know the norms for how to look both ways before crossing the cyber-street, but nobody's turned into Tang and there's no equivalent to Languagev2.

- Glorious Future Nonawakening. The aesthetics of the future are /weird/, and weird in ways that people in the setting can't really handle or adapt to. Everyone's been uploaded into a universe where martial arts really do predict success at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaolin_Soccer][wildly]] varying [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_of_Cookery][goals]], or even an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Fu_Hustle][internally meaningful enlightenment]], and people treat this [[http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?480387-setting-brainstorm-Kung-Fu-Transhumanism][the same as they do power in a world of scarcity]].
