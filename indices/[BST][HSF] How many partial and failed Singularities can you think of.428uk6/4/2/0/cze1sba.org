I don't generally watch TV/film SF -- it's too hard on my teeth (my dentist loves the splintering effect all the plot/world-building flaws have on my dental work).

A friend once forced me to watch an episode of "Firefly". That's an hour of my life he owes me. The only TV SF I've been able to follow in the past decade has been the 'toons -- Futurama, Invader Zim, and so on. (They're comfortably far across the other side of the uncanny valley of realism from where my imagination lives.)
