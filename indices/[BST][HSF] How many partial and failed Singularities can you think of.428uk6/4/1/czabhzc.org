  (On and Off) The Nature Preserve : The Singularity left people behind intentionally, either because the dominant groups excluded them, or because they were given the option to not sign up. There might even be communication or travel between those who went along and those who stayed behind, but the difference in timescales and desires and interests is so vast that it's pretty uncommon. The sky is filled with God's Dust, but Earth and the earth was inherited by the meek and the Amish.

This was the one I'm planning to use, should I ever grow a gajillion hours of spare time out of the side of my chest and write a wanky scifi novel.

The people of the future believed in /freedom/ in carefully thought-out senses, and left behind a large body of people on Earth who simply did not actively demand to be part of any technological whatever. Also, frankly, when the Nerd Rapture happened, the Nerds were kinda chauvinistic assholes anyway, so much of the population simply could not be persuaded to go along with them by any means.

This makes for interesting interactions between present-day Earth people and the eventual /children/ of the original Nerds, who not only grew up in a weirdly warped society, but wound up wondering why the hell there's all these mortals living pathetically anachronistic lives on Earth. Meanwhile, the mortals think that they were spared in a massive apocalypse that destroyed the sinful and arrogant assholes who were trying to usurp God, and that they live the only /truly meaningful/ lifestyles in the Solar System.
