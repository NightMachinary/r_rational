(On and Off)The Nature Preserve is a good explanation for what happened with /Firefly/. It's the most straightforward explanation for a situation where you can have inexplicably-powerful terraforming technologies /and/ a requirement to leave the Sol system. Otherwise, I would think that you could just use even the precursor terraforming technologies on either Mars or one of the Jovian or Saturnal moons while you re-terraform Earth That Was.

I actually asked [[/u/cstross]] about Firefly/Accelerando crossovers. He rightfully ignored me. The world just isn't ready for Aineko/Jayne shipping.
