I wholly agree with your appraisal of the Firefly universe's worldbuilding flaws. Those flaws are the reason that I had to try using your setting as a possible explanation. It was literally the only source of possible magical terraforming techniques and a completely unusable inner solar system that I knew of.

I do not, in any way, think that Accelerando was actually /meant/ to fit with Firefly. Your work stands well enough on its own, it just happens to be big enough that you could probably fit a bunch of Space Amish and Trekkies onto a starship with the last of the outer system's supply of idiotballium and chuck it away in the background of the MacX family drama.
