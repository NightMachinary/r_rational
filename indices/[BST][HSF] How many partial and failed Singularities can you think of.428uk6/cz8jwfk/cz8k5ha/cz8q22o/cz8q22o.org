I then propose that you run with a singularity that happened in the past - could be the 1600s (Isaac Newton was a fan of this 'chemistry' thing), or the 1920s (significant telegraph upgrades proposed by Nikola Tesla) or the 1970s (novel drug which vastly accelerates the clock speed of mammalian brains) or the 1990s (limited AI programmed to autonomously simulate pandemics eventually attempts to improve accuracy by releasing a sample of smallpox). Whatever, man. Werner von Braun builds a Nazi moonbase? Leonardo da Vinci designs working calculators, or submarines, or airplains? Henry Ford, in his twilight years, popularizes the uranium engine?

This isn't wholly related, just food for thought.
