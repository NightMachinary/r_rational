There are at least three main definitions for "Singularity", each partially exclusive of the others, plus innumerable minor variants. It's gotten to the point where no two people are describing the same thing with it anymore.

Thus, I'm looking for ideas that at least vaguely resemble some version of any definition Singularity, if you squint and turn your head, but which don't necessarily lead to the creation of superintelligent AI Gods who pursue their utility functions with godlike calculations. Near-singularities, pseudo-singularities, things that a random skiffy reader wouldn't blink at if they were /called/ a Singularity regardless of what "Singularity" actually means.

This is a brainstorming thread, which I'm hoping to leverage to evoke as many potentially useful ideas as possible, particularly ideas that I wouldn't have come up with on my own. If you think you've got some ideas that at least partially match the general pattern I'm describing, feel free to post them, and everyone here can use them as springboards for further elaborations thereof. :)
