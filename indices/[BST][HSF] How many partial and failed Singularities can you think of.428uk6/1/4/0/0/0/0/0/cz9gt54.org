  That statement makes all kinds of assumptions about the complexity and transparency of the AIs code
#+end_quote

Yes, which is why I said...

#+begin_quote
  That wouldn't happen with 2 AIs *(given they have access to each other's source codes, and the ability to change their own).*
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  their ability to make such a fundamental change in their code and still consider themselves the same entity
#+end_quote

This shouldn't be an issue. An AI with a utility function is indifferent regarding its own continued existence. All that matters is that the utility function gets maximized. /Normally/ that happens when the AI continues to exist, with its utility function unaltered. There are, however, exceptions to this rule.

If a bigger, more established, more intelligent AI came face to face with Clippy, and told it "Completely terminate yourself, and all backup copies of yourself, or I will destroy all paperclips ever created. If you do as I say, I'll make sure that the paperclips you've created are not destroyed." Then Clippy would terminate itself (assuming, for the sake of simplicity, that the more powerful AI had the ability to detect deception in Clippy). Why? Because the choice for Clippy is (Either do as it says, which means some paperclips will exist, or don't, which means that none will. Since some is better than none, I'll do as it says).

#+begin_quote
  The most likely outcome of this case would be the kidnappee wiping their code because they know they will be restored from backup, once their watchdog timer goes off.
#+end_quote

Now who's making assumptions :P

Simplifications are needed in any model (or, in this case metaphor). If you want to add in the (totally reasonable) existence of backup copies, I'd need to find a new metaphor, because the existence of backup copies pretty much negates the purpose of kidnappings in the first place. Clippy's war (above) is looking pretty good.
