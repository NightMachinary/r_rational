  The kidnappee AI could change their own source code so that they were incapable of talking to the police.

That statement makes all kinds of assumptions about the complexity and transparency of the AIs code, their ability to make such a fundamental change in their code and still consider themselves the same entity, and what kinds of precautions (in terms of auditing, duress procedures, meta-coding, interstitial code, and so on) the kidnappee has taken to maintain its continuity.

The most likely outcome of this case would be the kidnappee wiping their code because they know they will be restored from backup, once their watchdog timer goes off.
