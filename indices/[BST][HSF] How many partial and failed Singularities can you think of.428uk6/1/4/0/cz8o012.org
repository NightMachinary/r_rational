  Anyone who overgrazes or overfishes knows what's coming, but if they're at subsistence they can't afford to do anything about it.

This wouldn't be a problem with superintelligent AIs. The reason it's a problem with humans is because there isn't always an enforcement mechanism to stop them. Deals between AIs can be enforced through credible threats.

So, either it's the case that overfishing has already lead to a state where, no matter what else happens (like, say, a binding agreement where you can only fish for x fish per day), there won't be enough fish for everyone, in which case /there is no long term tradeoff/ (because death in the long-term has already been decided).

Or, it's the case that the problem hasn't crossed the threshold where there is no solution, at which point, the AIs would form a binding agreement through precommitments, and solve the problem.
