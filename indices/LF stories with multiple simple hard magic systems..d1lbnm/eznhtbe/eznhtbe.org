I know exactly what you mean and I /adore/ this sort of thing, but unfortunately there just aren't many examples of it that I'm aware of. Worth The Candle comes the closest.

Sanderson's works, as mentioned, can come close. It's not much of a spoiler, but most of his works are part of a single universe, just on different planets. This means that there's the /potential/ that Stormlight Archive, the series that ties it all together, will eventually allow for the proliferation of magics from other planets. There are, in fact, at least two characters in the story that already do this. But it isn't what you want - the different magics are not generally known or available. There's just one character known so far that makes it his goal to Catch Them All, as it were.

Unsurprisingly, another of Alexander Wales' works, [[http://www.alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2016.html][The Dark Wizard of Donkerk]] also has elements of this. I recommend it on its own merits, anyway, it's really great.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21323/metal-and-magic][Metal and Magic]] also has elements of this. There's three or four magic systems that have been shown so far and it's all hard magic behind the curtain. Most people are only aware of their own culture's magic, though. Again, I recommend the story on its other merits anyway.
