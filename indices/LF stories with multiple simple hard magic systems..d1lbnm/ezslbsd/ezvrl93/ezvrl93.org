  Everyone else can get by on lazy solutions, but the MC has to get /creative/.

Bear in mind I've only read part of the first book, but to me this idea doesn't really hold water. Sure, there's magic, but most people aren't going to be all that good at it(and if they are, then wouldn't the world be different to how it is?, and it's still a fairly brutal culture and world they live in. Magic can't solve everything, especially if you don't have the right kind. In a rational setting, there's still going to be plenty of pressure to come up with clever mundane solutions, which obviously necessitates clever mundane thinking.
