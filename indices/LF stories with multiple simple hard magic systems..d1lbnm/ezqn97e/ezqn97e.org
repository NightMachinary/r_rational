Lawrence Watt-Evans's "Legends of Eshthar" series is a bit closer to the Worth the Candle end of the spectrum but has quite a lot of different magic systems ([[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLegendsOfEthshar?from=Literature.Ethshar][tvtropes lists six]] though I thought I remembered there being a few more than that). Each of the different magic systems is quite general purpose, but with very different strengths and limitations.

The books are generally pretty good mid-range fantasy. They're not necessarily rational rational but they're pretty intelligently written and I don't recall any examples of characters holding the idiot ball (with a few exceptions when they were under the influence of things that affect their sanity).
