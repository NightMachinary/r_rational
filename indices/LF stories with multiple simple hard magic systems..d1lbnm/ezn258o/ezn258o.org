Mistborn is basically the poster child for this. Fair warning, the second book in the original trilogy is mostly just conflict because a character tightly clutches the idiot ball. Democracy is not something you /start out/ with, for good reason. Other more interesting stuff happens too, but that's definitely my biggest criticism of it. The rest of the series is much better.

I haven't really read them, but most of Brandon Sanderson's works have magic systems such as you describe. I know that Stormlight Archive does, and Elantris kinda doesn't, but yeah. Mostly.
