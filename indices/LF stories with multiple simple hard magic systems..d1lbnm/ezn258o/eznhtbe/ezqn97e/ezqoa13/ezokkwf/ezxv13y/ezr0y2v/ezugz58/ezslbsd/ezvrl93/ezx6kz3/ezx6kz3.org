Sure. I might not have done a good job selling this, but that was the impression I walked away with.

It's not that other people aren't clever, it's just that they can make use of an easier solution, so they do so. It's also that while everyone else is practicing magic, the MC is practicing cleverness, literally because he can't do the first one. This makes the MC substantially more clever than most people, but only somewhat more clever that other people who care about being clever - because they also care about being good at magic.
