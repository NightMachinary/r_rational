Codex Alera comes to mind. There's a *bit* of "everyone else holds the idiot ball", but it's explainable by the main character being literally the only person without magic and so making up for it with cleverness. Everyone else can get by on lazy solutions, but the MC has to get _creative_.

Like - You could learn to cook a pizza. Or you could order one from you magic mirror. But if you learn to cook a pizza, then you get some _ideas_....

And by the end the world at large has picked up on this habit and there's off-screen tech development. It's pretty great.
