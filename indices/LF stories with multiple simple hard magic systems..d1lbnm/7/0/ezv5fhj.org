I think the ones that go more for what westerners expect in a magic system are "Xanhuan" rather than "Wuxia" or "Xianxia", though I believe that technically there is a bunch of stuff in Taoist mythology (& thus be classifiable as "Xianxia" I believe) that could be pass for a localized version of Europe's Hermetic tradition(s).
