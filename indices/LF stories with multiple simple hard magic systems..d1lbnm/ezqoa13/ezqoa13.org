Patrick Rothfuss's Kingkiller Chronicles are quite excellent(though if you read them, beware seeming eternal 3rd book hiatus).

There are 7 or 9 distinct magic systems in universe (I'm not wholly sure), of which about 6 have clear distinct explanations (though the MC doesn't use all of them), and I think 2 at least are distinctly hard.

The MC is most skilled at the hardest system, but is attempting to learn the softest (though I would hold that it's an excellent soft system), so YMMV.
