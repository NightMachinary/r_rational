If you're going for didactism with this you've got quite a bit of fertile ground with the "resurrection of ancient life" angle, especially if you're planning to focus on evolutionary biology. You could discuss all the challenges of accounting for degradation and contamination, the difficulties of short read alignment, all the other bioinformaticsy stuff (dealing with numts and repeats, all the phylogenetics, etc.), the limitations of mtDNA compared to nuDNA and gene vs. species trees, the need for exceptional preservation, advances in technology that make sequencing way easier (PCR! 2nd Gen Sequencing! etc.), the additional difficulties and limitations inherent in actually cloning something (e.g. you can't replicate maternal environment or diet, even if you somehow have a perfect zygote, though you could maaaaaybe iterate across several generations), and so on. You could also correct common misconceptions about the old bogus Antediluvian DNA studies, since most popular exposure comes through stuff like Jurassic Park.

Paabo just wrote a short, decent pop-sci memoir on this stuff, and he's probably the biggest name in the field right now. It's fairly light on detail (some textbooks and papers would serve you better there), but quite readable.
