Sure, though I only check reddit once a week-ish so a response might not be immediate. Paabo's book can be found [[http://www.amazon.com/Neanderthal-Man-Search-Lost-Genomes/dp/0465054951][here]] (or "free" online) , and there are lots of pithier review papers on the subject, too (e.g. [[http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.genet.37.110801.143214][here]], [[http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v2/n5/abs/nrg0501_353a.html][here]], [[http://www.gsejournal.org/content/44/1/21][here]], [[http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/272/1558/3.short][here]], etc., though I'm not familiar with any super recent ones).
