Some counter thoughts - not for the sake of fighting, but for consensus :)

- /Leaf's storyline hasn't been as interesting for me, but perhaps others are having a different experience. Her conversation with Laura had me wondering why she thinks her first article is going to go viral. This seems at least as bad as Blue's overconfidence, but I expect she'll be right for narrative reasons. It may be my fault as a reader, but the stakes for her story seem lower to me than those of Red and Blue, and I can't remember why she thinks her article is going to make the world a better place./

She has about as much reason to think that her first article will go viral as Blue has to think that his first gym challenge would be a success, or that Red would succeed in his first research venture. This is very much a "they all try their first thing" chapter, and the stakes are fairly low accordingly. None are likely to change the world by a great deal - but it's a learning experience for them. Also notably, our protagonists are very much not guaranteed success - what an odd notion. Blue already actually failed his first attempt. But he learned from it and is moving on, a little wiser.

- /While I'm complaining I guess I'll mention that Laura's advice last time bothered me. Like, it seemed like she was advising her to be as click-baity/pathos-heavy/anger-mongering/"dark side rationality" as possible. I may be misremembering a bit./

Laura's advice to Green is straight rhetoric, almost directly out of Aristotle. Ethos, pathos, logos and so forth. And she's dead on, too. People aren't persuaded by rational arguments as much as we might prefer, so this sort of thing is necessary when writing. Also, most of her salient advice seemed to be "go find out what the opposition actually believes" and "don't shit upon it while trying to persuade them". Sensible.

- /As for Red's experiment, how is he getting people to participate? Maybe make it more clear if he's just asking them for a favor, or if the diagnostic data is enough of an incentive. Also, should he be concerned about Ranna being able to see the spinarak, and the possibility that unrelated things like the size of the pokemon will contaminate the data?/

Lots of formal research, at least on the undergraduate level, works on a "hey wanna come do science for an hour?" basis. I see adverts for studies looking for volunteers with some frequency around campus (I attend a university that does research). People like helping out and they get a kick out of doing science. Also, I would hope that if possible, Red is keeping Ranma away from the spinarak. Or perhaps blindfolded? Do psychic attacks require line of sight?

Alternately, he might be too caught up in the excitement and be getting garbage data for that same reason. We'll have to keep reading and find out. He's not going to win just because he's narrated, after all.

- /Holy shit, man... Does this come across to anyone else as kind of "dark". I guess it isn't actually that objectionable, but it somehow seems way more screwed up to me than when he dismembered it in order to catch it./

That's incredibly dark, yes. But it seems like Blue's whole arc is figuring out how to amass power and victories while not outwardly seeming as calculating as he is inside. You'd also have a fair amount of support for a "take over the world while not turning evil" theme. Especially since as he is now, he seems to be losing that particular battle more than he's winning it.

- /In general I think you do a really good job with conversations. I like that you don't include a bunch of "he said's", "she replied", and so on, and I'm never confused about who's speaking. Rarely does someone start monologuing./

Agreed, and this is something I still have issues with. Mad respek.

- /And finally, a lot of the time I feel like the use of present tense is ill-suited to the kind of story you're telling, with its focus on planning, research, writing, etc. You make it work pretty well, and in some cases it seems like the right choice, but if you ever start a similar fic I feel like you should seriously consider getting used to writing in the past tense. Maybe people disagree with me on this though./

Not much to say here except that it doesn't tweak me as much as it tweaks you. Maybe it's just personal preference? Or maybe I'm uncultured swine :D
