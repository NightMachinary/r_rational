Yay! I'm always super excited about the first of the month because it means a new chapter. For some reason I ended up writing some thoughts down as I was noting typos, so here they are.

- The negotiation scene worked really well for me. Everything was set up and the payoff was great. I was surprised at the extent to which I was feeling the tension.\\
- Leaf's storyline hasn't been as interesting for me, but perhaps others are having a different experience. Her conversation with Laura had me wondering why she thinks her first article is going to go viral. This seems at least as bad as Blue's overconfidence, but I expect she'll be right for narrative reasons. It may be my fault as a reader, but the stakes for her story seem lower to me than those of Red and Blue, and I can't remember why she thinks her article is going to make the world a better place. While I'm complaining I guess I'll mention that Laura's advice last time bothered me. Like, it seemed like she was advising her to be as click-baity/pathos-heavy/anger-mongering/"dark side rationality" as possible. I may be misremembering a bit.
- As for Red's experiment, how is he getting people to participate? Maybe make it more clear if he's just asking them for a favor, or if the diagnostic data is enough of an incentive. Also, should he be concerned about Ranna being able to see the spinarak, and the possibility that unrelated things like the size of the pokemon will contaminate the data?

  "He spent more hours than he could count over the past week training his shiftry virtually, giving it plenty of positive memories to offset the negative ones it surely has of him. There are prerecorded simulations to choose from on the dex, and Blue went through them in a particular order: first Blue finding Shiftry alone and hurt, then slowly nursing him back to health, little by little. They wouldn't replace the memories it already has, but they would offer a counterargument, hopefully confuse it enough so that it doesn't automatically want to attack him despite the routine anti-human-aggression programs."

- Holy shit, man... Does this come across to anyone else as kind of "dark". I guess it isn't actually that objectionable, but it somehow seems way more screwed up to me than when he dismembered it in order to catch it.

- In general I think you do a really good job with conversations. I like that you don't include a bunch of "he said's", "she replied", and so on, and I'm never confused about who's speaking. Rarely does someone start monologuing.

- And finally, a lot of the time I feel like the use of present tense is ill-suited to the kind of story you're telling, with its focus on planning, research, writing, etc. You make it work pretty well, and in some cases it seems like the right choice, but if you ever start a similar fic I feel like you should seriously consider getting used to writing in the past tense. Maybe people disagree with me on this though.
