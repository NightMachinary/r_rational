Yeah, pokemon that belong to others can be stolen, but it's rather hard to do in most situations, since you have to have your pokeball out, hold it on the other person's pokemon for long enough to lock, then throw it. It also leads to a lot of behavioral complications from cross-programming, so is often more trouble than it's worth for the average person.
