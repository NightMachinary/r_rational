Enjoyed reading this exchange and most things I wanted to say have been said by [[/u/C_Densem]], so I'll just respond here :)

  It's harder for me to empathize with someone who's being trained to use convincing rather than rational arguments (especially when it's such an idealistic character who keeps talking about changing the world).

I definitely get where you're coming from, but one thing to keep in mind is that sometimes rational arguments aren't convincing, because /people are not always rational./ If you intend to change people's minds but forget that, you're simply not going to have as much success as taking it into account and working with what you have... which isn't particularly rational itself.

On top of that, and probably more importantly, rational arguments aren't convincing because /people have different values./ And this makes up the bulk of Laura's advice to Leaf: if you just assert the things you believe are true, you're going to get mostly just people who already agree with you to nod along. If you want to convince others who disagree with you, you have to not just work around the question of "Do they have the same knowledge I do about the world," but also "What lens are they looking at that knowledge through?"

A good teacher knows the material and can explain it. A great teacher knows the materiel and can explain it in a way that engages their audience.

What I would label "dark side" persuasion is taking advantage of the cognitive heuristics and biases we all share in a way that deepens or strengthens them. This is why Laura warned Leaf about, for example, using tribalism: it's far too strong a bias to play with lightly or carelessly.

  If they are doing it free, maybe a throwaway line somewhere to that effect would be good.

I think I mentioned in an earlier chapter that Red doesn't have the money to pay people, so he's basically offering the data from the pokedex as incentive, along with the usual "volunteer for science!" thing. I'll edit to reiterate it in this chapter too :)

  It isn't mentioned that Ranna can't see the spinarak, so I'm wondering if that's an intentional or unintentional omission. If it's unintentional, then perhaps it should be added.
#+end_quote

Ranna can see the spinarak, as it requires line of sight. Red did not consider this as a potential complication to the research, since he didn't consider why it would be an influencing factor.
