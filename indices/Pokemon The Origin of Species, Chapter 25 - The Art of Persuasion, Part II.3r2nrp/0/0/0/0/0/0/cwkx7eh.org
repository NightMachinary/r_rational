  I will make one last note that people having different values is not on its own an indictment of purely "rational" persuasive writing. Either you need to change a person's values (which should mean appeal to stronger values that they do hold, and demonstrating a conflict) or show that they are wrong about what their values imply. Both of these seem totally within the realm of "rational" discourse. You just need to find where the common ground is.

Yeah, that's absolutely true. When someone says they value Happiness, but also value, say, Tradition, and have a hard time quantifying or weighing which one wins out in what circumstances (and due to what other supplementary Values), there's always room for discussion there with someone who doesn't share their value of Tradition (doesn't even consider it a positive value, in fact) as long as they also share the value of Happiness. It's true that a conversation about this will likely be less entangled with reality than a conversation on something objective, but you can always bring objective observations and measurements into it to demonstrate to someone what their Values are resulting in, or what a new prioritization of Values will result in, and how that might change their mind.

  If those don't work, then there really is a difference of values/opinions. You shouldn't be able to convince them, only trick them. This kind of "dark side" persuasion decouples the discourse from the truth. You have to just trust that you are right and be comfortable imposing that on others, as you aren't entangling your reader's thoughts with reality, but rather entangling their thoughts with yours. That is, even if you were wrong you would convince them. I just... don't like it. It's not bad writing or anything on your part.

To me this gets into an interesting long-standing argument about what it means to have values that reflect reality. Of course if someone doesn't share any of your Values but understands them, they could still do the same thing, and that's much more potentially manipulative (also sociopathic, if they don't share any values like Happiness or Truth). I can totally see why you dislike it, in general :)
