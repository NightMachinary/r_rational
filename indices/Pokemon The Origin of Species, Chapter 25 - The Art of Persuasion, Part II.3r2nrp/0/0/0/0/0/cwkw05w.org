Yeah, I totally get it. I guess this kind of rhetorical talent doesn't seem "cool" to me, even if it is realistic and instrumentally rational for the character, even though other kinds of cleverness/savvy/even deception do (hard to account for what determines my thoughts here).

I will make one last note that people having different values is not on its own an indictment of purely "rational" persuasive writing. Either you need to change a person's values (which should mean appeal to stronger values that they do hold, and demonstrating a conflict) or show that they are wrong about what their values imply. Both of these seem totally within the realm of "rational" discourse. You just need to find where the common ground is. If those don't work, then there really is a difference of values/opinions. You shouldn't be able to convince them, only trick them. This kind of "dark side" persuasion decouples the discourse from the truth. You have to just trust that you are right and be comfortable imposing that on others, as you aren't entangling your readers' thoughts with reality, but rather entangling their thoughts with yours. That is, even if you were wrong you would convince them. I just... don't like it. It's not bad writing or anything on your part.

  I think I mentioned in an earlier chapter that Red doesn't have the money to pay people, so he's basically offering the data from the pokedex as incentive, along with the usual "volunteer for science!" thing. I'll edit to reiterate it in this chapter too :)

I'm sure you did. Sorry for forgetting! It's really up to you (of course!) whether you want to add another reference. Other readers (and those reading the whole thing at once) will probably remember.

  Ranna can see the spinarak, as it requires line of sight. Red did not consider this as a potential complication to the research, since he didn't consider why it would be an influencing factor.

They could set up a thin/light barrier with a slit for the spinarak's eyes if they wanted to, but of course they wouldn't if Red is not concerned about this.
