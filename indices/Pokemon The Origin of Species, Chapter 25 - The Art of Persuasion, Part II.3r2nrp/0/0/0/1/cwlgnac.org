  trained to use convincing rather than rational arguments
#+end_quote

I wouldn't say "rather than"; good journalism starts with a rational argument as a basis, and then uses rhetoric as a multiplier to /make/ it convincing to irrational human brains. Sometimes people will only believe the truth for stupid reasons.

The core argument (usually) stays in the piece; you've just got the other arguments in there as well. It's like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_rate_optimization][conversion rate optimization]] for an idea: you look at what parts of your audience you likely haven't captured yet, and then you try to capture them by adding another strategy to specifically appeal to that subgroup. The easiest group to capture is the one that just believes the argument because it's a solid argument; the work of journalism is capturing the other 95% of the population. :)
