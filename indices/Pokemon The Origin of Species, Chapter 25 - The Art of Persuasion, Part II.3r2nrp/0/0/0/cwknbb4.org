Disagreement/multiple perspectives is/are important, especially in feedback! :)

  She has about as much reason to think that her first article will go viral as Blue has to think that his first gym challenge would be a success, or that Red would succeed in his first research venture... None are likely to change the world by a great deal - but it's a learning experience for them. Also notably, our protagonists are very much not guaranteed success - what an odd notion.

I agree that she has basically as much reason to expect success as Blue did (though actually she should have less unless she has evidence that she is some sort of journalism prodigy). Red's current goal is pretty reasonable I think: a modest investigation of a potential phenomenon, nothing groundbreaking. Blue lost, and this was good for the story, but I don't think Leaf will "lose" in the sense of her story failing to go viral. Maybe she'll lose some other way (like the backlash being worse than expected, or nobody wanting to publish it for political reasons, such that she has to find some other way of spreading it), but I don't think her story will be met with a lack of interest. It just doesn't seem like the sort of thing that is going to happen (though of course I may be wrong).

  Laura's advice to Green is straight rhetoric, almost directly out of Aristotle. Ethos, pathos, logos and so forth. And she's dead on, too. People aren't persuaded by rational arguments as much as we might prefer, so this sort of thing is necessary when writing. Also, most of her salient advice seemed to be "go find out what the opposition actually believes" and "don't shit upon it while trying to persuade them". Sensible.

Yeah. As I said it may just be me misremembering. I ended up skimming it due to frustration, and then forcing myself to read it, so you're probably right. I did have that reaction though. Maybe I just don't like journalism :). It's harder for me to empathize with someone who's being trained to use convincing rather than rational arguments (especially when it's such an idealistic character who keeps talking about changing the world).

  Lots of formal research, at least on the undergraduate level, works on a "hey wanna come do science for an hour?" basis. I see adverts for studies looking for volunteers with some frequency around campus (I attend a university that does research). People like helping out and they get a kick out of doing science. Also, I would hope that if possible, Red is keeping Ranma away from the spinarak. Or perhaps blindfolded? Do psychic attacks require line of sight? Alternately, he might be too caught up in the excitement and be getting garbage data for that same reason. We'll have to keep reading and find out. He's not going to win just because he's narrated, after all.

Most of the research at my university includes a payment for the subject, usually like $10/hour or a giftcard or something. But anyway, I'm not saying that things are unrealistic or bad, just that they are unclear. If they are doing it free, maybe a throwaway line somewhere to that effect would be good. It isn't mentioned that Ranna can't see the spinarak, so I'm wondering if that's an intentional or unintentional omission. If it's unintentional, then perhaps it should be added.

  That's incredibly dark, yes. But it seems like Blue's whole arc is figuring out how to amass power and victories while not outwardly seeming as calculating as he is inside. You'd also have a fair amount of support for a "take over the world while not turning evil" theme. Especially since as he is now, he seems to be losing that particular battle more than he's winning it.

Totally agreed. I wasn't saying it was bad at all, just noting my reaction. Though I was reacting to how casually the line incorporated into the text compared to the treatment of some of the other dark stuff.
