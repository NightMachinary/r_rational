Possible typos/specific comments (made this a separate comment):

#+begin_quote
  "However, we have decided that a smaller grant could still serve to explore whether your hypothesis justifies further study. In addition."
#+end_quote

Not sure what's up with the last two words here.

#+begin_quote
  "The forms will be valid for two months, and once submitted, the grant of $2,000 will be made available to you for four months."
#+end_quote

Could be clarified that this means $2,000 per month. Or maybe it doesn't, and he has to use the money within 4 months? If the latter maybe clarify anyway, since I think that's sort of unintuitive (giving him access to a temporary account rather than a check).

#+begin_quote
  "Other than studying pokemon, few subjects captured his attention like psychology."
#+end_quote

Maybe add "as a kid" or something like that to justify the use of past-tense. Or change to present tense.

#+begin_quote
  "Which is why reading books on finance or economics, interesting as they were, never held his attention quite like ones on the incentives that drive behavior, or interpersonal dynamics between people engaging in business deals."
#+end_quote

I just vaguely don't like this sentence. This is a really dumb objection, but this and the last sentence together kind of read to me as: "Few things held his attention like psychology. Which is the reason that things X and Y didn't hold his attention as much as psychology." Also I think making a distinction between "interesting" and "attention holding" is fine but could be profitably rephrased.

#+begin_quote
  "Which ties into the most important rule: make sure that they feel like they can walk away with a win."
#+end_quote

Better not to start sentences with "which" used in this way (one of the above sentences does it too). Maybe just replace with "this".

#+begin_quote
  "Red checks his phone as he walks incase he missed any texts from Blue or Leaf."
#+end_quote

In case.

#+begin_quote
  "There's a lot more she could say, if she wants to convince the old woman of the good that scientific progress brings, despite the risks."
#+end_quote

Usually "could" is paired with the past tense (so, "wanted"). Hmm, not sure about this one though.

#+begin_quote
  "This is the fourth interview she had today, by simply wandering around outside and inside the museum and asking people who don't seem busy if they would answer some questions about it."
#+end_quote

I feel like there might be tense shenanigans going on here, but I'm not sure. Something about "she had today" and "who don't seem busy".

#+begin_quote
  "a quick sessions with subjects."

  "The point on Pewter's proud history was made, and can stand alone. Rather than linking it explicitly to the contributions to the rest of the region and world, that point can be much stronger on its own, once expanded."
#+end_quote

Kind of unclear which idea needs to be expanded.

#+begin_quote
  "though their pace is slow and unfocused."
#+end_quote

Their pace is unfocused?

#+begin_quote
  "New secrets began to be uncovered and revealed every day"
#+end_quote

Laura was okay with the passive voice here!? (not actually a big deal).

#+begin_quote
  "the more people it doesn't convince are going to get up in arms and start firing back."
#+end_quote

Not a problem but might be better with an additional "the" before "people".

#+begin_quote
  "and might give the story more legs."
#+end_quote

"More legs" sounds weird to me but maybe it's normal.

#+begin_quote
  "So it looks like your spinarak's chitin has a high proportion of sclerotin compared to the average, by about 17%."
#+end_quote

"by about 17%" makes me think that "high" would be better as "higher".

#+begin_quote
  "hands on an empty pokeball and his charmander's."
#+end_quote

I don't understand why he's holding an empty pokeball.

#+begin_quote
  "After that, Blue's attention is too focused on the shiftry that locks its gaze on him and immediately dashes toward him."
#+end_quote

"That" might be better as "as it", since it's not as if there are a bunch of other shiftry around.

#+begin_quote
  "They try it, and then a trough of water, then both, with Blue far behind them. The last is the only one that makes the shiftry hesitate: it clearly identifies Blue, notices the food and water between and to the side of them, then goes for it."
#+end_quote

I'm confused. Are you saying that food and water individually didn't slow down the shiftry but together they did?

#+begin_quote
  "Zephyr spots the pokemon and flies down to land on Blue's shoulder, looking ready to launch himself at the tree pokemon."
#+end_quote

"The pokemon" + "the tree pokemon" strikes me as a bit clunky in the same sentence.

#+begin_quote
  "killedi t."

  "Wom. "Pow! Fnnadle! Laracra! Rotund!"
#+end_quote

Extra quotation mark.
