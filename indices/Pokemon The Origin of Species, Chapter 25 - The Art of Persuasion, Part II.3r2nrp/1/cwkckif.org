Hey all, welcome back! This chapter went on /way/ longer than I was expecting, becoming the longest chapter to date, I believe... and it /still/ didn't cover everything I wanted it to. It's a bit rough, so hopefully I can get more edits done to it soon. In the meantime, hope you enjoy it, and all feedback welcome, as usual!
