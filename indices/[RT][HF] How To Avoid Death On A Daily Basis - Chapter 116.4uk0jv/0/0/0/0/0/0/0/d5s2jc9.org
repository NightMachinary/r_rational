  I also still don't see why you asked if it got less edgy, as though you felt it was too edgy so far.
#+end_quote

Yes. I do? I think it would be /less/ "edgy" if the mice were innocent, because that'd mean the main character had made a questionable or outright wrong call. It would reassure me as to the integrity of the setting, if that makes sense.

  How is kicking people out of a lifeboat so you don't drown different to killing people to make the rest fear you?
#+end_quote

Well, the lifeboat example is pretty much settled physics. But there's lots of things we did, like beating our kids or debtor's prison, that we thought were obviously a settled matter at the time and who in retrospect turned out to be highly problematic. That's the point - hard decisions aren't a /virtue/, they're a gamble. You're basically hoping that you understand the situation well enough to take complete responsibility for the consequences. But that's meaningless if the universe conspires to make the consequences turn out well, because if it /didn't/, you wouldn't have trust and charity to fall back upon. The cost is effectively omitted.
