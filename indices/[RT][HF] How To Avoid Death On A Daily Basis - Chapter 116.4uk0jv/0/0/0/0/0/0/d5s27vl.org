I still don't understand what you're saying. How is kicking people out of a lifeboat so you don't drown different to killing people to make the rest fear you? I mean in the context of the hard decision thing.

I'm not being a dick, btw (not intentionally anyway) I'm genuinely asking.

I also still don't see why you asked if it got less edgy, as though you felt it was too edgy so far.
