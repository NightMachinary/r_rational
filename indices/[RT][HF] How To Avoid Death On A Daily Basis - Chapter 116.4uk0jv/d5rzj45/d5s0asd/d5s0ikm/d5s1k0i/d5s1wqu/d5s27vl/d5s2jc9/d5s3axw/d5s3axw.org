It's very hard to follow your thinking because you have a very specific definition in mind (in this case of the word edgy) which you assume is obvious. Simply asking "does it get less edgy?" does not convey your specific meaning of the word. I'm not saying your use of the word is wrong, just that without context there's no way someone would know that's what you meant.

To the actual point you're raising, as I said you're jumping to conclusions. It's written in first person POV so you only find out stuff as he does. But if you aren't enjoying the story there's obviously no point trudging painfully on to get to the "good stuff".
