  btw you asked if it gets less edgy and then seem to complain it isn't edgy enough.

Part of the trope of "hard men making hard decisions" is that the universe conspires to make their decisions the right ones. In real life, this doesn't look like kicking people out of the lifeboat so you don't all drown, it looks like impaling people on stakes to teach the survivors to fear you, or cutting off thieves' hands, or taking slaves because the savages need the guiding hand of western civilization. We're still dealing with the fallout from some of those "hard decisions for their own good".
