It's not that I don't like dark moments, it's that this is pretty much as vanilla as twists go. Given how you established the character, I half expected the mice to completely innocent and that he'd just invented that overheard conversation in order to get the others to attack. (It wouldn't even be out of character!) That's what I mean by /edgy/ - it's very "hard men making hard decisions". But if it's supposed to be a deconstruction, it's like ... these are tropes that were deconstructed twenty years ago.

Please tell me they at least start a beastfolk rebellion? (Or join the one that's already clearly ongoing somewhere)

[edit] Okay I read to chapter 37 and no. No. I'm out.

I would have been a lot happier with this story if the mice had been innocent.
