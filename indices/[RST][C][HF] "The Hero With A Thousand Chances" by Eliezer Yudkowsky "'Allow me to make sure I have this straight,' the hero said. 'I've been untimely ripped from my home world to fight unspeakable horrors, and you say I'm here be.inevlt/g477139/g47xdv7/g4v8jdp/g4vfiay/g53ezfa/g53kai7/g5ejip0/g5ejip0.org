If I always try to win, but always win only by a bizarre coincidence, there is probably some force at play that I don't understand yet.

And just in case the force cares about whether or not I'm trying to win, I would keep trying.

I'd falsify it by observing whether my victories happened through my lawful efforts, or though a random coincidence, I suppose.
