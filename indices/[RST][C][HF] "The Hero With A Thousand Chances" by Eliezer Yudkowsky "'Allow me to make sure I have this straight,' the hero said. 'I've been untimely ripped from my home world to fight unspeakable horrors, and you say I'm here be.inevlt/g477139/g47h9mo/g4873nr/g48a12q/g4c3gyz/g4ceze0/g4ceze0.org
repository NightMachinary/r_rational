Even if I'm unfamiliar with a /particular/ narrative, the structure of a modern Western narrative is pretty unmistakable, and the following selection hints pretty heavily towards that kind of structure:

#+begin_quote
  The boy whose dusty heirloom sword proves to be magical. The peasant girl who finds herself the heir to a great kingdom. Those who discover, in time of sudden stress, an untrained wild magic within themselves. Success born not of learning, not of skill, not of determination, but unplanned coincidence and fortunes of birth...
#+end_quote

... That sounds a lot like the beginning of most stories based around a Hero's Journey structure. There's really no good reason that a hero should typically come up from nowhere to save the world, /except/ that it provides a chance for exposition (in the form of the reader learning the rules of the world along with the protagonist), and for a character arc.

When you think of actual people who are in a place to do heroic or otherwise notable things, they usually aren't people who were recently raised up from nothing, or recently gained incredible gifts, they're people who were in the right place at the right time to do something incredible simply because their job is to be in that place most of the time: think firefighters, rushing into dangerous situations, or scientists, working hard on vaccines or treatments that either aren't needed until they are, or are proven unsafe or ineffective until they find one that isn't.

If I were in a world in which the path to defeating a foe always, coincidentally, seemed to route through the path of maximum dramatic tension, I would, again, either be suspicious that someone is telling me a mythologized, misunderstood, or outright false version of events, or that the world is somehow under the influence of someone who wants the story of that world to be as compelling when re-told as possible.
