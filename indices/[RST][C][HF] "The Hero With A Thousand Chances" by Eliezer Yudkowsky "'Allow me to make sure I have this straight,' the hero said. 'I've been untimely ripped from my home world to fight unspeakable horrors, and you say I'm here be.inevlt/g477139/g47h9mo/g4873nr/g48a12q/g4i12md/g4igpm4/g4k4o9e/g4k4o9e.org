Yes, but if you're looking for specifically things put there by out-of-universe authorial intent, you're very likely to find in-universe authorial intent by writers convinced of, e.g., the world-spirit balancing events around the 8 elements of mankind, or something else that isn't true. There's only one author creating all of reality, and dozens to hundreds of historians writing the diegetic history you'll be reading. Any apparent themes are more likely to be coming from the latter than the former.
