  So, for example, the most likely number of universes with magic is “all of them”. Magic has to have the ability to operate in the protagonist's original universe to be able to move or copy them.

All universes might have magic in that sense, but some might have magic only in the sense that the spell has to originate in another universe, while other universes might be fully magical.

  Given that the narrator's description of the counterforce acts more like coincidence with a selection mechanism than an actual force, it's overwhelmingly likely it's not an actual thing.

Most importantly, magic operates using mind states, rather than fundamental particles, so while a force (in an ordinary sense of the word) that looks like luck is very improbable, because that would be too mind-centric, /magic/ that looks like luck isn't, especially if the luck works towards preserving the universe in existence.

So I think when judging the weirdness of the counterforce, you're considering what ordinary forces look like (physics) (and so you conclude that it's obviously coincidence), and not what mind-centric magic could look like.

But I can see that with a certain prior about what magic looks like, you'd arrive at that conclusion, I would just use a different prior.
