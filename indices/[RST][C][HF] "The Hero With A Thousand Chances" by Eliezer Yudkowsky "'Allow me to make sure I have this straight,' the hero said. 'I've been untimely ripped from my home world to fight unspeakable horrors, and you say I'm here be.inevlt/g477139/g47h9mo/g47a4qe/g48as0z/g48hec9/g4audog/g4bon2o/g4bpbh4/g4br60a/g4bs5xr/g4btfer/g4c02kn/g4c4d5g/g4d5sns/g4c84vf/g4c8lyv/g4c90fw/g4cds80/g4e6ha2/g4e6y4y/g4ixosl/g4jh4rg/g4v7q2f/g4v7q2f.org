You will still have universes with a person-describing-a-luck-seeming-counterforce that contain a real counterforce (other than "we just happen to find ourselves in a universe where things happened that way"), and you will have universes where the person-describing-a-luck-seeming-counterforce is merely describing a universe where things happened that way (with no deeper explanation).

The proportion of the first kind of universes is much larger than the proportion of the second kind of universes.
