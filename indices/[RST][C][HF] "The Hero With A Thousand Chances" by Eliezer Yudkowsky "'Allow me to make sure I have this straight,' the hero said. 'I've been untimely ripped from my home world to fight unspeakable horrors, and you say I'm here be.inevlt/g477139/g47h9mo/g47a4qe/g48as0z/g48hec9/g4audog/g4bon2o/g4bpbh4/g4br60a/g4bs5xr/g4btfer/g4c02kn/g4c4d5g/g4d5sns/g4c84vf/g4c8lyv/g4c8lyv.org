The protagonist /does/ know that. That's the whole point. It's obvious from what the protagonist knows and what they've been told so far. It's /literally/ (not figuratively literally, literally literally) the most likely scenario, if you're already familiar and comfortable with quantum physics.

If you don't see that, you haven't actually understood the story.
