I honestly think you need to re-read the story, because you keep making comments that make no sense in the context of the story.

1. Any evidence at all for a counterforce other than the one you already know about.
2. There are no astronomical odds involved. The odds /in any one universe/ don't matter, because only the universes that have beaten the odds can be observed by a hero summoned from another universe.
3. This is like having a chunk of blue ice fall from the sky and through the roof of your car. It's extremely unlikely that a chunk of ice from a plane's toilets will hit your car, but once it's happened you don't try to come up with a different explanation just because it's so unlikely.
