The most likely numbers of “universes with X law of physics” is “all of them” or “none of them” just by the was QM operates.

So, for example, the most likely number of universes with magic is “all of them”. Magic has to have the ability to operate in the protagonist's original universe to be able to move or copy them.

Given that the narrator's description of the counterforce acts more like coincidence with a selection mechanism than an actual force, it's overwhelmingly likely it's not an actual thing. The volcano suicide incident is a super compelling argument for that.
