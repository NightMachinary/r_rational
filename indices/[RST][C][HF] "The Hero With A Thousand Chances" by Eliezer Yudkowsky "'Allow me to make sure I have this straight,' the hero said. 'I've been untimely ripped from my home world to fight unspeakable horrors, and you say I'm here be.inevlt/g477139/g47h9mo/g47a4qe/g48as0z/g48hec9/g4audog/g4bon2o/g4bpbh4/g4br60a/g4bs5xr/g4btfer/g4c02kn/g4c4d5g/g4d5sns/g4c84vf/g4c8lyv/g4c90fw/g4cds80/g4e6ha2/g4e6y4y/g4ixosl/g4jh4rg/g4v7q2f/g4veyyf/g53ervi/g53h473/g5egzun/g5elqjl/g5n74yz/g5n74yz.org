I'd say by definition (reducible to fundamental particles = physics, irreducible force that takes mind states as one of its inputs = magic).

That of course raises the question how do I know they used magic and not physics, and my answer would be that's a simpler explanation.

  Ringworld had a force that looks like luck, so that's not the problem.

You did, however, use the luck-like appearance of the force to argue it was just an anthropic principle, so... you seemed to think it was a problem before?

  The problem is that it's multiplying unknowns to assume there's one when, again, the narrator describing it is clearly unreliable.

(Do you mean /conclude/?) I'm not sure, the narrator didn't seem unreliable to me.
