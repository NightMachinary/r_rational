The Anthropic Principle doesn't have the lifting strength this story needs to work. There are too many more possible universes where there's an actual explanation beyond random chance, such that given the data you should believe chance /isn't/ the explanation. The Protag believing that it is has no magic power to force it to be true. The narrative doesn't even give additional weight to it, it's consistent that he's simply wrong.
