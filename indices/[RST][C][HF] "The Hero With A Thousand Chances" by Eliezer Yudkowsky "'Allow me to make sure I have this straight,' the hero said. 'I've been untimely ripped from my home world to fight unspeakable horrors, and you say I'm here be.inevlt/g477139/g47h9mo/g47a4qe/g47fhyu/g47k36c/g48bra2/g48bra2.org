Well..sort of. That isn't quite enough for science. It would need to be reproducible for everyone, and ultimately the underlying mechanism that allows it to occur must be identified and found to be consistent with other known laws. The laws we have defined aren't arbitrary and it would take a lot to cause us to throw them out.

Essentially, HJPEV and the hero in this story are at odds. Both their reactions can't be rational. It's interesting that EY wrote them both, and that they both work as stories, when their premise is diametrically opposed.
