Fair, but then, we're being told the story of /this one/.

As I said in the latter half of my comment, yes, it's a stretch to immediately go "Anthropic Principle!" in this situation. It would take a much longer story to /properly/ set that up. But I can appreciate the core idea. Perhaps a better execution would have had a fragmented story split over many years, with the hero deciding at the end of a long life spent fighting and researching that there truly must be no Counter-Force at all.
