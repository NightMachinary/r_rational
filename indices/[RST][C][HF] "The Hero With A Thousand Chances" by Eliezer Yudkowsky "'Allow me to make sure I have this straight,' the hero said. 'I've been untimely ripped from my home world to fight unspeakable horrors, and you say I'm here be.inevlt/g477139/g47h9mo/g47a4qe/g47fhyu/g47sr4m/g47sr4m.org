I think this story heavily implies branching multiverse with infinite number of possible heroes summoned each time and only a few or even one of them results in survival of that branch of the multiverse going forward, and only these branches can summon another hero.

So every newly summoned hero will hear that all the previous heroes succeeded, but almost all of these newly summoned heroes will then fail.
