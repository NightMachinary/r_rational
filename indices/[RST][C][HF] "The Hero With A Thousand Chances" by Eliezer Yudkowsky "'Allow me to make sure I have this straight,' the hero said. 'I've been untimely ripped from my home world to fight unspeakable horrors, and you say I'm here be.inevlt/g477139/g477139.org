I love this story. With that being said, I think this is actually not a great demonstration of the Anthropic Principle, or at least it was an improper way for the Hero to approach it.

The hero has been summoned to a desperate land, which has been assaulted by the Dust countless times, and each time survived due to a sliver of luck. Early on, the viewpoint character states, “The Dust is terrible and our world should long since have ended. We are not fools enough to believe we could be lucky so many times by chance alone.”

But it turns out that this actually /is/ the correct conclusion, or at least that's what the hero believes at the end. He thinks that the Anthropic Principle is the real ‘cause' behind the Counter-Force; that the world has only survived so many times because otherwise he wouldn't have needed to be summoned in the first place. He could not be summoned in a world in which the Dust had been victorious, or in a world in which the Dust had been defeated once and for all; so of course the Counter-Force isn't real---it's just the Anthropic Principle at work.

This is a bad assumption. All things being equal, a hero who is summoned to assist a world in need should expect to find themselves in an average world---one in which there had been only one or two conflicts with the Dust. For the world to come to the absolute brink of destruction, over and over again, countless times (there are 37 heroes who say something similar to what this hero says immediately upon being summoned, so I think it's safe to say that we're talking at least triple digits) is so spectacularly unlikely that this is clearly /not/ an average world. It is so extremely unlikely that the existence of a Counter-Force being real is something that the hero should genuinely consider as being possible. That he does not do so, and instead immediately goes to the Anthropic Principle as a solution, is in my opinion a poor evaluation of evidence.
