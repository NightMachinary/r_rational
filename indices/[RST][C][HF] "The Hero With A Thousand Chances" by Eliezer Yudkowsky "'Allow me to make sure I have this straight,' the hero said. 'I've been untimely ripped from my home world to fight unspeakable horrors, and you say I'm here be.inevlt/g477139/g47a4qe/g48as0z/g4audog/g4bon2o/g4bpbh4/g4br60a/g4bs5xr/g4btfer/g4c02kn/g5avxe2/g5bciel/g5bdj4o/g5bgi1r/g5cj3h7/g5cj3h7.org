I think I understand. Unlike the case of Abraham Wald's WW2 planes where survivors make it back to England only AFTER they survive ALL the shots, the summoned hero could have been summoned to any of the earlier battles which makes the earlier opportunities a large portion of the anthropically visible part of the distribution. Thanks for taking the time to explain.
