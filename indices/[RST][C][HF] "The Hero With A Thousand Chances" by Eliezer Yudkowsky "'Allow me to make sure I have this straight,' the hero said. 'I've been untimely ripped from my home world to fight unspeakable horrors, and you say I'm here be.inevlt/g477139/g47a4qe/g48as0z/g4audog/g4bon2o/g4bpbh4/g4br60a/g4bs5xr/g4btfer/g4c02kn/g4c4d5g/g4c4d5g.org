The protagonist knows that literally, and I mean literally literally, not figuratively literally, there are infinite "airplanes". Even if they only see one, they know a priori because of what they were told that there are an infinite number, because that's how physics works. So it doesn't matter if the odds are one in 10^{12} against coming back, that's still an infinite number of airplanes returning.

The other side of the probability measurement doesn't matter, because once you have multiple universes the numerator is infinity and the denominator is irrelevant.

When the protagonist was told they're from a different universe, they knew immediately that the numerator was infinity. That's /obvious/ once you know about the multiple universe interpretation of quantum mechanics. They know they were dropped into an unlikely universe because there's no mechanism for them to be dropped into the likely ones because there's nobody alive to perform the ritual.

/Assuming/ you know that, then quantum immortality is the most likely situation.
