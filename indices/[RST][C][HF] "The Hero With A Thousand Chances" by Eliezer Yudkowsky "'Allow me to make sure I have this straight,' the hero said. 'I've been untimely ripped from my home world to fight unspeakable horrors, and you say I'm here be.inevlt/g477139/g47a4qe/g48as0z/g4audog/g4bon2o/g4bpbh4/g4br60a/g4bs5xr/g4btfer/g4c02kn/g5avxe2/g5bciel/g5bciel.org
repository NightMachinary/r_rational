Yeah I think thats a fairly simple way to approach it. There are universes where the dude is lieing and where there's a counterforce ...etc. The way you 'win' most often is by picking a reasoning strategy that works in as many as possible (weighted by probability). Even if there are some universes where concluding 'anthropics' makes sense, After seeing 37 won battles in a row, you have to move onto other hypotheses.

There's more, like for example think about how in the airplane example the planes go out, get shot at a bunch of times, and then return whereas in the story, the hero could be summoned after the first battle or the second...etc. In the airplane example this would be like examining the airplane in between bullet shots. This has a significant effect on the distribution you'd see which also drives down the probability of it being pure anthropics in a way thats a bit laborious to explain.
