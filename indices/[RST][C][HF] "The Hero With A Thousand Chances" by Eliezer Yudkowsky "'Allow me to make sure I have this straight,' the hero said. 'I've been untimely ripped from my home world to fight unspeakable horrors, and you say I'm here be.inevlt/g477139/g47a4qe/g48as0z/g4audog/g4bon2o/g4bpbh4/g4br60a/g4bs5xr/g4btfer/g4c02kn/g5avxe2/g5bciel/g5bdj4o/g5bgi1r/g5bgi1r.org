Yeah thats mostly right. To clarify the point though: If you think about the plane example, consider all planes that get shot 20 times, the only ones that return are the ones that get super lucky and survive all 20 shots. You survived 10 shots? we don't see it. 1 shot? Dont' see it. Even though if there's a 50% chance of survival then there are equally as many planes that die on the first shot as all the rest put together. You only get to see the ones that survived all 20 shots, everything else is hidden. Whereas in the story, you have a chance to get summoned for the first battle, and for the second...etc so you actually get to see all those situations. So the only difference from normal stats is that you don't see the defeats. Thats 1 outcome out of 21 compared to 20 out of 21 we don't get to see with the planes. Thats a huge difference in the number of outliers are in your distribution.

Long story short, anthropics does some fucky stuff with the stats but in this case its not as fucky as you might expect which makes seeing such a massive outlier even crazier.

p.s. when I say you get to see all those situations what I mean is that they show up in your distribution, so when you use bayes rule to think about what type of universe you are in, seeing an outlier doesn't change the likelihood of being in an anthropic universe as much.
