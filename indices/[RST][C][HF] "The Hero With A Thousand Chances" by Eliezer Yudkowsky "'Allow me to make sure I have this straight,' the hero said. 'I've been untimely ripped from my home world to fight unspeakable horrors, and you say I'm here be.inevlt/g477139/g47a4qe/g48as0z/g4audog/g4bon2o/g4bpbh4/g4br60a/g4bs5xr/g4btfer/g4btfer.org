They know that multiple universes are a real thing, because they're /in/ an alternate universe.

Therefore there are infinitely many queues. This is obvious from the fact that they're in an alternate universe.

And odds are that in most universes the whole queue has been destroyed because one of the 37 tickets wasn't a winner. That still leaves an infinite number of lucky universes.

Therefore for someone who understand and has internalized quantum theory, the obvious, rational conclusion is that they're only there because of the anthropic principal.

Now, most of the heroes don't understand quantum mechanics, so they don't come to this conclusion.

But EY isn't telling the story of those heroes. They're telling the story of this one.
