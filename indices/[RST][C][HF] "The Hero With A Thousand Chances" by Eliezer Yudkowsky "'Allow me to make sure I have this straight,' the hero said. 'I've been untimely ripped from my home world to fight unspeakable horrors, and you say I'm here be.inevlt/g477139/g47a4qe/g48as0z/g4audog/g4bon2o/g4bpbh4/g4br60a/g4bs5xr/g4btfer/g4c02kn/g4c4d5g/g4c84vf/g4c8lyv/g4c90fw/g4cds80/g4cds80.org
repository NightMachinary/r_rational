There is no luck involved. In the multiple-universe interpretation luck doesn't exist. All outcomes are real, probability is reflected in the proportion of the infinite successor universes that satisfy each outcome. But there's infinitely many of them for any outcome.

So it's a /known/ force imitating luck. It's just not a /useful/ one.
