No I'm not missing that fact. I'm explicitly talking about it.

If you find yourself with a winning lottery ticket, it might be reasonable to not immediately assume something is amiss like you are being pranked or there was a printing error. But if you buy several lottery tickets and all of them are wins, you should, with overwhelming confidence, assume something is up instead of concluding that you have just witnessed a ~ 1 in 1,000,000^{10} event.

Just like if you find yourself in a world which has survived disaster on many successive extremely lucky occasions. It may be the case that the author has placed you in an extraordinarily unlikely world, but you would not be correct to conclude so unless you are aware you are in a story. Without meta-level knowledge or some other overwhelming piece of evidence, you would rightly assume there is an external cause unless presented with overwhelming contradictory evidence for something so unlikely.

If this is not clear, consider how this situation differs from the canonical anthropic example of airplanes returning from dogfights/bombing raids with bullet holes in their wing but never in their engine. Notice how the average case is what justifies the anthropic conclusion with the alternative being that the bullets simply luckily missed the engine every single time up to now.

Probability and logic don't just go out the window because outcome X is also correlated with observability.

So yes, someone has to end up in the long tail but if you are at all rational, you have decided to forgo being correct in situations where the overwhelming majority of evidence points to a wrong conclusion in favor of being right when the evidence points correctly.
