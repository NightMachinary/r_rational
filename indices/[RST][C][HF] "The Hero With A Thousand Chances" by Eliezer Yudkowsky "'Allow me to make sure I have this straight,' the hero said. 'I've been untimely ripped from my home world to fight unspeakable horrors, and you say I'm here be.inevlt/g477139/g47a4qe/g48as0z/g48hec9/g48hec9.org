No. A world that gets anything close to an infinite number of heroes is very unlikely if there isn't something else that balances Hero vs Dust outcomes to be indecisive. So yes, in theory he could be in a world where Dust will at some point overcome it's handicap and should this give it his all, but to think that there is nothing like a Counter-Force is not supported by the evidence.
