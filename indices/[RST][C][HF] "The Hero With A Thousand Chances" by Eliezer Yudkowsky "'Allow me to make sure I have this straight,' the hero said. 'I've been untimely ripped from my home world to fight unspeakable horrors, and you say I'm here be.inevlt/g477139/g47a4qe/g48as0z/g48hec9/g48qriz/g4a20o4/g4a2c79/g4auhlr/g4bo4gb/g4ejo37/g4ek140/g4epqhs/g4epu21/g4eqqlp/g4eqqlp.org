You're effectively saying that (the chance of winning the 37 times in a row entirely randomly, multiplied by the prior of no counterforce) is greater than (the prior of a counterforce existing, multiplied by roughly 1)

The mistake you and the protagonist make is that you are far too confident that a real counterforce does not exist from far too little data.
