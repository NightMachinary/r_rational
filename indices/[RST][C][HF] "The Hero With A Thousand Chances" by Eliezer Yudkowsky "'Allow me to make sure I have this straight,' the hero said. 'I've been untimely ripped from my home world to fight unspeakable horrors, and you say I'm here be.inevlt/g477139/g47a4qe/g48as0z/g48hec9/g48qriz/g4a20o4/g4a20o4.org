Of course. But whatever happens, one has to look at the probability. The chance that one gets sucked into a world that had hundreds of wars where it barely stopped a great evil through sheer luck is much smaller than the chance that one gets sucked into a world where /something concrete/ made sure that hundreds of heroes bumbled their way into defeating some great evil, even if both possibilities exist.
