Yes, it is a little odd that magic exists in this world, inter universal summoning spells and immortality at the very least, and yet the "hero" dismisses the possibility of any form of probability manipulation that looks like the counterforce.

Since there are an infinity of worlds, there is not only an infinity of worlds in which the answer is "anthropic principle," but also another infinity of worlds in which the answer is "someone is covertly using magic to screw with probability." Not to mention an infinite infinity of other worlds with various other explanations that result in a useful counterforce.

I would think the "hero" would be trying to weigh up which of those infinities was the bigger infinity, hence the more likely. And the "anthropic principle" infinity, requiring more luck, would look to me like a smaller infinity than all the other infinities.
