  Well..sort of. That isn't quite enough for science. It would need to be reproducible for everyone, and ultimately the underlying mechanism that allows it to occur must be identified and found to be consistent with other known laws. The laws we have defined aren't arbitrary and it would take a lot to cause us to throw them out.

Not really. Science can provide proof /that/ things work, without having yet found out the /how/ of it. Early chemistry was science before the mechanics of the atom were discovered.
