it's a strange scenario to try to build, from a bayesian perspective. You need to have a certain level of improbability to be justified in invoking the Anthropic principal, and yet the more improbable the situation the greater the chance that there is a real counter-force behind the events. so what evidence WOULD point to the Anthropic principal being more likely than a real meta-agent?

edit: or, we can pose it more generally. If we assume our understanding of physics is correct, what is the probability that Magic is real, given that we see evidence of it working?

A case of "magic" occurring -- say, for instance, a fireball appearing when you incant a specific spell -- could be explained by low-probability coincidences, like spontaneous combustion happening at just the right time by chance when you spoke the words.

There is some world in which it happens with perfect consistency for you 999/1000 times, and fails from there on out. Even if we've seen it work 1000 times before, if to the best of our knowledge it is physically impossible for magic to work this way, but it can be explained by coincidence, it is more reasonable to assume that magic *isn't* real and we are just in a low probability world, right?

In order to believe magic is real, we'd need to reach some threshold of evidence high enough to overcome the probability that everything else we know about physics is wrong. But what is that threshold? Can we ever reach it, personally?
