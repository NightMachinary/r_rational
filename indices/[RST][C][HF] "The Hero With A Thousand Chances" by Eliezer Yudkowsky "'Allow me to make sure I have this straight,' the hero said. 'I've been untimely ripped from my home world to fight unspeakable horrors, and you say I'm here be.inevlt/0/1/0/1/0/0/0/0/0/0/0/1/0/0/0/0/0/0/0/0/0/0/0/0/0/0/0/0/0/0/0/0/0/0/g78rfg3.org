I see - you are saying that just because the best way to win, on your theory, is to proceed lawfully, it doesn't follow that they /can't/ win any other way. Maybe they can win by luck. Or maybe they can win some other way (assuming there are more options than something that looks like lawful bootstrapping and something that looks like luck).

The problem is that in lawful universes, the probability that you accomplish a complex goal by luck is so small that it can't practically ever happen, so I ignored that option. So the way I rephrased your theory /isn't/ logically equivalent to your theory, but it's practically equivalent to it. (Hence the hero says "the Counter-Force isn't going to help you this time," as opposed to "the Counter-Force might or might not help you this time.")

Or do you have in mind some /yet other/ way they could win (so luck and lawful bootstrapping don't exhaust their options, on your theory)?
