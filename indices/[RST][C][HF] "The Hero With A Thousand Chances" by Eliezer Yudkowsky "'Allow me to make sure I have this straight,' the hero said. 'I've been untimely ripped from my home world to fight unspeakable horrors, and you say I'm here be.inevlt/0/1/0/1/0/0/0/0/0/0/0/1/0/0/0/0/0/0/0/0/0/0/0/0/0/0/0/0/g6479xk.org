  There are approximately forty skillion models of how magic might actually work out there. You are assuming that one particular one is “how magic works”.

If you're responding to my definition of magic, that's how I defined the word, not an empirical prediction. (Or are you responding to "my answer would be that's a simpler explanation"?)

  Teela Brown's Luck was distinguishable from the anthropic principle because the observer could observe it happening over time, they didn't just come on stage after all the failures were painted over.

That's true... but if you came to the story in the middle, you'd observe that you "came on stage after all the failures were painted over," and so you could use the same reasoning that the hero is using (and obtain an incorrect conclusion).

  Louis Wu was even able to make predictions about the Luck.

That's a good point, but this counterforce (or luck) only saves the world by an act of luck. That sounds very complex (and therefore improbable) in a magicless multiverse, but if you have magic, concepts like "save the world" and "luck" aren't necessarily complex at all.

If I understand you correctly, you're saying that world-saving luck-generating magic is so improbable (even in a magical multiverse) that the /extremely/ small fraction of the universes where those events /just happened/ is still greater than the fraction of the universes with luck-like magical counterforce. But I think that for any reasonable prior, it turns out to be smaller, not greater.
