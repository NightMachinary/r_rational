  In the multiple-universe interpretation luck doesn't exist.

You will still have universes with a counterforce that looks like luck but actually follows a law (other than "we just happen to find ourselves in a universe where it happened that way"), and you will have universes where the observed counterforce is just a result of them finding in a universe where things happened that way (with no deeper explanation).

The proportion of the first kind of universes is much larger than the proportion of the second kind of universes.
