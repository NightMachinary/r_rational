Just stumbled on this thread. Thanks for the detailed reasoning. The problem with the other side of the probability measurement still remains even if there are near infinite universes, right ? You are saying that 7/10^{12} is so low that other causes are more likely i.e. there is likely to be many more universes with a string of unlikely victories caused by other reasons (Dust playing both sides, mythologized version of events, etc.) than from pure luck. Have I understood your point correctly ?

Have to chew on that. Until I read your argument I didn't see anything wrong with the anthropic principle angle.
