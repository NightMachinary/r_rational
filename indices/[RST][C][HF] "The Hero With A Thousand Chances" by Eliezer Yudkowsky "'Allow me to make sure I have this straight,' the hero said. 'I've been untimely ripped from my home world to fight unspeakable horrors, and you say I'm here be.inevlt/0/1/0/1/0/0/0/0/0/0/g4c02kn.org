Think about the airplane example and its parallels with the story. Each airplane is like a universe. Those airplanes that get shot in the engine and don't return are ~ those universes that lost a fight against the dust. Those airplanes that come back with only holes in the wings are those universes that have won battles with the dust. Each bullet that goes into the wing instead of hitting the engine is a won battle.

In the airplane case the famous solution is to realize 'just because I am only seeing damage done to the wings doesn't mean that there isn't damage being done to the engine because damage there may correlate with whether or not I see it'. The parallel in the story is saying 'just because i am only seeing universes with only victories, doesn't mean there aren't losses since losing universes wouldn't have people left to summon me'.

That reasoning is fine, which I believe is your point.

The problem here is on the other side of the probability measurement so to speak. If your planes are coming back with a couple bullet holes in it, then the conclusion absolutely makes sense. But if a plane comes back and it was hit 37 times and all 37 happened to hit the wings, then you start wondering what exactly is going on. If the relative probability to get hit on the engine is 1/5 then the probability that this plane returns is 2 in 10,000 so getting this information is fairly unlikely given your theory that the engine is the real problem. however its even worse than THAT since we aren't dealing with 1/5 odds of defeat in the story. As the story says, these fights are already lucky. If we conservatively say that each of these fights with the dust is an even 50/50 shot, then the probability of that plane returning becomes 7 in 10^{12.} Astronomically unlikely. Thats the problem. The enthropic conclusion depends on the system functioning entirely probabilistically but the evidence being shown points at another conclusion even taking that into account. Sure its possible the user was dropped in a really really unlikely universe, just like its possible for a plane to be shot hundreds of times but never in the engine. But if you needed to come up with a hypothesis after exactly a single plane had returned, and that plane was shot hundreds of times in the wings but has no bullet holes in the engine, then you would be right to wonder whether maybe the engine is reinforced already or if they are deliberately targeting the wings or something.
