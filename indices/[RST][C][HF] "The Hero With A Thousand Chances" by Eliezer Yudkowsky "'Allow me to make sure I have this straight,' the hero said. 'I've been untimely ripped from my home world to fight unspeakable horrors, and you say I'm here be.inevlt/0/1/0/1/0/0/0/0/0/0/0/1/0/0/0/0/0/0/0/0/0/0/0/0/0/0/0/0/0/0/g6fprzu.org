  Your definition of magic has no predictive ability, therefore it's useless.
#+end_quote

In case you really mean "definition": Definitions don't have predictive abilities. A definition simply means connecting a word to a particular concept. It's not supposed to have a predictive ability (that's what a theory is for), and it can't have any.

In case you mean that my theory doesn't have any predictive ability, I disagree: I predict that if the hero attempts to win, he'll win by something that will appear to be luck (instead of defeating Dust by bootstrapping himself to become powerful enough and defeating it in a way that will appear to be lawful).

Your theory, on the other hand, predicts that the hero either defeats Dust in a way that will appear to be lawful, or that he'll lose.

Both our theories therefore have a predictive ability.

  It's like you're saying there's a god that sets the fundamental constants of the universe, and that's more likely than the anthropic principle.
#+end_quote

That's not a good analogy - for this analogy to hold, we'd have to be in a multiverse with universes where some of which would contain god (who would be the explanation of the fundamental constants in those universes), while other universes would be godless and would have the correct fundamental constants just because of anthropic principle.

In that case, I'd argue that we're probably in a universe with god, using the same reasoning.

This reasoning doesn't work in our universe, since we /don't/ know if we're a part of a multiverse with both god and godless universes.
