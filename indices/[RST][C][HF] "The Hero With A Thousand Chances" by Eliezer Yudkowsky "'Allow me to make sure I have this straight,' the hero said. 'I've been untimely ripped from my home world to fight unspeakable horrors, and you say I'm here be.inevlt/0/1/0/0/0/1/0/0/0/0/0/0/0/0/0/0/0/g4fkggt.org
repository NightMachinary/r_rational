Assuming the inception of the Dust was not a uniquely event, there are still an infinite number of older universes (or rather universes that the Dust has been present for a longer time). In addition you can't make a strong statistical argument from a single event, the assumption that there are a wide variety of times for the Dust's arrival is not a given.
