Personally, if I got summoned to a world that lined up perfectly with the narrative beats of a story I was familiar with (in this case, /The Lord of the Rings/), I would start from the presumption that either I was not being given a true history (either from deliberate lies, or a mythologizing of history), and then, if I could rule that out, that I was in a world where an Author was manipulating events for maximum dramatic effect.

"Wait, the resolution to that story was pretty much an incarnation of the moral, 'Oft evil will shall evil mar?' I am going to need to look at your previous heroes' tales to see if each had a coherent thematic throughline, because real life shouldn't."

The good news, if an Author is playing for drama, is that the world should never lose one of these conflicts (although in a world running on narrative logic, that should of course never be stated aloud). The bad news is that these catastrophes are bound to go on, regardless of the hero's efforts, for as long as it amuses the Author.
