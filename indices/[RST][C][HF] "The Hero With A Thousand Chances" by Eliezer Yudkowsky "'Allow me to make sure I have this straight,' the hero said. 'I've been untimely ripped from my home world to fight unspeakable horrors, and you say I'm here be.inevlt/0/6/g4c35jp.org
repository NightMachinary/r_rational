  All things being equal, a hero who is summoned to assist a world in need should expect to find themselves in an average world---one in which there had been only one or two conflicts with the Dust. For the world to come to the absolute brink of destruction, over and over again, countless times (there are 37 heroes who say something similar to what this hero says immediately upon being summoned, so I think it's safe to say that we're talking at least triple digits) is so spectacularly unlikely that this is clearly not an average world.

What does it matter? If many-worlds theory is real, there are INFINITE worlds. The peaceful ones won't summon heroes from other planes to help them with their troubles. The ones that were destroyed clearly can't. What's left? The ones that survived. Once, twice, or 37 times. Though, yes, the ones that survived 37 times are a lot less common - but there's still an infinity of them.

That said, I agree that jumping entirely to the notion that the Counter-Force never existed with this little information is unwarranted. A more complete development of this idea would have that be the twist at the end of a long novel where all other possibilities are explored and ruled out. This is basically just a matter of EY wanting to write a short story instead of a 100,000 words book.
