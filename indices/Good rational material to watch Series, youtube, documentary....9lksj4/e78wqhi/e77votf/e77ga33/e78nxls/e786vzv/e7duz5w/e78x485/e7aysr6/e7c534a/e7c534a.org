Because if you're not interested in politics, he has on his channel full lectures of, i think multiple, courses on evolutionary psychology (check the playlists section) which he does foray into political opinion 1% of the time, but 99% is standard scientific consensus on the field like any introductory course to a scientific field should be.

If you are interested in politics then he also talks a lot about how he relates the purely fact based field he is a distinguished, respected and successful professor in, to his political and more esoteric view on the world.

I don't see how he could NOT be on this list, whatever side you fall under.
