/Drums fingers debating inside whether it's worth it/

So...I don't mean to stay anything here, but isn't ContraPoints a politically partisan channel? Her subreddit has a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/ContraPoints/comments/9j0wgs/masterlist_of_leftwing_youtube_channels/][masterlist of left wing YouTubers.]]

EDIT: I see someone's also submitted a bunch of channels popular with the right wing, so I guess this is only fair. Regardless, I wish that this sub didn't involve politics.
