I guess it does. My wish is that it wasn't so decisive, but i completely understand and respect the community rules so will refrain from going into issues.

For those 3, all 3 are liberals. (as in the proper definition of the word, not the party). UKIP is the only party in Brittan atm which prioritizes liberal values, and isn't even that far right if at all. On multiple occasions Sargon has polled his audience and its almost every time it's 50/50 left-right. He calls himself centrist and used to call himself left leaning.

In general, lately the right has gone more libertarian and the left more authoritarian. Being libertarian focused has made them seem more right-leaning and left-wing authoritarians and right-wing liberals want to perpetuate that since it helps their strategy. 10 years ago all 3 would be called solidly left-leaning. So in public opinion i guess you could call them right wing channels, but by the traditional definitions of the words i think that is false.
