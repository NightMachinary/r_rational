She's definitely both left-aligned policy-wise and partisan (in that she advocates publicly for those policy positions).

But I don't think that makes her less rational. Don't get me wrong, many partisans are irrational, there's definitely a correlation. But I find ContraPoints to do a good job of arguing from principle rather than tribalism.
