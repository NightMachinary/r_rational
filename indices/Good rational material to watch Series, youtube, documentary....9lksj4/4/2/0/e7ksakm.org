I think my support of him would be in a similar vein as Peterson's. A friend i have who is fairly right-wing had a similar complaint about him, and my response to him was as follows:

I actually agree with you he isn't the smartest guy, and is not very 'middle class'; so 'bogan' as you said. He also isn't very extensively 'traditionally educated'. Neither of those three disqualifying him from intelligent discussion.

What he is though is very, VERY well-read, and very well debated (by this i mean he has had much, much, more debates and discussions on his opinions than your average 'middle class' or 'well educated' guy or girl) and most importantly; his opinions have CHANGED over the course of time due to the discussions he has had. This alone would put him as someone important and beneficial to watch irrelevant of your 'side'.

I would also claim, that if you did watch his content, you would notice that he TRIES. Whether he succeeds at being intellectually honest and accurate or not, he tries to be, and when he isn't, often his audience will tell him, and often he acknowledges it, corrects the mistake, and sometimes changes his opinion. I don't know about you but according to me, integrity like this is the most important thing when it comes to content i want to be listening to.

Just as a general note as well; to anyone why doesn't think sargon, or peterson, are worth your time: Can you name me any actual 'right wing' channels which are? Any which you would say are intellectually honest and should go on that list instead? If you can't then I would strongly urge you to re-consider where YOU get your news from, because i hope you understand how ludicrous it is to believe half the world is unprincipled trash. If you can then please do tell me who you think is good, because i find the people who strongly dislike those two tend to be the same: don't listen to anyone or anything that isn't 'left wing' and believe that those two aren't.

If that isn't the case i would love to hear your opinion on them as well, who you do like, and your reasoning!
