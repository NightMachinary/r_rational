Educational:

- Real engineering: [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR1IuLEqb6UEA_zQ81kwXfg]]\\
  Basically an engineering channel, doesn't sugar-coat things but easy to understand with a basic education.
- Youtuber Law: [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJgUkWtBuxh-2jK0aBWoSXw]]\\
  This is a law channel by a tech lawyer going over legal cases related to youtube and youtubers.
- CaspianReport: [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwnKziETDbHJtx78nIkfYug][https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwnKziETDbHJtx78nIkfYugd]]\\
  A Geopolitics/Geo-economics channel. Talks about different countries situations with respect to their neighbours etc...
- Kurzgesagt: [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q]]\\
  Very well-done educational videos. A little simplified for a general audience but still good.
- Nerd City: [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxsQFG_8Dbt1sZhLReL2mUw]]\\
  A myth-busting channel which shows you how to do the myths - though not always. (E.g. shows that most model pics on Instagram are Photoshoped, and then shows you how to do it correctly so it isn't stupidly obvious.)
- Jim Browning: [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBNG0osIBAprVcZZ3ic84vw]]\\
  An old British guy who is just trying to shut down scammers and protect people...
- That Japanese man Yuta: [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn7LyBvG5LEBXK9I4W5dGdA]]\\
  Japanese guy who interviews Japanese people about popular issues in the west.
- SerpentZA: [[https://www.youtube.com/user/serpentza]]\\
  Best china youtuber IMO. Just does vids about china, good and bad things about it (Non-political and he likes china but is still critical so I think its quite unbiased)
- Potholer54: [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCljE1ODdSF7LS9xx9eWq0GQ]]\\
  An Ex-science journalist just does debunking vids. Very educated and educational.
- J. B. Peterson(His lectures): [[https://www.youtube.com/user/JordanPetersonVideos/playlists]]\\
  If your not interested in the politics just watch his lectures. About evolutionary psychology.

Entertainment:

- No links, too many and easy to search: Philip-de-franco, Thoughty2, IDubzTV, mattyburrito MB, TierZoo, Trash Toons.

Political:

So this obviously gets heated. For anyone else wanting to comment, I welcome other political recommendations of people you think fairly attempt to discuss with people they disagree with. If your rec is similar to any of the ones below I probably already know if it though.

- ContraPoints as recommended below.
- Sargon of Acadd
- Lacigreen
- Jordan B Peterson
- Bret Weinstien (He is also an evolutionary psychologist, you can listen to his things for the educational content too.)

Also, if anyone else has any suggestions please do gimi, especially on good educational things.

Now, don't get me started on actually good anime or TV shows... Actually there is only like 10 or 20 of those.... Maybe next time.

Docus only All the david attenborough ones if you haven't seen them yet. Though I had fun binging air crash investigations.
