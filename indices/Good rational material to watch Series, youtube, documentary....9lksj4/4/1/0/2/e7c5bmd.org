  Because if you're not interested in politics, he has on his channel full lectures of, i think multiple, courses on evolutionary psychology (check the playlists section) which he does foray into political opinion 1% of the time, but 99% is standard scientific consensus on the field like any introductory course to a scientific field should be.

  If you are interested in politics then he also talks a lot about how he relates the purely fact based field he is a distinguished, respected and successful professor in, to his political and more esoteric view on the world.

  I don't see how he could NOT be on this list, whatever side you fall under.

This was my reply to oliwhail

The reason he is controversial is because of his political opinions, chiefly: strongly pro-free speech, for equal opportunity, anti equal outcomes, acknowledges average biological differences in people exist, which all immediately puts him against the mainstream trend and hence "controversial". The reddit rules say no American politics though. Not sure if this would count because pretty much all politics is American politics so i won't expand beyond here. Strongly recommend his lecture series and if you foray into the politics, at the very least watch his interviews. (I recommend after the lectures)
