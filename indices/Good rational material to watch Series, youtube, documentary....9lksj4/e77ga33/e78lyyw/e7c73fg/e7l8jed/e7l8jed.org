I understand why many communities make politics taboo. Like religion, there's so much identity and ideology caught up in politics that people have great difficulty changing their minds and often feel alienated over disagreements regarding it.

The purpose of rationality is to become capable of changing one's mind and thinking clearly to evade such problems and come to an understanding of issues that we care about. So in theory this community should be good at discussing politics. But in practice, very few people are so accomplished in rationality that they can see past their political beliefs, so any such discussion is bound to end poorly.
