If you're referring to my comment I had the exact same thought as you lol.

I was wondering though why you don't want this subreddit to, at least, talk about politics. I would hope that if any non-partisan community could discuss politics without getting heated it would be one that specifically advocated for rationality over emotions?

As a side note though, I don't really see how my comment, if you were referring to it, has many right-wing political channels recommended? I did split the partisan and non-partisan channels, and believe i split the recommendations evenly, if not even slightly left leaning? Unless you are counting Sargon, Peterson and Bret as solidly right leaning, then i guess just difference of opinion.
