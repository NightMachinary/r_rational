  Unless you are counting Sargon, Peterson and Bret as solidly right leaning, then i guess just difference of opinion.

Well, Sargon's with UKIP, and Peterson and Brett have both received lots of positive coverage from the right wing - ContraPoints has done at least one video on Peterson. Overall my point is that the pursuit of critical thinking and good storytelling isn't inherently political, and I dislike politics being brought into neutral spaces as it tends to be divisive.
