Within the same YouTube neighborhood, I like:

- [[https://www.youtube.com/user/thephilosophytube][PhilosophyTube]], which features videos about philosophy.

- [[https://www.youtube.com/user/chezapoctube][Lindsay Ellis]] (her newer stuff). She does good movie critiques.

- [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbWcXB0PoqOsAvAdfzWMf0w][Down the Rabbit Hole]] does in-depth histories of obscure internet events.

In a completely different YouTube neighborhood, [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZFipeZtQM5CKUjx6grh54g][Science and Futurism with Isaac Arthur]] is a fantastic channel for scenarios on space colonization, mega structures, Fermi paradox, etc.
