This video is probably the best overall, bottom up, simply explained description of what makes up rational epistemology.

Might not have anything new for long time rationalists, but if everyone really, truly understood the concepts in that video, the world would be a very different place.

Also, pretty much everything from CGP Grey is fantastic.
