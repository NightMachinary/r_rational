Rationality adjacent podcasts I like: * [[https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/rationally-speaking/id351953012?mt=2][Rationally Speaking]] - Julia Galef interviews scientists, philosophers, organizers, etc. about their work and how it relates to rationality.

- [[https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-after-on-podcast/id1265002699?mt=2][The After On Podcast]] - Rob Reid, sci-fi author and entrepreneur, interviews scientists, techies, and leaders. It started with interviews related to the tech and concepts in his books, but has grown beyond that. The interviews are higher quality than Rationally Speaking, but less directly rational.

- [[https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-future-of-life/id1170991978?mt=2][The Future of Life Institute Podcast]] - does interviews about AI, ethics, extinction risks. The topics are mostly interesting, but the audio is disappointing and the hosts are monotone.

- [[https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-bayesian-conspiracy/id1085426180?mt=2][The Bayesian Conspiracy]] - co-hosted by the guy that produced the audio book for HPMOR. It's much more conversational than any of the other podcasts.

Other podcasts that are not rationality related, but are fun and educational: * [[https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/99-invisible/id394775318?mt=2][99 Precent Invisible]] - my absolute favorite podcast. Covers anything and everything about design in the world around us.

- [[https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/science-vs/id1051557000?mt=2][Science Vs]] - From vitamins, to ghosts, to nuclear power, what does the science say about common knowledge and fears? It's an excellent and fun podcast, if you can survive the puns.

- [[https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-allusionist/id957430475?mt=2][The Allusionist]] - All about words, their meaning, origin, and how they're used.
