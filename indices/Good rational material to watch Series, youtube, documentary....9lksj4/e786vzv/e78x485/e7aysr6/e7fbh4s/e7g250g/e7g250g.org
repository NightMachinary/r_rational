I'll be replying to all 3 comments here, so I guess ([[/u/Action_Bronzong]])?

Ok to the lectures; Have you watched them? Because if you have you would realise that:

1. The lectures were recorded before the controversy, it's a standard university course, and no one had an issue with them until now. I have taken psychology courses and listened to other professors talking on the subject (I believe a video including your other recommendations too) and they all seem consistent. If you want to take the word of some people politically opposed to him who now claim that it's mostly pigshit and not check for yourself then I guess we will just agree to disagree, if you have checked for yourself please show me examples of what you are talking about. I would very much like to know what was wrong for my own sake.
2. Yes, 1% if politics. Whenever he goes off on a tangent it's most often about myths and stories, and how they relate to his field. Whether he is portraying the stories accurately or not is irrelevant, it's a learning tool and the science is sound (the science is not derived from the stores but the stores twisted to fit the science). If you watched the lectures yourself, you would also know that whenever he does venture into politics, it's non-partisan. He talks about the types of people (as shown through studies and research) who fall into different "wings" and why they are BOTH important, not why any side is most important than another.

To your first comment, would you mind giving some examples in what you think is ignorant about religion climatology and gender politics? To my non-political recommendation it would be irrelevant because he doesn't mention those in his courses, but I am curious as to what you are referring to.

Lastly, about the wiki:

...I'm at a loss for words. This is the introduction:

  *Jordan Bernt Peterson* (b. 1962), is a Canadian +evolutionary biologist+[[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson#cite_note-1][[1]]] +neuroscientist+[[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson#cite_note-2][[2]]] clinical psychologist and professor of [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Psychology][psychology]] at the University of [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Toronto][Toronto]]. He is the author or coauthor of more than 90 [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Peer-review][peer-reviewed]]articles on clinical psychology, social psychology, and personality theory.[[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson#cite_note-3][[note 1]]] [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Inverse_stopped_clock][However]], Peterson is better known because of his [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Conservative][conservative]] views on [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Religion][religion]], on [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Trans][trans]] issues, and on [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Feminism][feminism]]. His statements are notoriously incoherent and ambiguous, which allows him to [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Handwave][handwave]] criticism as mere misrepresentations of his views.[[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson#cite_note-CurrentAffairs-4][[3]]] Peterson's fanbase is extremely dedicated and overlaps with the [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Incel][incel]] and [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Men_Going_Their_Own_Way][MGTOW]] circles, though he is not a member of either.

Right off the bat, in what is supposed to be a piece of news, not propaganda, resorts to adhomenim and poisoning the well! "and overlaps with the incel and MGTOW circles" Holy shit, this wiki should be ashamed of calling itself Rationalist! what the actual fuck? The author is obviously implying that those two "groups" are some kind of evil, and using a correlation fallacy to try and poison the well. As if it also says something about mental health institutions that their customers overlap with incel's and MGTOW's.This is such an obvious hit piece, I can't believe it.

Even this piece has to admit that " However, in November 2017, he had 4510 citations with an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/h-index][h-index]]ðŸ“· of 38 (see [[https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=7403426180][Jordan B Peterson - Scopus preview]]). An h-index of 20 is considered "successful", and 40 "outstanding"." (which is 39 now) That he is an experienced, recognised and trusted professional in his field, and I think I trust field of science over a propaganda piece.

The rest is very interesting and, where it reports facts, accurate, but so obviously biased its embarrassing. It's obviously designed to target non-religious, left-leaning, anti-discrimination, anti-sexist, readers and imply he is against all those things demonstrated with valid quotes where he criticises issues related with each of them. Being each of those things (so either disagreeing with him or not being happy with the logical conclusion) AND listening to him I can safely say that his criticisms of those are perfectly valid and absolutely not ignorant or misleading.

For example: The whole part about religion. He says that religion gives people stability and they perform better with it. I'm an atheist and I can tell you he is completely correct! and so what?

â€‹

Guess if you would still like to discuss specific points I would be glad to, but I think most of this is cleared up if you actually listen to what he has to say. and especially interested in what I mentioned above what you think he is ignorant or lying about.
