I've decided, just now with little forethought, that there are two kinds of irrational characters: the proud and the stubborn. Proud characters know that their reasoning is flawed and don't care, while stubborn characters reject the idea that their reasoning is flawed. I split them up like this because I've noticed I tend to enjoy the former and despise the latter.

I actually find characters that admit their irrational and don't see that as a bad thing to be entertaining. They're a person who chose to give into their biases and believe fallacies instead of overcoming them because they value feeding those desires over changing them. These characters are usually villains, of course, but I find myself enjoying them as characters.

Characters that are too thick headed to realize they're irrational, on the other hand, I just find annoying. From a narrative perspective they accomplish the exact same goal of creating a character that seeks to fulfill a goal and can't be reasoned with, but it comes across as them being stupid, which I don't find entertaining. Does anyone else have thoughts on this?
