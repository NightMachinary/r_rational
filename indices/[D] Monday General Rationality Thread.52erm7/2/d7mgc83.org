Man I hate my brain chemistry. Long history of depression/anxiety, a cup of strong coffee(!) yesterday hit me like a sledgehammer and kicked my brain into some weird metastable productive nondepressed, but not manic, attractor in my brainspace.

I did not flinch from tasks, reddit bored me, each time I finished a task I already had the next one and felt compelled to do it.

That lasted for 28 hours, and now its back to old depressed unproductive me.
