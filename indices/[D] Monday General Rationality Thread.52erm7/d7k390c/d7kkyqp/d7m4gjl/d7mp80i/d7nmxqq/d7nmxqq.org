Huh, you are right. Perhaps we should call this the Distasteful Conclusion?

Yesterday I read [[https://www.mccaughan.org.uk/g/essays/cui-bono.html][another argument in favor of the Repugnant Conclusion]]. It says that 0 utility is not a person contemplating suicide. That is because a life has extra value to its owner, so it has to get really bad for its owner to consider suicide. Instead 0 is a life "objectively" worth living.

This is somewhat convincing. It reminded me of the "Critical Level" theories, where adding a life is only good if it has more than a positive threshold of utility. In the original, pure population axiology setting, this led to the "Sadistic Conclusion". But with this framework that also references the current state of affairs, has at least another, albeit much less nasty, issue. Let's say we put the threshold at 10, which is a fairly good life. Then we'll have googolplex people living a life with utility 10. But why not increase that to utility 11? or 12? It's hard or impossible to justify leaving the threshold at any place.

I'm starting to think we can't really use our intuitions in this topic unless we /actually know how the human utility function looks like/. Otherwise, we'll come up with conclusions totally detached from reality, that we won't be able to agree on.
