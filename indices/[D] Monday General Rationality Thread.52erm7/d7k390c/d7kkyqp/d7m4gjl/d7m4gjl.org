Thank you very much, this is the sort of thing I was looking for. Yes, it's pretty bad.

I'm thinking about more possible solutions. What if, when the utility of purple is negative, it gets counted with green to be maximised? Then, the utility for Green of options (1000, -1), (1001, -1000), (1001, 1000) and (1002, 1) would be 999, 1, 1001 and 1002, and it would choose the latter.

But then it'd be foregoing the opportunity to have 2001 total utility! But this is precisely what leads to the Repugnant Conclusion, so it's not all that bad. We care about maximising current people's welfare, and additional lives that are happy, if not very happy, are definitely not bad.
