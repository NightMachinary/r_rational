See, I'm a utilitarian (more or less, anyways), but I'm personally of the opinion that it's shit as a /moral/ system.

Applied on a personal level (maximizing /own/ utility) it's downright tautological-- why should I maximize my own utility? -> Because it maximizes my utility. That's useful to keep in mind, but doesn't actually reccomend any particular action in any particular situation.

Instead, I put forward that utilitarianism is best used as something akin to a negotiation and political analysis tool. You can't convince someone else to act just because "it's the right thing to do" unless you and they hold the same idea of what "the right thing to do" is. Instead, you appeal to their own self-interest. So then, when it comes to politics, or similarly large-scale endeavors where any single person is unlikely to affect the path of a nation-state or company or whatever, utilitarianism is the best policy to push, because it makes the group happier on average. Therefore, convincing a group of people to appoint someone who'll act in a utilitarian fashion works because they are, probabilistically speaking, likely to benefit.

So while in an actual trolley problem, I might still chose the "kill five people" outcome if I feel very strongly about the one person being saved, I'd vote for the government that chooses "kill one person" every time, because that's what's most likely to benefit me.
