If we're talking about written material why not something like a Kindle Oasis with an offline copy of the Wikipedia.

Also there are portable chargers, I always carry two with me, a pocket-sized one (3Ah) and a larger one in my laptop bag (21Ah). The Oasis battery seems to be 245mAh so, theoretically we're talking about 100 charges with 23h of usage per charge.

Even if one assumes the chargers and the kindle are at half capacity we're talking about 50 days of non-stop reading.
