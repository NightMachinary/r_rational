  But most of us don't spend anything resembling a majority of our lives hiking.

You're missing the point. If the setup of the SI is "Fall into a fantasy world and start a tech revolution", a reasonable point of entry would be falling down a hole or something in some wilderness while on a hike. It's not "how often do we go hiking", it's "what's a reasonable setup to make the having the equipment rational" even if this is the first hike for yourself/your SI in 3+ years, it's reasonable to think you would have your phone on you still.
