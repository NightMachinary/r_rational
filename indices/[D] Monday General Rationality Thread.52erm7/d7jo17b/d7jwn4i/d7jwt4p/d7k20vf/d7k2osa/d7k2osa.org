  The character already has arbitrary characteristics that may be advantageous, e.g. college degree, knowledge of science, lack of chronic medical issues (including mental illnesses) that would impair him without his medicine, particular mindset, specific background (e.g. he read some book before that in the story will be relevant/quoted).

Yes, that's true. I'm not trying to completely remove character advantages, just give the character ones that are less likely to strain or break SOD.

  Like [[/u/Dwood15]] [+10] said if you start from a character that was planning for a hike/trip it would make sense to have an ebook reader, a decent portable charger and, if it was somebody like me, have an offline Wikipedia on it (I had on my older tablet before it died). IMO if you play it right you can still make it challengin, e.g. wrong/missing info on the wiki, the offline version is text only and the relevant part are on images, the search tools are very basic.

That would work, yes. But most of us don't spend anything resembling a majority of our lives hiking. In contrast, I think most of us will carry a phone for twelve to sixteen hours a day. It's just so much easier to justify, and thus so much easier to avoid breaking SOD. Giving your charachters a few advantages is fine, but readers start getting annoyed when it's obvious the writer has set the work to easymode.

It's why we like rational fiction in the first place-- charachters can't rely on Deus Ex Machinas. In the interest of narrative few works are /entirely/ rational, but we do our best.
