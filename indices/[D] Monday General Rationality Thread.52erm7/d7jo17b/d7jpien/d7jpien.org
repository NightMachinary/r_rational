You could potentially circumvent the eight hour time limit if your first set of images allowed you to construct a generator and any other necessary things to charge your phone.

I'm not sure exactly what would be required for that. From "scratch", you might have to do the whole bootstrapping process up to and including smelting and forging, which could take longer than 8 hours.

There may be a way to short-circuit the process for the specific application of charging your phone, but I wouldn't know how off the top of my head. Getting it wrong could potentially brick your phone, which would be disastrous in the long term.
