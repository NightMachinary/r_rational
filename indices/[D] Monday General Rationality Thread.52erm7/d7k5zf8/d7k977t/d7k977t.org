I am currently compiling a collection of every For Dummies book ever printed. I suspect it will take me a few weeks to finish this. If you don't mind illegally downloading torrents of books, here's the [[http://gen.lib.rus.ec/search.php?req=For+Dummies&lg_topic=libgen&open=0&view=simple&res=25&phrase=1&column=def][link]].

Also do you mind letting me know how you get an offline copy of Wikipedia?

Another question to answer is what sort of entertainment do you prefer? Because I have backed up copies of my favorite books, favorite manga/comics, as well as a few rare movie or tv episodes.
