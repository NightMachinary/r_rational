I wrote a thing about population ethics, or how to apply utilitarianism to a set of individuals:

[[http://agarri.ga/post/an-alternative-population-ethics]]

It introduces the topic, covers literature a little and I finally give a tentative solution that avoids the Repugnant Conclusion and seems satisfactory.

I was close to asking people to "munchkin" and raise objections to it on the Munchkinry Thread, but then I found out it was only for fiction. If you feel like doing it though, I'll appreciate any issues you find.
