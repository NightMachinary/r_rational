Better, but I think there still seems to be a repugnant-type conclusion possible, basically as an extreme version of your example:

1. Green: 1 billion happy original people. Purple: 100 billion new happy people

2. Green: 1 billion slightly happier original people. Purple: googolplex barely-worth-living new people

Since the new people aren't negative, they are ignored, so the system chooses #2. The original people stay happy ... but at the end of the day the world is still mostly Malthusian (plus a small elite class of "original beings," which seems almost extra distasteful?)
