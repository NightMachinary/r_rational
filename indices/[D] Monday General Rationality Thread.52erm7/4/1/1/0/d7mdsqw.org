  Utilititarianism has its problems, but: What would you use as a moral-decision-making tool, if not utilitarianism?

  I'll explain: we want a tool that, given any set of outcomes and the current situation, it can choose the morally best outcome from the set. Such tool should also be transitive and complete, to avoid inconsistencies or situations when deciding is impossible. If we take all current situations and all outcomes and run it through the function, recording which outcomes are not-worse than which outcomes, we'll be able to order the set of all outcomes. Which is the same as mapping outcomes to integers, if they can be enumerated, or reals, if they cannot.

Utilitarianism is somewhat useful as a philosophy, but never on its own. Utilitarianism doesn't, in and of itself, define the relative utility gained from each choice. Our own internal set of virtue ethics does that. Utilitarianism is useful for deciding how to act on our virtue ethics, but ultimately can't be used on its own on a personal level.

That's why I critiscized it so harshly-- attempting to use it as a moral system just leads to recursiveness issues. It's just a decision theory for use with moral systems.

  Utilitarianism doesn't magically solve the problem of conflicting values (aka conflicting utility functions) though. That's solved by the skill of the negotiators in finding common ground.

Which is why I put forward its use as a political tool. It wouldn't work in a direct democracy, but in a republic, even completely disparate groups can be convinced they want a utilitarian (or in code, someone who "cares for their citizens) in office.

  Yet utilitarianism as a policy is useless alone. It needs to be coupled with an utility function or, more feasibly, with a set of values the policy cares about. In that case, the groups benefit from government by someone who has their same values. So different subgroups have all the incentives to fight to put a different agent in power, sparking competition à là Moloch.

But it /is/ coupled with a utility function, by the nature of politics. Namely, the population the elected official serves. Because the politician's own "get elected" drive is fulfilled by making their citizens happy.

Of course, perverse incentives fuck it up for everyone, but this is the strategy I plan to use to convince people to vote for Utilitron 5000.
