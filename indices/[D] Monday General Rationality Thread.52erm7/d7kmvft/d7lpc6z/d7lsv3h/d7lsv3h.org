If I had to sum him up so far - he appears to have been genuinely and exceptionally competent as a general. He was incredibly detailed focused and capable of a level of micromanagement that I can hardly believe.

His record in other areas is sketchier - he essentially appears to have created satellite states for France based on the principle that their institutions should have the apparent structure and appearance of Republican idealism, but should have particular restrictions that obligated them to France, or where possible to him directly. Most of these subordinate states were conquered and dissolved or annexed directly into France in short order, though, so no real insight into how well they would have fared longer term.

With regard to France, his assumption of almost total control as First Consul certainly triggered a massive turnaround in the state of the country, but a large part of that was probably simply more due to obvious corrections to the faults and inadequacies of the Directory which preceded the Consulate.

You're absolutely right that the chaos of the revolution was what opened the door for Napoleon's rise to power, and certainly an outside observer would probably have predicted the rise of /some/ strongman dictator in its wake as a significant possibility, but the question of why that person was Napoleon takes a bit more analysis. The proximate answer is simply that he was the most successful of France's generals and had the ambition to parlay that success into political power when there was a relative power vacuum in France, but digging deeper into why he was successful, and why he succeeded when there's evidence of at least a dozen other plots to overthrow the Directory at the same time as his coup was being put in place is more interesting. I'm not sure I'm able to offer a satisfactory answer other than "Everyone knew it had to be someone, and he was the obvious focal point to unite the nation."
