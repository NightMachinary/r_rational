I'm not sure there's that much improbability to justify away with Napoleon. He rose to power in an era of great political instability, and since at that time France was militarizing like crazy he had the manpower to start a series of conquest that lasted until his empire collapsed under its weight. I'm personally not sure whether he was really really good at what he did or just really lucky, but I certainly don't see him as a hyper-rational/one-man-industrial-revolution protagonist.
