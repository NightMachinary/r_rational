/Outliers/ is interesting, but I've gone back and forth in my opinion of it since I first read it. The whole book is a weird mix of starting off from a good scientific foundation (The whole 10,000 hours of deliberate practice leading to expert-level performance seems to trace reasonably well back to the Cambridge Manual of Expertise and Expert Performance and Ericsson, et al. (2007) - "Making of an Expert") but that gets piled under a whole lot of anecdote and conjecture.

That's not the worst writing style in the world, as it makes it far more accessible to people unused to the academic citation-chain style of writing, but also prompts people to go off on their own tangents and rely on anecdotal evidence really heavily when thinking about this sort of thing.

Ultimately, I think the snowball effect (wherein early initial advantages can be decisive because they prompt the further accumulation of info and resources that further exaggerate the advantage, and on and on...) is a valid observation. I also believe that deliberate practice is probably the dominant if not near-exclusive determinant of performance outside of genetics and physiology.

Where I think /Outliers/ and the culture that grew up around it after it was published fall short as generalizable advice or a set of parables for rationalists, is the implied conclusion of believing both of those two things - that success can be predictably achieved by deliberately practicing the most advantageous skills. That's how you end up at "Tiger Mom".

The tricky part is identifying which skills you're best placed to take advantage of, and which will be most advantageous ~10-20 years down the line.

For Bill Gates, he might have known that access to a computer gave him a rare chance to develop skills few others would have, but would the /rational/ prediction at that point been that personal programming skill and knowledge of computers would give him a decisive advantage in his career? His family had apparently been pushing him to pursue a career in law, and his grandfather had been a bank president. Even though he's an archetypal example in /Outliers/, I think that if he had been presented the book without his story in it, it would likely have been interpreted as encouraging him to press his advantage in law or finance. Being a pioneer in a field without much in the way of established practice methods at the time would seem foolhardy.

As such, while /Outliers/ has some good methodological advice on /how/ to reach a performacne goal and why focusing on performance leads to success, it's ability to predict ahead of time exactly which skills will have the biggest impact is limited, and so the scope of its thesis should not be interpreted as arguing for any particular skill over another.
