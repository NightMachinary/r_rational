I recently finished reading "Peak" by Ericsson (that I really enjoyed), and he criticizes the 10 thousand rule made up in Outliers from his studies.

His true message from his research is that every person that reached the top in his field did that thanks to massive effort and dedication. On the other hand Ericsson didn't find any proof that talent exist, outside of physical advantages for sport and the result of deliberate practice.

In short, he never found a magic number for expertise, and you can usually become good at something in way less time.

To op: I too was thinking about the lack of rational fiction in the real world. I would immensely enjoy a community munchkin effort to optimize happyness/accomplishment/wealth/immortality in the real world
