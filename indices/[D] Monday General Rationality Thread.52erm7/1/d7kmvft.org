I noticed a little while ago that there's a distinct lack of rational fiction set in the real world, either modern or historical. Also noticing that there are certain lessons, insights, or other basic information that's lacking from rational fiction in general because of the tendency to make characters significantly overpowered for their settings (usually by exploiting some seemingly simple aspect of the setting that somehow the millions of equally well placed people who came before them somehow didn't think to exploit) or else by being unusually well placed to execute an exploit or apply some rationality with large and far-sweeping consequences.

With that in mind, I picked up a biography of Napoleon, thinking it would help to illuminate exactly how real world stories of those who climbed top or were otherwise able to have an outsized influence on the world differ from rational fiction.

What I've discovered is that Napoleon basically exploited as aspect of his world that none of the equally well placed people who came before him did, and was unusually well placed to have an outsized influence on society.

He read /everything/ even tangentially related to warfare and the basic concept of a Great Man as he was taught it and turned theoretical tactical suggestions into applied battlefield strategy, and micromanaged the shit out of his army's logistics and supply to the point of simply making up statistics to send to the government in his requests for more supplies.

He was the first generation of Corsican nobility offered the chance to integrate with the French nobility and attend their prestigious military academies, but unlike most other young French nobles he got early and direct exposure to national level politics on Corsica, which emboldened him in his dealings with the other nations of Europe later on. It's shocking to imagine a 27-year-old nation builder until you realize he had been pretty damn close to the center of Corsican politics at 17. That, plus being one of few competent military officers who hung around during the Revolution meant he was thrust into high command in his mid twenties instead of ~50 like most others.

I will note that the second aspect as a "just-so" story feeling to it. If I had been there at the time, I'm not sure I would have picked a Corsican as "Most Likely to Take Over the French Government" on the basis that he had experience in national politics, but I imagine it would have been a useful discriminator in looking for those likely to make an attempt at a coup.

The one area he does differ from most rationalist heroes is that he's incredibly, incredibly, and repeatedly lucky. He's discharged from the Army as a junior officer for desertion while he's off getting caught up in Corsican politics, but on return finds that his discharge papers have been lost and he's been granted a promotion instead based on the shortage of available officers. His response? He demands an extra promotion on the basis that it would match the rank he was awarded in the Corsican National Guard.

Later, when he leaves his Army in Egypt to return to France and effect the coup of the national government, he's sailing through waters patrolled regularly by the British Navy, which had just destroyed the fleet meant to escort him and his army back, but gets lucky with the wind and doesn't encounter them.

I haven't gotten to the downturn of his career yet, but the author has at least hinted that it's more a matter of his perennial luck running out than any dramatic shift in his approach to problems, so we'll see how that pans out.
