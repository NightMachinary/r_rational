Another thing, is that if a person were to be SI'd into a story, it's not unlikely that they would have a case with an extra battery, like if they had a Galaxy (S3-S6) phone, that would be reasonable, OR the user would have case battery as well, doubling the phone's life span.

My phone gains about 2-3 hours of active use when in Airplane mode. Then with battery saving turned on, a good 12-13 hours is reasonable. If you had been planning for a two-way trip, say a trip across country, you'd probably have most of the external power sources already figured out any way. I mean, with my last phone, I had a case that doubled as a battery pack, giving me an extra 1.25 battery charge.

Your story could be similar to: go on trip, go on hike early in the morning, bringing charged phone and case from night before, get trapped in fantasy world. Have battery packs. The only thing would be to make why the main character would have all that stuff on their person on their phone already.

If someone had a Kindle or the kindle app on their phone, on the other hand, they could be reading Art of War for fun (yes, people do) or other historical war books (about the Mongols or Exploits of Roman Generals) for fun as well. That, and a Kindle can last for weeks without needing to be recharged.

So I guess my point is that extra batteries for their phone or a Kindle would be likely.
