The character already has arbitrary characteristics that may be advantageous, e.g. college degree, knowledge of science, lack of chronic medical issues (including mental illnesses) that would impair him without his medicine, particular mindset, specific background (e.g. he read some book before that in the story will be relevant/quoted).

Like [[/u/Dwood15]] said if you start from a character that was planning for a hike/trip it would make sense to have an ebook reader, a decent portable charger and, if it was somebody like me, have an offline Wikipedia on it (I had on my older tablet before it died). IMO if you play it right you can still make it challenging, e.g. wrong/missing info on the wiki, the offline version is text only and the relevant part are on images, the search tools are very basic.
