So, a lot of the "bootstrap civilization" stories, cognizant of the fact that modern society is built off the backs of genaration after genaration of machines building machines, give their charachter some pretty massive advantages. For example, easy contact with royalty, the ability to use magic, or having their charachter just, out of sheer happenstance, be the kind of person that's memorized, among other things: the bessemer process, a macroeconomics textbook, the art of war, gunsmithing, the periodic table, etcetera.

But it occured to me that'a not exactly necessary. Most of us have smartphones, and with battery conserving tactics most smartphones can last for eight hours.

So with the much more plausible assumptions that an SI will prioritize finding themselves a writing material, and that they'll have a fully charged phone (okay, not that plausible), what set of images could the SI have on their phone, transcribable in under eight hours, that could plausibly give an SI the knowledge they need for bootstrapping?

*edit:* to clarify a little, I'm asking this in the sense of "what set of images should /I/ put on my phone" (or any other [[/r/rational]] reader) to prepare for uplift. Not because I seriously think it's a possibility, just as a thought exercise.
