It's my understanding that a simple generator, in and of itself, isn't too hard to build if you can generate electricity, and phone chargers are designed to take in a fairly wide range of voltages and amperages.

The real problem would be acquiring the materials to build that generator, and if you've just been dropped into a random fantasy world/historical era you're going to have far more pressing concerns than recharging your phone, so it's not feasible until the long term.

In the short term, you need to get useful knowledge down fast.
