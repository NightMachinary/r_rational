One thought experiment I've done is imagine how things would go if I was dropped into a tribe at the near beginning of civilization with no advantages other than being immortal and viewed as a God figure. So basically free reign to dictate / direct society and being able to follow through on it the entire way.

On the flip side, only with what information you already have in your head.

The end result isn't particularly optimistic. As someone that hasn't gone out of there way to study useful things in relation to this, the best I've got is a broad spectrum, shallow view of a huge range of things that most internet age people with a 1st world education have, being further limited by there being no initial industrial base at all to work from.

At the end of the day, the best I could really come up on is more of an advisory role. Educating in the very basics (like base 10 systems, math, etc.)

I'm sure I have some knowledge that would be useful for things that would pop up in that time period (I've got no idea how to make antibiotics besides some vague knowledge penicillin comes from some kind of mold, but I'm sure basic knowledge of hygiene / bacteria is useful. I have vague knowledge that you can make electricity from a river, spinning things, and metal wires to produce / collect static electricity, but not the actual process of doing so or making it useful, etc).

So I'd teach the basics that I could. Once I've ran out, I'd do my best to refine areas of my shallow knowledge pool that it's possible to do so with just thinking about things and small scale experiments, but I'd imagine that to be of limited use.

I'd imagine at the end of the day instilling a basic education, measurement system, and the process of experimentation would be the best impact I'd realistically have. After that it would be more describing things as well as I can with my shallow areas of education (like vague notions of how electricity works) and then relying on the population to preform experiments and work things out from there.

I assume that having accurate knowledge of the end results and basic sciences would give the population some degree of better advancement but no idea of how much.
