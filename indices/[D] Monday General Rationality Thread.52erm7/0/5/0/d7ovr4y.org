[TRIGGERED]

If you get to restart mathematics from scratch, use base twelve. Please, I'm begging you.

Here's a demonstration of why:

Base 10:

- 10/2=5
- 10/3=3.333... <- ugly
- 10/4=2.5 <- ugly
- 10/5 = 2

Base 12:

- 10/2=6\\
- 10/3=4
- 10/4=3
- 10/5=2.4972 <-ugly
- 10/6 =2

12 is a much nicer number to divide by. 60 is even better, but then you'd need to remember too many symbols.
