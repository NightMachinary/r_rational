I don't understand.

Last chapter they were terrified to have her set foot in brittain at all because she could be kidnapped and spirited away for diabolical purposes.

Now they are planning a semester there? And Minerva is fine with it, even though she herself can't go back for fear of being attacked by Riddle?

This makes absolutely no sense to me, I feel lost.
