In the case that it's a bad idea I would expect Mcgonagall to say so, as Hermione's friend and mentor, and I would also expect Hermione to listen if she did. I could see her being overruled and someone else convincing Hermione to go behind her back, or just cutting her out of the loop entirely, but if M has any say and knows how dangerous Riddle is, she would try to sway Hermione not to go.
