Wow. Hermione with even more to prove than in canon is a force to be reckoned with.

I guess it's obviously the case that the age restrictions from canon aren't in place for this version of the Tournament? Is Hermione really puissant enough that she would be allowed to compete on merit, or is this just meddling by Riddle to get her to Britain?

I loved the "Adele Dazeem" reference.

I'm interested to know what the difference is between "Alchemy" and "Potions." The canon Potions courses are pretty much how I would describe alchemy.
