McGonagall isn't fine with this:

  McGonagall sighed and retrieved an envelope. It was thick and heavy and yellowish, and it sat there in her hands for a little while before she looked back at Hermione. “There is another matter, which will perhaps make all this moot. Your earlier request, to attend the Beauxbatons Delegation for the Triwizard Tournament, has been...reevaluated. And accepted,” she said, *as if it took great effort to force the words out.*

  [...]

  Hermione looked up, her face brighter than any lumos. “This is it, I'm really going!” Then the wheels of her brain began to turn and her smile fell apart at the edges, collapsing slowly into a frown. “Madame Maxime said it wasn't to be done, that I was too young. Why would---why would Laurent Octobre get involved in this?”

  “Politics,” McGonagall said, *with no small amount of venom*. “There will be no end of the photographs for La Lune, I am sure. Octobre was in the Secretariat for Foreign Affairs before, and I'm sure that he'd like them to...”

Neither is Maxime, for that matter, but it isn't Maxime who gave the approval---it's a high-ranking government official (the meaning of his title isn't apparent, but Hermione knows who he is and wonders /why/ he got involved, not /how/), and McGonagall seems to think that he's trying to score a political win by setting up some kind of photo op.

There /may/ be more to this, however, because McGonagall mentions that Octobre used to be in Foreign Affairs, and the very last entry from the previous story, "Political Realities," includes a recommendation from France's "Black Room" (evidently some kind of intelligence department) to encourage particular diplomatic attitudes and actions with respect to Britain.

In either case, Hermione is being used for political purposes by people who don't care about her, and who have the influence to overrule the people who /do/---and Hermione, being fourteen, has too much tunnel vision to back away from the chance that she's been offered.
