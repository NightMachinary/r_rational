I think Friendship is Optimal comes closest when it comes to a single individual's well-being and values. Once you get over the initial shock, you could live in that kind of world for a long, long time. And it seems truly fun. The only bad things are that the world doesn't seem to have any true randomness, they don't have access to the real world, and they aren't "free" the way I understand freedom.
