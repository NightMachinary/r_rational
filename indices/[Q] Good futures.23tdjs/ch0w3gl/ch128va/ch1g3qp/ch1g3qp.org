I actually don't think it's that strange. I mean, the 'Superhappies' utopia in Three Worlds Collide is even more different and some people have still defended it. I have the feeling that if you seriously started implementing the [[http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Coherent_Extrapolated_Volition][Coherent Extrapolated Volition]] of humanity and let it reach its conclusion, FiO utopia would be child's play when compared to that - which is an argument against FiO utopia of course.
