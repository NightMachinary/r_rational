  I have the feeling that if you seriously started implementing the Coherent Extrapolated Volition[1] of humanity and let it reach its conclusion, FiO utopia would be child's play when compared to that - which is an argument against FiO utopia of course.

Hence your new flair!

  I mean, the 'Superhappies' utopia in Three Worlds Collide is even more different and some people have still defended it.

Some people will defend anything. Some people have defended Robin Hanson's Malthusitopia of uploads. You should ask yourself whether these people value what you value, and whether or not you can consider them ethically rational, /before/ considering their defenses/endorsements to be genuine evidence in favor of some particular scenario.

I mean, as long as we're talking ponies, plenty of people have actually endorsed the nastier versions of /The Conversion Bureau/. That doesn't mean those stories aren't /blatantly, genocidally evil/ and /outright bullshit written by misanthropes/.

(My apologies for the vehemence, as I really quite like canon!MLP and can't stand seeing it mixed with genocidal evil.)
