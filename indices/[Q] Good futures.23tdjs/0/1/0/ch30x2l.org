You don't consider it utopian? Why? It seems to have all the general hallmarks of a standard utopian society. You are immortal to the point where if your sick you can get a new body, you can work on anything and be rewarded for it in a non-abitrary way, there is a near endless supply of resources, and its all self-governing.

Also I loved /Pirate Cinema/, and learned quite a bit from it as well. I think my favorite one at the moment is /Little Brother/.
