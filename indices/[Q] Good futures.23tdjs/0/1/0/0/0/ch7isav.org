PeridexisErrant got /Makers/ and /Down and Out in The Magic Kingdom/ confused, but didn't beleive that the lather was still a utopia story. Makers is most certainly not Utopia, though it does raise some interesting questions about information value, group think, and story structure.

Edit: Also Whuffie is an incredible idea, like reddit on a grand scale. I wouldn't mind paying for things with karma.
