I don't consider it utopian. It's not post-scarcity, injustice and brutality still occur, there isn't true health, and governance is external.

  You are immortal to the point where if you're sick you can get a new body

The "new body" technique in /Makers/ had significant downsides for the early adopters, including having to eat ~9000 calories per day and eventual metabolic failure.

#+begin_quote
  you can work on anything and be rewarded for it in a non-abitrary way,
#+end_quote

Only if you gain attention and support from a community willing to support you. It's already true today. It's how the FOSS world operates.

#+begin_quote
  there is a near endless supply of resources
#+end_quote

Why set up shop in a garbage dump, then? Why were people living in the slums? If there were truly endless resources, if we truly lived in a post-scarcity society, then there would be no economic reason for poverty as seen in /Makers/.

#+begin_quote
  it's all self-governing.
#+end_quote

But is it, though? If I recall correctly, the federation of printed museums had legal issues, meaning that there was governance outside of the free-market systems depicted in the majority of the novel. By those standards, we're already in a self-governing system. And if we're in a self-governing system, why did that one maker get shot in the face with a rubber bullet?

If you want a truer utopian society, try /Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom/, where body replacements are available, scarcity isn't a problem, rewards are reputational (Whuffie is a neat currency idea), and everything is an ad-hoc-racy.
