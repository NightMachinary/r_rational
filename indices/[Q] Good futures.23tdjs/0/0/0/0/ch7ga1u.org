Have you read Charles Stross' [[http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando-intro.html][/Accelerando/]]? /Rapture of the Nerds/ can be likened to the story of those left behind on Earth during the events of /Accelerando/. They aren't the same universe by far, but it's a useful comparison, and provides a link to a story in a similar universe but a different perspective.
