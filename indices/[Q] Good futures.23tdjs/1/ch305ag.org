In the unusual but excellent category, I have to reccomend /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406866/1/To-the-Stars][To the Stars]]/.

It's a far-future AU of /Puella Magi Madoka Magica/, which went through WW3 before achieving post-scarcity space colonisation. Everything was going beautifully until the aliens started attacking...

Of note: fantastic worldbuilding, treatment of bioenhancement (mental and physical), Friendly AI thanks to a Wish, and the main characters from the anime - now 400+ years old - being terrifyingly competent compared to the young main character. Humanity basically got the good ending... and then sideswiped by aliens.
