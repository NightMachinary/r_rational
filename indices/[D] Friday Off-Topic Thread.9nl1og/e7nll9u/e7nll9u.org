I was rejected from Harvard Business School without an interview last week. HBS interviews 20% of applicants and admits 10%, and it really sucks to think that I wasn't even in the top 20% of applicants in terms of what HBS wanted.

I solo built a company that now has an 8-figure annual revenue and my GMAT is above the 99.9th percentile. I've spent most of my life operating apart from society's normal support structures and institutions and I had hoped that what I accomplished would speak for itself (with the help of a well crafted application), despite the fact that I'm not an investment banker or MBB consultant. Apparently not.

It doesn't help that my SO is at Harvard Law. I'm surrounded by people that have 'made the cut', and I feel like [[https://img.memecdn.com/stop-i-amp-039-m-one-of-you_o_1298291.jpg][they're no different from me]].

I hear back from MIT early November.
