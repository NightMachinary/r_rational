Rejection feedback is something that's explicitly only offered to people that made it to the interview stage and were rejected. One of my recommenders sent an email on my behalf anyway but it's a long shot.

A few of the possibilities I came up with are:

- Lack of corporate/large org. experience
- I have no network or connections to offer
- Too techy/entrepreneurial for HBS
