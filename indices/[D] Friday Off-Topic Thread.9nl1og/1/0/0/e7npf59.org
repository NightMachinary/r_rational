Not a dumb question at all. My closest friends [[https://memegenerator.net/img/images/16828244/wipe-tears-with-money.jpg][don't really understand either]]. Which also sucks.

There are two primary reasons.

First, it takes a very uncommon type of individual to be happy living/working completely independently. I'm not a hermit living in the woods, but professionally speaking, I'm not that far off. Turns out I'm not that uncommon, I want to be around other people and I want professional recognition.

Second, I've seen the benefits of belonging to an institution like Harvard thanks to my SO. This is cliched, but it opens so many doors. It's hard to make it when you're a nobody from Bumblefuck, Nowhere. I had multiple bank accounts shut down because the banks thought I was money laundering. They didn't believe someone with no connections could experience business growth of that type, that quickly. If I had Harvard's network back then? Everything could have been solved with a couple phone calls.

tl;dr I want recognition. Also, being a member of HBS and other institutions makes everything easier and I'm tired of playing on Hard mode.
