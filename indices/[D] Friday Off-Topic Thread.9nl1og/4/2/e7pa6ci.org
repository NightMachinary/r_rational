I'd say it's one of the best action/suspense/SFF anime out there and perhaps even a must-see.

I am usually pretty blas√© with most anime and with battle shounen in particular; the extremely simplistic plots and character archetypes means they lack any depth whatsoever and rational thought goes out the window. When they are good it's usually due to some other aspect (e.g. Angel Beats' soundtrack or Konosuba's comedy).

So I was pleasantly surprised to find that AoT has very little negative qualities of its brethren and seems almost like a spectacle-heavy western show. It features an ensemble cast which is mostly realistic and the writer isn't afraid to kill or depict them suffering. And the protagonist Eren doesn't feel like a self-insert because while hot-headed he is almost always kept in check by the rest. The fights are well thought out (if you excuse how the mobility gear could possibly function) and involve tactics of some kind rather than winning because the plot demands it. And it has more political intrigue as it goes on which I like.

While some of the plot did seem ludicrous, so far I'm quite satisfied with how it's turned out. That said, I've only watched the anime and I did watch it all 47 or so episodes back-to-back. Yeah, there are better stories out there. But if you are looking for SFF and/or action in an audiovisual medium you don't have much choice outside of anime and AoT is one of the best in that regard.
