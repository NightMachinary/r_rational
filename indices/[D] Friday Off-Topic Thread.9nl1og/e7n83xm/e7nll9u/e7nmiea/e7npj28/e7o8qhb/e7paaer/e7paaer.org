I'm going to keep it very general because it's too easy to connect my company with my real identity.

My company heavily utilizes software and web automation (think Selenium and PhanomJS) to perform activities that are traditionally done manually. The core automated task is something so banal that most people's reaction when they find out is, "Seriously?"

Each individual activity only brings in a small amount of money, but the market is huge and scaling is easy when it's fully automated.

Building it out:

1. Identify opportunity and get over the hump of "Seriously?"
2. Lean heavily on automation skills that I learned while botting computer games (thanks, MapleStory/Neopets) as a kid.
3. Rely on third parties to do marketing and advertising for me.
4. Scale up using software instead of people.
5. Eventually hire people.
