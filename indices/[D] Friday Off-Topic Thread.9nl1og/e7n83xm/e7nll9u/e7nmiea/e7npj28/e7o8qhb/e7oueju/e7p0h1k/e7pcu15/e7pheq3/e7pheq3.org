Just trying to help, from what you said it lead me to think that you weren't making this choice because you wanted the returns from it, but because you want something to do.

Your choice isn't bad don't get me wrong, it's just that it seems it didn't work out so perhaps it'd be a good idea to move on.

Maybe learning swahili isn't worth it roi wise, but I don't think Tim meant for you to take his examples literally. Something competitive like a sport, or martial arts could be a good idea, you'd also make new friends and meet new people. Check out HEMA btw maybe you'll like it..

This is not a simple problem, you could try learning from people that have been in your position, or you could try figuring it out by yourself. Most of them just start other projects i.e Ferriss became a writer, then started a podcast.. No matter what you decide to do, good luck ;P
