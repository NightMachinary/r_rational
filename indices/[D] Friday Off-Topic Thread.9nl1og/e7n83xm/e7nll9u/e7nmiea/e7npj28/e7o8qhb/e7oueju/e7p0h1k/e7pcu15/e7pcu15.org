Given the limited amount of info that I shared, I think it's pretty presumptuous to say that I chose the first option that presented itself. I admit that I'm envious of my SO and heavily influenced by them, but I have put a reasonable amount of thought into my choice. After all, it's going to cost two years of my life and $200k. I'd be crazy not to think it through.

Re: 4-hour Workweek, I assume you're referring to one of these two chapters:

- Mini-Retirements: Embracing the Mobile Lifestyle

- Filling the Void: Adding Life After Subtracting Work

Mini-Retirements - I'm quite well traveled by now, but traveling for the sake of traveling has lost much of its luster. Now I want experiences with the people I care about. Too bad all my friends are climbing the corporate ladder and my SO is a full-time student.

Filling the Void - The void in my life is people/team/collaboration-shaped. I don't think I can fill it by becoming a world class pan flute player or learning Swahili. Business school though? That might fit the ticket. Joining a startup or some kind of maker community might do it too, but that comes with its own host of issues. And I live literally down the street from Harvard and MIT... it's too good of an opportunity to pass up.
