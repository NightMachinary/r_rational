This might be a silly idea since I don't really know how the application process to HBS works, but couldn't you send an email asking why you weren't qualified? Because I don't understand how a school for business could possibly reject someone who has constructed a 10,000,000+ dollar figure company. Asking for their reasons could be illuminating and help with future applications. I've asked some colleges why I wasn't admitted before and they were sometimes perfectly willing to help me by explaining why.
