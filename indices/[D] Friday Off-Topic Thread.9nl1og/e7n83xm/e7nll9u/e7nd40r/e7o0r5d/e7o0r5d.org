I was just thinking about undertale, and when you actually sit down and count them all, there are a /ton/ of characters that cheat death: Napstablook (and implied Mettaton), flowey, chara, toriel, asgore, gaster, and the entire mechanic of DETERMINATION. Creating a plot where the multiple factions are competing to create forms of immortality actually fits into the canon plot of undertale really well.
