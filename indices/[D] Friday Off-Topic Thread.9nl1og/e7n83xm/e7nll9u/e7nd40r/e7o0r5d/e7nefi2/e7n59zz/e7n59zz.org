I recently had the very entertaining experience of reading [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/201644][/Island/]] (by Richard Laymon). It's basically an ecchi manga in text form.

The premise is that a guy goes on a cruise to the Bahamas in his personal yacht, bringing along some close relatives (two male, four female) and the protagonist (the boyfriend of the only female relative who's unmarried---they're both college students). While everyone except the yacht's owner is having a picnic on an isolated island, the yacht explodes, stranding everyone on the island and apparently killing the yacht's owner. However, it very quickly becomes apparent that the yacht's owner intentionally rigged the explosion and is seeking to kill the others, presumably for their money and/or life insurance.

This all sounds quite run-of-the-mill, but the protagonist's narration makes the story much more amusing than it otherwise would be, as the Goodreads reviews like to point out. However---unlike, say, /High School of the Dead/, [[https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8t2291/d_friday_offtopic_thread/e145ae0/][whose lewdness I've described as "gratuitous"]]---/Island/ does a very good job of avoiding [[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Mood_Dissonance][Mood Dissonance]], IMO. I rate it four stars.
