What are this subreddit's thoughts on Attack on Titan?

I watched the first season a while ago and dropped it when I thought the final reveal in the season one finale was too ridiculous to ever have a satisfying explanation. A friend urged me to give it another shot, so I read the manga, and I wound up being pleasantly surprised with how well everything was planned and plotted compared to how ludicrous I thought it was at first.
