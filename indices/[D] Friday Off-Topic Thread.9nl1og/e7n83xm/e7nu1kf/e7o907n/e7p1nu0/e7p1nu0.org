I can imagine how draining it would be to react and read every single negative comment. Especially when a lot of them are just a few words saying that they disliked it, you can't get much feedback from that.

In this case though (perhaps because it was the only response I got) I am pretty happy I engaged. The person responded with a more thorough critique, and PM'd me later to say some encouraging stuff about my work and the execution of it.

I don't know about you personally, but I have a very hard time finding people interested in reading my work or giving me feedback, and that feedback is usually vague responses about why they liked it. While that is nice, and is a little ego boost, it doesn't actually make me better. I know enough about my writing to know there's a lot to work on (which is one of the reasons I love writing).

Having someone, anyone, give feedback, was worth the initial emotional discomfort for me, because I don't have many other opportunities. Feedback is worth a lot more to me right now due to the scarcity, but I imagine with my established authors it's not worth it. Because you are receiving so much of it and because reading so much negative feedback can be harmful and draining, it would probably be a pretty bad idea.
