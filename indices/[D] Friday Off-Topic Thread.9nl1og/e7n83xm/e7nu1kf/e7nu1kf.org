Some people just react to works in primarily negative ways. I've had people who read through 30+ chapters and left a negative comment on each of them, then dropped the work with a multi-paragraph comment that I didn't really feel like reading. There's probably something to be said for reading every single comment and evaluating them on their merits, but I personally find that really emotionally/creatively draining, especially when there are people whose MO is to be hostile toward the work. If you're able to, ignore those people, though that's a little bit harder if they're one of the only people that you're hearing from.

I think a lot of people are like that in real life too; to them, everything sucks, and most of their time is spent pointing out how everything sucks, usually without any mention of what's good or how things could be better. People get caught up in the feeling of outrage and anger, and then they just run with that because it's self-sustaining, especially if there's an audience/community for it.
