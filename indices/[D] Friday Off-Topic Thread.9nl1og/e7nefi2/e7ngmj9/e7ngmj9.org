I stopped caring after the second season, where the one characters that has all the answers to the series' mysteries, strong incentives to stay with the heroes, and a crush on one of them decides to just run off and stay with the bad guys for no reason.

I've seen this style of storytelling before, and no thanks.

Also it was starting to look like the story was going to try to tell some intricate multi-layered backstory about how the Titans were created, and secret religious conspiracies among the elites of the show's society, etc, which really isn't for me. Every fantasy and their mother has a multi-layered conspiracy of shadowy cults and evil aristocrats; what I wanted was a simple story about giant invincible zombies and the logistics of fighting them; fighting attrition and maintaining morale despite the fact that even the best Titan killers take casualties in the best of circumstances.
