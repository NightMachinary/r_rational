Really sad MoL got pushed back a week. I've had three exams in the past 2 days, and have to write a multilevel feedback queue in C by Sunday night. I could use the distraction, one that can't consume too much time even if I procrastinate.

Speaking of distractions, Sudoku is quite a good one. I downloaded an app for it on my phone a few months ago, and it's just a fantastic way to relax and not think about other things. Reading or watching a video doesn't always work because it's pretty easy to zone out of those and focus on other stuff, but Sudoku takes enough attention that it's difficult to zone out of. I've also become pretty good at it without any instruction on how to play at a higher level. My record for the hardest puzzles my app has is 3:45, and for the medium level difficulty that I primarily use as a time waster my top 10 scores are all between 2:00 and 2:40. When I picked up my first Sudoku newspaper puzzle for the first time in forever about 5 months ago, it took me like half an hour to get through a moderately difficult one.

I've also finally moved up to doing bench press reps with 45 plates, which I'm proud of. I don't know my one rep max because I don't have anyone to spot me and that's dangerous, but I finally feel comfortable enough to do sets with 135 pounds of iron. I think this is the first time Ive ever been consistent about going to the gym, and it's nice that it's showing.
