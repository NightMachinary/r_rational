It's best when reviewing a work and you know the author will see it to focus on how the work can be improved, rather than just problems. For internet serials, the author generally isn't getting paid, so it just feels really rude to insult the work rather than offer constructive feedback when you didn't even pay for the experience. I know Alexander Wales has talked about this experience in detail, and he described how bad it made him feel when people would offer simplistic, unhelpful feedback on something he spent so much time working on.

I'm of the opinion that people are too critical of others over text, including myself, and it's a trend that should be reversed. Just because you aren't face to face with someone doesn't diminish the impact your words have.
