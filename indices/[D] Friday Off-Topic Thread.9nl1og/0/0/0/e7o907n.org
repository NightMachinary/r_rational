  I've had people who read through 30+ chapters and left a negative comment on each of them, then dropped the work with a multi-paragraph comment that I didn't really feel like reading.

Personally at least I find it a lot easier to offer negative feedback than positive feedback. If a story's bad, it's obvious why it's bad: the character's dull, the spelling is bad, it's an unoriginal setting, whatever it's almost always obvious. If a story's good, it's a lot harder to describe why it's good. That doesn't mean in my head I'm spend more time thinking "that's bad" than "that's good" because I prefer my comments to be meaningful, where as in my head I'm fine with just thinking "that's good".

Even this comment is an example of this, I'm giving negative feedback to your statement because it's very easy to verbalize what I disagree with about it. But I don't think I've ever given positive feedback to you when you've commented, even if I do think "alexanderwales has a real insightful comment here", because I don't really have anything positive and meaningful to say.
