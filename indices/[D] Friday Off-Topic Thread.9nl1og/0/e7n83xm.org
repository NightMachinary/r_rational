So I've been writing a [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/13920/smokeworks][web-serial]] for a short while now, with a pretty low amount of readers (Which is fine, I don't really put it out there), and for the first time yesterday I had someone go through and comment on a decent amount of my chapters.

Some of the comments were honestly, not the nicest. Mostly about how my characters are bland, and how you could kill off the main character, and it wouldn't matter, or how the characters are too sad and too much of "pussies". They were essentially the only comments on my piece, so it felt pretty bad.

I responded back to the latest comment , which said that they were dropping the series, and said I was sorry my story didn't work for them, and that I hoped they found something they liked better. They responded to that with a pretty long response with the reasons why they stopped reading, what they liked, and how they thought that parts of it were being dragged out, which was actually really helpful. Along with that there were numerous comments from them about spelling/grammar mistakes, which I fixed. So the whole process kind of sucked, because it feels bad when you get a negative critique, even when that critique is probably deserved.
