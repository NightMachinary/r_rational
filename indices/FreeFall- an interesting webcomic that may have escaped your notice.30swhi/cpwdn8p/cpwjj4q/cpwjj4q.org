consider: would you destroy, say, yellowstone national park to build a hospital?

whether you would or not (I would, by the way) there's obviously a trade-off, a downside accepted for the superior upside; and in the case of FAI, we don't know exactly what we're trading away.

that is to say, FAI has all the drawbacks of a X maximizer, where X is something we think is really neat and we should have more of. those being: what if we're wrong and what if we end up needing some Y every now and again, too?
