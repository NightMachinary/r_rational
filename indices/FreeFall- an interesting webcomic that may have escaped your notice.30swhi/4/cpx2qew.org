I quite enjoy this strip. Thank you. The author clearly is using a lot of humor at the expense of lawyers, politicians, telemerketers and managers, but behind that there seems to be a simple, but fairly thoughtful consideration of alternate intelligences.

It's fun to be able to get a chuckle out of something that is actually serious. It's almost like the author is trying to hide his serious thoughts under lowbrow humor so more people will actually read it. If that's the intent, I'm impressed. It it's accidental, I'm amazed.
