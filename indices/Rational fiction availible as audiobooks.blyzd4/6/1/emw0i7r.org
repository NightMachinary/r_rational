Well, Worm may have realistic and intelligent characters behaving in complex ways, but that isn't, by itself, sufficient to make participation enjoyable. The same could be said of a skilled dentist and his assistant performing root canal surgery. If you are merely a neutral observer, or if you sympathise most with the dentist, you might like it, but if you feel for the patient, it might not be much fun.
