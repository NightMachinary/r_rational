I do the same... actually one of the mais reasons why I can't see myself with an iPhone is the Moon+ Reader app and it's TTS functionality... I couldn't find anything nearly as good on iOS.. also after finding that functionality I've never got another audiobook, i prefer the flexibility of being able to read and/or listen to the book.
