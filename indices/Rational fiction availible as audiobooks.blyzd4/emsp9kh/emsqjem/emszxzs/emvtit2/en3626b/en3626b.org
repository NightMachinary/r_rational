I'd suggest [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0fV8wR4wu4&list=PLqzaEaXT1reNb_FCxDOk7LZHj00tiouY7][Mother of Learning]], narrated by John Gilmore. It's a pretty good read, and it's time loop fiction which is one of my favourite tropes. I haven't seen it mentioned as rational fiction before, but it definitely fits the bill in my book, even if it doesn't seem like it at first. It's very much a rationalist Bildungsroman.

EDIT:

  Are there any other rational stories like HPMOR that have a complete or up-to-date audiobook? Other things I prefer are that the main characters be kids, and that at least one of them is a girl.

Well, this sort of fits that. Zorian and Zach are kids, though both are male. Kirielle is Zorian's younger sister, and Taiven is Zorian's older female friend, though I believe she's around 19 or 20? My favorite female character in the story would have to be Ilsa, though, even though she's a teacher and not a protagonist, per se.
