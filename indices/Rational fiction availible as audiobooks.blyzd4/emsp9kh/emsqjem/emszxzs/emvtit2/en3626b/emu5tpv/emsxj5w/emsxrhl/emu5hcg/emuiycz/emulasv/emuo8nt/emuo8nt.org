I liked Worm, and I liked it because it was dark, but I wasn't convinced it ended with everybody dying - I felt it was between the two extremes where you already know how it ends (everybody lives/dies). When I read Game of Thrones (first book) I got the impression that it was being told by someone standing in the middle of a graveyard, explaining how an entire nation fought against itself until everyone was dead. In Worm, the MC does make a difference, but the price is high. In both cases, you know it isn't the last book in the series, though.
