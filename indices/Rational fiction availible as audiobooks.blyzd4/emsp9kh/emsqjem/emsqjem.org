This is a question that's [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/873xm5/rational_fiction_podcast_recommendations_like/][been]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6omc2o/any_recomended_audio_books/][asked]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5us4xo/meta_rational_audiobooks/][before]], though not recently. Audiobook projects are slow work, so the linked threads should still cover most of what you're looking for that's actually available.
