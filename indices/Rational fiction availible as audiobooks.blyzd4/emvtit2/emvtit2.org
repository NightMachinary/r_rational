Hey I know this isn't strictly what you were asking for but I have a suggestion that my assist you. I use the text-to-speech function of my ebook reader i use on my phone (Moon+ Reader). I know this may seem unpalatable at first but i remember acclimating to it over the course of a day or two.

If you listen to audio books for the quality of the narration, then i'm not sure if you would find this arrangement ideal, but if you listen to audio books for the convenience, this may be helpful for you.
