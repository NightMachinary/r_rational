I respect your opinion on Worm, though I feel like you should keep going, as someone who was also caught up early (and later) in worm, do not trust your ability to predict the plot, you are almost certainly incorrect. Unless you are like myself and have sought spoilers for some specific plot points that you have knowledge of, I did this and it made me dread some of the twists that I knew were coming, even then, I thing you should keep going, the skill with which the story and characters are written will likely exceed whatever expectations those spoilers have given you, it is a truly great book.

If it is the quality of the audiobook that has driven you off... Then I can't really blame you, some of the voice actors that do the earlier arcs can be pretty bad, the way I dealt with this is using a text to speech reader and a worm EPUB file to read those arcs, as I also do not really enjoy reading manually.
