Cultivating Civilizations are horrible places for people to live.

Abducted from his retirement, Jack was placed into such a world.

He has two options. Either he can follow the traditions of the world and kill his way to the top, or try to change the world into one where people don't have to.

Follow him on his path as he tries to balance his past life's morals with this life's realities.

Jack doesn't care that a sea of people stands in his way, he will nurture a sea of his own and drown them.
