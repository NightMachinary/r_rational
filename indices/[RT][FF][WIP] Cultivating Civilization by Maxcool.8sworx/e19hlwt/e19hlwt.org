I have read it, but not really liked it.

First, there is one of my hated tropes/tendencies: if it's rational, it must be dark. This story looks at the common cultivation tropes, and looks through black-tinted glasses.

Second, it greatly irks me how MC refers to the natives of the world as "primitives". Every tine I see it, I want to retort: "who are you to say that, your culture is 400 years old and their - 40000", or something like that. Colonial mindset is not any less dangerous than "primitive".

And third, underlying the previous, I believe there is a huge plothole in the worldbuilding. The first stages of cultivation are very easy and very cheap to achieve! Even servants, who don't posess good aptitude, can apparently reach the first stage in a week, and third stage in a few months. Requiring no resources at all, starving and being repeatedly harmed and drained of mana. There is absolutely no reason why not everyone is a cultivator then! A sect which transformed their outer portion to include the entire country which they rule would benefit tremendously: more recruits with hidden talents, more efficient resource gathering etc. This is something that should have happened in the world the author describes. But didn't because the author wanted to do a colonialist fantasy of a transmigrated White Man who would teach those stupid primitives the Right Way.
