As with anything of this type 90% of everything is crap. So I find that the best places to find new stories are sites that have robust rating systems.

[[http://topwebfiction.com/][topwebfiction.com]] and [[http://webfictionguide.com/][webfictionguide.com]]

are good places to start.

I have found a number of very good novels on [[http://royalroadl.com/][royalroadl.com]]. The site has a very nice rating system and search feature. Making an account is free and will remember where you are in a story if you leave and come back later. The downside of this site is that average quality is low so the 90% rule is closer to 95% crap, but there are tons of new stories so you can always find a few gems in the mountains of crap. Additionally specific niche genres are heavily favored, litRPG, OP MC power fantasy, etc. If you are not into those types of stories you may find the site less useful.

Lastly reddit is a pretty good way to find new stories. Especially this subreddit. [[/r/fantasy][r/fantasy]] some times has some good recommendation threads.

I am always looking for new stories and sites so if anyone else has recommendations I would loved to hear them.

Of course this subreddit
