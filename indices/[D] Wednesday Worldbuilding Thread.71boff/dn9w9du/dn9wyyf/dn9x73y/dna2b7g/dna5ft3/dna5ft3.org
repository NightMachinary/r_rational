Well, to do it /right/, you wouldn't just construct a story and then include bits like [math problem goes here], because then you're not doing much different than if the peacock/ritual thing was something like, say, archery contests or musical singing ability.

Like, if you assume a world in which men present problems to women which are hard to do and easy to check, that implies a lot of things about that world, and a lot of things about the specific problems used (because they have to be doable in relatively short order by a well-trained humanish brain). And it seems like it would be /really, really hard/ to do that if you weren't well-schooled in both mathematics and complexity theory.

I mean ... just as a starting point for a story, there's a woman who is going to a society ball to placate her father and needs to make decent enough showing that there's no scandal, which isn't hard for her because she's brilliant and actually interested in mathematics, rather than interested in the results that mathematics can bring her (namely, a good husband). At the ball, she meets a man who asks questions outside the norms of their sociocultural tradition, giving mathematical problems that not only challenge his partners, but are designed to probe into how they think, and which reveal /him/ as brilliant to anyone paying attention.

I would submit that I could write such a thing, but it would take me /ages/ to do, because I'd have to get a grasp on a lot of things that I don't have a grasp on. That is, if I wanted to do it /right/ and display actual intelligence that puts some amount of narrative/character weight on the math, rather than just using math problems as an interesting set dressing (which would be far simpler).
