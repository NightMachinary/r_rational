I put some brain time on this.

For the math, as said before, you want problems are are difficult to solve, easy to check, /and easy to convey/. Maybe solving roots of polynomials? Factoring numbers? I don't know. I think I could fill out the problems with factoring questions leading into prime numbers (the factoring gets harder to check as the factors get larger), culminating with various [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoprime][pseudoprime]] numbers.

But to make the story interesting in any manner, I think some more worldbuilding needs to be done. The gentlemen can't just be spouting random problems, but should be giving relevant problems. They should have a genuine need for solutions. Hence the need for a wife that can be trusted to solve real problems that are encountered on a day-to-day basis.
