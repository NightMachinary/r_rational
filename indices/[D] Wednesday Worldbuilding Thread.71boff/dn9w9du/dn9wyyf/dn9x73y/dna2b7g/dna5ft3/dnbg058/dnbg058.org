Okay, I have a skeleton of a short story ready to go, if someone with a heavy math background wants to write the damned thing:

$FEMPROT is a bright young woman of marriageable age who is going to a society ball in order to appease her father. She's plain-looking but very gifted at math, and more than being gifted, she has a genuine interest in it. However, she isn't really looking for a husband, because that would likely mean the end of being allowed to devote huge numbers of hours to esoteric math.

The entire story takes place at a society ball, and the first few problems she's presented with are within the same set of boring old problems, difficult but with defined algorithms for solving that you just have to churn through, algorithms that every marriage-age woman knows, where the only challenge is how fast you can do it. This goes on for one or two examples.

$FEMPROT is then approached by a somewhat standoffish and brusque man, who begins asking her a series of questions. The first of these is rote, which she breezes through, and she's about to turn away when he asks her another. She churns through it, but it's a much harder one in the same class, because it butts up against one of the corner cases of the traditional algorithm used for solving that problem. She finds this somewhat annoying, because it makes her look like she doesn't know her stuff, but she gets the answer out after some time and awkward standing around.

Then he asks her a third question, still within the same problem set as the previous two, and again it's a corner case where the traditional solution algorithm is terribly slow. At that point, she realizes that this is part of the test, and switches to a different, little-known solving algorithm that performs well on that particular edge case.

From there, the problems start to wander into the esoteric, and most often the man gives them two or three times, each time hitting at a different part of the problem space, each time encouraging different methods of solution. This testing goes on for a bit, and after every time, he says "That's correct", which is too blunt, a little bit off-putting (because she's the one doing the hard work), and a little bit thrilling (because who doesn't like being told that they're right). But the /problems themselves/ are interesting ones, and the challenge is thrilling for $FEMPROT, in a way that she hadn't expected when coming to the society ball.

But things take a turn when the problems start to change, and it takes her at least two of them to mark the difference. The solutions are no longer checkable in P time, yet he continues going on with his "that's correct". This is enraging, because he's not even doing the easy part anymore, he's just taking her word for it. So on the third one of this set, she solves it and then gives the wrong answer to him, expecting to shove it in his face, but he instead says, "that's incorrect" and continues on. What happened is obvious to her; he planned all these problems ahead of time and laboriously solved them, or got a woman to solve them.

So she calls him out, and he mildly replies that he solved the problem himself. She makes a major breach of etiquette and challenges /him/ with a problem, which they both finish solving at the same time, which leaves her breathless, shocked, and in love.

At which point he says that she's the most extraordinary woman he's ever met, and that he has a proposition for her; he wants her to help him work on designing something called a mechanical computer (and, incidentally, he would like to start courting her, on the understanding that the courtship would give her some social cover to do the work).

(I am mostly interested to see whether you could actually write a story like that where a lot of the twists and turns rest on mathematical/algorithmic problems. My guess is that the payoff wouldn't be worth the effort.)
