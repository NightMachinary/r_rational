I've been super into peacocks lately, and thinking about how variant humanoid species might have wildly impractical displays for mating purposes.

- The female Equis put almost all of their efforts into mathematics, specifically in solving NP problems whose solutions can be checked in P time, with solution checking being done by the males. There are big society balls where eligible women are repeatedly tested by eligible men.
- Female scill have a large shell on their backs, which they decorate with complex dioramas and cityscapes. Because all this is done on their back, the complexity and beauty of these three-dimensional scenes is a testament to either a stable family that can devote time to shell-work, a lot of money paid in labor, or a woman who is dexterous and proficient enough to carefully manipulate long, complex tools through mirrors. (There is some taboo against not doing it yourself, and most prospective mates will ask questions about the scene in order to test a woman's knowledge.)

Does anyone have more?
