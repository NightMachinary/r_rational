Heh, female humans are ALREADY peacocks in this respect. Shaving off all your body hair, painting yourself, wearing painful and impractical shoes and clothes and having hair styled in a way that requires constant attention and so on.

I'm not just saying this to make a feminist point, but to point out that in any intelligent species there will be at least some who go against the tradition and point out how unfair it is on the gender in question. THey will in turn find mates among those who are either short of a mate or politically minded enough to prefer the counter signalling to the original signalling. Meanwhile whole industries of shell builders etc will spring up, advertising their wares as 'self pampering' and 'because you're worth it', and because they are making money off this they will sell to people outside the mating age range and possibly even to the other gender because it's a whole new market. And you will get trans members of the species who do it because they really LIKE higher mathematics or shell building...

I could go on, but you get the general idea :-)
