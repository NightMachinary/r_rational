I mean, a cultivator doesn't have any other abilities that would allow him to project force. If he's not there, in person, then he's not any different from anyone else. How would he know you're a cultivator? You're in a shack in the woods, and your family comes by once a day to give you some rice, fish and water, hoping you'll have a breakthrough so you can join a clan or sect or the army(in that order).

And say a cultivator manages to become the ruler of a country(which is dumb, as every moment he spends maintaining his political power is a moment that he's not increasing his cultivation power) and outlaws cultivation, so that he was the only one. It would be tantamount to inviting invasion by neighbouring countries, or even just random wandering cultivators. In this world, there's no rock paper scissors, there's only rock rock rock. And a country with 3 rocks is more powerful than a country with 1 rock(not necessarily, of course, but you get my point).

Also, cultivation is unending. There is no point where you stop becoming more powerful, and once you start on that path you don't tend to stop.

As to your second point, there's two reasons why there would be no animosity from the common person:

First, it's ingrained into their society. Becoming a cultivator is one of the few ways to jump immediately to (the bottom of) the highest social class in the world. The lowest cultivator is above every other non-cultivator in the world(or so cultivators believe, and might makes right in spades). As an aside: while anyone can become a cultivator, few actually manage to. Just like in our world, the best indicator of success in cultivation is to come from a family of cultivators.

Second, there is an outside threat that only cultivators can resist against. That's enough to turn cultivators from tyrants to saviours.
