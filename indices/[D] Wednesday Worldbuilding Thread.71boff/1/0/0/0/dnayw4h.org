Will the next person be forced or tricked into fulfilling that role?

I'm not familiar with the setting, but fey are often depicted as master tricksters and illusionists. If the task is to (say) kill the Dread Monster, then could the other fey beat the Dread Monster to the verge of death, then trick said visitor into landing the final blow? (Or could a particularly large fey beat the monster to death using the visitor as a club?) Could they lure in or outright kidnap the people maintaining the perimeter in order to do so?
