I've been working through (some of) the [[https://projecteuler.net/][Project Euler]] problems with only pencil/paper/calculator. There are at least a few (or variations) that are doable purely mentally if you have good working memory and know the right algorithms.

For example: "What is the largest even Fibonacci Number below 1 million?" (variant of [[https://projecteuler.net/problem=2][#2]])
