I feel like there's a fundamental barrier in trying to reconcile literature and mathematics in this way. Unless the reader is given the opportunity to arrive at the same conclusion, it's just another "smart-people-doing-smart-things" story. But when the problems are the focus, the plot becomes secondary and the whole thing conceivably turns into a math circlejerk with no payoff outside of the relatively niche audience. Even if you try to avoid using the math as a dressing, overlapping the two in a meaningful way seems alien to how people think and interact (or read). Analog: using a Rubik's Cube record to mediate a Tinder conversation with another speedcuber. Major creativity required for those pick up lines.
