Hmmm. Fair enough. Elite men will be distinctly unimpressed by that trick. Elite women might try it as a gateway test, and reject any men who fall for it (before presenting a sufficiently complex problem to attract the more elite men).

Some men, in response to this, may act disdainful of the first problem a lady presents to them even if they /can't/ see how the solution was arrived at.
