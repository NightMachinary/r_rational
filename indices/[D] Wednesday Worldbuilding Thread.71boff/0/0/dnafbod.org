Twice a year, members of a vampiric species (temp designation KEANU) gather at a prearranged metropolis for an event akin to a wine and cheese tasting. Males regurgitate the choicest morsels of arterial blood they've acquired since their last rendezvous. Preserved in the male's mucus to forestall clotting as well as diffuse the male's unique hormonal signature, the large globs are effectively Fruit Gushers that the females get to sample. Rarity and quality of the blood source factor into the one-upmanship.
