If a cultivator cal alter their body on that level, then they can extend their skin into a whip for a ranged attack (and then, on a hit, the end of the whip suddenly manifests really long claws and starts tearing apart the target).

If they cannot create matter inside their aura, then they can also be killed be being trapped in vacuum. (Vacuum can be generated by building an airtight room with a single small hole, and having a cultivator with a field large enough to cover the hole only permit air to leave via the hole, i.e. acting as a pump).

If they can only control matter, then they can still be killed by lasers of magnetic force weapons. Anything that they don't know about can kill them (a cultivator unaware of microwaves can be killed by a microwave beam) simply because they don't know to stop it. Or the void rifle from "Worth The Candle", which simply creates a void in whatever matter it is aimed at.
