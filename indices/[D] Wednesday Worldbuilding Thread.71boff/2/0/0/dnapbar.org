Yeah, the idea is in its infancy. To make it a /Rational Studios Production/ I would have to make it nice and tidy like that, which I fully intend to.

So in my mind, I imagine the process of cultivation being like a profound knowledge of self, both spiritually and physically. Manifesting an aura beyond one's skin is very hard because you have to make this other stuff, all the molecules and germs and bacteria yourself, which is insanely hard. Once you have your aura firmly manifested, the difference between what you know and what you don't is very clear. Anything that changes your "self", anything that intrudes on the millimetre that you know so very intimately will be like a needle in your eye; you'll flinch. Eventually (with training) you'll react reflexively in the correct manner.
