It's one of those things that I see and think "this is a great idea that needs metrics". To use this in a work of fiction, I would probably sit down and determine:

A) what the supersets of power are, then what the subsets of power are

B) how many standardized years of study/meditation each superset/subset would normally take

I'd start with "ways to kill a person" and circle outward from there. Stopping an arrow from entering your aura (and from there, your flesh) is one thing, doing it instinctively is another, doing it while you're asleep takes even more practice. Imbibing or inhaling poison is a concern, if you don't know enough to reverse it, and if you actually need to eat and drink because you don't know enough about those processes to replace them entirely.

You'd also need a rigid definition of where the aura projects from, especially if you're involving biotinkering and matter creation.
