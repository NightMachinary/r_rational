I've always really enjoyed and admired the way Frank Herbert made his universe, particularly the Holtzman shields that made it so an advanced interstellar civilization still had a heavy emphasis on personal skill with melee weapons.

The melee weapon/personal skill part is something that I also want to have in my story, so here's my idea:

I was thinking of having cultivators(yes, this is my take on the xianxia genre) at a certain level of power being able to extend a sort of "aura of omnipotence" from their skin. This field extends initially a millimetre or less (with legendary masters attaining mastery of up perhaps ~20 cm from their skin) in which they have complete control. So it's impossible to kill these people because they can simply not allow something hostile to enter that field. After a lot of training the very gifted can even manage to perceive themselves at a molecular level, and if they attain the knowledge of how to correctly change their own biology, they can change it to so that they are practically immortal.

The only way to kill a cultivator with an aura is by penetrating it with another aura. So two cultivators can beat each other to death with their hands, or they can use the very rare weapons made from the metal extracted from the meteors that rarely fall, and which are highly contested. When the weapon is bound to the cultivator's soul(an arduous and uncertain process), the weapon can extend the cultivator's aura just like it was their own body.

So this is a world where a common person can't even fathom defeating a cultivator of any skill. Where the average cultivator will spend a decade meditating and trying to achieve the understanding to extend an aura and affect an outside object's momentum simultaneously. Where many die of old age before they can perceive themselves at a small enough scale to rejuvenate themselves. Where what a person can do is entirely up to their skill and their imagination.

Some ideas of what's possible: Fly like a superhero, use their own bodies like a missile, accelerate objects like a railgun, create matter from nothing, alter existing matter, altar other animals, alter one's own body into an absurdly massive monstrosity with an implausible number of redundant organs, replicate objects, replicate yourself, heal others, travel into outer space, travel between solar systems (or even galaxies?) travel through the planet's core, the sun's core.

Anyone have any thoughts?
