This quote shows The Pilgrim's--and by extension--Good's hubris: /he/ could not heal the creature, so it must be put down; /he/ cannot cure the corruption in Procer, thus it must be destroyed. It's very self-centered in a way. Maybe the wyvern would have liked to continue living, despite the pain, just as like the people of Procer would probably like to continue existing despite the corruption, but their wishes don't matter because Tariq knows better.
