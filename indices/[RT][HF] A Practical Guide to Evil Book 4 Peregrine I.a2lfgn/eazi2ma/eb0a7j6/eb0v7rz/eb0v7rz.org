Do you really think it is more moral to allow a extremely dangerous animal to exist in a state of pain? Would you consider it immoral to painlessly kill a wolf or bear that is infected with rabies?

It really seems like you are just looking for a way to criticize the moral attitude of the Pilgrim and the Heroic mindset in general rather than actually analyzing their actions.
