I don't think it's fair to say that Below is looking for entertainment. It's the age old argument between parents that want their kids to obey them and parents that want their kids to surpass them, or at least grow self-sufficient. By being awful, Below forces its followers to rely on themselves. Heroes look to angels for help all the goddamn time. Villains only summon demons from a position of control.

Objectively, right now Below is worse, but in the long run, who knows? It's worth pointing out that Summer and Winter fae were both awful, almost equally so. You can see a focus on the long run is the way Below uses hunger/ambition as a way to shape its tools. The ratlings are one of their poorer efforts, hungry all the time. The orcs have massive caloric requirements. The goblins were weaker than other races. Praes has the Wasteland. The Gods below created their followers in a position of needing to strive, but the Gods above keep them there. The only logical conclusion for followers of below is that they need to break the rules and wreck the game for any sort of justice; which is probably what the Gods below wanted in the first place.
