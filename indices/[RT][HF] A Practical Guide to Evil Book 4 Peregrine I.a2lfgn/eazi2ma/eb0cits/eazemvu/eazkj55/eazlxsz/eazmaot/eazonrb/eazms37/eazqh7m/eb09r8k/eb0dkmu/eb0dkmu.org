'Destroying the army and culling the population of breeding age by four tenths should be enough.'

'Every former Trueblood not currently aligned with these so-called â€˜Moderates' would have to be killed and their entire family line ripped out root and stem'

'Using the Calamities to destroy the capital of the Principate, for a start, should incapacitate its ruling infrastructure. Using a surprise strike to torch and poison the central principalities, the main farmlands of Procer, would lead to widespread starvation come winter'

-Villainous Interlude: Decorum.

Yes. So very compromise inclined and moderate.

Edit: More to the point though I'm not really sure what your argument is. Killing Black will somehow lead to the war becoming much bigger and kill millions? How? The war has already gotten to the stage of mass civilian casualties with the involvement of the Dead King, and Black has no connection there. The Pilgrim already knows Cat is willing to negotiate with the Crusade, so his influence isn't needed there. Malicia will never negotiate on even terms with the Crusade since one of their central goals is to depose her.

Black is an enemy combatant currently engaged in a campaign to cause mass starvation in the Principate. Stopping him undoubtedly saved tens of thousands of lives. You could definitely argue that that didn't justify using a plague or killing a town full of civilians, that the Pilgrim should have found another way, but I don't see how you could think that killing his soldiers and capturing Black somehow leads to millions of deaths.
