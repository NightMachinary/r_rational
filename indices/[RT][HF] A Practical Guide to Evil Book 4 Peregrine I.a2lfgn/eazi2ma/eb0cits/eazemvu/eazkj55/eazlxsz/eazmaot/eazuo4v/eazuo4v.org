I see these comments all the time but don't agree with the position at all. Below/evil seem to like domination and power and cruelty and chaos (demons anyone?) which seem more connected with letting people do mostly what they please. With a few small nudges here and there, narrative twists and pacts and comprimises with evil.

Meanwhile Good isn't only good but is focused on healing and destroying evil. Yes they want to beat Evil, but in their minds overwhelming people with virtue is okay. They aren't really utilitarians, but more focused on virtues. And that doesn't make them bad.
