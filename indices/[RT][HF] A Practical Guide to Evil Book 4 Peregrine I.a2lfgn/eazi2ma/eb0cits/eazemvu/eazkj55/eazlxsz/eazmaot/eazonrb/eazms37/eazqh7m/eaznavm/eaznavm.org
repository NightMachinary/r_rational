evil is all about change/chaos, they will just force you to make harder and harder choices, but in the end it's you who make them, and then you look back and notice you stand alone with nothing behind you.

Good is all about order and they make the choices for you, basically mind controlling their servants to a degree.

the point is that EXTREMES are bad in either direction, if you get a splinter in a finger evil would see it fester just to see what happens while good would cut of the entire arm.
