Agreed. People going on about how evil the Pilgrim is are simply being hypocritical.

What he did to stop Black was undeniably horrible, but let's face it, Black is a mass-murdering monster who was in the middle of a campaign to sack cities and cause mass starvation. What the Pilgrim did likely saved hundreds of thousands of lives in that campaign alone, not to mention all the people he would have killed if he had escaped Procer afterwards.

The Pilgrim's plague was an ugly deed, but it's no worse than many of the things Catherine has done in the name of the greater good, and frankly, it was for a much more clear cut greater good.

And no, Above and Below are not the same. Above promotes ideals of justice, mercy and honour. Good nations and heroes don't always live up to that but at least they try. Below on the other hand encourages betrayal, murder and human sacrifice. Even the best, most reasonable and rational villains in history - Malicia and Black - still conquered a neighbouring Kingdom and practiced suppression and institutionalised murder.

Above has Choirs, which are inhuman forces capable of extreme, horrific deeds. But what powers do they grant? Healing. Knowledge. The ability to stand against dark sorcery, demons and devils, and all powerful madmen like the Dread Emperors. Below has the Hells. What do they bring to the world? Death. Destruction. Corruption. Devils can only be brought into the world by sorcery, often with a helping of human sacrifice, and are invariably used to kill. Demons are likewise only used by villains, and fundamentally damage reality simply by existing in Creation. The difference is rather clear.

What about Light and Night? One of them heals and protects against sorcery, and is obtained through faith and the swearing of vows. The other is used almost solely for violence and is obtained through murder and betrayal. Guess which is which.
