  let's face it, Black is a mass-murdering monster who was in the middle of a campaign to sack cities and cause mass starvation.

Okay, but if you step a layer back from that Black is the least monomaniacal or at least the most compromise inclined villain in hundreds of years, much more inclined than almost all other villains towards trying to work towards lasting international peace. This war continuing will cause /millions/ more people to die than just those who die in Procer from Black's campaign. So the only way this seems even remotely ethical is Good Named constantly reframing the story such that any cost paid to kill Evil Named is worth it.

Blacks killing is apparently so bad it's worth killing way, way more people in order to get rid of him.
