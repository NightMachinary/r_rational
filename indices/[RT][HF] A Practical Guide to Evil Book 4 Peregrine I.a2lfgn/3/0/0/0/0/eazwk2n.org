Good is focused on ruling and securing power, when considering the game of the Gods in Creation, you always, /always/, need to consider that first paragraph in the prologue to book 1.

#+begin_quote
  In the beginning, there were only the Gods. Aeons untold passed as they drifted aimlessly through the Void, until they grew bored with this state of affairs. In their infinite wisdom they brought into existence Creation, but with Creation came discord. The Gods disagreed on the nature of things: some believed their children should be guided to greater things, while others believed that they must rule over the creatures they had made
#+end_quote

/This/ gives you the mission statement for both Above and Below.

'Guided to greater things' is below, which is always pressing it's Named and followers to advance and create, to skirt the edges of the rules and push beyond them, this is rarely good for those named, and often ends in disaster. Which is very interesting, and gives these gods great amusement.

'Rule over the creatures' is above, who has forced an arbitrary and contradictory form of morality onto the world, this morality only exists to keep above in power, it /may/ in some circumstances, be beneficial, but would you say that Procer is any better a place to live than Praes? With its greedy nobles and war mongering ways?

In the end Above and Below are different and the same, one is in it for power the other entertainment. Neither of them gives a rat's ass about mortals, all they care about is their eternal pissing contest and their own amusement, the ones who should be determining morality for mortals are /mortals/, the gods can fuck off.
