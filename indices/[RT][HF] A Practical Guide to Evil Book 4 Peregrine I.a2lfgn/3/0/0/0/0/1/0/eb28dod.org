I completely agree, though I feel like entertainment is definitely part of it, it was pretty late for me when I made the comment and I haven't been keeping up with the series lately. This is more or less what I think about Below aswell, they are the tough love kind of gods, they push their followers into improvement through sheer need to survive, this makes them stronger and usually more fitting for the roles they are cast in, it however also tends to drive them a tad bonkers, not that all named aren't some level of mad, but the bad guys tend to take it to another level.
