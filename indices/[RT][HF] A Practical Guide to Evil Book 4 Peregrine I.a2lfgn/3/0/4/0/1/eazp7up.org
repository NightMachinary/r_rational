Chaotic Good is limited to doing the will of the Above regardless of how they do it. Lawful Evil are as free to oppress as any other kind. In the end Good would force everyone to help each other while Evil raises tyrants to lead for their own reasons. Both are at the same time authoritarian and egalitarian.
