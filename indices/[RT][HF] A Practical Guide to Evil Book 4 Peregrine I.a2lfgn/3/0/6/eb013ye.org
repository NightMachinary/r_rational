I think there's a point to be made that, whatever the differences between Above and Below are, they've been pretty ambiguous so far, while the similarities have received a lot of emphasis.

The author can say that "Good and Evil map to lowercase good and evil" all he wants, it's kind of hard to see it when the Saint is complicit in undermining her country in the face of total invasion for petty reasons, and Good leaders consistently screw each other over for selfish political gains (and that's without going into the Elves and the Golden Bloom). The only difference we've seen between Proceran politics and Praesi politics is that Proceran prefer conscript armies where Praesi prefer brutal assassinations and private militias; both practice deception and consider it as a valuable trait for politicians (eg Procerans can't shut up about the "Ebb and Flow", usually while gloating about their latest treachery).
