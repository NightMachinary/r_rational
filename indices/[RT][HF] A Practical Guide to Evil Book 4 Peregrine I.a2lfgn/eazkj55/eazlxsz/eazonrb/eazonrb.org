Above uses its power to reduce the pain of others but also keeps the game going. The only way to actually change things is to go "practical" because it's the only way to get away from the game and stop the endless slaughter and pain that both above and below keeps going. The difference between Above and Below, is that you can't have a "practical guide to good" because Above keeps their pieces locked down while Below grants agency.

Look at the most prominent champions of "good", Pilgrim the utilitarian who won't deviate from the path of zealotry even when it would help people. Hanno who judges all people solely based on the word of Above. Saint who would burn the innocent if she thought the ashes would work provide fertile land for more "Good". And the Bard, who literally manipulates stories to keep the game going forever.

Evil tinges it's champions so that most changes they make don't improve things, but Good doesn't change. Note that the Dwarves are the only force in Calernia who actually manage to improve upon their nation in a functional way over the centuries, and they don't seem to put much stock in either side, "You surface people quibble over devils and books".
