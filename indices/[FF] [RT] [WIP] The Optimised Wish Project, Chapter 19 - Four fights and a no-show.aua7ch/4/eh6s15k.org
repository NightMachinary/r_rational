I guess that technically [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/amotxh/comment/efnmrj2][my predictions]] about who beats who in fights have not been wrong so far, but the chapter still wound up going a different way than I thought. It was pretty obvious that Mai had some evil plan to enact with being in the tournament. I thought she would use some trickeries or hidden techniques to advance to the final match before unleashing her endgame, but in hindsight she just wanted access to the backstage. Still not sure what she gets out of shooting Giran, maybe it's a distraction or something.
