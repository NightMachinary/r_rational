I want to write a series on 'A History of Magic', meaning, historical fiction set in various eras exploring episodes we know of from the HP canon and how they intertwine with real history. I have a very clear idea for the first story, but it's still gotten hard to write for... reasons, I guess. I first tried writing it like I would pretty much anything else (though with a generally more serious tone than the OWP) but I found myself dissatisfied at how the dialogue and way of thinking of the characters felt way too modern for the setting. I then tried a more literary style of prose (drew inspiration from Virginia Woolf's "Orlando" for that one), but it felt really tiring to write for a long stretch of time in it. I also had a problem with the projected story length - I wanted it to be not longer than four chapters, but considering how much world-building I wanted to pack into it (this being obviously a very nerdy project to begin with, I had a lot of ideas for references to real history and such), it would just have felt a dense stream of exposition in that way. However I did not feel like committing to a longer work either, what with already being managing this one huge project!

My end solution was to try and write it as a mock essay. I'll pretend to be a present day magical historian who tells the tale for a modern public (which leads to some neat literary framing device). I tried writing the first chapter yesterday, and while it's perhaps not the most impactful way to convey a story (I'm sure some people will be bored at all the geeky historical asides), it's definitely the most fun and natural I've tried yet. And there's already a precedent of sorts in the HP fandom, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1149623]["Disillusion, by Hermione Granger"]]. Being an academic, it figures that writing basically a fanfiction /paper/ would be right in my alley... I hope I can finish it that way, and then I'll probably split it into three/four parts for publication.
