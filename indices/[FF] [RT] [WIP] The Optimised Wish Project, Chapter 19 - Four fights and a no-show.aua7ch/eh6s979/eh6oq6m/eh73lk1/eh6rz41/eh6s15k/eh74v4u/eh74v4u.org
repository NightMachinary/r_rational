The outcomes weren't exactly shocking. We knew Gohan and Goku had to win their fights, and Muten losing in some contrived way to Mai would have been stupid. In the only match left we have Krillin who needs to finish his arrogance arc against a stronger opponent than Yamcha, and Yamcha himself who can't be too successful or it would diverge way too much from canon.
