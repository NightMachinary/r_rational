Thanks! I've been actually swinging back and forth between different ideas (especially an Harry Potter one that I've started and rewritten at least three times now), so that slows down the process a bit. I'd really like to work in parallel on something shorter and different, just for the sake of variety (since I won't get that nice feeling of having wrapped up a story from this one for quite a while) but yeah, with my job and all I'm often just too tired to produce anything decent.
