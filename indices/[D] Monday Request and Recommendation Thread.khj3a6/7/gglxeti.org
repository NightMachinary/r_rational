RE: Monarch is on trending/most popular and is a rising fiction on Royal Road.

I just binged it yesterday and it ticks every box for a good time loop story. It has periodic check points and tangible progression with likable characters and high stakes. The author is a big fan of MoL and sought to create something to scratch the same itch. I believe they succeeded.

There is currently ~370 pages on royal road and it's of a very high quality, publishable. The author has stated that the first 100 chapters have been already storyboarded and we're currently only in the 30's, so there was some good planning put into this and you can feel it.

Highly recommended as someone who is a fan of MoL and other time loop stories.
