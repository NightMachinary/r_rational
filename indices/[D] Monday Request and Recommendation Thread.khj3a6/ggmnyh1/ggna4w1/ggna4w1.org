A similar request garnered some great recommendations close to a year ago: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ekv9s8/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/fdfwvq9/]]

I'd repeat my recommendations of [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/382450.Fevre_Dream][/Fevre Dream/]] by George R.R. Martin and [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36161.The_Madness_Season][/The Madness Season/]] by C.S. Friedman. The former is an excellent period piece set on a riverboat in the 1850s, the latter is space-age scifi that explores some interesting ideas about alien psychology.
