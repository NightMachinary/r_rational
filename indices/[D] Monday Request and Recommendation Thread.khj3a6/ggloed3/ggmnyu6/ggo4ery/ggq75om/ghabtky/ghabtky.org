I can't agree with a Forged Destiny recommendation. The story starts well but the consistent lack of self awareness and idiot ball holding of the protagonist made it actually painful to read.

He continued to show zero character development or ability to learn from mistakes which just made him very unsatisfying to follow.

Maybe it gets better later, but I dropped it around chapter 40ish I think. After he killed the soldier for executing prisoners of war, the fact that he killed them on accident made it worse. He will be advised repeatedly by his less idiotic teammates and then go on and do the opposite of what they recommended, choosing the worst possible thing at any moment.
