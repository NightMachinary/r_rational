The /Young Wizards/ series by Diane Duane sounds up your alley. It's for young adults, but I've just finished the second book and I'm quite enjoying it. Fundamentally positive outlook, close personal bonds, and, perhaps best of all, all nine (current) books in the series are [[https://ebooks.direct/products/young-wizards-new-millennium-editions-9-volume-box-set][available for just $20]] for as long as COVID is running around.

It isn't rational fic per se, but the series has been recommended /many/ times on this subreddit, its ideology is pretty anti-death (wizards are explicitly charged with fighting entropy and delaying---though not permanently averting---the end of the universe), and it even tries to explain the YA-typical trope of teenagers going off and doing spectacularly dangerous things (wizards get weaker as they get older, so the, well, /young wizards/ have to be on the front lines, as it were, while senior wizards hang back and fill an advisory role).

EDIT: There's also the [[https://ebooks.direct/collections/feline-wizards][Feline Wizards]] trilogy, because there are cat (and dog, and whale, and...) wizards, too.
