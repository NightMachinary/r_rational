I disagree on Calculating God. Not only is not a very rational book, it's not very good, period.

I first read it when it came out and I was in middle school/high school. I originally enjoyed it well enough mostly because I was too young to really get the points the book was trying to make, but then several years later I re-read it when I was well into a degree in biology.

That book is basically arguing for intelligent design. With even the most basic understanding of evolution, none of it makes any sense. And they don't explain at all what's different in the universe to make a reader think that evolution would work differently than in the real world. The arguments are clearly meant to apply not just to the book, but to the real world.

The basic premise that all life in the universe was seeded by a lifeform who's reproductive process spans multiple big bang/big crunch cycles and uses the life in one universe to create it's own next generation is super interesting and could have been done so well....if the protagonist didn't end up going on long rants about how we should have known that evolution didn't make sense and that all the arguments that intelligent design proponents made were, in hindsight, totally reasonable and we just chose not to listen, oh the folly of those arrogant scientists!

It's a cool premise that is ruined by unnecessary pushing of a totally crap viewpoint on science and evolution.

The problem is not the religion per se, it's the pushing of the narrative that evolution just doesn't make sense/is clearly wrong. I knew/know a lot of religious people in the biological sciences, and religion isn't fundamentally incompatible with our understanding of evolution. And Ive read and enjoyed lots of book with either religious protagonists or religious themes.

This book isn't just religious, it's attempting to make anti-science, anti-evolution arguments that it wants the reader to carry over and believe in the real world. It's propaganda, and it's not good enough to justify reading, which some propaganda occasionally is.

The modern day equivalent of this book would be one making the argument that climate change isn't real, and not in a speculative fiction kind of way but in "and the lessons in this book show why it's wrong in the real world too!" kind of way. No thank you.

-edit- when I re-read my comment, I realized it's kind of rambly mess. To sum up, the idea of exploring "what if intelligent design was real" could be really interesting. But just saying "lol evolution is wrong and it's obvious in hindsight" is probably the least interesting, least smart way the author could have done so.
