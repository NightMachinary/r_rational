/Calculating God/ does fit the theme of this sub, IMO (and is a good book). It may not be rational to believe in a specific religion, or a particular god, but what if Aliens came with compelling evidence that the universe was designed? (This isn't really a spoiler, its the first chapter, IIRC). The aliens are on a fact-finding mission to try to puzzle out what god is up to.

The alien is reasonably funny. The opening with the Alien talking to the security guard (who thinks this is a prank) at the museum of anthropology is amusing (this is from memory).

Sawyer's books are all fairly reasonable/rational ... like any SF books they have some leaps you have to make, but they play fair once you make them. The Hominid trilogy (about people moving back and forth between our Earth and one where we went extinct but neanderthals didn't) is also decent. Haven't read mindscan, though.

Edit -- Just read Sawyer's Wikipedia page (looking for the name of a few books) and it said "Sawyer's works frequently explore the intersection between science and religion, with rationalism frequently winning out over mysticism." Also, all of his books are fairly quick reads, I think. No door stoppers.
