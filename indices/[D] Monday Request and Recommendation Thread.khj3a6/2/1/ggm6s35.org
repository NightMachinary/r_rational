Have you read any of Brandon Sanderson or Robert J Sawyer's work? I feel like they might fit you "protagonist with an optimistic worldview" requirement.

Sanderson does mainly fantasy, has has also done some sci-fi. He's probably best known for his /Mistborn/ series. It starts out kind of like a fantasy Ocean's 11, except instead of robbing a casino they need to overthrow an immortal god-king.

For Robert J Sawyer's I would recommend /Mindscan/, which explores whether a dying woman who has her mind transplanted into an android body is still "alive," and even if they're still human. There's also /Calculating God/, which I like better, but doesn't fit the theme of this sub as well as the former. There's the /WWW/ trilogy (/Wake, Watch, Wonder/) that is essentially about a blind girl making friends with an AI. He has a bunch of other work, but unfortunately I haven't read them (yet).
