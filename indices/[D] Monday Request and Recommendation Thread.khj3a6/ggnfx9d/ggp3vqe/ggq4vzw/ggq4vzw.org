Let me preface this by saying SIs are not rational. My big thing with SIs is that you get to see AU more often than not. The original authors create an entire universe and a lot of FF just ends up being stations of cannon or they explore angst/romance in ways that make me as a reader uncomfortable.

This is typically why I enjoy a good SI. They have an entire documented verse to play in and no obligation to do anything with the plot should they choose (read: I also have a tendency to dislike stories where the SI forces themself in the main cast e.g Omg HERMIONE, HARRY, RON, and I will be BFFS for life SQUEEE.) This is a personal preference and I can see where people who feel the opposite are coming from.

So, in general, I look for things that at least respect the butterfly effect, go slightly AU, and treat meta knowledge for what it is. Op as all get out. (side note: People who feel the need to add more powers onto the SI e.g rinnei-teinseigen or some other broken thing are an immediate turn off because quite frankly that's just super boring. The gamer ability is an exception as it scratches the progresson itch)

Some of these are better than others and some I stopped reading because they got a bit carried away, but most I enjoyed.
