I think in some settings, adding powers to a SI is basically required though because otherwise it limits the stories that can be written. For example, in /Worm/, if someone just showed up suddenly with all the knowledge of canon /Worm/, Contessa and the Simurgh would notice immediately and it's very possible they would be insta-ganked or kidnapped right off the bat. Mind/precognition protection is basically mandatory.
