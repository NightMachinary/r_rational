I know a few I can easily recommend.

*[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dragonspawn-my-hero-academia-si.696280/][Dragonspawn]]*: My Hero Academia SI, where the MC is born as Ryuko Tatsuma's little sister. The SI ends up having to deal with a major disability while simultanously having a rather strong power, which is a neat combination imo. 260k words so far.

*[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/assimilation-young-justice-si.436294/][Assimilation]]*: Young Justice SI. The SI finds himself on a Psion research vessel, and is promptly eaten by nanobots. He soon teams up with another imprisoned research subject and escapes to Earth. The story has gone completely off the rails in a few interesting ways, and it's just great. 400k words so far.

*[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/whats-her-name-in-hufflepuff-harry-potter-self-insert.662488/][What's Her Name in Hufflepuff]]*: Harry Potter SI. The SI falls through a mirror into a Gringotts vault. She proceeds to use her metaknowledge to secretly work against Voldemort while remaining (mostly) in the background. Actually manages to capture some of the original series' feeling of 'whimsy,' which isn't particularly common for most fan-works as far as I can tell. 190k words so far.

*[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-calculator-dc-multiverse-si-as-canon-character-season-1-complete.39138/][The Calculator]]*: DC comics-verse SI. The SI wakes up as a minor villain (one of the ones without superpowers). But what he /does/ have is some better than average technology, an Artificial Intelligence, and a boatload of paranoia. 60k words (first 'Season' complete).

*[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15406896/chapters/35757684][Hear the Silence]]*: Pre-canon Naruto SI. Takes place way pre-canon during the Second Shinobi World War. There's a ton of original worldbuilding here since it's set so far in the past, which I found really interesting. The story leans really hard into the trauma aspect of Shinobi life, which might be a turn-off for some readers. The world is seriously brutal, and the SI regularly gets emotionaly wrecked. 690k words so far.

I'll also put a recommendation behind Sanitize.
