Honestly any of them. The only ones that toe the line are 9 (Its 40k) and 15(Has yet to get its legs and is pretty dark beginning).

More often than not I find that tragedy is synonymous with edgy. Same thing with "Evil MC", "Sociopath MC", "Dark MC", etc.. I have yet to find one of those that has been decent let alone good. Its gotten to the point where I see any of the listed above and cringe. I have a great deal of respect for people who spend their free time on the hobby of writing. In general, I love all genres, but when the writer says "Sociopath" it can 99% of the time be taken as "Hey, I want to do whatever I want and there won't be any consequences unless it advances the plot in some contrived manner." Like someone took an already annoying as hell trop from xianxia and turned it up to 11.

Edit: 14 can toe the line as well
