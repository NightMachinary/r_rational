So I read it and didn't really like it. I consider the comparison with MoL particularly poor. One of the defining aspects of MoL was the use of the time loop deliberately as a tool to grow. This story completely lacks that. The time loop is purely too-bad-try-again encounter redoing.

There are reasons why the MC is acting the way he is. Good reasons even. The timeloop works very differently than MoL. But it doesn't make the story any more like MoL.

More generally, I don't think the time loop is being very well used at a narrative level. Indeed, it's being massively underused. The time loop is this story's selling point.

It featured heavily in the Everwood chapters. That arc had the main character reset scumming through a deadly situation to survive and come out victorious. That's the core of this story's time loop. What it should be. Utterly different from MoL but it could work. But since then? In the 20 odd chapters, fully half the story so far?

It's been used exactly once.

Escaping a city his enemy has surrounded? He fails once and then gets through. None of the desperate reset scumming that so characterised the Everwood chapters. The author even sets out to make this situation different than Everwood, with the shorter reset window. Could be interesting. Could be different. But nope. One try and he's right on out of there.

And since then? Not. One. Use.

Arrives at the infernal city and has to get inside? Gives a speech and does so first time. Thrown in prison by his political enemies? Gets out without doing anything.

A trial with his life on the line, where corrupt dealings have already pre-determined the verdict against him? That has to use the time loop right? He can go through the trial multiple times, learning more about the corruption and how to bring the judges onto his side? That's perfect for this kind of time loop.

Nope. Notices the corruption and deals with it with a speech.
