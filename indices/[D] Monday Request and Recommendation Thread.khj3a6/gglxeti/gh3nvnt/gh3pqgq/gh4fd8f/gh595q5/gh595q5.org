My understanding is that the amount of time going backwards isn't necessarily consistent, and we don't know what affects how far back the MC goes. So far it's been mostly short term except for the very first incident but from the prologue it's hinted that it might not always be so short term (again why I think it's a bad idea to skip the prologue...).
