The story is this one guy's personal timeline through the repeatedly resetting world, so the setup's equivalent to the one in a non-timeloop story. I'm not a fan, either. I'd just recommend people not read the prologue- it has no bearing on the story that comes immediately after (or rather, it has a negative bearing.)
