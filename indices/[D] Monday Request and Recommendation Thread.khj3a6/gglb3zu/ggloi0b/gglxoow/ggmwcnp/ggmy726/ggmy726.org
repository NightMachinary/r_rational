I agree 100% with you on everything you said, but just like with the author of With This Ring. whenever they start spewing bullshit I skip a chapter and try to ignore it because they update regularly and consistently. I have a fuckton of free time and I'm desperate to fill it so I'll read *ANYTHING.* but con the subject of LordsFire, I tried reading his brutal harry fanfic and had to drop it because of the excessively plentiful religious references.

edit: and for the record bruce quest suffers from all the flaws you mentioned here and I apologize for not mentioning it on the list. I would remove it but that would make this whole section of the conversation weird and out of place so I'll leave it for context with a warning.
