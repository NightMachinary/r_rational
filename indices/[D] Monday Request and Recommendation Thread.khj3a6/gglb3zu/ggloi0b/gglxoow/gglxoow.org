let me point out before I begin that most of these are *not* rational and most aren't even rational adjacent, but these are the ones I liked the most.

- Apocalypse: Generic System by Macronomicon.
- Infinite Realm: Monsters & Legends.
- The Pen is Mightier by Quill Moniker.
- Dungeon Crawler Carl.
- anything written by John Bierce.
- Ar'Kendrythist. (I know it's shit, no need to remind me of it, but I enjoy it)
- Forge of Destiny. and in a similar vein even though it wasn't recommended to me, The Path Unending.
- Masters and Mages trilogy.

and just in case anyone wants some recommendations from me that I *think* haven't been mentioned before with the same caveat as the ones above:

- A song for two voices. (rational Valdemar fanfic)
- A Sword Without a Hilt: A Song of Ice and Fire/D&D 3.5 Crossover.
- Bruce Quest (for the record. this is a shit quest with an overabundance of religious propaganda that I do not agree with, but it updates daily and I have too much free time).
- Just a Bystander by Aefraga.
- Beneath the Dragoneye Moons by Selkie
- RE: Monarch by Eligos (just saw that it's recommended here in this thread).
- Tower of Somnus by CoCop.
- Super Minion by Gogglesbear.
- Traveler (Pokemon Fanfic that I've just begun to read).
- Ra. (I think it's on the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] wiki)

and right now I'm reading a progression fantasy called the Frith Chronicles by Shami Stovall. I've been thinking of making a long-ass google spreadsheet with everything I've read and reviewing it with scores on things like how much I enjoyed it, how good the grammar is, what I've thought of the magic system, etc but it's way too much work.

Lastly, a list of webcomics that I've read recently or I'm reading right now:

- Homestuck.
- Kill Six Billion Demons.
- Gunnerkrigg Court.
- Daughter of the Lilies.
- Stand Still Stay Silent.

edits: added webcomics and fixed some things.
