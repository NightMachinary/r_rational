Are you okay with non-progression fantasies? I've recently been reading some nice fanfics.

Man off the Moon is a Mass Effect / Fate Grand Order crossover in the best way possible. Main character is Nameless (basically Archer from fate stay night), and he retains most of his power, and goes ham on the mass effect universe. The author expands on the lore and locations in a good way, and explores parts of the universe that weren't shown in the games. There are also a bunch of recurring jokes that get funnier each time.

Coeur Al'Aran on ff.net writes mostly rwby fanfics with Jaune as the main character, and has a bunch of completed stories with more than 500k words. Most of them are good, some are quite good, but nothing too groundbreaking. It's like shounen manga in literature form. He also updates weekly.

Brockton's Celestial Forge has the main character get the powers of the Celestial Forge. Every few thousand words he gets a new power based on a jumpchain chart. They range from small powers that put a bonus to his crafting speed or style to big ones like knowing how to build Transformers. Really satisfying progression from nothing to building power armor in hours. Also goes deep into technobabble about how his tech (and other powers) work, which could be a plus or minus.

From Fake Dreams is a fate stay night fanfic where Kiritsugu gets dreams of the future, and starts preparing Shirou for it. It's quite long, 1 million words+, and has an out of character Shirou. It's also quite controversial for fate fans (not a high bar tbh). It's pretty fun and sometimes even emotionally provoking, given you don't look too deep into the lore. Shirou progressively gains power through the series as well.

The Games We Play and An Exercise in Stupidity (on ff.net) are two Gamer rwby fics. The first one is one is pretty popular, and finished. Gets to the endgame and encounter with final boss and everything. The second one is more recent, and has a protagonist that goes all into strength and tankiness. Results in some fun impulsive moments where the protagonist ignores lore dumps in favor of fighting his enemies.
