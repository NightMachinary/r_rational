Any good (rational) vampire stories you can recommend where vampires play the main role?

I have personally read

1. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7127255][Contratto]], a short story which was very good, apart from the ending which felt hastened
2. Peter Watts Blindsight and Echopraxia and the pseudo documentation PDF about vampires. I wouldn't count the novels as vampire novels with one vampire per book.
3. Luminosity and Radiance by Alicorn. I didn't like them. It has been quite some years, so I only remember that the main character Bella was the only really competent one on the good side. And the ending felt like wish fulfillment fantasy of the author.
4. Some Harry Potter fanfictions I really can't remember the name of.

Movies:

Apart from that the vampires in the Twilight movies weren't convincing, let alone the plot. But depending on the kind of film you want to watch and not too high expectations /Stakeland/ and /Daybreakers/ was good. Vampire Academy was okay. And /Interview with a vampire/ was good. /Let me in/ was very good. /Let the right one in/ was good - actors weren't as good as in the American adaptation (Let me in) and this one comedy-like side-story didn't fit. /The Moth diaries/ which was pretty good. Can't remember any other movies currently.
