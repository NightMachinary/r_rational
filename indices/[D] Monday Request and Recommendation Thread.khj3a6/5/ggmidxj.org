Off the back of [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37934/sexy-space-babes][Sexy Space Babes]] being recommended last week, are there any interesting and more rational scifi/fantasy high-concept attempts at exploring potential different gender dynamics?

Stuff like Amahara's two Teisou Gyakuten Sekai manga series (also a male/female dynamic swap) and Ursula K Le Guin's Left Hand of Darkness (also a human interacting with humanoid Aliens that have different gender dynamics) are the closest to Space Babes, but I'm interested if anyone is aware of anything that covers that kind of ground competently in a high-concept way.
