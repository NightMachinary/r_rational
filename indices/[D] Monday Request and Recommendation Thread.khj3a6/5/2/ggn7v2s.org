[[https://spaceandsorcery.wordpress.com/2014/08/21/the-dying-of-the-light-g-r-r-martin/][Dying of the Light]] by George R.R. Martin is a space-age scifi novel that might fit your request. The storyline focuses, in part, on the results of an isolated human civilization shaped by privation such that it developed vastly different gender dynamics as a matter of survival. The harsh, seemingly barbaric customs linger on, even centuries after the necessity which bore them has been relieved.
