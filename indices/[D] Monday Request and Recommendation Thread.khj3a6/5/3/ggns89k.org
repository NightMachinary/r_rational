Ancillary's already been mentioned, and you should definitely read it.

The Inthya books by Effie Calvin and the Clocktaur War + related books by T Kingfisher (aka Ursula Vernon) both have non-gender-binary settings but it's played so casually there's literally no exploration of it, it's just a thing that exists as the un-commented-on status quo.

If exploration of single-gender societies counts, then Ethan of Athos (by Bujold).
