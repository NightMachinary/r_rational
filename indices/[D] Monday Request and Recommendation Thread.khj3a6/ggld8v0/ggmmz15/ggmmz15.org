Haven't checked out Salvos yet, but here's a second for Cormorant.

Minor spoilers about the subject of the book, rather than events: economics are a focus rather than physical combat --- I can't say whether it's well-done because I don't know shit about economics, but it's done. The main character is also sapphic if that's a draw.
