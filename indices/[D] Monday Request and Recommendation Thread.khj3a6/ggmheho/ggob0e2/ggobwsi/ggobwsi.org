Yes. Also, do you still call rational fic Yudkowskian? I don't mean that as a criticism or weird status stuff, just a question.

I think the term Yudkowskian is actually really useful for works that try to emulate HPMOR, e.g. Pok√©mon: The Origin of Species. But I think rational fiction is a large category, of which didactic RATIONALIST fiction is only a small subcategory. For example, I would describe Alexander Wales fiction as rational, but not rationalist.
