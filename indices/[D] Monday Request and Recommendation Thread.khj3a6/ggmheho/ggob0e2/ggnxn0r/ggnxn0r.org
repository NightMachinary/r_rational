Seconding the rec for /The World as it Appears to Be/. Definitely my favorite OW fic. Although I liked /Cordyceps/ and /Dave Scum/ by the same author much more.

Same as masterax2000, I wasn't aroused by any of the scenes in /Erogamer/ and yet really liked it---at least in some part because of that. It starts off weaker than expected considering all the recommendations but quickly picks up steam and becomes downright amazing.
