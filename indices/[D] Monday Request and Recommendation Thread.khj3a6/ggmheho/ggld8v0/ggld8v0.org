I just finished reading /The Traitor Baru Cormorant/ by Seth Dickinson, and really enjoyed it. The MC, Baru Cormorant, is a child living on the island of Taranoke when it's annexed by the Imperial Republic of Falcrest. What follows is full on colonization, under the guise of "elevating" the simple islanders. Baru sees this happen, and knows that her people aren't strong or smart enough to fight the Empire, so does the only thing she can: she joins them.

Her idea is to change the system from within, but in order to do that she needs power, and in order to get power she needs to prove she's useful and a good Imperial citizen. Which in turn her into a cog in the machine that helps perpetuate the system she hates.

The story focuses a lot on the aspect of colonization. How it works, what the effect on the native people is, how it replaces culture with one that is "superior" and who benefits from it. The author definitely draws from historical examples; we see how diseases are imported by colonizers, how children are educated to forget their past, how pseudoscience racial theories are used, how money is used to subvert local rule, and how merchant and the military go hand in hand. It's very interesting, though a bit morbid, to watch this unfold on people who know what's happening but can't fight.

The characters feel very real, each distinct with their own dreams and aspirations and flaws. The main character is constantly struggling, with herself and her actions and those around her. Being a young woman all on her own in a strange land, she has to survive using mainly her wits, unsure of who she can trust.

The ending is something else. I didn't see it coming, but all I can say is it was painful. The book is aptly name, and Baru lives up to it.

/[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37438/salvos][Salvos]]/ by delta201 is a story about a demon child who is trying to figure out who she is and where she belongs. I've been reading Salvos for a while, and I'd very much recommend it.

The characters are definitely the strong point of of the story, but it's doesn't lose out in other aspects. We see character growth, both literally and metaphorically, and personally I just feel invested in Salvos, watching her grow and learn more about the world, who she is and how she fits in it.

I can't really talk too much about worldbuilding - the demon world is described as bleak and basically a wasteland with literally nothing to see but rocks. The mortal world is well-described so far, but we haven't seen too much of it so far. What we have seen is consistent and well-described.

The writing is well-done. I don't recall any problems, or grammatical/spelling problems.

My personal take is that the story is very much about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-actualization][self-actualization]], and goes about it in a very literal way. Character progression is measured by evolution, where each evolution essentially "resets" the character in terms of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs][desires/needs]] and immediate goals.

The last few chapters have been especially good, with Salvos being thrown into the deep end and having to learn what it means to be a demon.
