Are you okay with webnovels? I feel like there have been a few recently that check your boxes.

Ar'Kendrythist has a protagonist that keeps his optimistic outlook even after many challenges. It's somewhat controversial here, but I think it has merit if you're able to get past his initial personality.

I hear good things about Cinammon Bun, which is a litrpg starring a really adorable and optimistic protagonist who gets the "cinammon bun" class.

The Demon Lord's Lover (on royalroad) is primarily a romantic comedy, in a seemingly generic Japanese isekai where the mentor of the current generation of heroes falls in love with the demon lord. Outside of the main romance, there are also elements of optimistic diplomacy and cultural acceptance that come up. It's an overall positive, happy story. Highly recommend.

Some non-webnovels.

Bobiverse is an optimistic AI colonization story.

The Culture series is an entire series of optimistic sci-fi novels.

The Curse of Chalion is a pretty optimistic (both philosophically and theologically) fantasy story. The main character is an injured veteran, not too old but not young either, coming back to the palace he grew up in and trying to find employment. The characters go through some pretty bad situations but they never give in to despair, they keep trying to uphold their innate optimism.

By the same author, Penric and Desdemona is a series of novellas taking place in the same world. Also has a pair of optimistic characters that solve problems through diplomacy and kindness instead of fighting (although there's a bit of that too). Really delightful.

Spice and Wolf is a series of light novels with mainly two main characters Lawrence and Holo. It's about their romance, but being a Japanese romance, it takes ages to get anywhere. But I will say that their banter is really fun to read. It's mainly slice of life, but I will say that there's a warmth to the story and characters that makes me go fuzzy inside.
