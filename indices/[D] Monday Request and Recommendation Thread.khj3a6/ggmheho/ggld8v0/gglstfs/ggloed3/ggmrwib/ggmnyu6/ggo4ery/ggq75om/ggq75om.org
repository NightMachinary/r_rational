Alright here's a few more popcorn-esque reads. Most of these are fanfiction though.

The Games We Play by Ryuugi, rwby fanfic but might as well be a whole different novel. Protagonist gets the powers of The Gamer.

The Gamer on chyoa.com, follow neo_kenka's route, it's probably the best one. It's an erotica, and does get somewhat extreme (as you would with magic sex powers), but the Gamer aspect is genuinely interestingly done and the protagonist's build is also really interesting.

Almost any of coeur al'aran's fanfics. He mainly writes rwby fanfics with Jaune as the main character. It's not amazing (although some are pretty darn good), but it has consistently high quality grammar and usually good plots that are enjoyable to read. I especially liked Forged Destiny and Relic of the Future.

Man off the Moon. A mass effect/fate crossover, starring Nameless from grand order as the protagonist (really it's archer from fate stay night with some differences). Really fun and has some long running in-jokes that get funnier each time. Has some pacing issues in the middle but the current arc is pretty exciting.
