'[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/12024/the-new-world][The New World]]' and '[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/kill-them-all-worm-gamer.830187/#post-65418408][Kill them All (Worm)]]' are both long, fun LitRPG popcorn reads (and utterly irrational).

The New World is incredibly edgy. It's so edgy it runs into parody land while Linkin Park plays in the background and wraps back into hilarious because you can't take that much edge seriously. In chapter 3 (of 287) he unlocks a power that called agony that slowly kills him from the inside out by setting his nerves on fire, in order to do equal damage to anyone near him and that's how he has to fight. It only gets edgier (and numbers go up) from there. It's like someone read the famous Arifureta novels and decided to outdo it by an order of magnitude.

Kill them All just finished, and has some of the dumbest/best power progression I've ever read. I've described one of the author's other works as 'the Bee Movie, but every time someone says the word Bee, it speeds up, except with murder instead of B's.' This story is that, except every time the main character kills someone, the power level doubles. It also has multicross elements after the first ~fifth, which are ridiculous and fantastic. One of the few stories I've seen them used well instead of detracting from the story as they're actually /used/ instead of just being a garnish.
