I really think we've got at least two or three chapter batches before the end game stuff. I know this batch heavily teased diving straight into Fel Seed, but I really feel like there's some major character development stuff that's going to happen before then. Bethel coming back, Raven is going to do something, Solace and the Locus, I could swear we're going to get Fenn back somehow now that Juniper is in a stable relationship. There's no way all that happens in just one arc.
