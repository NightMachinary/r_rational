I second /What's Her Name in Hufflepuff/! Funny, adorable, clever.

/Dragonspawn/ was OK to read, but after I finished the then-last chapter (at the end of the internships), I never felt the desire to come back to it and read on.

The thing that most stuck with me from the whole fic is this: The protagonist (Ryuko's sister) befriends Pony. Pony is basically Ryuko's number one fan. Pony is unfairly eliminated from the tournament ("Sports Festival"). Because of that she gets no personal internship offers afterwards and is stuck with the default ones for the whole school. So of course the protagonist does... absolutely nothing. It's never even mentioned that she could do anything about it and she is on great terms with Ryuko.

/That/ is what I remember the best out of hundreds of thousands of words. I would classify the whole thing as quite bland.

/Hear the Silence/: As far as I read, this lacked any wonder, cleverness or intrigue. It was blandly slice-of-life-y. The SI-aspect was also completely unnecessary.
