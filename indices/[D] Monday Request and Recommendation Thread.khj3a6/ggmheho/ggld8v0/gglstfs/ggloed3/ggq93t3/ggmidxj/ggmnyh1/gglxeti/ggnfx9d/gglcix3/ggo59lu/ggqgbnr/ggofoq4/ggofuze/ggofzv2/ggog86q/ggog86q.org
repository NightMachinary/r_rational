Thanks for the attempt. Hopefully some more monster MC novels get written in the future, there's a lot of potential in the set up and a real dearth of quality ones. It's real interesting seeing a reincarnated human struggling with their new nonhuman identity and paradigm shift, in the case of reincarnation ones, and in seeing that one rare monster get lucky and adapt to, experience, and survive human civilization, for the natural monster MCs.
