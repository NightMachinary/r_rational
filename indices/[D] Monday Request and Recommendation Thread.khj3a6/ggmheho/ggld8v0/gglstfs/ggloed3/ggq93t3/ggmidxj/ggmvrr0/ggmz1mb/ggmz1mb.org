I just read a Greg Egan short story (Wang's carpets) where, offhand, the virtual-space humans are explained to use "relative gender," where two sides of a relationship might perceive their own avatar as female and the other person as male, for instance.

Anyhow, it's not the main focus, but it might give you a reason to enjoy some of Egan's short stories.
