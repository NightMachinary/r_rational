I already read it and keep up to date on it, it's pretty good among isekais and JP LNs, as much as that's worth. Apart from the stats powercreeping and some silliness, it's one of the better nonhuman isekais.

Thanks for the attempt, it seems like I've read every single decent monster MC novel going by the recommendations here, unfortunately. Guess I'll have to get my fix through the upcoming Spider anime at this rate.
