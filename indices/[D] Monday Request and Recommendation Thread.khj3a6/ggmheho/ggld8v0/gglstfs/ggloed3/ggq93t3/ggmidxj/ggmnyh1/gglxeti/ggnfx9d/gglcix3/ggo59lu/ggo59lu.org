Does anyone know of any good monster MC progression fantasies or the like? It's an interesting genre, but it's so empty and filled with garbage. I still think there isn't any novel in this genre better than So I'm a Spider, So What? with the only other decent ones I know of being Chrysalis, Shade Touched, and I guess Super Minion. I've heard some mentions about Salvos, perhaps I'll check that out soon.

Any recommendations? A bit disappointed with the offerings in this genre, with basically none of them even being rational that I know of. Perhaps I just haven't been looking hard enough, though.
