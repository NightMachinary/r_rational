I'd call it bad, below average if you want to be charitable. The writing is ok, better than most web fiction but that's about it. The main issue is mostly the plot, the MC holds the idiot ball HARD, many things happen just for plot convenience, and I'm not even going to start with the plot armor.

It's gripping, easy to read and enjoyable in bulk, but I personally wouldn't rec it to others. A day after finishing the second book and had some time to think, it annoyed me, left a bad taste in my mouth and made me feel like that time was wasted to the point that I changed my rating for both books on goodreads (2 stars if you're curious).
