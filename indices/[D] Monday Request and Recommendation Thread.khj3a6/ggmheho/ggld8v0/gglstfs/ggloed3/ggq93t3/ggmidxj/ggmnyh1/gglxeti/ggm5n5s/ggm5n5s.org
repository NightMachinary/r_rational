I started reading it after it got rec'd last week, but I have bad experiences with the "legendary badass who lost everything recounts his story" narrative framing device. Not only is it hard to pull off(look at the kingkiller chronicles), since the reader knows exactly where the story is going, if not how it gets there, it removes one of the best and most dependable ways authors have to produce narrative tension. With webserials it's even worse as now the author is locked into a destination he's years away from reaching. You're shit out of luck if you change your mind or get a better idea for the character.

In this story we already know the guy is going to master unmasterable magics, acquire unacquirable weapons/artifacts and reach places that are unreachable. We also know he eats shit somehow and is vewy depwessed. Here's the problem: in every other story I would have to use spoiler tags, but not this one!

In closing, people like to say it's about the journey and not the destination, but that's bullshit, it's fucking both.
