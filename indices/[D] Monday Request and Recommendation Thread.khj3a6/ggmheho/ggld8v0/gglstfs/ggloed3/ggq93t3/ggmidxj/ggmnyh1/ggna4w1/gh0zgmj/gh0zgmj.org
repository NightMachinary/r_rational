Thanks, also thanks to all the others who have replied.

I just wanted to mention, that I have read /Let me in 2/, recommended in the linked thread. I can generally recommend it to. A for me novel take on vampires which also fits what we learn in the movie well. The characters in the book in general where interesting. Although the plot as whole wasn't ultimately satisfying for me how it developed. But that is - meta-spoiler about ending - probably more due to the gloomy development of the plot and the bitter-sweet ending. Which is in the end a personal preference
