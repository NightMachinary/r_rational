Hive Queen deserves a bit better than a 6/10 imo. Not because it's amazing, just that there is so much other garbage out there that "reasonably executed and somewhat unique ideas" almost warrants a 7/10 alone.

Shade Touched on Royalroad is also pretty solid, although the mc is an intelligent monster learning about the world and humanity from birth, rather than as much a focus on navigating the world that comes from having some starting knowledge.
