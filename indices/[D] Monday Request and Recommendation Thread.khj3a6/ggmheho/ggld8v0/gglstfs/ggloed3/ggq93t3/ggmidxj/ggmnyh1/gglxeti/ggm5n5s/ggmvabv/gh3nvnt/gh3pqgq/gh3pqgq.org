I see your points and I think they're well argued but as I see it the story is still just getting started and the MC doesn't understand the reset mechanic enough to properly abuse it, vs Zorian having a fairly clear understanding of the loop he's stuck in. I look forward to where the story will go and hope to see some of your criticisms addressed. The author (Eligos) is very open and courteous so I think he'd appreciate it if you broke down some of these criticisms and dm'd them on Royal Road.
