I'm out of books to read, not counting all of the books I don't feel like reading! This is of course a terrible, horrible disaster and you should help me fix it.

I'm particularly looking for fantasy or sci-fi that features protagonists that have a fundamentally positive outlook (not necessarily "things are great" but at a minimum "things can be better and we can make that happen if we work hard enough in the correct way") and close personal bonds/friendships.

Three examples: Becky Chambers ("The Long Way To a Small Angry Planet" and its two sequels), Effie Calvin ("Daughter of the Sun" and other books in Inthya), and Graydon Saunders (the Commonweal).

Also, I re-read "A Memory Called Empire" and I just absolutely cannot wait for its sequel. Very much recommended, so incredibly good.
