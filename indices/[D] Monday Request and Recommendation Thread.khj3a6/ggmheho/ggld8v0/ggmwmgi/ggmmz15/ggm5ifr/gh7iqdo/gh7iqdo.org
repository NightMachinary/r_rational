If someone wants to read the short story instead:

[[http://www.beneath-ceaseless-skies.com/stories/the-traitor-baru-cormorant-her-field-general-and-their-wounds-by-seth-dickinson/]]

Though only do this if you don't mind being spoiled or are not planning on reading the full book. Seriously, you've been warned.

Blogposts from [[/u/embrodski]] reviewing the novel: [[https://deathisbadblog.com/sff-review-the-traitor-baru-cormorant/]]

and comparing it to the short story (again, SPOILERS): [[https://deathisbadblog.com/traitor-baru-vs-traitor-baru/]]
