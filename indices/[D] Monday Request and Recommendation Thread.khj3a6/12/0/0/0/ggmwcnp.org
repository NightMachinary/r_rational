/Bruce Quest/ is by LordsFire, isn't it?

That gets an automatic de-rec from me.

Dude can't keep it in his pants. I haven't read /Bruce Quest/, but in every work that I /have read/ by him (that wasn't short and dead) he jizzes his Christian evangelism all over the worldbuilding, characterization and plot, no matter how little sense it makes.

For example:

Crossover premise: After years of drifting, a Japanese Shinto girl crashes in her spaceship onto the death world of Remnant. Alright! Let's go!

Wait, did I say Shinto? Nah, let's make her Christian.

Last time she had contact with religion or any other people indeed was as a preteen? Doesn't matter. Religion- No. /Her/ religion is /extremely/ important to her.

People on Remnant need her tech to survive against the endlessly respawning monster hordes? Well, she wants to talk to them about her Lord and Savior Jesus Christ instead. Do they feel saved yet, while being eaten alive?

Wait! Does this lead to religious conflict with the native religion(s) on Remnant? Nah. Surprise! The sole native religion on Remnant is also Christianity! Let's have Pyrrha quote the Bible out of the blue!

(And anyway, that part is canon, you see.

Proof: Ruby has *crosses* on her costume! QED!)

No, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/sheltered-rwby-pseudo-crossover-completed.713359/][I am not making this shit up.]] I wish I were.
