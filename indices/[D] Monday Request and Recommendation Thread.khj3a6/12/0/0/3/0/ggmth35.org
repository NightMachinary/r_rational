it's more that I was trying to not put things that have been recommended to death before here. for example, I love:

- The Zombie Knight Saga.
- Pokemon: The Origin of Species.
- With This Ring. (I know the author has some shitty takes on some subjects but he updates daily and I'm bored)
- I tend to let WtC chapter build up and then binge them once in a while.
- up until a very recent chapter I put The wandering inn tied for #1 with Mother of Learning for my fav. web fiction. now it's like #10.
- I dropped A Practical Guide to Evil around the end of book 5.

and many more that just aren't coming to mind right now.

edit: oh and A song for two voices has 1,391,256 words today. And A Sword Without a Hilt is an INSANE quest with 4.6 million words.
