I don't get it, you say you want +300k words but you recommend and read stuff that's less than 3 months old with less than 50 chapters, and that we can't be sure will still be good a month from now.

Personally I'm not reading anything less than 6 months old, getting invested in things that turn out bad after a while and having a hard time dropping them because of the sunk cost fallacy is not my idea of a good time. I'd rather wait a while longer and not risk it.
