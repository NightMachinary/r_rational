Have you ever come across [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15130/threadbare][Threadbare]]?

In an RPG-based world, there's a golem maker who's desperately trying to create a sentient golem; one of his attempts is in the form of a teddybear. He tries to invite the bear to his adventuring party, but the bear doesn't say 'yes' - mainly because it doesn't know that saying 'yes' is an /option/ - and so at first he thinks he's failed to create a sentient golem (again), so the best thing to do is to take the teddybear apart for parts. And the teddybear doesn't even understand the question.

And those are the humble beginnings of the hero...
