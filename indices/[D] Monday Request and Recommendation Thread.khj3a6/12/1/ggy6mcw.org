Honestly you have read most of the western fics that I could've recommended. I think it is time for you to branch out into the grandaddy of progression fantasy, i.e translated chinese novels. Lot of them are utter shit, but there are also some really good ones.

I would recommend [[https://boxnovel.com/novel/lord-of-the-mysteries-boxnovel/][Lord of Mysteries]] and [[https://boxnovel.com/novel/reverend-insanity/][Reverend Insanity]] for actually good stories on par with some of the high quality western novels. First is a Victorian era story about eldritch powers, and second one is about a neutral evil protagonist being sent back in time to his childhood years. They both also have stupid amount of chapters for you to go through and Lord of Mysteries is already finished.

As for a non progression fantasy recommendation, you should read [[https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/the-grandmaster-strategist][Grandmaster Strategist]], a really well translated novel about a sickly scholar with genius tactical mind, it also has some pretty awesome martial arts/wuxia scenes.
