Note: IF YOU ARE ALEXANDER WALES DO NOT READ THIS. THIS IS A PREDICTION ABOUT YOUR BEHAVIOR AND IF YOU READ IT IT WILL CORRUPT IT AS CALIBRATION PRACTICE. Anyone else can read this.

I calibrate a 75% probability that the final non-epilogue chapter batch of the story is released between 90 and 150 days from the date of release of the most recent chapter batch.

If I am wrong or right please flagellate or congratulate me respectively when the data comes out, please.
