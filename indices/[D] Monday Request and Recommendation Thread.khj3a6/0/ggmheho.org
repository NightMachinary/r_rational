I would like to recommend "The World as it Appears to Be." It's an Overwatch fanfiction that hardens Overwatch's sci-fi. The dialogue and comedy are extremely good. It reminds me of Unsong in a lot of ways, and Unsong is my favorite novel.

Also, I'm considering reading the Erogamer because I've heard very good things about it. However, I tend not to like smut because I prefer to separate business and pleasure. Is it still worth reading?
