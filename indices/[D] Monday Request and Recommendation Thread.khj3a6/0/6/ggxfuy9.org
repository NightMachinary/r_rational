The World As It Appears To Be is very solid. Seconding this recommendation.

If you can stand reading a story in second-person it's probably worth it to read Erogamer. It's an instant disqualifier to me, like if the author decided to forgo punctuation; it doesn't matter how well the story is otherwise written, the syntax makes it unreadable.
