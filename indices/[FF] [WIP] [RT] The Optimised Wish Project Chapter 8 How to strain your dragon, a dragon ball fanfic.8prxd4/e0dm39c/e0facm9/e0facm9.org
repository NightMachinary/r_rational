There is another possible plot path: That Mai really did betray the Red Ribbon Army, and just wants to use the wish for herself. Immortality is not a good idea right now, with a lot of enemies on her heels, and would probably settle for a power-granting wish to deal with the short term problems.

On the other hand, she would have lawyered up her wish like Bulma, therefore making the same mistake, giving Goku enough time to interrupt her.
