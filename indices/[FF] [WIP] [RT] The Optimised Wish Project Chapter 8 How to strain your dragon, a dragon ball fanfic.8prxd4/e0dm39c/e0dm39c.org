Excellent as always. Shenlong is pretty cool, and having Bulma just violently die like this is fairly shocking even though death is a revolving door in Dragonball. I can posit a guess as what the "and things generally worked out" path of events for next chapter would be: Goku gets back before Mai has the chance to use the dragon balls (possibly killing her out of anger and to prevent her from speaking a wish) and wishes Bulma back to life. The "oh shit heightening of stakes" move would be "Mai makes her planned wish and makes the Red Ribbon Army an incredible threat", which would set up the next arc pretty nicely and keep Goku with a solid goal of finding the dragon balls again and wishing Bulma back to life.
