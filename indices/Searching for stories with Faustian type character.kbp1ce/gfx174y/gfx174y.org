You might be interested in [[http://www.lysator.liu.se/%7Ebellman/dka.html][Dungeon Keeper Ami]] then. The whole story revolves around keepers, people or entities who sold their souls to the Dark Gods in exchange for magical powers, the ability to control certain areas as if they were gods, and the promise of more power by offering more sacrifices to the dark gods or paying mercenaries for their hard work.

The protagonist is a moralist goody-two-shoes who wants to save the world, protect the innocents, etc. who is forced into becoming a keeper. But as the story progresses, she has to make bargains with evil people, choose between lesser evils and slowly become more Faustian because of the situation she's in, despite her initial ideals.
