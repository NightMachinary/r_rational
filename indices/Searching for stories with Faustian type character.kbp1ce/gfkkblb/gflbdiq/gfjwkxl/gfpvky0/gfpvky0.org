There's a little known manga and anime called “The Laughing Salesman” that's basically all about this, an entity going around offering deals that always have a very monkey paw like side to people who have some problem. It's more of a collection of parables about various flaws and vices that destroy whoever makes the deal, though; the Salesman himself is just an enigmatic, never explained existence.
