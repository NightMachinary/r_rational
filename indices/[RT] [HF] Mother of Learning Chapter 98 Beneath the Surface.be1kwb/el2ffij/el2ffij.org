What I love about this story so much is that anytime Zorian takes a break to unwind, It carries over to the reader. Nobody103 develops tension extremely well, and when it is about to be too much we get a bit of cuteness and tranquility inserted to keep it from being too much. There is no character who I have ever empathized with as much as Zorian.

​

On a more story related note, there is clear room for maneuvering in the contract, it is just that every form of it involved deceiving Zach. I have a consistent worry that this story is going to end with either a battle with multiple deaths, and Zach or Zorian dying, or something clever yet bittersweet.

​

Finally and most importantly, Novelty continues to be adorable, and so does Kirielle.
