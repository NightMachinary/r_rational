Funny that I read this advice when I tried to develop a story's climax. Paraphrased because I read it months ago, it might mixed from advice from somewhere else:

#+begin_quote
  "Once you reach the peak, you solve the problem with one grand stroke, be done, and run away with it. Don't dally, don't let the tensions seeps away. Dallying soften the impact. Memorable is the opposite of soft."
#+end_quote

I don't have any idea how the author will conclude his story. It just I repeatedly remembered about chapter 26 when author drove the surprise home and end the chapter then and there.
