Hmm. Something about the contract doesn't seem right.

IIUC, it requires that no one knows about the time loop except Zach. Even if he didn't tell them. After all, Zorian found out all on his own, so if the contract only requires that Zach neutralize anyone he's told, then Zorian ought to be safe, and anyone Zorian's told - like the aranea - should also be exempt.

If they're not, if the contract applies to anyone at all with time loop knowledge, then that means the contract requires Zach to hunt down and kill, for example, the Ghost Serpent, and quite possibly other ancient elementals like Stonechild.
