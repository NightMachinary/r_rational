I wonder how/if Damien's sacrifice in chapter 91, will change how Zorian interacts with Damien next chapter.

I imagine it was something he was profoundly moved by. But, showing (positive) emotional behaviour towards his older brother is out of character for pre time loop Zorian and could contribute to Damien's suspicions that Zorian really isn't his younger brother. Which may make Zorian consciously reign in his emotions. I'm just saying, a heart warming (one sided) reunion with a confused Damien after all that happened would be great. I could only really see something like that happening with an impulsive simulacrum though.

I'm surprised Zorian has the strength to consider going through seeing Taiven die again, this time he knows it would permanent too.
