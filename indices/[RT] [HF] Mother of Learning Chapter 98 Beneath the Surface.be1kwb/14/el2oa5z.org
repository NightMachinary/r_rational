Is Zach planning to make the youth potion for the original Silverlake? She has plenty of motive to oppose the time loop Silverlake, and isn't much weaker than her since she was already an ancient archmage pre-time loop.

Plus if she also gets the youth potion, she can infiltrate the enemy side with simulacrums that are pretending to be the time loop Silverlake. No one would be able to tell the difference since their souls are practically identical.
