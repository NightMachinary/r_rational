  the contract had an expiration date. At the end of the month, it would dissolve and Zach would no longer be bound by it. That meant that after the month went by, Zach would be free to make his experiences as public as possible as he wanted to make them.

  Were the angels really fine with that? The contract strong suggested they weren't, but there was really nothing stopping Zach from doing just that. Maybe not immediately after the month ended, but as years and decades went by? A person might get tempted to write a book or something before he died...

  It would be probably very convenient for the angels if Zach and Zorian stopped Panaxeth's release, but perished some time afterwards...

Maybe they aim for the Sovereign Gate to be destroyed. It's breaking down and allowing Panaxeth to subvert it, anyway.
