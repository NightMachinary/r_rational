There's no fight or bloody confrontation in this chapter but the tense situation is still there. I like how author always including something new in the recent chapter, like that detection web ability. When mental enchantment come into play Zorian can become closer to super human at calculating and precision, normal artificer would spent a day at recalculated and adjusted the blueprint but Zorian can do it almost instantly and there's also weponized mini golem Kojenska. Sometime I forgot how young Zorian was, and it's not normal for young mage like him to be extremely capable.

What happen to Zorian mana, it's already couple of days (more like couple of months) it should be stable by now, right.
