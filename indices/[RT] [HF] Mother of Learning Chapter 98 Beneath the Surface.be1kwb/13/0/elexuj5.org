By the time Zorian was met by Silverlake, he's mostly recovered. That was first school day, the 3rd day of real month. Three days later he helped the church fueling fancy shell for a branchy angel. Suppose the truce talk happen at the evening, then this chapter is the 7th day of the month. It could be the 8th or 9th day, but 7th is more likely.
