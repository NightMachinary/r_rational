Well, they might still have analogues of romance (likely with the "mother" of the drone male). If you grant that the evolutionary foundation of romance is that you pick a high quality mate and thereafter your offspring-in-which-you-must-both-invest are related to both of you so your interests are sort of merged now, there is still mate choice involved regarding whose genes you're taking.

(Also note it's not clear if the drone males are produced asexually. Drone males in bees are haploid, they're really almost more akin to glorified flying gamates than full organisms, by human reckoning. If they are produced asexually the identity of the drone-mother would be even more important, since she would be a genetic half rather than a quarter of the resulting offspring)

Although it's not clear that Areana require parental investment, they do seem to hoard territory and resources and have colonies and clans and wars, so there is some resource investment and allocation involved. It's not obvious that who reproduces with whom is a matter with no emotional weight.

Although I guess the efficient thing to do from an out-breeding standpoint if you're going so far as to make walking sperm would be to send the drone males far away to other clans. That's probably what a non-sentient insect would do. And from that you might form socially form alliances between clans via genetic closeness...but even that requires some degree of emotional weight to the matter of who is related to whom. So it's /possible/ that they don't really think about sex except insofar as pumping out drones to send elsewhere and selecting drones who seem like they have good genes. But unless they are like bees with only one reproductive unit, you'd think that Areana who cared about relatives that they're related to via a drone in other colonies would be under a selective advantage.

Yeah my guess is that the most interesting and plausible way to arrange it is they wouldn't have romance per se, but they might solidify inter-clan alliances via sending drones to each other, and that would lead to a sort of pseudo romance between the reproductive units of different clans. And within clans it might be a point of contention, who exactly got to be a reproductive unit and how exactly they distributed genetic material to their offspring.

Real-life social spiders don't actually have clan conflict, but they are sometimes very inbred, so it may be that the whole thing is unrealistic from the start and that the spider society shown in MoL wouldn't ever make sense, which would require a rethinking of the whole thing
