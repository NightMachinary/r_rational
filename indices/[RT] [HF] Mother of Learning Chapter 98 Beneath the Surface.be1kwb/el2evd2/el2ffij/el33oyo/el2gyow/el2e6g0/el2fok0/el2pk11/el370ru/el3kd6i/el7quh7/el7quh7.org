Well, Worm's epilogue's job was setting up some stuff for the sequel.

If we want to look at a well-done epilogue for a web serial that most likely won't ever see a sequel, I'd point to Twig's. There, significant parts of the story are actually told via the epilogue chapters. They don't only give closure on side characters, but also actually wrap up several plot threads that were pertinent to the main story.

Of course, the reason that the POV shifts away from the Lambs and Sylvester in particular is that they're undergoing the process of becoming Lords, finalizing their "growing up". Their story isn't finished, but their /childhood/ is. Thus, we only see them again after they've fully taken over their new forms, and are meeting the "Endboss".
