Or it could be a fake Chekov's gun. We know it is a contingency in case Zorian dies. Maybe Zach also knows this.

Thus when Zach sees Haslush opening the letter and finding something, it finally dawns on him that Zorian is ACTUALLY dead, with all the implications. Otherwise Zach might simply consider that a mind illusion by Zorian. Thus, seeing Haslush opening the letter allows the contract to accept that no time loopers have spilled out and survived, thus allowing Zach to live.

Once the contract dissolves, the final illusion dissolves as well. Since the last part would not be an illusion at all, it can be done without mind magic as well.
