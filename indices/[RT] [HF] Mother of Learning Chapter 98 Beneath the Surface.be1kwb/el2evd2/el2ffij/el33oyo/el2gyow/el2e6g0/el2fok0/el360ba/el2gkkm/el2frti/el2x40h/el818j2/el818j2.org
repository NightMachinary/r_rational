We didn't see Zorian's reaction to Daimen's sacrifice, at least not in any depth since 91 was so action packed and we got no breathing space since then. I'm expecting at least a few thoughts on it though - maybe knowing that Daimen isn't as bad, and in fact, Daimen loves Zorian enough to sacrifice his life for him.. Could lead to some realizations about his parents as well.

While Zorian needs to be more circumspect with Daimen, I'll be expecting Zorian's thoughts at the very least to address Daimen's sacrifice. I wouldn't expect a massive conversation though - we got a that in the loop.
