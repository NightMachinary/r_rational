Having it be strongly foreshadowed is a good thing though. Like one fic I read with an enemy that trapped people in dream worlds, where the fic "ended" in a stupid dues ex machina where the good guys win, right up until it's revealed that the PoV character got trapped. (And the battle is still raging outside)

Having things be suspicious is good because it lets the readers feel smart when they figure it out.
