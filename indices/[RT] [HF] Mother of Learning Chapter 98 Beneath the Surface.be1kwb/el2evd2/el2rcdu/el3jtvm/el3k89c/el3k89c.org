As funny as that would be, SL has fought it before, she knows that its a bitch of a fighter even for a grey hunter, if RR has fought a Grey hunter before and they toss this one at him, it will catch him off guard as it uses all of the tactics that SL basically taught it to avoid and counter magic, and that would be hilarious.
