The story by design defies rationality. I don't think one could produce a satisfying rational deconstruction of nonsense poetry retaining the charm and theme of the original.

Do you imagine an Alice who walks around pointing out the inconsistencies of the fantasy world and repurposing magical artefacts to defeat the Queens and the Jabberwocky? Discussing the implications of a vorpal blade that can cut anything - "Does it cut on a subatomic level?! Do you realise how dangerous that is?!"

I have serious doubts that it could work.
