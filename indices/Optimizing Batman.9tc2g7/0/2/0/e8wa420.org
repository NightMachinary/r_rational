And I've found it very, very common for a new hero or villain to be introduced that is SOMEHOW, SOMEWAY suddenly stronger than the previous MOST POWERFUL mutant/hero/villain/mercenary/god whatever.

It is tough, which is too bad, because people love all of this stuff, and I'd love for it to have a much easier entry point for some awesome fanfiction or whatever.
