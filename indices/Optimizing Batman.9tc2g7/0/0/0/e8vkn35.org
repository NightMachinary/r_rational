I agree with this, but the bigger problem isn't having a character that is rational, and then trying to figure out the other characters, its how you rationalize the powersets everyone has: here is a excerpt from a comic that has the Flash outrun death and time and some other concepts - [[https://imgur.com/a/pdgj1]]

So, like, I get what you are saying, but what world are you creating with what physics that also has this iteration of the flash? And if you dont have this iteration of the flash which one? Can he still outrun light? Time? Where are the lines, and if he can ONLY run to near lightspeed, well, how does anyone ever stop that? If you literally do anything to endanger anything in the world he could speed up so much that he is unlimited possibilities.

I don't know, I always find this stuff frustrating because trying to think through any of it feels impossible in a rational way. And the Flash is just one example, right? There are people like Dr Fate where, like, what's the rational version of that? How does Fate work? Or Constantine, and the fact that there is literally the One Above All, who is God, like God in the sense of unlimited and total power - [[http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/One-Above-All_(Multiverse)]]

However, if you all want to just have fun and talk about Batman and stuff, sorry to be a wet blanket.
