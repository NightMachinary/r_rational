The Bat-Army plan has been tried in various forms, though never quite to the degree you imply. First-off, the various Robins and other 'Bat-Family' characters essentially function as a well-trained army, of a sort. Second, the /Batman Incorporated/ story-arc, where Bruce recruits various other Bat-types, including a number of foreign knockoffs, to help deal with international threats and that sort of thing. Finally, in a relatively recent story-arc, a villainous vaguely-government-affilliated group called the Colony tries to extend that concept out to an entire group, with surprisingly competent results, a large group fo them managing to swarm and incapacitate Batman, though predictably they get turned into low-level mooks who crumple after a single punch once there's no need to make them seem intimidating.

I know these are comic examples and you're talking movies, where Batman is shown as explicitly okay with shooting and killing people, but the 'just give Batman a gun' solution still irks me somewhat. I think it would add an interesting challenge to the proposed problem to not be able to use guns or kill people. Bat-bombing people with his bat-drones isn't really Bruce's /style,/ y'know?
