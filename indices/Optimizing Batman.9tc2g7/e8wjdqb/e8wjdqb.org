Bruce Wayne is a foremost industry captain with command of a significant portion of the production structure of the world. He should be correcting wrongs and bringing justice at the global systemic level, using such huge influence of his on creating or divesting jobs and regional development as fit to to corral around lawmakers, making and unmaking political leaders almost at will, into opposing corruption and enforcing human rights everywhere. He should be "Good Lex Luthor", in short.

As a superhero character Batman makes no sense at all (and was never meant to make sense anyway). To begin with, the fact that his combat suit is not remote-controlled, especially considering that we're frequently shown that all his vehicles are, is utterly ridiculous. His personal income compares favorably with small nations' GDP, FFS, but he can't recruit and form even an elite combat squad of his own, and has to do everything himself ? I know, I know, demigod mythology tropes etc.

That's just not how you use the superpower of megawealth. But then if the writers knew anything about making vast amounts of money, growing huge businesses, and using it all for for good, they wouldn't be writing comics I guess.
