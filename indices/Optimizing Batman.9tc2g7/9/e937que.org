But at this point wouldn't you have just changed Batman into Generalman? He's got the powers of an army General! He commands the strength of a thousand men! He's neither a bird nor a plane, but has a squadron of the latter ready to scramble at a moment's notice!

I mean, the fundamental problem is that if you try to make a billionaire ninja who goes around in costume fighting criminals realistic, you stop having a billionaire ninja who goes around in costume fighting criminals. Superheroes aren't very realistic already, pretty much anyone outside of someone with Superman-level powers just wouldn't be that much of a force on their own. If they're vulnerable to bullets all their superpowers count for shit, they'll get killed. So we need to at least assume some kind of suspension of disbelief to make the concept of superheroes even remotely viable.

Otherwise, a truly "realistic" superhero story IMHO would need to make them work in cooperation with the police, and mostly exist as heroes for a PR boost (flashy, recognisable guys in costumes with superpowers would do wonders to both enhance the good guys' morale and scare the shit out of their enemies). My Hero Academia is probably on the right track there, though it still is very unrealistic with how the battles actually pan out (since most of its heroes have only /one/ power, often not even a defensive one, but somehow manage to withstand stuff that'd kill a normal human multiple times over).
