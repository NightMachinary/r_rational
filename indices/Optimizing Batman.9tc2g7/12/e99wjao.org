IMO, the ideal ratfic version of Batman isn't a protagonist - he's an /insane but extremely intelligent villain/, like Metropolitan Man Lex Luthor but with even less common sense. Don't think "how do I optimize this character" - treat him like Quirrelmort instead. Batman and the Joker are strikingly similar concepts; the difference is just that one of them /mistakenly believes/ that they're acting for Lawful Good while the other one /correctly believes/ that they're acting for Chaotic Evil.
