You are trying to put a rational character in not-rational-at-all universe. Don't forget, the inner laws of DC universe are the laws of drama, not the laws of physics. For example, no amount of faceless, nameless goons can defeat a main character in battle. Actually, if you think about it, a rational strategist in such a universe would notice that and would consciously only recruit people with interesting personalities and backstory for his army.
