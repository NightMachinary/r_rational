Oh it's been fairly established that Barry is faster than Clark, but the real question is: Is Barry so much faster that Clark couldn't pull off all or nearly all of the same feats in a given situation?

Think of it this way. You have to choose one of your friends to help you move. Brandon benches 250 lbs, but isn't good for much other than lifting. Tommy caps out at about 200 but has a pickup truck and gets the employee discount at the local storage unit. Who do you pick?
