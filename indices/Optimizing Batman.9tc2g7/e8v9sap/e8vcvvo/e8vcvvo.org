Make Batman the rational protagonist: the only character who thinks these things through in a world of well meaning super-powered idiots.

For extra credit, reveal that there's something about the nature of super powers that makes people who have them worse at lateral thinking, and unable to imagine solutions outside of using their powers in a direct "comic booky" sorry of way.

Bruce Wayne has figured this out, and knows that simply pointing out the obvious to super beings doesn't work. He created the Batman persona as a way of getting close enough to the Justice League to study the details of this phenomenon, and slowly guide them towards rationality.

Maybe Steppenwolf's punch is so much weaker against Batman because Steppenwolf /expects/ a superhero to be able to take his punch.
