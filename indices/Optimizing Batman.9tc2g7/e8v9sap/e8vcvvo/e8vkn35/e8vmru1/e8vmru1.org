  So, like, I get what you are saying, but what world are you creating with what physics that also has this iteration of the flash? And if you dont have this iteration of the flash which one? Can he still outrun light? Time? Where are the lines, and if he can ONLY run to near lightspeed, well, how does anyone ever stop that?

The DCAU is pretty good for this. The heroes are nerfed big time relative to their ridiculous comic book feats, while still remaining true to the spirit of the characters and their powers. For example, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a0pwb9NvFE][this]] is the fastest the Flash ever goes in /JLU/; it takes him 10 seconds to run around the earth, putting his top speed at 4,000 km/s. Which is fast, but way below light speed (300,000 km/s). And that was a one-time thing.
