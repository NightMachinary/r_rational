I'm suggesting that all superpowers in the DC universe share a common origin, and that that origin creates a blind spot in the user's reasoning /specifically around their powers/. Now that I think about it, this could also help explain the secret identity phenomenon; superpeople tend to cope with the subtle cognitive dissonance by creating two separate identities, one powered and one not.

One way this could go would be like the Inderdict of Merlin from HPMOR: The Being that created superpowers set them up this way to prevent creative rationalists from accidentally destroying the universe by unlocking their full potential.
