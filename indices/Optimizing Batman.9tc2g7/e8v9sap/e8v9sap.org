I think that everything you said, mostly, makes sense, but the problem itself needs to kinda be re-defined before we can do anything.

Honestly, the best thing anyone in the DC universe could do is explain to the Flash that he can win every single battle by himself and fix the entire world, if he felt like it.

The amount of speed he gets up to, no one else would be moving, like, at all. The guy is recorded going faster than light, so it would literally be impossible to see him. In the face of that, well, batman would be infinitely more effective if he just made the Flash happy with food or something.

But that's the thing about all of this. You are taking a very reasonable approach with some good thinking and applying it to a world/universe where absolutely nothing makes sense.

Steppenwolf, if he did actually punch batman, probably should have blown through his torso, if he can at all trade blows with Superman. Like, the main problem is nothing in the DC universe really makes sense, if you take it at face value, so unfortunately, while I agree with most of what you said, the first question should probably be: "How do we make the DC universe make any kind of sense, and then, once that is established, what could Batman do in that universe to be most effective?"

Anyway, just my 2 cents, and hopefully my frustration with superhero comics hasn't overwhelmed my response, although I think it has definitely bled through.
