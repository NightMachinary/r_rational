Well, you know, being a member of the military still skews your worldview in very specific ways (like all jobs do, after all). It's not by chance that almost all military coups tend to end up on a certain side of the authoritarian spectrum. Your whole life is following orders, getting shit done, and going through extreme kill-or-be-killed situations, I can see how you can end up being somehow desensitised to the comparatively lesser problems of daily civilian life. There's a good reason why military and political power should be kept in the hands of different people.
