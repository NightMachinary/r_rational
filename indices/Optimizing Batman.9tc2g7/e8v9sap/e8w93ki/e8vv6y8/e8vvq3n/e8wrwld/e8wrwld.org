Do /not/ try to optimize Batman, the entire premise of this particular superhero is unfixable.

Why? Because he does not have personal, unshareable superpowers. He has training and a high-tech costume. In a universe where quality wins over quantity, a much better course of action for him would be spending time in the lab making custom costumes for other heroes, who do have a superpoower, cooperate with police, and maybe maintain a couple of Robins for emergencies. There shouldn't be a Batman.

Problems with Joker? /Call Flash/.

Than there is an angle that maybe Gotham could be fixed if Bruce starts paying decent wages to his low-rank employees instead of spending money on expensive toys.
