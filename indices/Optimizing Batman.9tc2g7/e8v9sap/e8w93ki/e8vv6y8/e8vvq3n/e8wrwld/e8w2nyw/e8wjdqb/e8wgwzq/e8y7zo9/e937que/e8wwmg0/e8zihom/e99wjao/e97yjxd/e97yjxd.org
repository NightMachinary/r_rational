Young Justice Batman is rather better, as I understand it, clearly shown as a skilled planner and coordinator. He would actually be a very difficult League member to replace; flying bricks are plentiful, but top-notch criminal investigators are rare in the superhero scene.

But I mostly know it by way of With This Ring.

Oh - but he should also get himself a copy of Rocket's kinetic belt. Immunity to bullets, knives, punches, etc, and you can fly.
