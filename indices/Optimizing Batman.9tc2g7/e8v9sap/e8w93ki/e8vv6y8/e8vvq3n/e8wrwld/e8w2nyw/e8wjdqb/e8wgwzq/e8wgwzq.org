The thing is, Superman and the Flash and others are really really good at hitting villains. Really /really/ good. But they're not nearly as good at /locating/ villains. Your average supervillain, given a twenty-minute head start, can probably avoid them with a wig, a pair of glasses and a nonchalant walk. (It probably won't work forever, but it might extend their head start into a full day or more).

Bruce Wayne's ideal place in the team isn't to punch things. His ideal place in the team is to figure out /what/ needs punching, and /where/ and /when/ to do that punching.
