an army and guns? thats like the opposite of batman.

no, batman is the worlds greatest detective. he also understands psychology, is a master of stealth and ninjitsu, and has his own R&D corp to handle that wierd alien tech that keeps showing up.

batman solves problems by thinking. not by fighting, the fighting is just him helping when and where he can. his psychology skills help keep the team together and working for a common goal.

if you have a problem with how a specific version of batman isnt good enough, then your problem is with the writing, not with batman. lets look at the movie: he assembled the team, he helped motivate flash with 'save one person', and he had the plan to get superman back. without batman there is no team, just a random assortment of superheroes with no plan.
