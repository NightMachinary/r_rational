Again you are not understanding the scale of what I am saying. If Flash is truly thousands of times faster than light, he can constantly comb through Earth's every nook and cranny multiple times over in his free time (whenever he doesn't need to sleep/eat/spend time with his family whatever) and stop almost all crimes happening on the planet at any given time in a millisecond (except maybe other Speedsters but none of them match his top speed). After some days or weeks of this, crime rates would pretty much go to 0 worldwide due to their ineffectiveness against a literal god. You're thinking of this in terms of Batman directing the Flash to go stop X crime or defeat Y person, but the Flash is more than fast enough to defeat literally every person and stop all crimes on the Earth in a second or so - he doesn't need to stop to solve any particular one of them when he can solve all at once. Like if he spends one or two hours per day "patrolling" as a superhero, then in that time he can check up on any plans any person in the world might be going over to commit a future crime and stop them right before they happen. Heck give him some more time and he can probably be an universal enforcer who very few people can stop.\\
Similarly while Supes top speed is not that high, his base speed is still high enough to cross to any part of the Earth in a couple of seconds BUT he can hear and process everything happening on Earth at the same time, so he too can stop any crime right before it's gonna happen worldwide. No need to wait for a crime to happen and for Batman to then direct them towards the culprit when you can hear (Supes) or see (Flash) it happening in slow motion real-time and stop it right then and there.
