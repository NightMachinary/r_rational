...I had no idea that the Flash could travel through walls or keep track of more than a dozen conversations at once. That does change things rather a lot.

  Even a smart man like Lex working through intermediaries won't be able to hide anything from a man who is on every place in the world at the same time and can't be checked for or warded off beforehand.

On the contrary, it's not difficult - unless the Flash speaks every single language, /and/ has some means of bypassing encryption. But yeah, Lex's criminal enterprises will be /heavily/ constrained, and probably no-one else will be able to get anything that the Flash doesn't like done.

But that's the important point, isn't it? It's a matter of what this Flash likes or doesn't like. That's suddenly the only thing that counts anymore. What rules is he going to enforce?

You stated earlier in this thread that you would like him to stop crimes - specifically, "the ones that take away people's choice and agency about what's happening to them". And your proposed solution, in order to reach this state, is to take away all agency and choice from anyone except one man?

What religion does he follow? This is important, because it might mean that everyone finds themselves in church every Sunday. Or it might mean that every woman finds herself wearing a burqa every time she's in public. Or that suddenly there's no blood transfusions in hospitals.
