Even that panel dismisses Flash's top speed though. He can get rid of literally all guns on Earth (assuming that particular example), not just "most" in a second or so and nobody would even know that it was the Flash who got rid of them. There would be nobody in the "know" to resent him at all. I'll take a decent human like the human Flash as the sole arbitrator of humanity, over the current Earth any day. Obviously a rational character like Lex Luthor might never believe that Flash will always act in humanity's interests, but we know that being meta-characters in a sense.
