Okay, let's consider what happens if the Flash tries to stop crimes permanently.

Lex Luthor is currently buying shares on the stock exchange. Does he have inside information on the company in question? If so, then he is doing insider trading, which is illegal. If he does not, then his transaction is perfectly legal. The Flash has no way of knowing which is the case - Luthor's smart enough not to leave any damning paperwork lying around. Does he stop the transaction?

There is a locked and sealed soundproof room. The key is in the lock, on the inside, and there is a ventilation shaft for air. The Flash has previously seen three people walk into the room, of their own volition. Was one of them tricked into entering the room under false pretenses by the other two? Is there some violent crime going on in there? How can the Flash tell, short of breaking down the door?

Two large people (in trenchcoats and fedoras) are asking one small fellow where the money he promised them is. The small fellow is nervous, the big guy are looming a bit in order to look intimidating but not laying a hand on him. The big guys are telling the little guy that he needs to pay "what he owes" or "he knows what will happen". Is this a legitimate debt, and if the little guy doesn't pay he gets hit with contractually agreed penalties, or is this a criminal gang shaking down an innocent shopkeeper?
