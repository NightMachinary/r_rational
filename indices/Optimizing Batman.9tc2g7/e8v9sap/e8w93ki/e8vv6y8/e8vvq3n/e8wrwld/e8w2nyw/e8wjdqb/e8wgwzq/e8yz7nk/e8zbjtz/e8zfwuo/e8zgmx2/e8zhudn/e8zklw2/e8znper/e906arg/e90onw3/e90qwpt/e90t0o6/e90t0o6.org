Again you're underestimating the speed of what I am talking about. The Flash can literally keep tabs on every place, every person, every animal and every insect on Earth at the same time (relative to us). He can phase through things and come out with the same speed, or travel through space's vacuum - he doesn't need to break down home security to enter anywhere. Your first example is moot as Flash already would have tabs on every single person due to his sheer speed and relative thinking (so it's not even that he can't process so much information, which he has shown to do in the past). He would know every word spoken by every person aloud, every action taken by them etc since he started doing this enforcer job. Your second example is already solved because Flash already has tabs on every person as I previously said, so he will already know if a crime is going to happen or someone is being coerced etc. The third example - same thing, Flash already knows about the situation beforehand, and even if he doesn't - as soon (assuming it's a criminal gang) as they start to actually physically threaten that guy the Flash will instantly put them somewhere on the other side of Earth with them being none the wiser. With the speed he has, he literally becomes an omnipresent god on Earth.\\
You can't hide anything from the Flash, because he will know literally everything. Even a smart man like Lex working through intermediaries won't be able to hide anything from a man who is on every place in the world at the same time and can't be checked for or warded off beforehand. Yeah you could say he is disrupting privacy or he is breaking many laws, but if such a character existed then what are human laws compared to a God who can solve all of Earth's real problems at once. I'd take a dictator like that any day.
