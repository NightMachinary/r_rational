  no, batman is the worlds greatest detective. he also understands psychology, is a master of stealth and ninjitsu, and has his own R&D corp to handle that wierd alien tech that keeps showing up.

If anything, ninjutsu ties in to what Batman's real role should be in a more realistic setting: he's a really good infiltrator. He's the black ops guy. Superman and Flash punch shit, but if you want a subtle hit, he's your guy.
