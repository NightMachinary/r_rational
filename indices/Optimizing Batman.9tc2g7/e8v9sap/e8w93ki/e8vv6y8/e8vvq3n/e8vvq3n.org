If you do this, you are killing Batman and replacing him with yourself in a batsuit.

The whole point of Batman as a character is that he is nuts, but manages to channel it in a more acceptable way than his villains. Going out and punching people isn't the most efficient way to stop crime, but Batman does it anyway. Unless there's a supervillain involved, beating up and arresting a single criminal is maybe one of the worst ways to stop crime!

Batman comics/movies have dealt with this before; it's one of the most defining aspects of his character. A Batman that doesn't get personally involved is a Batman that dealt with orphanhood/trauma much better, and if that's the case what you probably get is Bruce Wayne, billionaire philanthropist, instead of a billionaire playboy with a secret life.
