  If you do this, you are killing Batman and replacing him with yourself in a batsuit.

I don't have the butt for it. Have you /seen/ the asses of those suits? They leave nothing to the imagination!

  Unless there's a supervillain involved, beating up and arresting a single criminal is maybe one of the worst ways to stop crime!

Fair point, but I was trying to optimize Batman to be a valuable member of the justice league. And generally the league only gets together for supervillain-type crimes. Where it's less "Socio-economic problems lead to a sparsity of legitimate career options for young males, causing a spike in muggings, robberies, gang activity, and murder" and more "Dr.Nefarious has constructed a giant moon cannon, and unless we can defeat his army of gorilla-soldiers soon all of America will be reduced to yellow ash!".
