Doesn't have to be Flash even. Superman can do everything Flash can and more. Flash is just a subset of Superman, to be rude.

But yea. Batty should use his superpower, money. He should make sure superheroes get funded.

He should bribe supervillains who otherwise rob people to join his ranks.

He should hire everyone whose superpower is building crazy shit like mister freeze to build things for his hired heroes.

He should have a robotic army too.
