I mean, it really depends on what comic you are talking about: [[https://imgur.com/gallery/dQk55qv]]

But, let's be clear, if any superhero or villain's goal was money; they could easily make it hand over foot. Pretty much every villain in existence has a power that would allow them to vastly improve either the US military, which has a spending budget of trillions, or some corporation looking to sell their device/power/etc (e.g. Mr Freeze could possibly make cold fusion or cryogenics work).

It isn't so much that I am disagreeing with you (except maybe the Flash thing) but that there is an innate problem to solve first. Cause, like, lots of villains have money or superheroes (they built the watch tower in space), and we've seen plenty of robot armies get destroyed, simply because robots aren't interesting, so of course they lose to the lone hero.
