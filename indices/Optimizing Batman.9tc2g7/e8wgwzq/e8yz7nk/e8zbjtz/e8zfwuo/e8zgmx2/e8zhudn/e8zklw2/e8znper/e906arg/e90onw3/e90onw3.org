Yeah but my initial discussion wasn't to stop death permanently. It was just to stop CRIMES for happening - at least the ones that take away people's choice and agency about what's happening to them. Puffing cigarettes isn't a crime in most countries, and even if it was then it still is the drinker's own choice. If you accept Flash's top shown speeds as something he chooses to use daily then the whole premise is that Batman and the rest of the JL are completely useless, and that the Flash can effectively accomplish what the rest of Earth's population can't in a matter of seconds. What he chooses to do then I can't really say as I'm not a writer, but I definitely do not agree with the panel you showed me. Main reason why I prefer to read original popular standard fiction just to read their rational fanfiction later on as the latter interests me more.
