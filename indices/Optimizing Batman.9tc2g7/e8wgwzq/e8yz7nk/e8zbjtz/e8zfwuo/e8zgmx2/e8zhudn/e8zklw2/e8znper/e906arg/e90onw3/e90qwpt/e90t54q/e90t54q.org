Again you're underestimating the speed of what I am talking about. The Flash can literally keep tabs on every place, every person, every animal and every insect on Earth at the same time (relative to us). He can phase through things and come out with the same speed, or travel through space's vacuum - he doesn't need to break down home security to enter anywhere. Your first example is moot as Flash already would have tabs on every single person due to his sheer speed and relative thinking (so it's not even that he can't process so much information, which he has shown to do in the past). He would know every word spoken by every person aloud, every action taken by them etc since he started doing this enforcer job. He will already know if a crime is going to happen based on say what the people say to each other or if they're taking weapons with them before going to a third guy or if someone is being coerced etc. Even if he doesn't somehow know about it beforehand which is not really possible - as soon (assuming it's a criminal gang) as they start to actually physically threaten a guy the Flash will instantly put them somewhere on the other side of Earth with them being none the wiser. With the speed he has, he literally becomes an omnipresent god on Earth.\\
You can't hide anything from the Flash, because he will know literally everything. Even a smart man like Lex working through intermediaries won't be able to hide anything from a man who is on every place in the world at the same time and can't be checked for or warded off beforehand. Yeah you could say he is disrupting privacy or he is breaking many laws, but if such a character existed then what are human laws compared to a God who can solve all of Earth's real problems at once. I'd take a dictator like that any day.\\
Also even if he can't do this 24/7, solving ALL CRIME even for one hour per day (especially if he chooses the best time statistically after going through some research on time zones and population centers etc) is still better than the nothing we have right now. And he can keep shifting his hours around every day so that criminals can't just concentrate in other times of the day, and after some days/weeks/months of this most of the highest tier terrorists, gang members, serial killers will already be in jail/dead/whatever he decides to do with them, and the rest will be forced to go back to a better life in fear of the Flash.\\
Your previous comment assumed I was talking about the DC Flash, who probably won't choose to do any of this (because of the cigarettes thing). I was mostly talking about any random real life morally decent human who had the DC Flash's powers instead, who could solve any problem or do anything he chooses to do on his whim. He is literally one of the most overpowered characters I've ever seen, at least out of the ones who are kept at a lower level (most other "God"-like characters have Godly matters to deal with and similar level enemies, but Barry fucking Allen keeps fighting shit like street mobs on a daily basis with no effect).
