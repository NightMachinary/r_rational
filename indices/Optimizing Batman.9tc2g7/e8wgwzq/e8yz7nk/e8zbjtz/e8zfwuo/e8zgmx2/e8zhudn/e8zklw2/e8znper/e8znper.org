I never said I agree with the basic premise of the panel you showed to me. Cigarattes is a different thing - in that case you're choosing to kill yourself and that's fine by me. Dying to a robber, or a serial killer is not something you choose and shouldn't happen to anyone ever. Obviously what I said is less clear cut and there exist countless other examples you could think of that would confound me or are philosophically challenging, but someone like the Flash who can think at that speed can think of all possible arguments and rationales in such a situation far more effectively.
