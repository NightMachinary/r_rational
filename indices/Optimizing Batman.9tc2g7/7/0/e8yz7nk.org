And that's pure bullshit compared to some levels established in the comic universe. Superman can hear literally everything happening on the Earth at a particular (which he never uses outside of specific cases) time, Flash can run way, way faster than Light so he can probably comb through every home and person on Earth in a single second, so on and so forth.
