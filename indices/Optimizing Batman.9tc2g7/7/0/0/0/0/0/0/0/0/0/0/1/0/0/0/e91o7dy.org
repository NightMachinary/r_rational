I think you missed the point of what I was saying.

Let's say that the Flash was truly as unstoppable as you claim. (Personally, I doubt it, but let's ignore that for the moment). Let's say that, for whatever reason, he decides to remove all agency and choice from every other person in the world by the means that you describe. Let's say that he decides to prevent anyone, ever, from acting in any way that he personally disagrees with.

Why do you seem to think that that would be a good idea?
