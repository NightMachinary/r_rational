  On the contrary, it's not difficult - unless the Flash speaks every single language, and has some means of bypassing encryption.

Again you're not understanding the scope of what I'm saying. If Lex or one of his intermediaries even "type" anything, the Flash will know instantly what they typed even though the data will go encrypted to the second party. He can just read the keyboard strokes right as they're happening, while still keeping tab on every other place on Earth at the same time like a proper God. He has shown to be able to pick up new skills at the same pace he does everything else, so give him a millisecond or less and he instantly knows every spoken language of the universe, or all known encryption techniques on Earth. Heck he thinks and can even decrypt way faster than any known computer system in 2018. And yeah he can phase through stuff easily, and that's not even one of his "high end" powers like the scenario I'm describing - even the CW Flash show has him learn phasing in early S2 (in S5 currently) which he uses every couple of episodes. If such a character ever existed then the life of every organism on Earth would get constrained to whatever he decides them to do, even other theoretical superpowered beings like Wonder Woman or Martian Manhunter who can't do anything to him. But this is why I was saying I would take a theoretical beneficial Barry Allen over the current system. But obviously if I had the option of giving supreme power to anyone it won't be a random person off the street or even me personally.

Also this is all considering his "present" day powers - he travels in time constantly and that's one of his lower end powers. Any time he fucks up (which is not possible if he uses his power at 100% constantly like I'm describing) he can just go back in time and repeat the scenario.
