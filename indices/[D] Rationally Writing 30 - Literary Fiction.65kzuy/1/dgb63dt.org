I've definitely seen people arguing over where House of Leaves falls in terms of it being literary. These discussions usually fall into arguments over whether the stories more bizarre features have purpose, or if they were just there to lend the appearance of depth. So, for those people who didn't get anything deeper out of it, is it a failure of the author to convey the story's depth, or a failure of the reader to see the depth that is there?

It's an interesting parallel to my own thoughts on Name of the Wind. I found the story to be entertaining, but I never found it very emotionally engaging, like how DaystarEld described it. Part of me wishes I had- I certainly didn't read it in the hopes it wouldn't engage me on that level.

I guess what it comes down to is that there is (probably) no such thing as a story with universal appeal.
