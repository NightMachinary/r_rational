Hey everyone! This week we discuss literary fiction, its values and failure modes, and its similarities and differences from rational fiction. Hope you enjoy it!

We've also got a new book recommendation for you, by [[/u/alexanderwales]] :

My recommendation for this week is "The Necromancer's House" by Christopher Buelman. I'm recommending it here because it's literary fiction that straddles the line into genre (speciafically, fantasy). It has the qualities of literary fiction that I most enjoy; the prose has a careful beauty to it, the themes are heavy, and it avoids most of the power fantasy and wish fulfillment that I think bloats the genre. At the same time, it doesn't fall into the literary trap of doing away with plot in order to focus on character study and pretty prose.

The plot centers around a recovering alcoholic who is dealing with the realities of middle-age. He also happens to be a practicing warlock. In literary fashion, much is made of tying the fantastic elements to the underlying human elements. Along the way, it dips into Russian folklore, May-December romances, and the costs of vanity. I enjoyed it, and hope that you do too.
