I think Worm impresses me more, but only for sheer speed and length in which it's written. The same goes for Homestuck. Unsong is the first to impress me in the sense of "there's no way someone could do enough research to find a way to make everything fit". It's like that movie where they gave Excalibur both origin stories and had it make sense, except it does that constantly.
