On one hand, I can't help but feel the actual plot has been moving along very slowly recently, with a lot more interludes and asides, and few chapters that focus on Aaron or Ana.

On the other hand, Alexander somehow managed to find a connection between God and Karl Marx that makes perfect sense. I don't think any piece of fiction has ever /impressed/ me more than Unsong has. This may be on its way to supplanting Worm as my favorite book/story.
