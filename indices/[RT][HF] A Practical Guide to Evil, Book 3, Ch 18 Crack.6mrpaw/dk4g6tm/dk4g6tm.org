What if Killian becomes full Fae, but stays with Cat? IIRC, Killian's grandmother was from the Summer Court and Cat is pretty much THE Duchess of Winter. That sounds like the foundation of a forbidden love story that somehow brings an end to the war (kinda like the Omashu love story from The Last Airbender?). Though on the other hand that seems a little too obvious to me, even for a Fae story.
