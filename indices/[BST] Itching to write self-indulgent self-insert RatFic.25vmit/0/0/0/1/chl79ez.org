Okay, so maybe that could be a meta-text blurb, ala part of a novel's back cover, instead of part of the story proper.

I suppose that also means I should leave out anything along the lines of "This narrative is derived from personal memories, available recordings, written notes, and interviews of willing survivors. All of these have their various biases, and narration imposes its own requirements on what to include and what to leave out - but the result is as true a story as I can make.", or any other hedging about where the story actually comes from.
