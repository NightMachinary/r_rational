Alternative for an /in media res/ first paragraph:

I woke up as sick as it was humanly possible to be. The only reason everything within five feet wasn't covered in noxious fluids was my GI tract was, mercifully, already empty. Even given all of that, somewhat more concerning was the discovery that my legs ended mid-thigh. Thinking about that used up enough of my cognitive resources that I didn't even try to figure out how concerned I should be that I was hallucinating a pink-furred rabbit-woman puttering around at the head of my bed, and was barely able to pay enough attention to the fact that she was naked to try to remember the more aesthetic details when I could properly appreciate them...

(Second paragraph: Throw in an earthquake, or at least what seems like one, and build up from there...)
