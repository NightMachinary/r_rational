Just start writing as quickly as possible and publish regularly somewhere. Something really simple like Wordpress blog or Google docs. If you have more energy you can do something more fancy, but that shit is secondary. You can post links to [[/r/rational]] and people here would offer feedback. You can post links to other websites.

It doesn't have to be good in the beginning. It's generally agreed that [[http://parahumans.wordpress.com/about/][Worm]] kinda sucked during the first few chapters, but it became really, really good later on because Wildbow just kept writing a /lot/. Just write and you'll improve.
