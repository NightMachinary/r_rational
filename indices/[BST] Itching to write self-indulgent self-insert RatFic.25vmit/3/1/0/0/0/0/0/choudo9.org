As far as I've been able to work out, just about anything I could write that's post-Singularity and contains a self-insert protagonist that's even vaguely recognizable as being remotely human falls into the 'soft and implausible' range. So I picked a set of implausibilities, and am running with them.

It's still a lot /less/ implausible than getting turned into a cow in a land of magical talking ponies, or going to Hogwart's, and yet reasonably entertaining rationalist fics have been written based on both premises... :)
