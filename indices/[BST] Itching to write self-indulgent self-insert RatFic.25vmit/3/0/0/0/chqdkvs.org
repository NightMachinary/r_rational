I've started to lose track of LW's specific rules about what's supposed to be posted as a Discussion thread, what should go into an Open thread instead, or a Media thread, or somewhere else; and have been chided for posting to the wrong place.

Besides, isn't "Hey, I've started writing a pretty terrible self-insert RatFic" pretty thin gruel for even a Discussion post?
