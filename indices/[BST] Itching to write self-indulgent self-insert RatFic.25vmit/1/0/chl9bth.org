I expect that whatever I write is going to be roughly the qualify of fan-fiction. If I do better than I currently anticipate, it's going to be /good/ fanfiction; but I'm under no illusions that I'm going to get it onto paper.

I suppose that one thing I'm looking for is where I can post to /get/ the best possible feedback.
