The most important part of that story was the single scene that inspired it; the rest of what I was trying to write didn't turn out to significantly add to it. At least a few of the ideas from the non-viable expanded version are likely to make it into the story I currently have the itch to write.

(FimFiction has a minimum story length, and the single scene doesn't quite make for a story on its own. I haven't checked in a while, but if you know of a FiO compilation that accepts outside submissions, I could forward the scene to them to be posted.)
