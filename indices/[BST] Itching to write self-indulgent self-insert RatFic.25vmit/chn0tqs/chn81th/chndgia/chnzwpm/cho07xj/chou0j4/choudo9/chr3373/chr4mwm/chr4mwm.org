It's been some time since I've tried writing a narration; I fully expected to start badly and gradually get, if not good, at least a bit less bad.

I'm not exactly sure how I'm writing as much as I am, but since whatever I'm doing is working, I'm hesitant to go back and start trying to tweak things while I've got momentum to add more at the end. I don't disagree with your particular suggestion, either; in fact, I'd made at least a few attempts at some of that, by mentioning new species being farmed (heroin-producing snakes, 'red' tea), and should have had the first bunch of farm-girls mention less pleasant curses.

Put another way - an editor or beta-reader or any other source of specific feedback wouldn't hurt. But as long as I'm producing twice as many words a day as I managed with "Myou've" on good days (and that includes cheating by inserting song lyrics), I'm probably going to focus on the one piece of advice that got me kicked into gear: "Just start writing."
