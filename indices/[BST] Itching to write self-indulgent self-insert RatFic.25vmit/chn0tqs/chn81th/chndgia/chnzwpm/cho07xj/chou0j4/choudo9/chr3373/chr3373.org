Ok, I've been thinking this over further, and the fact nobody else seems to be reading and commenting, so i should say this: The first part of the story is by far the weakest, but I think there are a few sublte tweaks that can fix this. Specifcaly, /lampshade/ the parts you know are unrealistic given what is known so far, such as the singularity not spreading outside cities. For example, by making the protagonist surprised, or by first stating that they happened INSTEAD of whatever had realistically happened. Second, cut down a bit on the people-being-transformed as the only examples of events, since it risks the reader marking the entire thing as a fetish story and stop reading if they're not into that. Love the story, hope you find this advice constructive.
