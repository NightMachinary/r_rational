Ah, I see - I have some notes jotted down on that, which provide explanations for the apparently insane behaviour, but which haven't made it into the narrative proper yet. (Somewhere around half Stross's 'Vile Offspring', half Yudkowsky's 'God of Evolution', half the mismatch between virtual FOOMing and the speed of physical activity, and half might never make it into a first-person narrative at all.)

Also, in case it might interest you; the section I've just started is going to explore some of the ramifications a non-superintelligent AI with a core directive and certain constraints. Hopefully an unexpected and entertaining look for anyone who hasn't read the relevant Sequences, and at least a passable iteration for anyone who has.
