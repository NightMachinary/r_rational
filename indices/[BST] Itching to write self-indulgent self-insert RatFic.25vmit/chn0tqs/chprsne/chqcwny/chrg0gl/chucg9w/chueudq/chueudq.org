I think I've come close to my limit for writing as fast as I have been. I had 8 days of 4k words a piece, yesterday was 3k, and today's probably going to be less than 2k.

I think I'm close to a spot where I can call the first arc complete. I could even stick in a short epilogue right now and call it good. I've had some issues with my last few attempts at writing at pulling off anything like an ending. I think I'm going to wait until I decide whether to call this 'first arc of several' or just 'a novella' before I post a new submission here.
