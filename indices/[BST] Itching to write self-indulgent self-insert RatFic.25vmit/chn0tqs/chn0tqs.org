  Just start writing

I've finished a first draft of an intro sequence. It's... still bad, but not as bad as before. (Which doesn't say much.) I'm planning on continuing writing what happens after that, but in case anyone here wants to read and comment (or read and laugh at how far my writing skills have deteriorated), I've put a copy up at [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AU8o3wSAiufh-Eg1FtL-6656dNvbCFILCi2GbeESsb4/edit?usp=sharing]] .
