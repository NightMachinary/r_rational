In case anyone's still reading this post... I've written 3,000 words today - and they're gloriously terrible, full of infodumpy badness and horrible conversationing, and attempts to imply things that are so subtle they're downright invisible. It's going to take a near-total rewrite before I'd even be willing to show the result to anyone else to tell me how bad it is. Still... it's 3,000 words more than I've written in just about any day in recent months.
