I don't know how effective it is, but there's an app called the [[http://rationality.org/calibration/][Credence Calibration game]] that's built to train one aspect of rationality. As far as I know, there aren't yet broader programs for developing all of these skills.

The same site has a section with [[http://rationality.org/reading/][book recommendations]]. You may find some of them helpful.
