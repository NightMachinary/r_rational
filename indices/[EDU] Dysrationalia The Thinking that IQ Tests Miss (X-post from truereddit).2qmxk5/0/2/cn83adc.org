Most of the questions related to concepts from the statistics classes I took in college, so I'd recommend learning some general statistics and reading how scientists test their hypothesizes through falsification and similar tests.

I apologize that I don't have any handy links to material for you to read up on, but I picked up most of the concepts in the article by applying my college education to the research papers I'm required to read.
