Wait I don't know if I'm being thick, accidentally missed something in an earlier chapter or somehow even managed to miss something in this chapter, but I'm kind of confused as to what Iron Lantern is exactly?

Is it some kind of hacker base being run by a programmer with limited super speed? Or a more directed program, with the goal of producing a specific product (like an AI or something)?
