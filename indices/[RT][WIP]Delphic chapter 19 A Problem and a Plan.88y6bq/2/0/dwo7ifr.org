Honestly, I'm concerned that I haven't yet established myself enough to justify it. The other writers that I see on here with Patreon accounts seem to have a lot more content already set out and a much larger following.

I don't want to come across as presumptuous. I'm very new at this.

Do you know if any of the web fiction writers with Patreon have weighed in on it? It has been fantastic to get voted for on Top Web Fiction and to get comments here, so if a Patreon would encourage even more reader involvement, I should at least consider it.
