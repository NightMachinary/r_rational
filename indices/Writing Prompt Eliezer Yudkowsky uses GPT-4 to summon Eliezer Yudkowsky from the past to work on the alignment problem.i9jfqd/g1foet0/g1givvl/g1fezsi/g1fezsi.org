Unfortunately, I'm not good enough at modeling present Yudkowsky to go with this, and /definitely/ not comfortable with playing my hand at modeling present Yudkowsky modeling a hypothetical GPT-4 modeling past Yudkowsky.

EDIT: Come to think, GPT-3 can probably already model past Yudkowsky pretty well, given that it's reasonably likely that the sequences and various other things are in the dataset, but you expressly forbid that.
