That's true, and the hyper-intelligent thing too, which is not really coherent.

I wonder how he made them though, did he get access to the GPT-3 api?

EDIT he has one more [[https://gist.github.com/ekmett/6cd785180659e3c2f9284e5128c11025]]

My other bugbear is that people clearly edit these things, but don't disclose this. In there the end is clearly edited I think, since GPT-2 doesn't come to a nice ending IMO. It makes it hard to judge GPT-3 if people don't say how many samples they generated and how much editing they did.
