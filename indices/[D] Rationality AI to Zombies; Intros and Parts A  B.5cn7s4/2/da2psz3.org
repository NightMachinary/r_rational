I'll start with some chapter summaries from part A (if you feel I've left something important out or mischaracterized something, say so):

1.  "Epistemic rationality" is believing true things; "instrumental rationality" is about moving the world in the direction you want
2.  Emotions are fine; cold logic isn't an ideal to strive for
3.  Good reasons to seek truth are curiosity and a goal; a moral duty towards truth is more suspect
4.  A bias is a systematic unforced error in epistemic rationality
5.  The availability heuristic is that we judge probabilities by thinking of examples
6.  Extra details lower probabilities, even when those details are plausible
7.  People are very optimistic in planning. Estimates based on similar past projects are more reliable.
8.  We overestimate how well others understand us; it's hard to empathize with the process because we already know what we meant.
9.  Don't assume other people have the same base assumptions as you; try to start with their base assumptions
10. Humans can self-reflect and improve themselves

And a random thought:

On "Burdensome Details": I'm not sure I agree with the thrust of this argument (I agree with the math, of course). There seems to be a tradeoff between inferential distance and details; extra details can show a plausible path to a conclusion, as long as you remember it's one of many paths.
