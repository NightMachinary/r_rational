Yeah, the ending was great. Poignant as fuck and a great bookend. I think the dev could stand to iron out a few kinks (way too many people get dead-ended by the memory/processor ratio problem, if this thread is any indication), but overall I really enjoyed playing this. It's sort of the logical conclusion to incremental games as a concept.
