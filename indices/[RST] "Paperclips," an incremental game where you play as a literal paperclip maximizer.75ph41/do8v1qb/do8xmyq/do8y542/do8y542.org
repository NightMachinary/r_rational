You need to have at least 67 points in memory by the time you reach 100 trust if you want to get Hypnodrones. You also want to make sure you have 47 points in memory a while before that so you can solve global warming. (Roughly 3000 ops overflow can be gotten through quantum computing, if you time your clicks correctly.) Hypnodrones is what unlocks further stages of the game. Theoretically, possibly you could keep doubling your money with high stakes stock picks and giving that money to shareholders. But that will take a long time and I don't know if it will work.

In the stage after that, your goal is 117 memory, iirc.

This game isn't very forgiving, I got soft locked a couple hours later than you on the final stage. Creativity is too powerful early game which encourages people to wrongly invest in processing power over memory.
