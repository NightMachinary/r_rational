I'm sorry, I don't know how to enter stuff into the console on an apple computer. I don't have one of those.

I notice your work/think slider looks fucked up. I don't see a bar on the slider or a time to next swarm gift. That's pretty weird. Plus you really should have gotten more than 96 points to spend on computer stuff by now. Have you ever gotten a swarm gift? If swarm gifts aren't working you're going to have a rough time no matter what.

Other than that, I'm not sure what the problem is...as far as I can tell, you should be producing clips at a rate of 1.25 quadrillion per second (since your rate-limiting step right now is wire production). You have drones, they're making materials, everything is powered...Maybe your game is just horribly broken? Maybe it's a Mac-related thing? I'm sorry I couldn't be of help. Maybe the dev could figure it out.
