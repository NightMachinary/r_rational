The slider should be letting you trade off the rate of swarm gifts vs paperclip materials production. Swarm gifts are used for computer upgrades, yes. You definitely won't be able to win without them, since there are upgrades requiring more memory than you currently have.

Your wire stockpile will always be 0 inches if it's being used up as quickly as it's produced--but in your case I'm not sure why it's still 0 inches since you aren't making paperclips.

I'm using Chrome.
