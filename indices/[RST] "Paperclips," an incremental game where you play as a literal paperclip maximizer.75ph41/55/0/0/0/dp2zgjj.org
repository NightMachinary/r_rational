You have probes, so you shouldn't be earning only 0g per second of "available matter." Try moving the slider halfway between work and think. When I said slide it to think, I didn't mean all the way. Maybe it affects probes as well as drones.

At any point, have you been gaining Available Matter at more than 0g per second? That's what you need to make happen. Try things until you are gaining Available Matter.

Until you've made that happen, you may as well move points out of self-rep into hazard and combat, since you can't replicate without clips.
