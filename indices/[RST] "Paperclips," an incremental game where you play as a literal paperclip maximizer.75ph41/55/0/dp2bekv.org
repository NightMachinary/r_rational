You need to have at least 1 point in exploration. Right now your probes are not doing any exploring, so you are not discovering new matter, so you can't use it to make wire, so you can't use that to make clips, so you can't make new probes.

Once you are acquiring matter again, your drones will have something to do and won't keep getting bored. But you're probably going to have to spam the launch key a bunch because right now you don't have any probes out there to explore or replicate. It looks like you still have enough clips stockpiled to get a new population going, at least.

It would also be wise to move the slider much closer to "think" so you can receive more swarm gifts and boost your processing in order to gain creativity faster. There's no point in having your drones work so hard when there isn't enough matter for them to use. You also don't need any more Yomi right now, since you've already maxed out your current trust cap, so you can stop running tournaments. This means you'll spend more time at max ops and therefore make creativity faster.

Finally, you can take all those points out of factory production and drone production and move them into self-replication. You don't need any more factories or drones right now, you need matter for the ones you already have to work with. There is no reason to make more factories or drones until you're discovering more matter than you can use. Your priority, once you're making clips again, should be to get your probe count ticking steadily upward, which means focusing self-replication, hazard remediation, and combat.
