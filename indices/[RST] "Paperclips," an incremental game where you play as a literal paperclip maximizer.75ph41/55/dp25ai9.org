I'm not sure what to do anymore. I'm not making clips, and I'm trying to let my Creativity increase so that I can purchase the Drifter's Monument, but then the swarm keeps getting bored so I have to spend it. My Yomi is very slow in building up (and I've tried several of the strategies based on advice in this thread), and twice now my probes were launching automatically but then stopped.

Am I missing something??
