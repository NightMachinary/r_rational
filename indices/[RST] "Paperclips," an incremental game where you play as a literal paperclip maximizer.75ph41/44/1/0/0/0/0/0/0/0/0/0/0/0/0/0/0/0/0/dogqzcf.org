You can more or less ignore speed and exploration until you have self-replicated a large enough fleet, which will need a ton of self-replication and hazard mitigation. You can think of launching a single probe much like the original 'make paperclip' button. It rapidly becomes obsolete once you can have an exponentially growing supply chain of them. You'll need a point in each eventually so you don't run out of matter, but thats it.
