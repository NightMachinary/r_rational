Good to know. That makes sense.

I have 20/20 and it won't let me max it out. It says I need 17000 yomi, but I have 10x that and it won't let me buy it.

I followed the advice in the thread and put a bunch in replication/hazard and as much as I can in combat or else the drifters kill my guys faster than they reproduce. how's this setup look? I just bought some kind of limmerick fluff. do I just sit and wait for a while?

thanks again for your help, I appreciate it.
