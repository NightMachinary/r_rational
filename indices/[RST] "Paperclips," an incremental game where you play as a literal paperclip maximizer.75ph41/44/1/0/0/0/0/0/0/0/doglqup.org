Yeah, I got 20/20. Is my honor listed anywhere? according to the drifters killed, I'm getting at least some of them. Yeah, I'm playing actively right now.

Oh, ok, I'll give that a shot. So i'll just chill out for a while. is "yomi" the same thing as honor?

Cool! I'll probably have more stoopid questions in a couple of hours.
