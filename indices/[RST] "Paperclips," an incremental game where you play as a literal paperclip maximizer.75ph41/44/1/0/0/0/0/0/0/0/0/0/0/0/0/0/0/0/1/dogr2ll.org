You can't undo it, it happens every time you increase trust or max trust. That's the tradeoff I mentioned earlier. It's still worth spending trust. Just don't do what I did in my game, which was to idle for a while, come back, spend ALL my honor immediately, and then scroll up to discover that I'd increased my value drift chance a bunch for like 150 max trust that I couldn't even fill up.

Keep focusing more on self-replication than exploration. You need sooo many probes to start making a dent in the universe. Other than that it's mainly idling from this point.
