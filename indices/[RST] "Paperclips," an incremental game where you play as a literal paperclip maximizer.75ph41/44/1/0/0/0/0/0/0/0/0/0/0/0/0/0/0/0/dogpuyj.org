Makes sense to me.

Shoot, I got a message saying my risk of value drift went up. Is there any way to fix that or not? I've got no upgrades right now so I'm just kind of generating creativity and twiddling my thumbs. I'm putting my probe points into exploration since it's still at 0 (the universe is big) is there anything I'm missing? no milestones in the last hour or so.
