Well, your problem there is value drift. The drifters were all originally your own probes, whose utility functions changed to something other than making paperclips. So even if you kill every drifter that exists at this moment, some of your probes will become more drifters anyway. As far as I know, it's not possible to exterminate drifters through combat.
