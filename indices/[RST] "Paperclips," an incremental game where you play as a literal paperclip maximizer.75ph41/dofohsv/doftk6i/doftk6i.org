Update: Due to some strangeness, Universe level is currently 3. Public Demand is 960%. Revenue stream is the maximum, constantly selling, $0.01 per paperclip. The public is happy. The automated system buys wire, turns it all into paperclips in a flash, then waits for enough paperclips to be sold to buy some more wire. Cost of wire has gone up to $58/spool at the moment.

Maybe later the ClipMaker can solve world peace and do other nice things. Perhaps occasionally rank up the stockmarket engine, dumping some cash into the pipeline to let the MegaClippers operate at full capacity for a little while.

At something like 10,000 clips per second (taking into account pauses when waiting for more wire), reaching 6 octillion clips would take about 456,621,004,566,210,046 years. Perhaps if I fiddled with the console I could see whether the program blows through that limit or reacts in some way.
