In order to get projects that will give you more trust, you need to buy Coherent Extrapolated Volition. In order to get enough trust to buy that, you need to buy the projects that improve clipper performance, wire supply, etc so you can make clips faster and hit production targets. Just buy stuff when you can afford it and you'll be fine.
