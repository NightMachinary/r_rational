Yeah, but I can't buy any projects. They all cost at least 15000 ops and my max is 13000. My clip production has already reached a maximum due to the speed of the WireBuyer, buying AutoClippers and MegaClippers doesn't change the Clips per Second anymore. Sure, I could wait until I reach 2 billion clips to get 1 more processor, but then it's going to take even longer to get another. From what I've read on this thread, this wasn't how it was supposed to go, specially seeing as how the amount of clips required to gain trust jumped ridiculously high from around a few hundred thousand to 2 billion.
