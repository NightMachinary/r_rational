Just curious, is there any use for Creativity after the 175k yomi battle strategy upgrade? I hit the 3rd phase (space exploration) about an hour ago, and my Creativity just passed 200k with nothing to spend it on...

Also, what the heck is the strategy now? I feel like I'm just slowly building my drones back up over time; my probes are stuck at 8.08k; any more and they get destroyed until it levels out at that number again. I've basically just been sitting and twiddling my thumbs for the past 30 minutes, haha.
