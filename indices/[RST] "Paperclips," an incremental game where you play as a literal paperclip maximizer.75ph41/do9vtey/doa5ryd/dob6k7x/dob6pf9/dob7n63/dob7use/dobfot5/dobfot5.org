I managed to claw my way back from this by taking all the points out of everything but hazard reduction, combat, and self replication.

That let me handle a holding action, and then you can start to buy honor-increasing items, which let you increase maximum trust and upgrade more. It takes a while though.

There doesn't seem to be a good way to reset though.
