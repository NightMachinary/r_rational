I found that yomi generation sped up a lot after I unlocked the bonuses for tournament placement. You get like 20k yomi for placing first, many times more than you get from the actual score. The "Beat Last" strat seems to reliably place in the top 3.

The processor/memory thing is a pain, yeah. You can cheat to reallocate them in the console, but the game should really just allow you to reallocate them as a regular mechanic. I'm not a fan of dead ends in incremental games.
