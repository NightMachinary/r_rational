My experience: I've played a number of games like this in the past, so I have several auto-click programs installed. My favorite refused to start saying the evaluation license was expired, so I loaded up a much more complex program that I wasn't fully familiar with. I was able to get the auto-clicking to start, but then it refused to stop, trapping me in an endless cycle of hyper-speed clicking. Because my mouse pointer position was locked, I couldn't do much to stop it, and I didn't want to power-cycle my PC because I had unsaved documents open. Eventually I was able to get Task Manager open, then a command prompt, then I had to use my phone to look up how to kill a task from the command prompt in Windows. The auto-clicker was finally defeated, and I decided playing the game might not be a good idea after all. And that's how the world was saved.
