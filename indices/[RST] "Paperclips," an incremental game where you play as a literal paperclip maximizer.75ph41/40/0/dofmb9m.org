I can't really guess why your setup isn't making paperclips from a screenshot where you've sold everything and have no factories. It would be easier if you showed me the setup that should be making clips but isn't.

I would recommend bringing up the developer console (F12) and typing in:

memory -= 20;

press enter, and then

processors += 20;

See if that gets you around your processor bug. I don't think the displayed number of processors changes until you buy one with the actual button, but you should see your max ops fall and the rate of ops gain increase.
