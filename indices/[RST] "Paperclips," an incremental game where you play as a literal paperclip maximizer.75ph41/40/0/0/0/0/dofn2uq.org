That's okay. I tried googling it and it said push fn+f12, but that didn't actually do anything.

Slider? I don't have one. I assumed I hadn't unlocked it yet and that's what the 50 factories or 50,000 drones thing unlocked. What's it do? It's just a plain gray bar.

Yeah, I really should've, but like I said, I was never permitted to buy more than 6 processing, which made progress slow as hell. I bought memory and then got to the stage where I no longer get computer upgrades, so c'est la vie. I assume "swarm gifts" are just a new name for computer upgrades and I'll unlock them somehow.

No, I have never gotten a swarm gift. It used to say "next gift in infinity time" while my setup was working, but after it decided to stop, it went blank.

What's up with wire at this stage incidentally? My wire always says 0 inches, no matter how much I invest in anything, even when the game worked. Am I not making wire?

My game's definitely broken, but I don't think it's a mac thing, since I was playing the game normally for the last couple hours when it stopped on me. What browser are you using? Maybe that would give me a slider and let me do something and buy more than 6 processing
