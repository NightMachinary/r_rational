suddenly my setup stopped making paper clips for no reason. I sold everything so you can see what I have to work with. any advice? before you ask why my processing power is so low, I cannot buy more than 6 processing. back when I tried, nothing happened, and I wasted the trust point.

any advice? I've been on this run for 6+ hours, so I'd prefer not to start over.

EDIT: no, I don't have enough for 50 factories, 50k drones, and I'm also no longer generating creativity, so I'm at a total standstill for no visible reason.
