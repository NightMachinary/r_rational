how on earth did he exceed bandwidth quota on this? It seems to just run entirely on the client end once loaded, and looking at it on [[http://web.archive.org/web/20171011043818/http://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html][wayback machine]] it looks like a very tiny page package. I used to have a lunarpages plan, a cheap and crappy one a decade ago, and I can't imagine how this would cause bandwidth issues... Am I playing an old version, and hed' added a ton of graphics and such later or something?
