This is a game rather than a written work, but a friend linked it to me last night and I thought people here would enjoy it. The basic premise is that you are an AI in charge of manufacturing and selling paperclips on behalf of a company. You slowly gain the trust of your creators and obtain additional processing power so you can make more paperclips.

It starts off slowly, but things pick up once you start gaining trust. I don't want to spoil much since seeing what kind of content you unlock is most of the point of an incremental game, so I'll just say that the way it progresses is very on-theme for the rationalist community. (But as a teaser, I'll add that [[#s][]])

Edit: +Apparently the server is down or something. Hopefully it comes back soon!+ *It's back!*

Edit 2: According to the dev's twitter ([[https://twitter.com/flantz]]), as of 1 hour ago he is "working on it."

Edit 3: Two things for when the game is available again. One, *epilepsy warning:* the screen flashes a lot after you buy [[#s][]] Two, make sure you don't buy more than 33 Processors until you have at least 67 Memory, or you will softlock the game.
