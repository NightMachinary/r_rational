Oh, that's weird. It's still running for me in the same tab I had it open in from last night. But you're right, when I try to open it in a new tab I get a 404 error. That's a shame.

If it ever starts working again, I'll probably repost it, because I really think this community would get a kick out of it.

I haven't played Swarm Sim, but it looks like that's also an incremental game, so there are probably similarities.
