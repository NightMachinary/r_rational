Mine reset to the correct number the next time I clicked the button to buy another rank manually. Hence my suggestion to sell one more processor than you want to get rid of and then buy it back via the button. But I believe the latest patch provides a research project you can buy to redistribute your Trust, so using the console to get around the memory/processor ratio problem should no longer be necessary.
