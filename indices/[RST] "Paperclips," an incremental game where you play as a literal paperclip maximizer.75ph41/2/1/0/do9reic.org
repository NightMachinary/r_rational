Press F12 to bring up the developer console. Click the "console" tab. Type this into the console:

processors -= 1;

and press Enter. This essentially "sells" a processor. The number of processors shown on your screen won't update unless you buy another one, but you should be able to put a point into Memory. (If you want the number of processors shown to be accurate, you can sell 2 instead and then buy one processor and one memory.)

As long as you don't have more than 33 processors, you should be able to proceed with the game. It doesn't sound like you're at the stage yet where the too-many-processors softlock occurs, so your game must have slowed down for another reason.

If you ever want to reset it for real, I've never done this myself but apparently if you spam quantum computing until you hit like -10k ops, you get the option to reset. Or you could just clear your cookies.
