You shouldn't need much more than 100 million...battery towers are cheap. Buy one battery tower, buy a solar plant to fill it, dismantle the plant and build drones to make some wire, dismantle the drones, refill the battery tower if needed, build a factory.

Once the factory starts making extra clips, you should be set.
