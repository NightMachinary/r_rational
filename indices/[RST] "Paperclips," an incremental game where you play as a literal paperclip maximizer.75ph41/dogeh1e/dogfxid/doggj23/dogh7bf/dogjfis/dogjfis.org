you're a lifesaver. jeez, this game is badly designed. I would've just been stuck there forever wasting my creativity entertaining the swarm otherwise. I assumed, like all the upgrades before, that it referred to paperclips made, not paperclips in inventory.

Now it won't let me upgrade my von neumann probes. I have 10 times the amount of yomi required. is there some kind of secret prereq to buy it? it's still greyed out. no idea what the goals are now
