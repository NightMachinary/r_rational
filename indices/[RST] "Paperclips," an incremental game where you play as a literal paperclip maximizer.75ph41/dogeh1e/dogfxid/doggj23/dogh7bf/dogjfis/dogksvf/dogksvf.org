I believe all upgrades that require clips actually use the paperclips in inventory. "Paperclips made" is the figure for the total number of clips you've /ever/ made, and you can't expend from that figure because that would be like retroactively not making as many paperclips. You do early on get trust rewards for hitting milestones in "paperclips made," of course.

How many points do you already have invested in the probes? There should be an indicator on there that 20 is the current maximum. It's eventually possible to increase the maximum trust with a resource you get later in the game.

Your main goal at this point is to make a shitload of probes. The universe is so huge that you won't make any headway on exploration until you have a disgusting amount of them. I'd suggest putting most of your points in self-replication and hazard mitigation, with some token points in making drones and factories to keep up with the cost of replication.
