Yep, that's exactly it. Try not to buy more max trust than you can afford to fill up at any given time, there's a tradeoff involved (keep an eye on the message scroll at the top, you'll see what I mean eventually). Also you can probably turn AutoTourney back on unless you're saving up for more creativity stuff.
