Yomi is different from honor. It doesn't look like you've unlocked honor yet, actually. You should get the ability to earn it from a Project soon. I think you have to build up a lot of Creativity to make the project available. I would turn off AutoTourney to maximize your Creativity gain since you have excess yomi right now.
