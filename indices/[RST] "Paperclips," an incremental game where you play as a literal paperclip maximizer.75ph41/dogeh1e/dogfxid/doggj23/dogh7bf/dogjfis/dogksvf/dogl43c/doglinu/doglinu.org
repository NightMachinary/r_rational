If you have 20/20 then it's maxed out. You increase the maximum by expending honor, which you should be accumulating now that you're fighting drifters.

Your setup looks good for idling. If you want to min/max a little more with active management, you can move points in and out of wire drones and factories in order to keep your acquisition rate for available matter, acquiring matter, wire, and clips roughly equal. Right now you're acquiring way more matter than you are turning into wire, and you have more factories than you need. The upshot is that wire production is currently your rate-limiting step, so improving that will speed up your progress. If you take that point out of factories and put it in wire drone production for a little while, you should see your clip production rate shoot up.

Keep an eye on your total number of alive, non-value-drifted probes--it should be increasing. If it's dropping you gotta move points around until it's no longer dropping. If necessary you can completely stop exploring and making things until you claw your way back up.

Also, you're welcome!
