Edit: +Do you have a link to his twitter?+ I found his twitter with a google search.

There's nothing on the decisionproblem website to direct me to a place to provide feedback... I mean I know of:

- [[http://www.decisionproblem.com/]]
- [[http://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips]]
- [[http://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html]]
- [[http://decisionproblem.com/paperclips/patch1notes.html]]

none of them tell me how to provide feedback, there's no index to navigate between these pages and nothing to tell me of any other pages that are present on his website either.
