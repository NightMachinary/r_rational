*Edit: I just realized that you have the slider set all the way to "think!" There's your problem right there. You need your drones doing at least /some/ work, because you need the clips in order to replicate. Besides, you have way more swarm gifts than you need already. You also need to click that "synchronize the swarm" button to make them actually work again.*

Looks like you're way outnumbered by drifters. And it looks like a really high percentage of your probes are being lost to value drift. I would throw a couple points into drone production to make sure your clip output can keep pace with your replication, and everything else into speed, self-rep, hazard, and combat so you can regain the numbers advantage over the drifters. Once you have them under control it should be easier to build up your population. Don't buy any more probe trust or max trust or the value drift rate will increase even more.

Putting at least one point into each kind of drone is really important, as is making enough factories to use all your materials. I think you may currently not be making enough clips. You have /no/ unused clips, which tells me that every single clip is going to making probes. Your rate of replication should increase when you have enough clips to pay for it.
