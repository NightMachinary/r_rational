Thanks! I've added 3 points into exploration and split the rest up between self-replication, hazard remediation, and combat. Then I moved the slider all the way to the right and upped my processors, turned off my tournament, and launched as many probes as I could. But the same thing happened again: I ran out of enough clips to launch anymore, which was fine because the amount of drones was going up by itself. But then it went back down again and is now back at zero. I keep using Memory Release to get more clips so I can launch more probes, but the same thing keeps happening. Also, my Honor is going steadily down.
