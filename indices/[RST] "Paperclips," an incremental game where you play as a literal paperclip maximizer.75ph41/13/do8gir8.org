Played it for a while until it stopped working then had to start from the beginning. From there I got much farther (unlocking all the tiers of quantum operation) however my computer rebooted itself overnight so I lost that as well.

It's kind of a shame it just runs in the browser the way it does because if it used your computer's clock you could change your time to skip ahead. As it is odds are pretty good that most people won't make it to the end before something forces them to start over, and given it's a wait type game there's not really enough replayability to want to go all that work again to get to where I was previously.

Another serious flaw is that the game is effectively paused whenever you're in another tab, so the only way to let it run while doing other things on your computer is to open it in it's own window and change windows without minimizing it.
