Have you launched probes? Are they reproducing faster than they're being destroyed? Do they have points in making harvester and wire drones? Do they have most of their points in self-replication and hazard mitigation? Your main goal at this stage of the game should be to produce as many probes as possible, along with enough paperclips to support their production.

Note that it will take a very long time for the %exploration counter to start increasing. The universe is just /that/ big.
