It's a research item, it lets you redistribute your Trust between Memory and CPU. In my case it set them both to 0, Swarm Presents remained at 0 and the Memory and CPU buttons to assign my Trust remained non-functional (since the interface was replaced with the "Drone Presents" UI I guess).

I also had no Drones to generate new Presents with since I sold them all to more quickly hit the 5 Octillian requirement to enter Space.
