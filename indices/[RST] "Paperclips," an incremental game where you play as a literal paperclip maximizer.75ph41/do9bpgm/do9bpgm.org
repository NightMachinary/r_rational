Hm. (Hoping this much isn't a spoiler--) Upon getting the Revenue Tracker, I'm very confused.

For example, I have the option of 0.25 per clip and 39% Public Demand, or 0.15 per clip and 65% Public Demand. I thought that Public Demand was directly proportional to rate-of-buying, and so previously would have thought that the two would both give me 9.75 revenue per [applicable unit of time], and what I'd set it to would be inbetween at the 'peak'. However, the Revenue Tracker tells me that the first option gives me on average 0.32 per second and the second 0.58 per second. Very confused thus about the true meaning of Public Demand!

Edit: Making 150 paperclips per second, an average clips sold per second of 34 gives me a slowly-growing unsold inventory. Making 150 paperclips per second, an average clips sold per second of 50 gives me a slowly-shrinking (to zero) unsold inventory. I am not familiar with this usage of the term 'average'.
