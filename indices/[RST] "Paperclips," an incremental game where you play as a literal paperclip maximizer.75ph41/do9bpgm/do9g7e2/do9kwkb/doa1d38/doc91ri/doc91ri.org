Left probes multiplying overnight. Came back in the morning to find it back to 0 Paperclips and an out-of-memory error saying that my other browser had died. Replaced the decisionproblem cookie with an earlier decisionproblem cookie that I had saved. No effect, and a new cookie was spawned instead of renaming the old one. Closing the tab again, replaced the contents of the new cookie with the old one's contents, deleting the old one. No effect.

This experience was... very frustrating.
