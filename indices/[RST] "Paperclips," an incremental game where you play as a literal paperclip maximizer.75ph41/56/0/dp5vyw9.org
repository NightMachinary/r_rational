The initial maximum Trust you can expend on probes is 20. If you want to buy more Trust, you have to increase your max Trust by expending Honor, which is earned through combat.

If you haven't unlocked the project to earn Honor yet, try stockpiling creativity. Stop running AutoTourney and buy lots of processors. I believe the project unlocks when you hit a certain amount of Creativity.

Beyond that, some general advice for progressing quickly:

1. Put most of your points in self-replication, hazard remediation, and combat, in that order. Having more probes makes everything else happen faster. Once you have a shitload of probes you can pump up Exploration and Speed. (If you have the upgrade that makes Speed useful in combat, you can put more points in that now.)

2. Keep at least 1 point in Exploration and Speed at all times. You need to be continually discovering new matter so you can convert it into clips to pay for your probe self-replication.

3. Keep an eye on your stockpiles. Ideally your clip stockpile and total probe count should both be steadily increasing.

4. Monitor your rates of discovering matter, acquiring matter, making wire, and making clips. Remember that your rate of, for example, wire production is limited by your rate of matter production. So if you're not making enough clips to support your probe replication, figure out where the current rate-limiting step is in the supply chain and remedy that; e.g., if you're collecting less matter than your wire drones can convert, make more harvester drones.
