Well, that was an interesting eight hours. The A-B game I found a little confusing as there was no information on how to play it or indication as to whether A was the the left column or the top row, and the assorted strategies weren't explained at all in terms of the numbers seen on the grid. Even looking up game strategy/theory didn't help much in that aspect.

The space probe battle interface, too, was confusing at first as it didn't indicate which color was you and which was the opponent, or whether you were supposed to do anything with the interface to influence the battle (spoiler: you don't; you just watch it). And I was honestly expecting the generation of yomi to be able to be sped up in some way; waiting for it to tick over just to be able to update the probes was amazingly boring.

As some people have noted, too, there's no real guide for making sure you have sufficient ratios of processors and memory in order to be able to progress at certain stages of the game. It's quite possible to wind up with insufficient amounts of one or the other, and no real way of backtracking or compensating. I was lucky in that I only got almost-caught once, where I had 70 memory and needed 80 for some of the next upgrades, but there were no more processor/memory increases available at that point. I had to click-spam the quantum processors about 700 times at exactly the right moments in order to overdrive the memory to 80K before it started reverting back to 70 (and why does it DO that?).

Also, kinda lol at when you finally start playing the space segment, and see what percentage of the universe you've explored.
