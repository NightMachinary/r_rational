It's part of the Strategic Modeling mechanic. Every time you run it, a "tournament" plays out in which every strategy you've unlocked competes against every other strategy. You essentially bet on a specific strategy to win, and the yomi you obtain is equal to the score earned by that strategy. And once you unlock the placement thing, you get bonus points if it's in the top 3.
