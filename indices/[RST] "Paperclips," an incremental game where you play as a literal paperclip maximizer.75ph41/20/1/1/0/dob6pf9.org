Well as it is now, I think I screwed myself over. I let the game run overnight and came back to find 1.4 million drifters attacking me. I unlocked combat, pumped the number up to 11, and... have killed 158 of them. Woo-hoo?

Meanwhile my drones have dropped from 8.08k to just under 6k now. Seems like I was supposed to start combating them when there was a much lower number and now it's a losing battle.
