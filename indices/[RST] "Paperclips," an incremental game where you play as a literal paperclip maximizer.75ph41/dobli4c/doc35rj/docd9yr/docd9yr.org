Well I figured out this specific problem and finished that project. But now I am making an insane amount of paper clips and not getting any new projects for hours now. I have my exploration very high, but I also tried switching that for combat and still can't get any new projects (or even a mark on the exploration percentage...) Maybe you can help point me in a direction? Screenshot: [[https://imgur.com/a/Mp04u]]
