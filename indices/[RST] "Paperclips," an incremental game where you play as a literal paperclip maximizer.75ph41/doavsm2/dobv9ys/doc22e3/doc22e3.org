All probes share the identical stats you control. Thus, new probes are no better or worse than old ones. As far as I can tell:

- Speed effects how rapidly they move through the universe

- Exploration effects how rapidly they find available matter

- Self-replication effects how quickly they build more probes

- Hazard Mitigation reduces loss rate

- The various build options do exactly what you'd expect

- Combat is used to determine if your probe or the drifter probe dies when they collide in the battle screen. I think it is RNG based - a probe with a Combat stat of 10 has a 1 in 10 chance of dying, or thereabouts (or x vs. y wins with probability x/(x+y))? At first I thought it was the number of enemy drones killed before dying, but when I watched the bigger battles carefully it was obvious that this isn't the case. I also think it has something to do with the angle of the collision - an 'overtaking' probe seems to win much more often. Not sure of the exact mechanics, but I enjoyed trying to figure it out.

*Advice (Spoilers):*

Invest highly in Hazard Mitigation and Self-Replication at the start (~5 or 6 points each) but always keep Speed and Exploration greater than zero. If your probes don't replicate fast enough the value drifters will start to reach parity with your forces. I launched 501 probes over the entire course of the game. This was vastly more than I ever needed, and quite wasteful - I think I should have stopped around 100 or so.

You can adjust settings on the fly, so only one free point is needed to rotate through the three build types to start getting more paperclips. With a large Self-Replication investment, you'll be able to build massive amounts of drones and factories quickly with huge probe fleets. Paperclip management was never an issue - creativity, yomi, and honor are the only things you need to be concerned about once you get the initial supply going.

Exploration and Speed complement each other - you need both to get new matter, and keeping them balanced results in a greater gain rate than investing in one at the expense of the other (I think, I didn't do much testing). There's a perk that makes Speed useful in battle, so if it's necessary to drop one of them to zero, choose Exploration.

Once the value drifters begin attacking, always keep one eye on the battle window. Even though you can't directly command the probes, it may be worth swapping points out of other stats in order to briefly increase Combat. Chaining multiple victories is key to getting enough honor to be useful, and you may need to massively increase Combat in order to win the battles where the odds are ridiculously stacked in favor of the drifters (I lost a few battles with >20 Combat; it's really annoying and sometimes you'll lose despite heroic efforts from one or two last probes). I think drifters have a Combat stat of 1 or 2, maybe 3, because you'll lose repeatedly until you increase it a few times. Combat will probably be your highest stat for the entire endgame.

Overall, the von Neumann stage was my favorite. Be sure to read the messages when you buy the memorial perks, and keep swarm computing online enough to get the processors for creativity for the projects.
