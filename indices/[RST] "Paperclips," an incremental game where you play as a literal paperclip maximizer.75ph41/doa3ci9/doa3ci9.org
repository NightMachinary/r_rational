Some buttons need a way to click them faster, things like the Quantum computer are fine because mashing the button is the minigame, but things like for example the memory and procesors button in the space stage shouldn't be so painfull to use . Also the game needs some kind of instructions, to tell you which resources won't be usefull next stage, how some minigames work etc.
