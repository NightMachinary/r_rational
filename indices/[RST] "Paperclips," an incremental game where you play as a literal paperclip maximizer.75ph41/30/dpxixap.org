If you're thinking of walking away and letting the game just run for a while, then a good time for it is at the end of stage 2, where you can build up over 200 processors + AutoTourney and then leave it to stockpile millions of creativity and yomi. That makes stage 3 very easy. No more twiddling your thumbs waiting to gradually accrue Honor, and then watching your winning streak crumble as the game pits two of your drone dots against a veritable cloud of enemies. Just buy your way to the top.
