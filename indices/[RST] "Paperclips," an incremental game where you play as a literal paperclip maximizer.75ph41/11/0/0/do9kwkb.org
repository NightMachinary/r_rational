Thank you for the tips!

Indeed, money used to buy autoclippers and marketing. The lower the price, the greater the inflow of money (even if the Public Demand proportions don't make sense at first glance), so keeping the price as low as it can go without quite running out of stock--if I gradually build up stock, I can later drop the price a tick to sell it off quickly (or wait until marketing is boosted), but if I'm selling everything cheaper and time is passing when customers can't buy anything, I'm losing money overall.

I'm dabbling at the moment in the 12 memory area: thank you especially for the quantum computing suggestion, which I'm about to start on! I don't know how the tournaments will work, but I'll keep your advice in mind when I get there.

Edit: (I don't suppose I could ask the conditions for the Strategic Modeling project to appear? Other than slowly build memory to 70, all I have are things to spend Yomi on that I have no Yomi for. With Quantum Computing, I don't need more processors at the moment (I have 5), and I would rather not enter into a cycle of buying more processors in the possible-doomed hope that processor number is a condition.)
