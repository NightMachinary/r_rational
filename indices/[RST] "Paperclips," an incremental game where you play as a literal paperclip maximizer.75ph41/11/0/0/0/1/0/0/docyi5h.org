Unless I messed up a countdown when tinkering with the console, I think I've now observed how they should behave (though I don't know how this applies to the probes section):

[](#s "When converting the planet, Swarm Computing lets your Drones give you 'Swarm Gifts' every so often to increase your processors/memory. If just left running, this could perhaps increase roughly indefinitely? The 'X the swarm' seem to be regular interruptions once your processors+memory gets too high, to stop you from doing that. First was 'Status: Disorganized', and 'Synchronize the swarm' for 5,000 yomi each time. Next, less frequent, was 'Status: Bored', and 'Entertain the swarm', which was 10,000 creativity the first time, 20,000 creativity the next time. I didn't see any of the others in the playthrough I had, but at my shit to the probes stage I had ~1.25 million drones, 250 memory, and 123 processors.)
