Optimising profit margin vs rate of sales is an old problem. No, all settings are not equal.

Since your base cost starts at about $0.02/clip and drops sharply as you research extrusion tech, and since your ultimate aims revolve around paperclips, not money, I recommend aiming for volume. Build as many auto-clippers as you can, and drop your prices - or better still, boost marketing - so they all get sold, to fund more auto-clippers. Money is just a means to an end.

Be conservative about buying the other projects. You really only need one quantum computing chip - in fact, you get a longer button-bashing window that way. You can make yomis much faster by running lots of tournaments on the Random strategy, rather than buying more, since the tournaments are vastly shorter (and cheaper). And remember, you can only accumulate creativity while your processor is idle, so you should sometimes hold off on buying memory upgrades, and don't spend ops just because they're available.
