You can deposit (all your current cash) or withdraw (however much is currently in cash). The engine uses the money to buy stocks, with a risk rating you choose (higher risk = higher potential return) and average effectiveness determined by the number of upgrades you buy.

At level 0, it will mostly just sit around, but buy three or four upgrades, start with a few tens of thousands, select high risk, and you can sit back and watch it climb into the hundreds of millions. That's the quickest way to get $10M to monopolize the world markets.
