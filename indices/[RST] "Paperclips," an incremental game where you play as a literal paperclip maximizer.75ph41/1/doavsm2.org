That's the most fun I've had playing a game in a long time. The interface is deceptively simple, but the mechanics are realistic and interesting enough that it's well worth the ~5 hours or so I spent playing. It has the same feel of exponential growth as in Swarm Simulator, but I felt much more in control of my progress rather than being a simple exponent slave. Hats off to everyone who worked on the game, fantastic job! (Including the music!)

I struggled a bit at the very start before I realized I had to vastly reduce the cost per clip to get anywhere useful. The tip others posted about getting 67 memory before 33 processors was useful, and I would have reached soft-lock if I hadn't known. The only other sticky spot was the start of the von Neumann phase, when the drifters increased rapidly and had the advantage in combat. Later, the periodic defeats from the battles with <1:100 odds were the only thing that slowed me down significantly. In the end, I chose to annihilate all the drifters.

It's funny how humanity just vanishes without any note when the drones deploy. After enough exploitation, they're simply not worth keeping around any more. Chilling.

And at the end, the 30 septendecillionth paperclip is finished almost identical to the first: without processors, without memory, and without any automated infrastructure. Just a few inches of wire to mindlessly convert into paperclips. /Click. Click. Click. Click.../ *Click.*

Now I can sleep.
