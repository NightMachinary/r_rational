I think I'm stuck. I need help.

I'm at universe 1 Sim level 2

Computational design continues to work fine.

Strategic modelling is also fine (though I've never figured out what the difference in strategies is).

Absolutely nothing is happening in the left-most column.

I've tried rejigging the numbers but the universe explored remains at 0% no matter how many probes I set to explore it. No matter how high I set replication, I don't seem to make any more probes. I'm at Von Neumann Probe Design (30/30) 30 Max. I lose every combat which is depleting my honour. I swear I've clicked "launch probe" thousands of times by now. "Total" says 800 though I don't know what it's totalling.
