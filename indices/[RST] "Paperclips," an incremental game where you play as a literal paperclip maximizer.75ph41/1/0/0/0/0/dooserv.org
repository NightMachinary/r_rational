I know this is old but if you're still looking for help:

1. "Universe explored" is going to stay at 0 for a long time no matter what. The universe is just that big. Once it finally starts ticking up, it won't take too long to explore everything.

2. Self-replication costs clips. Even when focusing on self-replication, you need to periodically move points into exploration and drone and factory production in order to make enough clips to meet the demand. You can put all 30 trust points in self-replication and your rate of probe production still won't increase if you don't have the clips to pay for it.

3. Pay attention to what your rate-limiting step is at any given time and focus on improving that. E.g., if you have 0 matter available because it's being turned into wire as fast as you make it, make more harvester drones. This is important because if you're already using as much matter as you're harvesting, adding more wire drones or factories won't net you any additional clips.

4. Don't bother launching probes manually, it barely makes a dent after the first few.

5. "Total" probes is the number of probes that are currently alive and aligned with your utility function. It's the number of probes that have been made minus the number that have been lost to hazards, combat, or value drift. You want to get to a point where this number is increasing steadily without your intervention.
