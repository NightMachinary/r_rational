So, I'm at the stage of the game when I'm fiddling with the probes. I have no idea what they do but they're replicating (and drifting) rapidly. The entire thing in general is confusing (do probes replicate into probes with their own stats? Is there any point at all in launching replicating probes which don't make factories, drones, or explore or is that just useless?) But most of all, what on earth does Speed do?

Edit: ooooh the probes respond to your commands post launch

But still what does speed do?
