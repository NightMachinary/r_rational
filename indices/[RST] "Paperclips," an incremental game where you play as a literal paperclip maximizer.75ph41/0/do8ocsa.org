When my husband told me about this game I kind of objected because surely selling paperclips is bad, since the person who buys them might unbend them, turning them into USELESS wire?

Now as I sit here tapping my spacebar to stockpile some paperclips for the game to sell while I'm at work, I realise that I can sell those paperclips and in sacrificing short-term paperclips (as they get destroyed by CARELESS HUMANS) I'll have resources to produce a more permanent stash of paperclips.
