Yeah, you can't buy more than 33 processors during the first phase or you get stuck.

Fortunately it's fixable. Using F12 to bring up the console, type in "processors -= 7;" without quotes. This "sells" 7 processors and you should be able to put 7 trust in Memory, which is enough to get to 70 in a quantum phase.
