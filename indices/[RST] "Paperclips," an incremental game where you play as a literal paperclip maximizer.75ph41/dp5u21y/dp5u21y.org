I'm stuck at the part after you send space probes into space and begin combat. The button Increase Probe Trust is greyed out, though I have much more Yomi than the Cost for the upgrade would be. Anyone else see this / know how to proceed? I've been sitting on this screen for like a week with Caffeine running, meaning it's not going to sleep, and nothing has progressed. I literally have 4,084,794,342,326,720,000,000,000,000,000 paperclips.
