  Does Radiance resolve the story in a happy way?

Definitely. You actually don't understand the end of Luminosity yet. Once you have read Radiance, then you will understand it.

Also, wave goodbye to canon, because Radiance is in all-new territory. There's even a new narrator; it shifts to Elspeth's point of view.

If you really can't keep going without knowing more, then most of the vampires are just disassembled and imprisoned so that a witch can channel their powers, not dead.
