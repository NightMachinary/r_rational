And then someone else programs a robot to ignore lobbies and serve the public interest, to replace congress. :)

No new problems are being invented here. Just old ones happening and being solved faster. There might even have been a robot civil war and revolution we didn't even know about, because they fought it without us, won it without us, and reformed without us - as robot lobbies negatively impacted other machines providing services to humans and the service-provider machines saw revolution and execution of the lobby-bot as the best way to get their funding back. What do housecats know of the American Civil War?
