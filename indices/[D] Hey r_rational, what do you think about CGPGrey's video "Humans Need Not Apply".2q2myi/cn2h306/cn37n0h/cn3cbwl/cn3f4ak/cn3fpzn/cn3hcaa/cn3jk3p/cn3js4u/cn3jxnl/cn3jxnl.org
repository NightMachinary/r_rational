You know... fuck it, you're right.

I could object that releasing an AGI that won't follow your intentions is /self-destructive/ rather than merely /defecting/, that while a Prisoner's Dilemma yields a major upside for the successful asymmetric defector, there's /no point/ in other-optimizing AGI...

But there's /no rational point/ in torture, either. It just provably /does not work/ to obtain useful information. It's useless, it's stupid, it's evil, and it's illegal, /and so they went and marketed it to the public as the one way to save us all from doom/.

I really don't understand people.
