The video ends on the big question of what happens when there's very little that needs doing. The classic argument (used by a lot of transhumanists) is that new jobs will open up because of the readily available labor ... but there's a floor to labor costs, and that's the cost of paying someone's room and board. Given current trends, there will come a time when there's not enough paying work to support all the humans.

But what happens then? The /Star Trek/ future has everyone living on the government dole, but that's always seemed too rosy to me - I don't really buy that it would happen, given that we in America don't even have government healthcare. But what's the alternative to that when so many people are incapable of contributing anything that's valuable enough for someone to pay for?
