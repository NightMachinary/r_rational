You still have to connect that problem with technological displacement. I mean Rogoff and Reinhart wrote a book saying that financial recession are long lasting and that the long term effects of it are well understood. [[http://www.amazon.com/This-Time-Different-Centuries-Financial/dp/0691152640]]

Still you can clearly say that the Fed and the federal government did not do enough. Austerity was a problem and was counterproductive and the Fed should have pushed for a higher inflation target or go the market monetarist route and pushed for a NGDP level targeting.

The understanding is that unemployment is caused by friction in the market and when the economy shrinks due to a bubble bursting or what not, the wages are "sticky" so they do not adjust and instead people are laid off. That is a harm to the economy that we are experiencing right now. Governments doing nothing to boost the economy and the Fed not committing to a higher inflation target is keeping the economy underperforming.
