True, although it still seems like it may take a while for that particular viewpoint to be anywhere near fully supported in Congress.

However, redefining poverty would seem much more applicable to our current situation given the decrease in the relative amount of money actually devoted to food used to define poverty has from one-third to one-fifth in general given the increased utility, healthcare, and childcare costs.

So if we changed just the amount of money a family actually needs using their food budget, redefining it from three times that value total to five times that value total would help at this particular point in time.

However, the fact that this relationship changed to begin with suggests that a more responsive definition of poverty that automatically updates based off of the proportional of earned income used to purchase food obtained using the standard of living of middle class Americans would be the best fix for this issue in general and would be especially valuable given how rarely we get to update the conditions for anything important on the federal level legislatively.

So yeah, I say we do that first if we can manage it before going for straight basic income. It seems like an easier point to argue at this point in time.
