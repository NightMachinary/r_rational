If you're willing to dedicate your DALYs to this then I'd vote for you, if you identify yourself, if not, then I'll continue not caring about politics; The cycle time is too slow to have much effect on the course of events currently and soon it will be too slow to have any measurable effect.

Though I agree that wide open political positions are low hanging fruit, I am not motivated to contribute in that way.
