Plenty of quiet reservations too, but even so I feel like whatever misgivings I have, you could chuck out most of the welfare currently in place in most places and replace it with a UBI and while you might have problems of various kinds, you'd still be a hell of a lot better off than before.

But since that realistically isn't going happen anywhere anytime soon, it's a different and difficult question to think about how UBI would actually come about in the real world.

If I was an absolute dictator though, I know I would probably instate it basically immediately.
