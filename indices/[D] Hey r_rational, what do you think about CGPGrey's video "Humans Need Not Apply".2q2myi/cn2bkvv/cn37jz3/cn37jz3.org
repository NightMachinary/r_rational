[[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2q2myi/d_hey_rrational_what_do_you_think_about_cgpgreys/cn37i15][I both support it and consider it probable.]] I also think that targeting it using the simple "X% of the mean tax-reported income is payed out as Basic Income in monthly increments to every tax-paying citizen" will work to keep the level of basic income appropriate to the actual size of the economy.

Basically, I think there's a sizable economic-historical gap (decades, probably) between the Death of Labor, which is already happening /now/ (semi-skilled and unskilled labor are /plummeting/ in value, which includes large categories we didn't used to think of as unskilled), and full-blown post-scarcity production-for-need (which may not happen at all prior to the advent of Singularity-grade technologies). UBI/GBI/BI can and should help to fill the gap necessary to keep society healthy and functional until such time as it can all be disassembled into a pyre of paperclips by Glorious Clippy-sama.
