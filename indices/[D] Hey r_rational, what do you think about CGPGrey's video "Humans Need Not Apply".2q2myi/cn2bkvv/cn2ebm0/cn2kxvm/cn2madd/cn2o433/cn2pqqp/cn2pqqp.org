I remind you that I said that all extant evidence could be considered weak -- it is of course possible to poke holes in any or all of these studies, and the performance of a Basic Income in a limited trial will necessarily be different than its performance as a permanent policy.

All that said, studies have been performed in Canada, Namibia, the UK, the US, Mexico, Liberia, and other countries. A handy list is hosted at [[/r/basicincome]] -- list is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/BasicIncome/wiki/index#wiki_that.27s_all_very_well.2C_but_where.27s_the_evidence.3F][here]].
