50 years too early.

There's a transition coming up, where the amount of work people are able to provide becomes more than the amount of work people need to do. Not completely post-scarcity, at least as you imagine it, but moving in that direction. Before that point, UBI (and similar proposals) would be bad, because people won't work although there is work to be done. We'll only need UBI when there's less work available than people want.

And the solution doesn't need to be set up decades before the problem hits, in the way environmental or humanitarian concerns work. UBI is at its heart just a tax and welfare reform. It'll happen over the course of one or two election cycles.

It's good to start talking about it, but it is neither necessary or advisable in this decade.
