I love the concept. But I think it will simply have the effect of inflating the cost of food & rent to the point that the lowest-quality available that can still keep someone alive until the next Income payment will cost exactly as much as an Income payment. In the end, little will have changed.

Honestly I think it'd be better to simply provide certain life necessities for "free", leaving money as a thing that is only used for luxuries. Of course the definition of luxuries is fluid... not too long ago things like "heating" and "plumbing" were luxuries. /shrug
