I'm for it. I'm not sure it's a good idea to make it a living wage. It would make your savings go further, and it would increase the market price of labor and make it easier to get a job.

In the case of automation making humans largely obsolete, I'm in favor of getting a good wage from it. If most people don't need to work, then don't make them.
