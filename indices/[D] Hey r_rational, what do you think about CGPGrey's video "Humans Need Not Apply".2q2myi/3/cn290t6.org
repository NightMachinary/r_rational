I for one welcome our new robot overlords. If a robot can run a company, accumulate wealth, and not need to pay much in the way of its own bills, that leaves us free to tax the bajeezus out of it - it won't mind like a human CEO does - and spend the rest on providing free services to humans.

The world where no humans work growing food - is a world where all humans have food.
