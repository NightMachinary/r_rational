I honestly think there's going to be a basic income grant at some point. Reasons:

- It's the smallest concession that lets capitalism even /try/ to accommodate the Death of Work. It preserves market economics in the transition between the Death of Work thanks to automation and the radical simplification of supply chains thanks to on-site small-scale production using 3D printing, matter compilers, and the rest of that scifi stuff.

- It's cheap to administrate, allowing the neoliberal ideology to try to further cut into the power of the state to order people's lives and social relations.

- It can be explained to almost everyone.

- Judging by what I hear in polite society nowadays, large portions of the skilled, productive elite support it as a way to keep society going when they don't need the proles anymore.

- Politically, it's gone from a damn-near-utopian-socialist radical proposal just a few years ago to a platform plank seen in mainstream publications and supported among the chattering classes.

Basically, neoliberalism is collapsing, but remains distinct from capitalism itself. So, as actually happened around the Great Depression and World War II, it's turning out that large portions of the elite itself, between capital and the skilled professionals serving it, would rather sacrifice the /purity/ of their capitalist system by making some concessions to the more well-behaved and better-dressed sections of the working class than have the whole thing collapse into chaos.

TL;DR: We stand a solid chance of actually winning this one, guys.
