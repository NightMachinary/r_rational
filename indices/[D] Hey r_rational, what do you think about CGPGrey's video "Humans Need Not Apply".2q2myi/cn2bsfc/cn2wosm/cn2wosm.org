Given the potential hollowing out of the middle class and disengagement with the electoral process, I greatly fear the medieval cyberpunk future we are likely headed towards.

In acknowledgement this potential threat, I move that is time for the Conspiracy to go into full-swing and rise to the upper echelons of society using [[https://80000hours.org/][80,00 hours]] as a resource for determining which careers will allow us to earn the greatest amount of money as well as the various state legislators positions expected to run unopposed in the United States to begin to change certain things before everything is expected to come to a head in the 2040s.

While we specialize in the highest paying jobs available for each of our individual platforms the only thing that should label our alignment with the Conspiracy would be our devoting 10% of our earnings to Effective Charities identified using [[https://www.givewell.org/][Give Well]] and [[https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/][Giving What We Can]] and allowing our philanthropist activities to do the greatest good, spinning each of our stories to better fit the local politics, and building up public support for each of us while taking out during the next set of elections for state legislature those who run completely unopposed.

As long as some of us can get into these positions we can begin to offset the influence of the private, tax-exempt organization ALEC, possibly by infiltrating smaller/lower-population states first. Then, after taking advantage of the polarization of each district initially we can reduce the chances of gerrymandering to make it harder for highly polarized bills to pass where possible, gradually infiltrate larger/higher-population states, and gradually begin making inroads on the federal level.

If we continue to do such we may be able to cause a considerable amount of change and exert a greater influence on the future of our nation as a whole.

I mean, earning lots of money and running for public office just seem like the obvious things to do as far as I'm concerned. If we have an impending dystopian future on the way I'm either rising to the challenge or I'm going down fighting it the whole way.

Still, this idea is severely over simplified. What are your thoughts on ways to best deal with this possibility?
