  I like to think that productivity growth reduces the costs in absolute terms. You have to assume that people will not want to spend money on newer services and products and in the mean time believe that the benefits of productivity growth will not be shared as lower costs to the consumer.

And you have to make 2 different assumptions in the opposite direction for your argument to work. The first one, that people will want to spend money on newer services, no-one is arguing with. The second one, that the benefits of increased productivity will be shared with the consumer, I'm somewhat skeptical of, because productivity growth due to technology has been happening for a while now, and I haven't seen lower costs for many of the services/products I consume.
