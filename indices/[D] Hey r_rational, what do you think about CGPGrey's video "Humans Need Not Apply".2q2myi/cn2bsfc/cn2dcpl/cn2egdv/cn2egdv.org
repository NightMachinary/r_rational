I am inclined to disagree. If we've not yet recovered from the 08 recession, that means it's been going on for nearly 7 years now. That's my entire adult life. This state of affairs is what me and mine consider "normal". Any eventual upturn will be just that - an upturn, not a return to normal.

(Just my opinion. I Am Not An Economist.)
