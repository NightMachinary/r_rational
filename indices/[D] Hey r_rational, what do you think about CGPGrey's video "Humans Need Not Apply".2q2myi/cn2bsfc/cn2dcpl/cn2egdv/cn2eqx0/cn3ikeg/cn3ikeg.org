I was right with you until:

No.

The government and the fed have prolonged this recovery. Higher taxes, thousands and thousands of new regulation for executive agencies are a failure.

The Fed has kept rates at 0% for 6 years, and have bought 60 to 80 billion dollars of it's own paper for that same period. What the hell else do you want them to do?
