You don't owe anyone anything. Unless you are pirating content that is only supposed to be available for purchase, then you are fine. I'd guess the fact that you have paid anything at all puts in a very high quantile among online fiction consumers (maybe not among this sub, but more generally).

I'm sort of in a similar boat to you where I have in the past supported an author on patreon, and have also bought ebook versions of things when they got published, but generally I am very hesitant to pay money for something that isn't completed. The rate of abandonment in online serials is just way too high. I'm also really not a fan of the patreon model for fiction because unless the monthly payment is /very/ low or the rate of production is /very/ high, the value proposition just isn't there (for me, obviously other people have different value calculations and that's fine).

So, I'd personally rather buy a book once when it's completed if I really enjoyed it. Now this makes it difficult since lots of people will never officially publish their work, even if they do wind up finishing.

In summary, as long as you aren't pirating, I wouldn't worry about it. Pay for the things you feel like paying for and don't pay for the things you don't feel like paying for.
