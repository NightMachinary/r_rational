In psychic crystal woo, is there some sort of obvious tier list of which crystal is more powerful than the other? I've written myself into a corner where a technically-minded character needs to MacGyver some psychokinetic explosives, and I need three tiers of those. Rigging psychic crystals to explode is my best idea for it, but I don't know if quartz is better than amethyst or whatever.
