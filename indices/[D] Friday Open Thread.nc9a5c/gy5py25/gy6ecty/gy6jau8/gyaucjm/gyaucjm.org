I read an entire page of that site before realizing it wasn't satire or conspiracy-observing. This hurt my brain.

I'm pretty sure that site has all of the "research" you need. You're going to be "wrong" to anyone with different crystal theories no matter what, and I'm sure there are thousands. The best option is probably to pick some "powerful and dangerous" crystals and explain them well in story. Stronger crystals and those easier to psychically detonate due to their frequency/power type stand out, maybe even combine crystals to create "unstable" frequencies/opposing properties?
