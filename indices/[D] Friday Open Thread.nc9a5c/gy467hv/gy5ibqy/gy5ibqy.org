Back in the age of sail, the great powers invested heavily into shipyards, and consistent investment over decades and centuries plus a symbiotic relationship with merchant shipyards allowed the great naval powers to have influence disproportionate to their population on world events.

SpaceX is building about one Starship prototype for month (this is hearsay until I find a source) and [[https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/1000-starships#:%7E:text=Previous%20%2F%20Next-,Elon%20Musk%20says%20'Building%20%7E1%2C000%20Starships%20to%20create%20a%20self,on%20Mars'%20is%20SpaceX's%20Mission][plans to build 100 per year]]. Assuming this isn't just Elon bigging himself up as usual, that's going to give the United States a truly insane lead in spacecraft building infrastructure, as it's developing and building (space)shipyards on a scale that no other nation will even try to match for potentially decades.

I don't really have any conclusions to make here, I just think this is really interesting.
