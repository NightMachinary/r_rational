There's a pretty clear consensus that clear quartz is the best for healing, but after that it's very mixed. Some sources go for mostly for quartz-derivatives like rose quartz and citrine, others go for a bunch of semiprecious stones with short names like jade and onyx. Nobody seems to think a crystal can be destructive, even though logically^{1} any near-miss on a healing effect is deadly.

I will give an arbitrary shoutout to [[https://soonyata.home.xs4all.nl/crystals.htm][this site]] for pursuing the field of crystal woo with some of the same mood that [[http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/index.php][Atomic Rockets]] pursues hard SF rocket designs.

edit: All this said, I'm mostly looking at random listicles, which is not an accurate source even for topics where it is possible to be accurate. It's possible there's a more consistent canon that a crystal aficionado would know about, but I don't know how to access it.
