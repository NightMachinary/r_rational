I read an enormous number of web serials, and I would like those authors to continue producing content. So I vote with my wallet; I'll happily toss five or ten bucks a month at authors who provide me with more than a burrito's worth of joy per update.

Sure, this means that I'm opening my wallet to the tune of a couple hundred bucks a month to Patreon, but I love reading, I love the amount and variety of stuff to read I get sent straight to my email inbox every day, and as a software developer it's not like I can't easily afford it out of what amounts to petty cash.

There's obviously no moral obligation to support an author on Patreon, but you might ask yourself "do I want this author to continue producing this work", and if the answer is 'yes', consider that there's only one real way to make that statement and it's with your dollars.
