I don't pirate anything. There is no need to do so. There is already so much to read, so much to play, so much to watch.

Heck, last year I signed up for Curiosity Stream for a pittance, and it included some of the higher quality Youtubers (Nebula streaming service), all of it ad-free.

I have a bunch of video games I haven't played yet. I've been fairly good about checking in with the Epic Games store and grabbing the free one every week. Though I've only played a couple of those (What Remains of Edith Finch was really good).

And I still have to master Rust programming, and there are plenty of projects there to work on for fun.

Time, is what I need more of these days. Time...
