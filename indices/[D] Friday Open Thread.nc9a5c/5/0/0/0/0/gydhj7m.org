Well, [[/r/vegancirclejerk]] is full of vegans, if that assuages you.

Regardless, me and Salty are both long-time regulars here, have been readers of LW/ASX for a long time, love the community/etc

full disclosure, I have been known to post in Sneerclub, but it's about a 100:1 ratio. It's a combo of because I have genuine grievances with the community about certain things (misogyny, chiefly), and because I try to keep myself intellectually honest by not having an echochamber.
