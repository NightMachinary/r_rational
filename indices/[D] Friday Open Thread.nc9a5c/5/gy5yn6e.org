me and [[/u/callmesalticidae]] have just taken over [[/r/rationalcirclejerk]] - we want it to be a circlejerk of [[/r/rational]] but also the "rationalsphere" in general (SSC/ASX, lesswrong, etc).

In the spirit of circlejerk it'll be poking fun at ourselves / making small grievances with the community, rather than sneering.

we would appreciate it if people could subscribe, post, and comment.
