Naval powers in the age of sail had an incredible value proposition - subjugate far away lands, extract goods and labor from them, and monopolize trade on any goods unique to that region. Space doesn't have any laborers to exploit, so I don't think it can have anywhere near the kind of impact that early modern imperialism had.

I think it's more similar to when Germany was synonymous with automotive manufacturing, or Japan with semiconductors, or the current Chinese/Taiwanese dominance in chip manufacture. A country invested heavily in technical expertise and infrastructure, to the point where they have an outsized influence on that field, and could extract a profit from being the place everyone has to go to get that product. That's still a big advantage, but some of those examples have already fallen by the wayside. Also launching satellites is not as crucial an industry as chip manufacture.
