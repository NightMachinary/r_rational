  really. They've already gone through dying, once, you're bringing them back to face that again, knowing they will know they're going to die, again,

Just like resuscitating a terminally ill person.

  forever, after a short period of time.

This depends on how long necromancy lasts. Also I assume (or at least hope) that necromantic type 1 ghost simulacra don't feel pain and don't share the disabilities they had in life. So dying is no different than sudden and temporary unconsciousness coupled with amnesia. If a person would forget every memory they formed over the last day each time they go to sleep would you consider it unethical to ever let them wake up again? What if their last consistent memory (the one they wake up with each morning) is a painful accident coupled with the knowledge that they will in fact not be able to retain any new memories for more than a day?
