How is it different from a doctor resuscitating someone who won't have a long time to live afterwards despite treatment? So far I know if you don't sign a "do not resuscitate" they will try to revive you even if your heart stops at the very date the doctors gave you when they estimated how long you still have to live after you were diagnosed with a terminal illness.
