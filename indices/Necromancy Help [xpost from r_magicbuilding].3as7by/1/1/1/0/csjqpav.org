Yeah I can understand how some people might feel this way. In cultures where this kind of necromancy is practiced, it was always generally understood that the process will not extend your life indefinitely, just give you more time. Most people want their candles to be spent in the presence of their friends and family, often at significant occasions. I see no reason why multiple copies couldn't be made from the same nervous system before it degrades, but they would only share memories up to the time of death. Burning only one in the presence of family etc., while saving the other, would deny that copy these experiences. It would also abandon the copy to a completely unknown fate. There is no way of knowing if or when a method to copy ghosts from one medium to another will be developed, nor any way of knowing for sure that the candle won't be burned for some other reason, or simply destroyed, at some point in the future... So most people prefer to have their candles burnt within a few years, sometimes decades, after their death, and have some control over their final moments of consciousness.

Of course, I could definitely see some people preferring to have their candle stumps saved until, like you said, they figure out a way for ghosts to be transferred. In modern times though, I think they'd prefer to have their brains preserved cryogenically, since there's a better chance of creating transferrable copies with technology than magic, and in the mean time, as many new ghosts could be made from the frozen brain as they like.
