What other kinds of magic are there? If most other magic involves linking the minds of the casters to an outside intelligence and using the combination to do work (elementals, translation magics, enchantments, etc.) then the second type of necromancy makes more sense and "fits" better.

However, if you have things like D&D clerical healing and the like, then the first type of necromancy is a better match. Either method requires massive amounts of computation/cognition to be performed by your source of magic.
