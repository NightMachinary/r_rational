Most of the time the ghosts created by the first method don't last very long. The copies of their nervous-system are tied to an object (usually a candle, or something else portable) that must be burnt as the ghost is summoned. They can be “stored” indefinitely until the object is burnt, in an inert form that is (fortunately) non-conscious, and the object can be extinguished and relit multiple times. From the ghost's perspective, no time would pass in between their candle being extinguished and relit, they would seem to instantly jump into the future.

Of course, exactly how long the ghost lasts depends on what they're tied to. A ghost tied to an entire coal seam or natural gas deposit, for example, could last a /very/ long time... though the magic rituals are difficult to adapt to such large objects, so attempts to do things like this are unreliable. It has nevertheless been attempted, and a few times even succeeded.

It certainly /would/ be morally dubious to do this to people against their will, but in the cultures where this type of magic is traditionally practiced, it's something that's generally expected to happen, and is used, by the ghosts to "set their affairs in order", share last words with loved ones, witness their children's first steps... that kind of thing.

In modern times, there are also people who volunteer to pilot space-probes as ghosts, since they could be relit in as many years as it would take to reach their destination, and basically all they'd need is a supply of oxygen ... though they generally spend a bit of time on Earth beforehand.

This magic certainly can be abused. Dead enemy soldiers might be brought back and interrogated, for example, but this kind of thing has always been generally disapproved of... and in modern times there are probably all kinds of international treaties to prevent it.

I've never read /Distress/ (or anything by Greg Eagan, actually). Is it any good?
