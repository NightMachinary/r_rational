Distress is good, pretty much anything by Greg Egan is good, but I would recommend starting with Permutation City or Diaspora.

[[http://www.gregegan.net/DIASPORA/01/Orphanogenesis.html][Orphanogenesis]], the first chapter of Diaspora, is available on his website... along with a bunch of other amazing stuff. I would allocate a day just to browsing it.
