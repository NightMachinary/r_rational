The most "accurate" expectation wins out over the others.

In-world, they've actually done experiments to demonstrate this. An animal was trained to do one thing (let's say, pressing a white button) in response to a stimulus, and was observed behaving this way by one group of people... then it was re-trained to respond to the stimulus differently (pressing a black button), and observed behaving in this way by a /different/ group of people. The animal was then killed and a ghost of it created using type II necromancy. When observed by the first group of people, the ghost respond to the stimulus in the way they had witnessed (pressing the white button), and when observed by the second group of people it responded in the way /they/ had witnessed (pressing the black button). When both groups of people observed the ghost together, it responded to the stimulus in the way it was most recently trained to (pressing the black button) even if only one person in a large group of observers had seen the animal doing this while alive. The observers don't need to be in the same room, or even aware of each other... as long as they are both observing the same ghost, it will behave according to the most "accurate" expectation.

So, to answer your question, if the dead person habitually ran in place and communicated through monosyllabic grunts towards the end of their life, and the observer with the telescope had witnessed this but the nearby observers had not, then that's how the ghost would behave. Even if the dead person had just sincerely /told/ the telescope observer that they would behave this way, if their ghost was ever created through necromancy... the ghost would behave that way as long as that person was observing them. However, if the dead person /lied/ to the telescope observer about this, then the expectations of the other observers, even if they were completely unaware of the lie, would win out, and the ghost would behave normally. On the other had, if the observer the dead person lied to was the only one watching, the ghost would behave as they expected.

There was once an old theoretical magician who wondered what would happen if /all/ of the observers' expectations were equally incorrect. He put some notes in a safe, with instructions that it only be opened after his death in the presence of his ghost (created through type II necromancy), and a group of younger friends he was sure would survive him. He then told each of them lies about what the note would say, and requested that they never mention it to anyone else, until the day the safe would be opened, when they should ask his ghost what would be inside.

When the magician died, and the safe was about to be opened, his younger friends all asked his ghost what was inside. First, each observing the ghost alone... and then all together. Alone with each of his friends, the magician's ghost would repeat the lie he told them before he died, but with all observing it together, the ghost was unable to answer the question straightforwardly... telling them it might easily be any of the possibilities he mentioned in life... or all... or none... until the safe was opened and the notes, revealing the nature of the magician's experiment, were read.
