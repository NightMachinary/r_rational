Idea: seance-based necromancy. Requires the corpse of the deceased, ideally fresh and not brain-damaged. *To produce the brain of the summoned ghost, damage in the brain of the corpse is corrected to match the memories of the people performing the seance.* People who know more about the person will be able to produce a more accurate ghost, but anybody can produce an accurate ghost of someone very recently dead with an intact brain. You could even do it without the corpse if your co-necromancers know the deceased very well, but the ghost won't be able to give you any new information.

This has the added benefit that you can correct somewhat for brain damage of the corpse and you can also retrieve information that the dead person knew but told no one in life. You would still have to convince the ghost to tell you the information. The ghost would not immediately know that it is dead, but it could probably deduce that from its memories of dying and its knowledge of necromancy.

This solves the observation problem: corrections to brain damage are based only on the memories of the people who are "participating" in the necromantic seance. Even someone who is blind and deaf might participate in the seance. Maybe you could even allow bootstrapping: a ghost participates in the seance of another ghost.

Combined with memory alteration magic, you could intentionally distort the ghost to answer your questions even if it's someone who would refuse: brainwash several people into believing that the ghost would be willing to answer any questions you ask but have no other beliefs about the dead person, then have them participate in the seance.

If you really get down to it you have to define what counts as "damage" and what counts as knowledge of the deceased but it should be well-defined enough for fiction.
