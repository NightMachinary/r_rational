What do these ghosts that aren't reanimated zombies interact with our world? Are they hosted on some tech? A weird shimmer in the air with a voice out of nowhere? What other laws [natural and gov.] are they subjected to/exempt from?

The 2nd method is an interesting problem. How DO ghosts know they are being observed. Have you looked into time delays on quantum states? I was under the impression that such states collapsed once any information reached an observer. Schroedender's cat is both alive and dead until information about either state reaches an observer. I would think the ghost then acts like the first person to observe it would expect it to act. At least, until that person stops observing it, then it would be the next person.

And now that I think about it, if the ghosts were visible [in addition to being corporeal] that could be an amazing game. Trying to work with your ghost pair to disrupt observation of others, slowly capturing all other ghosts. There would be stealth and violence and so much clever.
