A range limit would certainly be helpful, but I feel like it would be defined too arbitrarily.

I'm thinking that most of the time, neither type of necromancy will work on living people. With the first type, the brain can't be alive while it's being magically "scanned" because living brains are constantly active. They don't "sit still" long enough for the magic to work. With the second type, it might be impossible to create simulacra of people the participants know to be alive, because the magic relies on some unique quality of memories of the dead... or at least, memories of people you know you will never see alive again. However, it may be possible to create simulacra of living people from the memories of someone who thinks they died.

In fact, I was thinking of using this as a plot point in a detective-style story where a someone fakes their death. A necromancer is called to create a simulacra in front of the deceased's family and the murder suspects (this was in the days before controlled conditions were required by a formal legal system) and, no matter what he tries, it doesn't work. The necromancer says he must simply be performing the ritual wrong (this was also in the days before this type of necromancy's means of operation was common knowledge), and later has a simulacra created in front of each person individually, in order to find the one person who knows the death was faked.

In a similar vein, I don't think you could use type II necromancy to create ghosts of historical figures or fictional characters. It has to be someone the observers /actually/ knew in life. I suppose though, you could create a ghost based on someone's memories of a ghost based on someone /else's/ memories... and continue this chain indefinitely. But eventually, the ghost might be nothing at all like the person it was based on. I mean, how accurate can a memory of a memory of a memory be?

There are no natural necromantic phenomena. The magic required for necromancy isn't an "ambient" or natural aspect of the setting, it's more like a special way of doing something unnatural that was given or shown to mortals by a god (who may have to be channeled, invoked, or given offerings during the process), and passed down from generation to generation.

There are /lots/ of different types of magic that were given to mortals this way, each governed by its own specific principles and capable only of specific things. Sometimes each /type/ of magic is thought of as a "spell"... and some people (wizards) devote themselves to learning and documenting different "spells" from around the world, becoming competent at using many different types of magic. However *no single, comprehensive system* of magic exists. There is no set of universal principles within which new "spells" can be invented or old ones modified... at least, none that has been found yet. Some people (theoretical magicians) /are/ looking, but haven't had much luck.

Some types of magic are more flexible than others though. For example, type I necromancy can be used to simulate any system that processes information and "responds" to "stimulus" as long as the behaviour of that system can be inferred from its structure... It's not just limited to human or animal nervous systems. If your laptop's battery died, you could use type I necromancy to create a "ghost" of your laptop that would process information in the same way. I don't know if it could access the internet, and you definitely wouldn't be able to save files created on the ghost to your physical laptop, but you could use ghost to retrieve any information previously saved.

And yeah, well... it /is/ possible to create machines designed to be piloted by ghosts, but I don't think they have direct "ghost-machine interfaces" like they have for living brains... probably for the same reason ghost laptops can't access the internet. These still come in really useful though. There are some people, for example, who volunteer to have their ghosts pilot space-probes after they die. As I explained in other comments, brain-emulation ghosts are stored within objects (usually candles) and "played back" as those objects are burnt. So they can be sent into space and awoken by a mechanism that lights the candle once the probe reaches its location, then all they'd really need is a supply of oxygen. The same technique used in the laptop example could also be used to give probes more computing power than they could otherwise carry into space... though it would still only be useable as long as the candle burns, and couldn't store any information once the candle was gone for good.
