Ooh, cool.

I honestly don't think it matters overmuch if someone is looking through a telescope. Makes sense to me to just have a well-established range limit (a mile, say) and have it use all memories inside that area to construct the illusion.

(Incidentally, you could produce major historical figures with this, right? How about people who /aren't/ dead, or who the observers don't know are dead? How about people the audience knows to be fictional?)

It's not /entirely/ clear how flexible this system is (are these different "schools" of necromancy natural phenomena, or just the main necromancy-like applications of a modular spellcasting system?) Still, I'm really intrigued by the idea of "resurrecting" a damaged portion of someone's brain inside an implant, which is then connected to the still-living remainder of the brain to simulate normal function.

... actually, now that I think about it, this /does/ allow for "zombies" of a sort, doesn't it? Plugging a resurrected consciousness into a pre-existing (hopefully braindead or condemned) human nervous system is a great way to create what are effectively brain emulations/robots in this system without needing the requisite tech level.
