I'm thinking the ghosts created by both types of necromancy will be tied somehow to a flame.

In the first type, the immaterial copy of the dead person's nervous system is actually tied to an object, usually some kind of candle, and "played back" as it burns. They can be stored indefinitely (in an inert, non-conscious state) until the candle is burnt, and the candle can be extinguished and relit multiple times. (From the ghost's perspective, no time would pass in between their candle being extinguished and relit, they would seem to instantly jump into the future.)

In the second type, the memory-based simulation is tied to the flame itself, rather than the burning object, and can't be stored (since the simulation is really just a continuous illusion dependant on observers, without any actual "content" of its own).

I haven't given too much thought as to how either would interact with the physical world yet... perhaps they'd be able to control any air heated by the flame, making it vibrate in order to speak, and creating currents of it to move things? Maybe light from the flame and light passing through the air is "bent" or scattered somehow, in order to create an image?

Ghosts created by the first method would probably have all the legal rights of a person... a person with a very short lifespan... sort of. Extinguishing them against their will wouldn't be a big deal, since their candles can easily be relit and the ghost suffers no ill effects from this. On the other hand, /not/ extinguishing them when they wish to be extinguished (or making the object burn faster by introducing higher concentrations of oxygen) would probably be a serious crime, since it would mean forcing them to waste the precious little time they have left on something they don't want to. (This might not be a problem though, if they can control the air around the flame enough to extinguish themselves... like I said, I haven't worked out all the details of this yet.)

Ghosts created by the second method wouldn't have any rights at all, since they're not sentient themselves... just illusions created from the memories and expectations of people watching them. Their "testimony" however, is admissible in court, under certain circumstances. I mentioned before that this type of necromancy would be useful in murder trials, but there are potential problems with it that must be overcome. For one thing, a ghost may accuse an observer of their murder simply because that person knew they always hated them in life, and therefore expects the ghost to frame them. To avoid this, the circumstances of the ghost's death are not revealed to any of the observers, and upon an accusation, the ghost is questioned in detail about the crime scene and exactly how they were murdered. If the accusation is true, the ghost would "know" these details, because they really are being observed by the murderer (who would know these details as well). It is also necessary, therefore, to summon the ghost in front of each suspect individually, with a new necromancer and stenographer (also unaware of the details of the crime scene) each time... and in a controlled environment which ensures the ghost cannot be observed (and therefore influenced) by any outside party. (So... a locked, windowless, soundproof room, swept for bugs, basically.)
