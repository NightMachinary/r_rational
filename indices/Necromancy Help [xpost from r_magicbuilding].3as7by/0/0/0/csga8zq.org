So if all nearby observers (lets say 3) expect the ghost to behave fairly normally, but an additional observer is looking at the ghost through a telescope. He expects the ghost to run in place and communicate only in mono-syllabic grunts. If the distant observer cannot observe the ghosts mouth or otherwise know what the ghost is saying, how will the ghost act?

what if 2 more people (with the same beliefs) join the watcher?
