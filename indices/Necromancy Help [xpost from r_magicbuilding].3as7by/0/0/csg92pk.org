The second type of necromancy doesn't require the consent of observers. People will be able to see and hear the ghost whether they want to or not. The ghost will be confined to a certain area though... probably tied or a flame of some kind. I'm not sure how the distance of an observer would effect the spell. I don't think it would make much of a difference aside form the time-delay problem I mentioned before. I'm thinking that, even if an observer is too far away to hear the ghost, it will probably still say the sorts of things they'd expect it to, as long as they were watching it.
