It depends on what you want to do with the story, but for the first method, maybe use the caster's brain to fill in missing/damaged parts instead of a "generic" one. This would remove one magical element (what is a "generic" brain?) and add another set of munchkinable rules (How will the corpse respond to the neurotypical caster? The autistic one? The psychopath?)

  I need to decide exactly what constitutes "observation".

I have a physically grounded system that I came up with for a superpower idea that should work for this. Basically, you need to simulate a universe where the ghost does something different than in the real world, wait one second, then compare universes. Anything that is different was observing it. This also answers whether video links work (yes, if low latency) or observing from the moon (no, >1s reaction time), as well as negating the need for time travel with the observations, just have a 1s delay on /everything/, whether it's in the room or 0.49 light-seconds away.
