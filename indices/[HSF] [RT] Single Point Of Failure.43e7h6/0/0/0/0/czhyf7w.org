I agree that the complexity added by bringing in more people can be exceedingly dangerous, but even Snowden required the aid of intermediaries to help ensure success. Considering that you are likely to be brought down quickly anyway, even one other conspirator on the outside able to oversee the plan after you are arrested might greatly increase the effect of the initial breach.

That is also why I suggested bringing in incompetents or unquestioningly loyal subordinates to sabotage security: these individuals don't have to be in on the plan, but their lack of scrutiny might allow you greater freedom to act.
