I'm not sure if this is what you want, but [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/polyhistor-academy-original-setting-survival-quest.614/][Polyhistor Academy]] is a pretty good magic school survival fiction. Premise is that our MC is accepted to a top magical academy and is forbidden to leave or have contact with the outside world during his studies.

Only the top 10% of attendees graduate since the school is extremely lethal and student on student violence is encouraged. But those graduates get unlimited funding for the rest of their lives. Violence is usually swift and brutal, so there aren't many pulpy parts.

It is in quest format, I don't know if that's a dealbreaker for you. You'll also need an account to view it.
