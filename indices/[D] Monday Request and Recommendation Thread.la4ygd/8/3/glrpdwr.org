There's more than a couple of Worm fanfics, with varying degrees of rationality.

Here's two request threads linking all that I'm currently aware of:

[[https://old.reddit.com/r/WormFanfic/comments/ja44eu/trans_characters/]]

[[https://old.reddit.com/r/WormFanfic/comments/e9janu/lf_fics_with_trans_charactersthemes/]]

Also I loved [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/836450/Heaven_Will_Be_Mine/][Heaven Will Be Mine]], a visual novel set in a very much anti-rational universe. Not gonna say too much about the setting because slowly piecing together what's actually going on is part of the experience. Playing [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/435300/We_Know_the_Devil/][We Know The Devil]] before that might help, but there's only one egg in it, so it doesn't really fit your request.
