Trying to respond to tjhance's request for ratification with trans girl protagonist (had weird bug when trying this earlier)

[[https://pithserial.com]]

It is recommended on here pretty regularly. The main characters are trans girls (although cis and trans make a lot less sense as categories when you can swap bodies as easily as changing clothes), and it is general really well written. I haven't been keeping up with it for a while, but the first 6 arcs and the world building is great.
