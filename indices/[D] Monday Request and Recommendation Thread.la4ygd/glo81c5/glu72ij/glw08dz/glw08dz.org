The only thing I don't like about Octo is the protagonist's amazing unhurried pace during most of the story. I get that it's computationally bound and maybe it's an artifact of the writing but it feels like sometimes the MC is watching numbers go up for a million years.

The rest of it is great. Very nice sci-fi, feels plausible, interesting memetic hazard that I'm very curious about.
