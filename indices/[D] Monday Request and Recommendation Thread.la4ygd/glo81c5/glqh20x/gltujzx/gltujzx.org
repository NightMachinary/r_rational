Read both, BoC is I think the second best story (after super minion) I have read on RR so far (it is very rare for a story to keep up its quality like that tho, so this isn't as big a compliment as it seems) while I didn't really enjoy Cadence much, can't really tell what was the problem, it just didn't really interest me much, felt a little... Flat I guess.
