A rec and a request of more like it: [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39307/a-fine-octet-of-legs][A Fine Octet Of Legs]]

I have before asked for more non-human MC's (I especially like Isekai's into something which normally is antagonistic to the "people" of whatever world it is and the interactions that ensue) and this new series seems to be just that.

Others like this I have read: Shade touched, the snake report, super minion, beware of chicken, blue core, Tree of aeons, new life of a summoned demoness, a backwards grin, I woke up as a dungeon now what?, OOgway's little owl, queen of the swarm, I don't want to be the hive queen, Hyphen (pokemon FF), kumo desuga nanika?, and probably more I don't remember.

If anyone knows more like this I could kiss you!
