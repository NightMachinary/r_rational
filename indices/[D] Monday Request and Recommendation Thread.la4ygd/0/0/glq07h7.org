I just read this based on your rec last week. I enjoyed it while I was reading it: the writing was generally well-executed and it kept me engaged through most of the story. After finishing it I'm feeling like the payoff wasn't quite worth the investment, though. It really could have been cut by 1/2 without losing the good aspects of the story.

For what was mostly a qusi-rational story, it also really bugged me how lacking in curiosity the MC was. It felt like she did almost nothing to investigate much of anything, despite having direct access to angelic sources of knowledge that was literally unique among all mortals ever. For instance, for a work titled "Vacant Throne", the MC only bothered to even idly ask an angel where the occupant of said throne had gone /once/ and after being interrupted by a side-question from her mother, never bothered to go back to the question again. Especially given how long the work ended up going, it just started to seem weird how little she was interested in such incredible truths like 'where is God'. No one ever seemed to really think this was worth talking about.

Anyway, I'd give this a middling rec as well, but only if you have time to kill.
