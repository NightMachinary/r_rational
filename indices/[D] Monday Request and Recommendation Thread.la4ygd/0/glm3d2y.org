A few weeks ago I recommended [[https://tcthrone.wordpress.com/][/Vacant Throne/]] by towercurator since it was wrapping up. Well, last week the final chapter was posted.

It's a pretty fun story about a woman who gets isekai'ed by an angel to a magic world. She has to learn to survive in a new world infested with demons and magic beasts, learns magic from a princess semi-possessed by a dragon, and adopts a shapeshifter as her sister.

The writing was well-done, if a bit plain at times, and I can't remember any spelling/grammar issues.

The world-building was okay. Often it was more alluded to than shown. I kinda wish we saw more of the world instead.

The characters were decent. I felt like there wasn't that much growth with the MC, but the secondary characters did grow into their own as the story progressed. I liked how genuine the characters felt, though the MC could be a bit grating at times.

My biggest peeve would be the pacing. I felt like some scenes, that ended up not being all that important, were given too much focus.

The ending was pretty good. Though I felt there were a few plot-lines that the author had previously started developing that seemed like they were important but were abandoned, which was a shame. And while I wouldn't call the story highly-rational, but it was mostly rational, and the payoff at the end was worth the read.
