I'm going to give a recommendation for Queen of the Castaway Isle.

[[https://www.webnovel.com/book/queen-of-the-castaway-isle_14926175406224405]]

8 years ago a young women was stranded on a island with her family when her plane and one other crashed and the passengers weren't rescued for 8 years. Nasty shit happened there with numerous deaths from starvation, murders, cannibalism, sex slavery, and worse in a real lord of the flies scenario where there weren't any laws or consequences. The main character lost her siblings and now 8 years later is a broken and insane women debating whether she should kill herself after the people who killed her sister successfully get away with it because they all blamed her for the deaths and claim she is mentally ill. Which considering what she went through, she actually is. Then she has a weird nightmare and wakes up the day before her family left on on a plane. She now has a chance to save her siblings and get revenge. A well researched story on survival, mob mentality, and rational decisions. Also very well written characters and it seems to be almost complete.
