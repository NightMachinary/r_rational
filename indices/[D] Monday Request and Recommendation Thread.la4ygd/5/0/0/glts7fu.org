There is some supernatural issue around the island that is also responsible for another plane that her little sister is on that traveled a few hours before her on a earlier flight. She is only going to save her sister and just as importantly to hurt quite a few people. I wasn't lying when I said she was insane from her experiences and she somehow on some level is happy to be back on the island. She warned her brother not to go with her and he didn't believe her. But she had a single day to make a call to a lawyer for changes to her will, give her cousin some stock advice, and fill the max carry on luggage with useful supplies. There is something supernatural on the island that seems to very much want her back. So word of warning that it a Thriller/Horror novel.
