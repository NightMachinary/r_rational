I think if you have this (obviously uncommon) ability to exploit these tendencies, you should exploit them, and do something useful with the money. Not so much for the positive impact, but because, from my perspective, it seems likely you'd learn stuff, because both these areas and human psychology are actually pretty complicated. I'm a little less interested in the left vs. right stuff, and it's off topic here regardless, though it seems that BTC is more of a grey tribe libertarian thing, which I guess is right of some stances, but only at an angle. Gold is favored both by wonkish libertarians and more right-learning preppers, I think it's a more fair statement for that.
