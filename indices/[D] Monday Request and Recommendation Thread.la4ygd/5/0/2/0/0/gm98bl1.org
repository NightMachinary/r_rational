.. In full generality, what bitcoin is an example of is that the rightwing fringe of the english-speaking internet is just incredibly vulnerable to affinity frauds. Especially ones that flatter their self-percieved intelligence or insight - promise a secret knowledge or special insight that will make them rich or special, and in they pile.

Qanon, goldbuggery, bitcoin, gamestop, ect, ect, it is the same pattern over and over, and I could get rich by exploiting that /now/. I am not going to do so, because it is evil. Time-travel is not a necessary ingredient, so it is also not a very clever exploit of the situation.
