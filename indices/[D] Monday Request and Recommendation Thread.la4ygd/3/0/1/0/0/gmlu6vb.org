Sure. As far as quest-runners go, I can't recommend [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/search/12168838/][Rihaku's]] works enough. He has a way of writing that encapsulates that 'if you give Frodo a lightsaber, Sauron gets a death star' adage bandied about around here. For me, he hits this sweet spot of pulpy goodness while taking itself seriously.

I like all of his stuff, but here are a couple standouts. There's [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/bleach-quest-story-only-thread.283295/][Bleach Quest]], where the main character is Ishida from Bleach.

His [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/jounin-quest-story-only.244441/][Naruto-setting Jounin Quest]] is great, and complete.

I'd also point out his [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-odyssey-story-only-thread.257553/][The Odyssey]] quest, about a mortal in the world of Exalted . That's the sadly abandoned original, and [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/exalted-most-high.15728/][here's the equally sadly abandoned reboot.]] There's plenty of story there to get into before they patter out.

His other best stuff is his [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/rihakus-as-yet-unnamed-quest.312404/][Unnamed Quest]] which is an isekai, and [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/even-further-beyond-complete.45951/][Even Further Beyond]] which is a take on xianxia. If the actual quest participation is what you're after, he has an [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-simple-transaction-i.66727/][on-going one I haven't gotten around to reading yet.]]

I'm not a huge quest reader, actually, but I don't want to just recommend one person, so here's another couple: [[https://fiction.live/stories/Deep-Red/3Qk82fibaeXXuvJXm/home][Deep Red by kosm]] is an Avatar (cartoon, not movie) story about an OC oldest daughter of Ozai and Ursa. I think this is also abandoned, but I enjoyed what's there; except for the website it's on, which is a pain.

I also hear really good things about [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21188/forge-of-destiny][Forge of Destiny]], which started as a xianxia quest. I think the sequel is still being written in quest form somewhere. However, I have had it open in a tab on my phone for literal months now without getting past the first chapter, so you'll have to draw your own conclusions about it.
