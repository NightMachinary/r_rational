I'm interested in finding good stories set in a realistic school environment, particularly in the context of gaming the system. There obviously isn't a shortage of books set in high school or college, but most of what I see looks a little too... pulpy, I guess? It's also possible I just haven't looked hard enough, but hey! That's what the rec thread's for. [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29044.The_Secret_History][The Secret History]] is the closest example I can think of for what I'm after.
