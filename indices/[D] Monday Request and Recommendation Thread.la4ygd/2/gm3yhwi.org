If you haven't been reading Beware of Chicken on Royal Road, the story that in less than one month has unseated Mother of Learning as best-rated on the site, you should be.

It's updated daily, effuses ethos, and never fails to spur a smile.

The comment section can be quite funny as well.

- Oh, but the grammar is sometimes off. The author especially appears somehow chronically confused about whether it's it's or its. Reminds me of my smartphone's autocorrect autocorrecting every instance of its for it's.
