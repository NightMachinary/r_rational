It's clearly Lost by way of Worm, but the protagonist is so unlikable and repetitive it gets tiresome to read. Instead of using the siblings to provide a counterpoint to the protagonist, they're used as lackeys and underlings she can monologue to. It's not very self-aware. The chapter in which her and her brother browbeat their sister into being less empathetic made me lose interest.

I think it's trying to show morality is full of grey areas, but it very much fails at establishing this properly. Instead it's more like morality comes in 3 colors: The evil pedo rapist, the easily exploited and the "enlightened" cynics. Every wise character is an enlightened cynic, every nice character is easily exploited and everyone the protagonist dislikes is secretly an evil pedo rapist (and she knows this for a fact. There's an extremely graphic flashback to the aftermath of child rape that comes out of fucking nowhere).

Can't spell empathetic without pathetic! Amirite?

Spoilers ahead The concept itself is pretty cool. By calling it Lost by the way of Worm I refer to the fact the storm is clearly some supernatural alien thing isolating the people on the island and giving them superpowers via snakebite, for some reason. The timetravel seems tacked on, but the idea of Worm in an isolated survival scenario with a reduced cast is pretty good. The story would be better without the prepper porn of the first couple chapters. Her sister having gone ahead on an earlier flight is a blatant contrivance meant to keep her from avoiding the island. The way the family dynamic is explained later, it makes no sense for the protagonist to have allowed her to go alone even before she had the horrible life altering island experience. She's described as overprotective several times.
