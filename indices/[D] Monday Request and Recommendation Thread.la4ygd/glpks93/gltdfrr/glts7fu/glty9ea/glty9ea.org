It seems like if she put as much effort into finding alternatives to getting on the plane as she did into getting useful supplies, she'd come up with something better. Perhaps she could do her best to make sure that the plane gets found in weeks or months and not the 8 years it took originally, which would do more to help her little sister.

But if I were her, I would feel very, very motivated to think of reasons why it's a good idea to go back to the island where (1) I can also get revenge on the people who made my life hell and got away with it, and (2) I have more survival experience and preparation than anyone else there. Staying behind requires doing things she's not experienced at, relying on other people to help her, and definitely giving up on revenge.
