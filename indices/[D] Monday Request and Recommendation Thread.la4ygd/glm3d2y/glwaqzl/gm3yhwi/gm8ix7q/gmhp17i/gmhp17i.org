The comment structure of royal road is quite irritating. The culture of first is a pain but a natural outlet of the structure.

I think that while I enjoy the story it isn't shocking that it overtook Mother Of Learning. It isn't because the story is godly, it is because it has a niche audience and you know pretty easily from the description whether you like it, so there is no obvious source of negative reviews. Of course if it trends into Jin getting too involved with the world that will start the negative rating train.

RoyalRoad reviews are a bit annoying to me because they are primarily the product of genre partitioning. I could be wrong for sure but I don't think it takes into account the exposure.

Long running and widely known stories that are a bit broad genre wise are always going to fall behind hot new stories with very well defined tags and flags.

The Essence of Cultivation and The Perfect Run both have a mere 5 pages of reviews yet are in the top 5. Meanwhile Super Minion has 16 and Beware Of Chicken has 22. Mother Of Learning has a whopping 39.

Number 6, a pokemon fanfic has 9 pages. Is that story really the 6th best on the site?

I'd really love to see their formula.
