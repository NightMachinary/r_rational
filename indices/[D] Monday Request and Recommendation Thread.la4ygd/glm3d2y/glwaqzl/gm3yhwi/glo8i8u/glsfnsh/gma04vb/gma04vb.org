  Only the top 10% of attendees graduate since the school is extremely lethal and student on student violence is encouraged. But those graduates get unlimited funding for the rest of their lives. Violence is usually swift and brutal, so there aren't many pulpy parts.

Small correction. It isn't that only the top 10% of attendees graduate because the school is extremely lethal and student on student violence is encouraged. Rather, the school's lethality and student-on-student violence are /because/ only the top 10% of attendees are allowed to graduate, and anyone who doesn't make the cut dies or worse.
