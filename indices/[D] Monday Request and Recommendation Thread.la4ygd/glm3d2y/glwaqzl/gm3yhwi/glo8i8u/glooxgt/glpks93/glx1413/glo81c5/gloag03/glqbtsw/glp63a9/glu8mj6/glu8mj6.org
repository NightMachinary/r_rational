All Night Laundry has a transgirl as the mc's companion (although she's more involved, capable and focused on than the average doctor who type so idk if "secondary protagonist" fits better). Main character is also a lesbian too so that might nudge the queer representation over the bar for you. Story is really good, the epilogue just started up now, and overall plot/themes/visuals is like Homestuck with ~80% of the clusterfuckery cut out.
