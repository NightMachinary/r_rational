It might be borderline given your restrictions, given that it is fanfiction taking place just as the canonically teenage characters become adults, but *[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9131719/chapters/20750566][Love Novels]]* is the best romance I've ever read, and I feel obligated to list it here. Familiarity with Love Live is dubiously required, but I suggest you at least familiar with the premise and characters before reading. It has received gushing reviews from everyone who has accepted my recommendation so far. Just an extremely strong story.
