If you are back in time, and it is not a fixed timeline, bitcoin is not the best bet - it caught the imagination of the internet and became a bubble, a bit of butterfly effect, and someone on the right forum points out it cant do double digit transactions per second at the right time, and it never takes off. (Hell, I would personally be inclined to try and mock it out of existence by doing this, since it has been a huge net-negative for the world)

You want something where the core of value is set in stone by factors that happened /before/ the divergence point.
