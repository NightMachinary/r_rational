Two recs, both books, you didn't specify whether you were interested in books vs serials vs manga.

- Daughter of the Sun by Effie Calvin is technically the second book in her Ieflaria series, but it's completely standalone and unconnected to the first. (Later books draw connections between the plots.) Unlike the first, its characters are more adult.

- Daughter of Mystery (Alpennia #1) by Heather Rose Jones is historical fantasy that's super, super good. Well-researched, well-written, lovely romance, riffs on very classic plots and plot beats with a love of the genre and a willingness to do things better. Author is a linguist and it delightfully manifests.
