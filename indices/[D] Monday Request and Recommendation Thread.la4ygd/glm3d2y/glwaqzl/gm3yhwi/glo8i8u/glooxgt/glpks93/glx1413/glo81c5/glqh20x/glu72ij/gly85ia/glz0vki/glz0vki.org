I have listed Snake Report, Large chests I read for a bit but got a bit bored, and I don't enjoy human vs monster - I like humans too! I can try PH, but I generally don't like post-apocaliptic stories. I like humans to progress, and it just gives me a bad feeling reading about apocalypses.

Thanks though.
