Read this up to chapter 50 ish and will probably keep reading. In general, some interesting ideas here, and I'm a sucker for hypercompetent characters, so I've been enjoying it. Atmosphere and setting-wise, this feels a bit like LOST or those parts of Green Arrow where the protagonist becomes a supernaturally good killer by surviving in the toughest place through incredible trials--except that the protagonist has already become a psychopathic badass.

The only major faults I have with this story are all writing and style/prose related. On the basic level, text-speek spellings (like using "ur" instead of your) or plain misspellings sometimes slip in randomly where it makes no sense and the grammar is a bit wonky. At a higher level, the narration perspective is a bit off--it seems to be a 3rd person omniscient retelling by the protagonist with occasional and in-paragraph shifts to the insides of other people's minds. Generally not too difficult to keep track of, but sometimes confusing. In general, this gives slight ESL vibes (chapter titles look like they were force fed through japanese-english google translate) although that might just be the webnovel-weebery leeching in.
