Having read the initial chapters my understanding is that she doesn't stay home because her sister is already at the island, she doesn't think she can convince people of her knowledge, she doesn't know the location of the island(which is kind of weird) so can't send a rescue team. and having done it once and now being able to prepare she think her best bet of saving her sister is going to the island. Also she does in fact buy Bitcoin.
