Ever seen [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0454848/][Inside Man]]? It's technically a heist movie, but set mostly from an outside perspective. The mystery is who are the robbers, how they will escape, and what's their motive. You're given plenty of clues to guess these things by the end of the movie. It's fun.
