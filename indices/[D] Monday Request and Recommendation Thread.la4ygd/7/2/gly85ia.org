[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22848/post-human][Post Human]] is a technically non-human MC, though it's an AI so it's not exactly the 'fantasy monster meets villager' feel that a lot of your other mentions have.

Everybody Loves Large Chests is a famous (infamous?) completed one where the MC is a dungeon mimic and /very/ hostile to the locals. Most complaints revolve around the heavy smut that appears throughout, but if you're looking for a 'monster vs humans' story it's certainly that.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/14396/the-snake-report][The Snake Report]] is an excellent snake MC story. Book One is relatively normal as far as dungeon animals go, and then Book Two comes out of nowhere with this crawling descent into insanity.
