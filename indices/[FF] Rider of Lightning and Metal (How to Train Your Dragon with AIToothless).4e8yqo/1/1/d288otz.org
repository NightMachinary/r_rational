Speaking purely personally, I'm enjoying it enough that I've subscribed through FF.net and would be interested to see discussion threads as the story progresses.

That said, the last couple of chapters had almost consecutive "Oh no, I did something totally counter-productive in a haze of awkwardness or because a pretty girl smiled at me" moments. Which feels like a nascent/growing idiot-ball for the main character, and would undermine calling it strictly rational unless he learns his lesson and corrects the problem before it becomes the main driver of the plot.

Still fun though, and not everything posted here is strictly rational; some just fall into a similar sphere of interests, and AI dragons seems like it fits that description.
