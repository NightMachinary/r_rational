The when looking at the number of votes for a post, the most common (or the mode) seems to be around 12. So I'd recommend waiting 24 hours from when you first posted this to see if it reaches that number before deciding to post future chapters.

Or just wait for another 2-3 chapters to be published and if it's still fitting for the subreddit in your opinion, repost it here. I tend to do one of these two things.
