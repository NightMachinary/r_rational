I thought that Mud's Mission started out really strong but in the last 20 or so chapters the 'artificial intelligence' protag could have been replaced with any numbers of antihero litrpg protags both in terms of personality and actions taken. I don't know if it says more about Mud's Mission or about the antihero litrpg trope.
