Hello everyone, I've been lurking a bit on this sub and finally felt like I had a question worth asking. I would like y'all recommendation for stories where the main character is an AI or other such created intelligence. I has read two or three of those set in the Mass Effect universe, and they were glorious.

Finally, what are your favorite rational fics from a first person POV?
