Stoic fiction? Sometimes reading stoic advice is too much work, but Stoic characters make the most of the hard-to-optimize real world in an admirable way. It appeals in a similar way to ratfic, and I learn from it. I would read the hell out of Harry Potter and the doctrines of Stoicism.

So any Stoi!fic recs?
