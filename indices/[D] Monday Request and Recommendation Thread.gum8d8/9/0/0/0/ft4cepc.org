I'm about 40 out of 81 chapters in, and I'd say that's sufficient background knowledge for you to read and enjoy it. The general framework for Origin of Species is based off of the Kanto region which is the first gen of games along with Pokemon up to the fourth gen (Sinnoh region - Diamond and Pearl). Not all Pokemon are physically described as they appear so you might need to google what they look like as you read if you want a picture in your head.

Most of the major side characters like gym leaders are from the first gen so remembering who they are adds enjoyment. There are a few insider Pokemon culture jokes that might go over your head but I wouldn't let that stop you at all from reading. I highly recommend reading it, been having a blast with the story!
