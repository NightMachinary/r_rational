Recommending [[https://storiesonline.net/s/73545/island-mine][Island Mine]] by Refusenik. It's a completed Rationalist story about an alien artificial intelligence that crashes to Earth and makes contact with an ex-military college student, and the lengths that the government will go when you have something they want. It has a very "fight the power" feel, reminding me of Cory Doctorow's /Pirate Cinema/ and /Little Brother./ Overall it's very well-written, with a smart protagonist and a satisfying payoff.
