It's odd to me. It feels like continual improvement in numerical competence( and particularly level) is a key concept of litrpg and delve blatantly breaks it for chapters at end. Sometimes (though rarely) they have setbacks but I don't remember a lirpg that plateud in this way. I'm not saying it's bad, it's just really really strange.
