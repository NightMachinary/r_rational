Have you played the flash game called "No one has to die"? It's a very interesting take on time travel where your consciousness is transferred with a machine to a set time in the past and when you transfer into the past, you end up in a parallel universe but can't really know which parallel universe you jumped into. It involves brute forcing with a brilliant experiment to find out if the machine actually worked, time travel hell and discussion about said time travel mechanics. The gameplay isn't much and isn't that great, but it serves the purpose of narrating the story and the story is all that matters.
