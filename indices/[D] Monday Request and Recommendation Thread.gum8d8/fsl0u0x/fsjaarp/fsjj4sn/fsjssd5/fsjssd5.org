I have two recommendations, as long as you don't mind that they are not strictly sci-fi.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31919/muds-mission][Mud's Mission]] This is a fun story from the point of view of a mud Golem. The mechanics of it are treated almost identical to what you might expect from a robot, even going so far as to have "The three rules of Golemancy."

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion][Super Minion]] This one is from the POV of a biological weapon with a loose human personality framework stapled to it.. Less of an AI in the traditional sense, but it is still a constructed intelligence with underlying directives driving its motivations. Worth noting that this one has a tendency to vacillate between super campy and body horror.
