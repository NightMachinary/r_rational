Recommending [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26494/path-of-the-whisper-woman][Path of the Whisper Woman]]. It follows a girl who wants to become one of the right-hand women to their spooky goddess.

I'm recommending it here for two (and a half) reasons: The worldbuilding is done well, in that it's not just infodumping information on you, but is instead revealed organically; while the story is nominally about the viewpoint character's quest to become a "whisper woman", it's also largely about dealing with the psychological trauma of dealing with manipulative/abusive/narcissistic parenting, and so spends a lot of time examining thoughts and thinking processes and whatnot; reason one half is that I just think it's really good and ought to get more eyeballs.
