Shit, this atmosphere is so incredibly bleak.

Edit: Unless I'm missing something, this is a humanity that will never rise in any way beyond their current existence. That's the worst part. I thought UNSONG's setting was incredibly depressing for the same reason, when it was revealed that the night sky was only an illusion, that our dreams for space travel are already dead, that there is no other place we can go. And this story is even bleaker.
