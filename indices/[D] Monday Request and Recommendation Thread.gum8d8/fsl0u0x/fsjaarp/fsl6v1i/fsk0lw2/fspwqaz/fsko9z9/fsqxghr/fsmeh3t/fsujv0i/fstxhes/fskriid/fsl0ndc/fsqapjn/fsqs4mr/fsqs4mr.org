Random question: what's up with the capitalization of words in some rational fics, and rationalist writings more generally? (Or: am I completely making up this phenomenon?)

I can try to dig up examples if desired, but I have a strong sense that frequently Eliezer Yudkowsky writes sentences along the lines of, "Curing death would be Good", or, "It would be Madness to do artificial intelligence research without pondering the control problem".

Does this come from Terry Pratchett perhaps or something? Am I totally making this up?
