I found having [[https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page][the Pokémon wiki]] open on a side tab very useful. Personally I have played the first two cycles of Gameboy games as a child, but they were in German and most Pokémon have very different names in German. Not to mention the release of ~600 more Pokémon since I las touched any of the games.
