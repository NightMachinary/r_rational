[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Remains_of_the_Day][That book]]?

I'm not sure if it's "artsy" in the same manner, as I haven't read the novel, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15996890/chapters/37322936][Birds of a Feather]] has significantly more advanced prose than most rational fics. It's a Harry Potter fanfic, where Hermione is born in the 1920ies and somehow strikes up a not-friendship with young Tom Riddle, who becomes not quite as monstrous in his youth. They both attend Hogwarts eventually.
