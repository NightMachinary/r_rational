Similar to /Revelation Space/ I'd say. /House of Suns/ is distant future but has no FTL or much in the way of technobabble. /Pushing Ice/ is a bit harder as it's mostly near future, again no FTL, reasonable engineering extrapolations from current technology, and he did the math on most of the orbital mechanics.
