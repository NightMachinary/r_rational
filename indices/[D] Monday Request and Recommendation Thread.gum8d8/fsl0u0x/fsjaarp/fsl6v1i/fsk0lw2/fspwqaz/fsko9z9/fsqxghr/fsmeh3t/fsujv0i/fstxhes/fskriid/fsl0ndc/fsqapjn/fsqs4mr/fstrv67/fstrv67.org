Sometimes it is used to differentiate between descriptors and perceived universal laws. Think in terms of D&D; chaotic and Chaotic are very things, same with good and Good. Good is a fundamental property of the D&D universe that even the gods must adhere to, while good is just the opposite of bad. Capitalizing it refers to the platonic ideal of the concept rather than a specific instance of it. This is likely what most of what you're seeing from these sorts of writers.

More generally, it is making the word into a proper noun. The white house in your neighborhood is different from The White House, where the capitalized one refers to a specific, often famous version of the more generalized noun.

Also, as [[/u/Flashbunny][u/Flashbunny]] said, it might just be someone mistakenly capitalizing something. All nouns in German are capitalized, so Germans who learn English often have a hard time determining whether or not they're supposed to capitalize a word since it depends a lot on the context. I'm sure many other languages have similar differences in capitalization but I'm not as familiar with them.
