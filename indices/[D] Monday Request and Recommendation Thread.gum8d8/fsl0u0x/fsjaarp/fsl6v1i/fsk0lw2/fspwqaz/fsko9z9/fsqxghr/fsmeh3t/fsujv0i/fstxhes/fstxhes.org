What do you guys think of Pedestal and Pokemon: The Origin of Species? These are both pokemon fanfics I've been looking into reading. I saw pokemon in my childhood but never really understood it (since I didn't know english back then), so I'm kinda hesitant. How much canon knowledge do I need to know?
