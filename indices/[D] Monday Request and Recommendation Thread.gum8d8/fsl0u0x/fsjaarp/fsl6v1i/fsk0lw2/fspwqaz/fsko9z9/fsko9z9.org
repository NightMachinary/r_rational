YMMV but recommending [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelot_(musical][Camelot the musical]]) for anyone interested in a different media form than the usual - it looks like there's some [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGG0Z_JX_zk][Youtube recordings]] of a 1982 version. Not super-rational but has strong themes of fragility of civilization / rule of law which resonated with me a lot.
