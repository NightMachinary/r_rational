I've only seen the Hopkins film for The Remains of the Day, so I might be missing the mark. I'm guessing you might have read the first two.

/Kokoro/ by Soseki. Protagonist on vacation takes to a man he calls "Sensei" and slowly hears his story. Never finished it but the writing is great.

Murakami's /Norwegian Wood/. Also never finished but the writing is great.

The classic /Night on the Galactic Railroad/. Needs little introduction besides saying that it was more mature than I expected.

You might like the anime films of Shinkai Makoto. I never got into them much, but I didn't dislike /The Place Promised in Our Early Days/.

The visual novel /Symphonic Rain/. A somewhat complicated love story involving a young music student protagonist who sees a fairy that no-one else does, and his childhood friends and classmates. Excels at atmosphere.
