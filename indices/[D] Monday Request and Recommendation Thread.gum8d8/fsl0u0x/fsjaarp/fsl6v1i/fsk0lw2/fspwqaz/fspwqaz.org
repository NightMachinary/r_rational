I am looking for self insert litrpg/gamer fanfics that is not pure wish fulfillment. It needs to have a sense of survival showing that the SI wants to grind in order to survive the antagonists of the world. Fix-it is unrealistic they should make it a point to avoid confrontation and grind safely as possible. Gamer in south blue, a one piece self insert litrpg fanfic, makes a point in avoiding the main cast like the plague. I love it how the author always mentions that there is someone always stronger than him which makes a goal for the SI to surpass.
