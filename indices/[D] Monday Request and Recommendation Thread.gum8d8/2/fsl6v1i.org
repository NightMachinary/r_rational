If any of you are on SV or like quests at all, Rihaku is running a [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-simple-transaction-i.66727/][new one]] as of last month. I would call their writing style more “epic tone” than “rational”, but the whole thread argues about build votes and choice optimization quite a lot, actions tend to have strong actual consequences, and the payoffs tend to be satisfying, so if you like that sort of environment you should drop by the thread.
