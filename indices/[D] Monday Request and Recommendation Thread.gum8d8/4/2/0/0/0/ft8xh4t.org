Force without balance I haven't read and Decide i don't really like. The one with the most rationalist themes is probably a precise note (my hero academia), and I particularly enjoyed the first chapter of the sociopathy of Uchiha Sasuke. As long as you know the source material and enjoy pure dark edginess, the others are good too.
