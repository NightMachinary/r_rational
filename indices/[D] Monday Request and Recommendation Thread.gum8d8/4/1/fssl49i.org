Ar'Kendrithyst is pretty good about not being wish fulfillment, although a lot of it is slice of life. The main character gets powerful pretty quickly, but even now where he is regarded among the most powerful mages, it's pretty clear that he's missing a lot of the knowledge and power that other people at his station have. Highly recommend for its vibrant world and good characters.

The Paragamer has the mc get gamer powers in Worm. Good characterization and the author does a good job at making the character have the potential to be powerful, but still at street-level (so far). It's on hiatus right now, although what is there is pretty good.
