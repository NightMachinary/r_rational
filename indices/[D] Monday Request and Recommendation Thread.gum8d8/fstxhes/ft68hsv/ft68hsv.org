Honestly you don't need any for P:OoS. You might miss some predictable outcomes and some jokes like Oak scolding Red over the phone for biking indoors, and I suppose the lack of knowledge about the actual pokemon might be a little annoying, but nothing is really left unexplained so you won't be lost.

The real draw of the story, I think, is the quality of the character development and the talent the writer has for promoting a way of thinking without losing the feeling of genial broad-mindedness (after the early chapters at least).
