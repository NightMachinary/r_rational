I mean, if you liked Remains of the Day you're probably somewhat different than me, but on the other hand, you're asking for recs here...

/You/ by Austin Grossman is quite good. Um, I'd describe it by comparing it to Tad Williams' /Otherland/ crossed with the classic play-within-a-play gag and set as a nostalgic retrospective, but that's a bit of a niche reference.

Or if you want something more classic, Herman Hesse's /The Glass Bead Game/ is really good. The first section at least.

Iain Banks' /Feersum Endjinn/ was fun.

/China Mountain Zhang/ by Maureen McHugh actually isn't super literary from a prose perspective, but it's good, and it's about people.

Oh, and how could I forget Gene Wolfe's /Book Of The New Sun/. Literary out the wazoo.
