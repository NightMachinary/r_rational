Set in seemingly mundane modern day, Man learns that through unknown means he'd been implanted with an instance of an AI that lives within nanomachines mainly housed within his bones. The AI had been with him for years, learning to observe his brain state and perceive through his senses but unable to communicate with him, but has just become able to do so through freak chance. And because this protocol of non-communication has been broken, this instance of the AI and the man must work together to survive or else they will both be destroyed.

Generally rational approach to intelligence gathering regarding the various threats and mysteries, in terms of what the heck is going on and how do you protect yourself from threat when facing the reality of such a gross invasion.

I will note that the first few chapters include some pretty extreme body horror (self-mutilation), but that this aspect tapers off significantly after that.
