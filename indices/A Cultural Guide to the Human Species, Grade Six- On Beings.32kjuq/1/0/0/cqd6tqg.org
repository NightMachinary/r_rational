  The Intergalactic Commission has artificial intelligence, but since these things were created, they are considered an extension of their makers. So if the humans in this story had created an AI that outlived them, the IG would consider that AI a non-Being extension of the Being humans, thus only entitled to a few Being rights.

This seems to contradict the article. The article states a being is something which satisfies four conditions, and none of them are "was not "created"". It could be that those conditions are necessary but not sufficient, but it reads like they are supposed to be.

I would also wonder why human reproduction does not count as 'creation', while a human building an AI which self-modifies and builds an AI which builds a robot which builds a robot which receives a copy of an AI which builds a robot which builds a robot which receives a copy of an AI does count as 'created by a human'.
