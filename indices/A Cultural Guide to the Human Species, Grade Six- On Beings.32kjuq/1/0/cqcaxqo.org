All of these questions have answers (even if I only just thought of the answers) but for now I'll answer the robot question, because I can't see it coming up in the text.

The Intergalactic Commission has artificial intelligence, but since these things were created, they are considered an extension of their makers. So if the humans in this story had created an AI that outlived them, the IG would consider that AI a non-Being extension of the Being humans, thus only entitled to a few Being rights.

Unfortunately for all of us, this is a textbook about humans, not extraterrestrials. As evidenced by the Thirona Mistake, the IG government has different values than humans, who would unquestionably call it genocide.

Thanks a ton for the feedback! I've had trouble getting comments on my writing so this means a lot.
