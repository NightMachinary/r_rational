Heh, mistranslations.

Ooh, so this is an explicitly /legal/ distinction that gets reified a bit by philosophers. Interesting.

  Humans even feared that their ROBOTS would kill their creators for some reason.

Has... nobody ever created an artificial Being? Are there no serious differences of values between species (one species that eats their young and another that values protecting children, for instance?) Are there truly no interspecies wars or slavery (excepting the Thirona)?

  EARTH animals with one or more traits of Beinghood have been described in human records. Why do you think they are not considered full Beings?
#+end_quote

Could be the lack of records, but there are exceptions - not sure how spotty their data is. (I believe both whales and great apes should qualify IIRC.)

However, I'm guessing that it's because none of them ever applied to the Intergalactic Commission; the Travellers Paradox issue would make no sense if you were considered a Being /before/ you had a technology base.

EDIT:

#+begin_quote
  Some schools of biology even theorize that onecan predict whether an animal will evolve into a Being by whether that animal can lie, thus purposefully masking its own thoughts.

  Asub-traitof this is theability to imagineand conceiveof the future. Although it is nota necessary requisite for Beinghood, all known Beings are future-cognitive.

I wanted to complain that these are present in pretty much all animals ... but then I realized that /animalia/ is the only genus I know about that produced Beings IRL, so that actually makes perfect sense as a distinction made by aliens dealing with multiple such extraterrestrial genii. This stuff is really good :D
