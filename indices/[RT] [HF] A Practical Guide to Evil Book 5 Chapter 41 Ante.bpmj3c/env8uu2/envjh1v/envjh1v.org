  Cat will be an exception only if she actually manages to achieve something long term - like boxing up the Dead King or achieving the Liesse Accords. Otherwise she goes next to all the other entertaining people who massacred thousands for no reason.

What are you talking about, she already saved thousands of people! She stopped Akua---though she was unable to save Liesse itself she did manage to stop the superweapon from tearing up the rest of Callow and Calernia, she prevented William from mind-controlling an entire city, she stopped a Fae invasion into Calernia, /hell/ she saved an entire race from being genocided by the Dwarves!

You could even say she did what William could not and liberated her homeland from occupation by the Dread Empire with a lot less bloodshed and deaths than he would have caused, as well as stop his foolish doomed rebellion in its tracks---though of course this is muddled seeing as she was responsible for that in the first place.

Sure the peace in Callow is now solely maintained through her as a person and not through any institutions that will survive beyond her death, and if she were to die now then yeah Callow will probably return to being a place of slaughter and foreign occupation, but let's not claim that everything she did up until now was worthless. She saved a /ton/ of people already.
