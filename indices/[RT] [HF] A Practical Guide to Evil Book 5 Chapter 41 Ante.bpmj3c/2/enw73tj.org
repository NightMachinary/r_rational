I thought the build up of Cat internally trying to decide whether to reveal her plan was more about the Liesse Accords. It took me a couple of paragraphs after Archer popped up to realize that was all she was going to reveal in response to RS's question, and then I had to reread to really enjoy the part with Archer in it.

Also, Saint of Swords is coming around on Cat, even if she has to be dragged into the new opinion by Pilgrim and Rogue Sorcerer. It's going to be real painful when Cat has to choose between upholding the image of herself as a Noble Villain Dedicated to the Preservation of Life that she's built up and getting everything she wants. Not sure if she'll have to trade the few steps she's taken to being trusted enough to present the Accords in good faith for Masego, Black, or some other thing. I'm not sure whether she'll make the trade when the chance comes, either. Is there anything so valuable to her that she wouldn't give it up for a better chance at getting signatories to the Accords?
