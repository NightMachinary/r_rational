Sure, but to be OK with something due to its lack of potential harm to you requires that you believe it to not have potential harm to you.

Saint knows that Cat is planning her death. Saint knows that Archer is not planning her death. Archer's statement places the current venture solidly in the latter's court, so it's not a threat.

So basically I take this as evidence that Saint's antipathy towards Cat isn't stupidity or lowercase-e evilness; it's ... wisdom, really. Sense Motive.
