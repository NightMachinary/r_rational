Hot take: Saint is completely right that Cat is playing them and has basically a con running. (We may or may not know what the con is yet.) And Saint can tell!

Indrani, on the other hand, has no cards up her sleeves. And Saint can tell. And you know what? Saint is 100% fine with this part of the plan, is 100% fine with Archer, not just because it's a Heroic story, not just because d'awww, but because Indrani isn't playing a con, and Saint can work with that.
