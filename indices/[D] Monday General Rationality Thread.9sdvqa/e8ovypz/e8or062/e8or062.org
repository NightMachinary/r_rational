So, I'm reading through a worm fanfiction known as Memorial and at one point in the story, Taylor begins using her insects to form an array telescope which greatly increases the range she can observe things from. Can someone explain how this would work or why it wouldn't given her abilities? I'm just not seeing how you can get telescopic vision from looking through bugs.
