I've also been re-reading Pratchett lately, specifically through the lens of this [[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/24/terry-pratchett-angry-not-jolly-neil-gaiman][interview with Neil Gaiman]] about his writing being motivated by anger. Lately I've been finding myself drawn to reading things that are written with a certain end goal in mind, which I think is a great way of describing a lot of rationalist works as well as Pratchett's works. Pratchett's stuff is often satirical in bent which I think is an interesting counterpoint to rationalism.

My other suggestion for older fiction or sci-fi that provides interesting insight would be Douglas Adams. The Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy, while certainly not rationalist in any way, still is a very insightful look into the human condition. In many ways, I think it's a argument against the nihilism that seems to have seeped into public discourse. Adams' work is all about a simple man working his way through a series of fantastical and terrible events while maintaining his humanity throughout, and I find myself really empathizing with Arthur Dent all throughout.
