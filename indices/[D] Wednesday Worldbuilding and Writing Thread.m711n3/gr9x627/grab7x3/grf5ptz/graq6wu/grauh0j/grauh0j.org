Kyesomas only affect their own body, can't magically turn or position the baby or anything like that. But since they have an extrasensory ability to sense their womb and child, they can easily see if the baby is turned around or in a perilous position. And because of that sense their knowledge of pregnancies would be very advanced, better than ours in many ways.

Edit: to be clear, they can affect the fetus's body in many ways, just not magically move it to prevent a breech birth or cord strangulation.
