Maybe? But we really don't understand what the signalling or mechanics are for babies to come out of breech (which usually happens around 38 weeks), there are just too many components firing in contradictory-but-somehow-it-all-works ways all over the systems in question. Obviously if this is a fantasy novel you can just handwave it with "things don't work that way"; maybe the signalling pathways for stuff don't work via hormones et al traveling in the bloodstream, maybe they work via waggley-fingers magic.

But I'm a strong believer that anytime you diverge from how things work in our world you should be doing it on purpose, so I figured I'd bring this up.

Also, there's a real tradeoff with head/shoulder size but it's not the only thing that gates gestation time. Fetuses run out of certain resources and start emitting "okay I'm ready to bail" hormones, which shifts the balance towards onset of labor, as one example.

(Kyesomas would never get some of the horrifying stuff like having the placenta implant in a way that blocks the exit, and wouldn't that be a relief. Placenta previa is, uh, bad news! Pretty close to "guaranteed mortality without surgical intervention" levels of bad news!)
