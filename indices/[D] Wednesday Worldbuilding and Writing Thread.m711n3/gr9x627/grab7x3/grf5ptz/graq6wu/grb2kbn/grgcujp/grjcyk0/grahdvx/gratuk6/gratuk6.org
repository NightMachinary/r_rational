  wouldn't some kyesoma see it as a chance to train their powers
#+end_quote

Absolutely. I imagine kyesomas as a whole would initially have a very dark reputation, witches who sacrifice unborn children and so on. But eventually the sheer utility of their power would basically cause a nation that banned it to be at a severe and undeniable disadvantage. Kind of like the advent of gunpowder and chilvalry and bushido and so on, reality doesn't care about your closely held customs.

  a story that says "these women are powerful because of their uterus" is already easy to veer into transphobic territory, or pro-relgiious conservative territory.

No more than a story about a particularly strong guy is transphobic to FTM guys because they naturally have less dense bones and muscle mass. Or just a story about a pregnant woman, for that matter. But I realize it's a fraught subject, so let's just agree to disagree.
