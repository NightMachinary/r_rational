So, it sounds like her powers are that, insofar as her own children go, she can give them the benefit of several generations worth of selective breeding... in a /single/ generation.

You say that she gets to choose which parent's traits get passed on. I assume that means that she cannot introduce traits that /neither/ parent has; if neither parent has the gene for red hair, she can't bear a red-headed child. But she can easily /eliminate/ some heritable gene, and tune some others.

So if, for example, there is some genetic disease that crops up occasionally, this disease will never crop up in a Kyesoma's child. This instantly suggests a division into the Pure (children of Kyesomas, and children of two Pure parents) and the Impure (everyone else), where only the Impure have any chance of getting genetic diseases (or, at least, genetic diseases that correspond to known codes). Given that a given Kyesoma will probably be having as many children as possible, so as to magnify her influence, it won't take many generations to have a large population of Pure people - especially if the Pure are widely considered the superior beings.

It also suggests that the genetics of distant tribes may diverge with frantic speed (compared to our world). One tribe may value height and speed, while another favours short, stocky strength - and in a mere generation or two, the members of each tribe will be /visibly/ different. /Especially/ the Pure members of each tribe. (Which may lead to conflict, as each tribe assumes that the other tribe's Pure are actually Impure...)
