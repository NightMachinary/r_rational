I'm working on building a map that might be easier to build if I were pulling approximate data from real-life GIS systems, so two questions:

- What is your favorite city built in glacial fjords? I'm looking for interesting terrain, high contrasts of elevation, and big buildings.
- Are there any examples of cities built in the crevasses where rivers from a high plain erode the plain down to the ocean level, and the shoreline is a mix of cliffs and eroded plain?
