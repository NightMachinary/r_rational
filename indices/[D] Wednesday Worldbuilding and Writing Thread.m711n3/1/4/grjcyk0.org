One trick the comments here seem to be missing is that kyesomas can infer some stuff about alleles without knowing anything about what they code for, and select statistically "better" traits even if you'll have no idea of in what ways. Firstly, they can observe that generally being heterozygous is better than homozygous, and select "anything that isn't identical" for every gene that is possible. This might have effects similar to a "negative amount of inbreeding" or hybrid vigour. Secondly, over multiple pregnancies they can memorize the traits of previous fathers, and if a later one is inferior to a previous one they can where possible try to match what they had.

There's also another trick they can use to figure out /some/ stuff about what traits correspond to what, if in a much weaker and more statistical form than experimentation by starting pregnancies with many different men, memorizing the codes that are not their own in each case, terminating the pregnancy before it incurs any costs, and comparing the memorized codes to the observed traits of the man. This can also be combined with the second trick.
