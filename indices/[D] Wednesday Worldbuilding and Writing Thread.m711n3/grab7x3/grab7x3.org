A magic system I thought up. Feedback welcome.

Bloodline mages, also called kyesoma, are women who have the ability to alter the development of a child growing in her own womb. This would be set in an alternate fantasy world where genetic heritability is overall very similar to our own, but abstracted the closer you look. In this world:

- There are no genes or chromosomes, a person will simply have a collection of active and passive traits, which a keysoma sees as a type of code.
- There is no instinctual knowledge of what code corresponds to what specific trait. This is something that they would have to painstainkingly develop the understanding of, mostly by trial and error.
- It is physically impossible for conception to occur without physical, penetrative sex.
- Artificial insemination is impossible, as well as anything in vitro, and no manipulation of a person's 'traits' is possible outside the womb.

A Kyesoma can choose whether she gets pregnant or not. She can deny pregnancy with a 100% certainty, but inducing conception is considerably lower and depends on the woman's particular skill level.

Starting with conception, a skilled bloodline mage can choose which parent's traits get passed on to the developing embryo. Making a clone by choosing only 1 parent's traits, for example, is theoretically possible but impossible at current skill/knowledge levels, as the opportunity for even a greatly skilled kyesoma to exert her power over traits is greatly limited by time. Consequently Kyesoma tend to use this limited opportunity to first prune out any obvious undesirable traits, and the remaining time to select for any particularly desirable traits that matches her intentions for the child. A Kyesoma belonging to a warrior clan will select for size and speed and endurance, while that of a political clan will select for attractiveness(facial symmetry, clear skin, etc). Any changes she makes at this point will be genetic as we know it. That is, heritable traits that the altered child will be able to pass on to their own children.

The second part of the Kyesoma toolkit happens during the fetal stage, where she can affect the fetus's development by closely monitoring its growth and nutritional intake and providing everything it needs as it needs it. She can also subtly manipulate what we would call gene expressions, which we know to affect a person's mental/emotional disposition as well as their future physical potential. Kyesoma babies are always born big and healthy.

(A good example of gene expressions in our world is how, despite the Dutch presently being the tallest people in the world on average, because of a famine during world war 2 every child born from during that famine tended to be extremely short, even if they had perfectly good nutrition after they were born. Another one is that the chance of one having a mental illness is increased exponentially if your mother was put under heavy emotional stress during pregnancy).

The last facet of a Kyesoma's ability is expressed during labour, where she can induce labor on herself at will, dilate her uterus, and etc. Basically have an all around easy and complication free birth every time, no major risks.
