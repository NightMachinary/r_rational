Some interesting ideas.

#+begin_quote
  she cannot introduce traits that neither parent has
#+end_quote

correct.

#+begin_quote
  this disease will never crop up in a Kyesoma's child
#+end_quote

they would have to track down what part of the code(I need a better name for that) corresponds to the disease, but yes, that's true.

#+begin_quote
  genetics of distant tribes may diverge with frantic speed
#+end_quote

My idea is that the kyesa skill would naturally spread quickly throughout a society, as the main advantage in the initial stages would be just increased fertility and reduction in child/mother mortality(I say just, but it's very significant in a low tech world). In that sense for the ability to provide a relative advantage over a rival nation it would need to be spread far and wide among all the women. And even if they tried to restrict it, the skill has a very low barrier to entry and a basic version can be easily shared and taught.

It would only be later that the cumulative, generational nature of the skill would show, as it would require a long time to discover what code corresponds to what trait, especially if the more important and desirable traits were partly epigenetic or something akin to a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygene][polygene]], like a multipart, non-contigious code. In that case it would be extremely difficult to conclusively select for the more complex traits purely by trial and error. It would require a generational effort of observing correlation and painstakingly establishing causation.

At this level I think it's inevitable that social stratification would occur, like you said. Families or nations would hoard the knowledge of which codes correspond to which trait, and would eventually come to exhibit an increasing divergence from the more ignorant masses as generations pass, although hidden pitfalls might occur if they inbreed too much. Maybe [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosis][Hybrid Vigour]] would be a thing in this world too, hah.

One societal consequence that I think would be inevitable given these conditions is that women would become increasingly valuable for their skill as a kyesoma to their own family, and would quickly no longer be "sold off" to their husband to join his family. Which means a natural transition to matrilineal family inheritance, where a male's heir wouldn't be his own children, but his nephew by his sister.

And inevitably, some sneaky women are going to try to overturn the patriarchy by breeding daughters to be smarter than their sons or something, so you would have matriarchal dynasties popping up in some places, and as a reaction strict controls over kyesomas to prevent it in others. Interesting stuff, but it wouldn't happen immediately, not until after hundreds of years of experimentation with the skill.
