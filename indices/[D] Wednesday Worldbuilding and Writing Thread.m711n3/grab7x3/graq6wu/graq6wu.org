  The last facet of a Kyesoma's ability is expressed during labour, where she can induce labor on herself at will, dilate her uterus, and etc. Basically have an all around easy and complication free birth every time, no major risks.

There's a lot more to labor than induction and dilation. Is your intent intent that they can act on their own body (dilate, induce) or both their body and the fetal body (fixing breech positions, making sure they don't get twisted around the cord, monitoring nutrient levels, there's a long list of this stuff)?
