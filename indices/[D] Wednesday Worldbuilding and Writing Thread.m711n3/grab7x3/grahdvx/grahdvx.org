If any kyesoma discovers a fetus is developing as male (could they easily modify gender development by the way?), given how core being a kyesoma likely is to her sense of self and values system, wouldn't some kyesoma see it as a chance to train their powers rather than prioritise the welfare of the fetus? It seems like powers based around pregnancy can very quickly end up ethically horrific to an outsider looking in, even before adding the real world baggage that gets dragged up with all that (abortion laws, death/permanent injury of the mother rate in childbirth process, laws about parenthood recognition and support especially with queer parenthood, the way all that ties in to the status and treatment of women). I mean a story that says "these women are powerful because of their uterus" is already easy to veer into transphobic territory, or pro-relgiious conservative territory. And even if nothing bad or objectionable is intentionally written in, its an easy breeding ground for reader interpretations of that nature. Also attracting a bunch of pregnancy fetishists to the story sounds like a hassle.

Edit: If a kyesoma could work on other women (with the innate difficulty of only sometimes being in contact with them the only barrier) you'd at least address some inequality stuff and promote empathy within kyesomas to help mitigate some of the worst case scenarios of a more power-orientated world view for kyesomas
