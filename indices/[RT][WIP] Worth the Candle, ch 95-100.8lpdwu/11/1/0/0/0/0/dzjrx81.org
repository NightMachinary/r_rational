That Everflask entad is actually such an overpowered cash cow, I mean it's not like they're strapped for cash now, but the most expensive bottle of wine ever sold was worth $200k. And that's just ordinary wine, imagine some magical wine made from unicorn blood that restored youth and gave you powers or something, some insane drink like that probably exists and would be worth millions of obols. And you could make one of that, every day.

Booze OP, plz nerf.
