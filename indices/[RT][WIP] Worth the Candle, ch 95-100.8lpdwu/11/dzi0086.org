Well Bethel is more than a little overpowered. So presumably she's a regenerating mobile tank, plausibly one that can be carried around, with nigh-infinite resources, a time machine and rather absurd magical weapons.

I am struggling to think of a good get-rich quick scheme, though, because presumably the value cap on backpack retrievals still counts even though the size limit could otherwise include planes (or smaller houses). Just magic-ing up libraries, clothing, etc. is the smartest idea I've had so far, which is pretty weak since selling things takes time and just having bars of gold would short-circuit so much. Maybe trying to find jewelry with some quantity of gold (to be melted for its components), and flooding the room with that? Would make being a gold mage pretty fun. Any better ideas?

--------------

EDIT: Here are some solutions.

1. Drink some gold. The Everflask will then produce that quantity on a daily basis. 100ml of gold is 2kg, or $80k at our prices. More importantly, that's a lot of gold for a gold mage: 700kg per year.

2. Bethel seems to have extremely high fidelity in what she can do, and Fenn's He-Man skit shows the backpack creates things in precisely controlled positions. Thus although you might not be able to pull a car out of thin air, it seems you should be able to pull all of the /pieces/ of a car out in the appropriate place at the same time. Voil√°, instant megafactory.

3. EDIT: [[/u/CaptainMcSmash]] gives another great solution: try using the Everflask to summon unicorn blood.
