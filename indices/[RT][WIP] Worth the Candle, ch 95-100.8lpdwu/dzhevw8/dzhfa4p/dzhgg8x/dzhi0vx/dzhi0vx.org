In terms of time or word count?

Word count actually gets entered into a spreadsheet, and it's currently ~1,890 words per day for the month (higher, if you include work on stories other than this one).

Time is a little harder to figure out, but usually a minimum of two hours a day, and a maximum of six, though I'm often doing other things while writing. If it's an average of four hours a day, then I guess that would be close to a hundred hours, but a lot of that time is spent with split focus (e.g. trying to sneak in some writing while my son is playing with his trucks, or going back and forth between writing and breaks on reddit or Youtube). There's probably some kind of productivity tracker I could use, but I try not to sweat that stuff too much, because getting in a "I have to write X words over Y hours" mindset isn't great creatively, at least for me.
