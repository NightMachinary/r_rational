Yeah, it's ~32K words, which is more than I would typically like in one go, but I try to make the chapter dumps follow logical transition points in the story (above and beyond the transition points that differentiate chapters). I think it helps make the thing read better, as well as helps me ensure that relatively atomic chunks of story are internally well-put-together.
