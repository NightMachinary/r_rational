So...I'm going to assume that the House of God (or at least god-in-training) doesn't have a soul, which means she'll likely have unique companion passives, like Valencia.

Anyone's guesses on what she'll have? I'm thinking something related to her core power, maybe the ability to regurgitate entads she doesn't want, or draw on nearby entads without eating them.
