You could do all sorts of fun things with a window into the chamber. Slowed time bends light the same way gravitational lensing does. When light changes speed abruptly, part of it gets reflected. I wonder if we would see a similar effect?

Is the time chamber effectively a white hole in the sense that it bends light away from it?
