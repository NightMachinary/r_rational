/Some/ technology from Earth still works in their world. We have no idea about the vast majority of it. The issue for me is that I am coming from a scientific standpoint of "I don't know"; I don't know why revision magic seems to treat light differently; I don't know why velocity wards allow light through; I don't know whether radio waves are caused by accelerating charges. I am happy to believe things around the edges of what we've observed, but I'm not going to take leaps I have not justified.
