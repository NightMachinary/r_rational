Technology from earth still works in their world. The thought experiment of a photon clock (and electromagnets working properly) forces relativity to apply to it to some degree. The speed of light being finite is a requirement for the existence of radio waves if they are produced by accelerating charges.

Photon clock would solve whether it is the black hole kind of time diation or the high velocity kind; the black hole kind bends light, the other one doesn't necessarily.
