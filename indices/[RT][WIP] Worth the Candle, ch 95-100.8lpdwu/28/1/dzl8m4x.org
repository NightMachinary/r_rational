  How dangerous is a four weeks early pregnancy?
#+end_quote

On 21st century Earth, not dangerous at all. The baby should easily be developed enough by then. The limit on viability is about 24 weeks, which is 16 weeks early.

On Aerb with a mixture of Earth tech pulled from the backpack...hard to say. Might need to do a caesarean, since labor isn't starting, but that should be within their capabilities.
