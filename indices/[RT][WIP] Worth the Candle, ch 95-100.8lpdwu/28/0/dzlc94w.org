  Quick question: wouldn't Bethel be able to detect whether the baby has a heartbeat, stuff like that?
#+end_quote

By that point in the pregnancy (~35-36 weeks), you'd be able to hear a fetal heartbeat using a stethoscope, which Amaryllis has presumably already done (or she would have mentioned not being able to hear a heartbeat). The worry isn't so much that the baby is dead, more that there's something seriously wrong that hasn't made itself known yet, and won't until (still)birth.

  How dangerous is a four weeks early pregnancy?

Depends on the specifics. The biggest risk for premature babies is usually the lungs, which are one of the last important things to develop, and one of the reasons that you often see premies with breathing masks or intubation. Other than that, there are infection risks from under-developed immune systems, digestive problems from under-developed intestines, and other, somewhat less common issues. Infant mortality for "late preterm" is about three times higher in the US/UK, IIRC.

Premature preterm rupture of membranes gives something like 1/50 chance of infant death (in the United States), with a whole host of other complications also possible. It's left unstated how long Amaryllis has waited after her water broke to see whether she would go into labor, but the longer you go without going into labor, the higher the risk (depending on the specifics, they'll either use steroids to help promote lung growth and antibiotics to fight infection, or they'll induce labor if it doesn't happen on its own).

(Note: I am not a doctor, but neither are the characters, so hopefully it's okay if they make the occasional mistake here.)
