I'm not sure what wants or needs Ropey might have. The usual food, clothing, and shelter don't apply. He spends plenty of time with people, and could easily start conversations if he wanted to - so presumably socialisation, at least with humans, isn't important to him. His bodily integrity isn't threatened; the party wouldn't willingly damage him any more than anyone else sentient.

Overall, it seems unlikely that he has unvoiced complaints.
