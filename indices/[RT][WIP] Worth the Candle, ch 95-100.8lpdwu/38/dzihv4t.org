How did Grak and Amaryllis get food when they left the backpack outside from the time chamber? I could see how they would be able to store most of the things they would normally need inside Sable, but food would still go bad. Anything they ate at the end would have been a month old at least. They could have done it, but it's the kind of thing that I feel like they should have given up the backpack before going into the chamber.
