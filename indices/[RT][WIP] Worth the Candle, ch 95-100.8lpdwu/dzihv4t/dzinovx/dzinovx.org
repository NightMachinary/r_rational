  I could see how they would be able to store most of the things they would normally need inside Sable, but food would still go bad.

There are food preservation techniques that can make food last for years. Canning, dehydration, freeze-drying... just grab a month's supply of cans from the backpack and don't forget the can opener. Or grab a month's supply of MREs and cup noodles and you won't even need the can opener. Plus, there is always the old standby of storing raw grain; humanity would have never gotten past the stone age if we hadn't been able to store enough food for a month.

Incidentally, this pissed me off about /Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows/. They can /duplicate food/ but they are starving to death and +stealing+ forcibly buying eggs? Come on. How hard would it have been to walk into a Muggle supermarket, buy a few cans, and duplicate all the food they could eat? If they don't have Muggle money and they feel bad about stealing, sell off a Galleon at a Muggle pawn shop first. Problem solved.
