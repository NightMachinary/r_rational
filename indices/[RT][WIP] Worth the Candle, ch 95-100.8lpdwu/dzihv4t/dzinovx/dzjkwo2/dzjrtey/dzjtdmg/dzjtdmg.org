Pretty sure you still can't duplicate it. The actual quote is...

#+begin_quote
  â€œIt's impossible to make good food out of nothing! You can Summon it if you know where it is, you can transform it, you can increase the quantity if you've already got some-"
#+end_quote

I take 'increase the quantity' to mean making food much larger, like we see in the second year with the Engorgio charm on pumpkins, which seems to have some reasonable limit since we don't see mountain-sized pumpkins.

However duplication is a different beast. The only two things we know that are exceptions to /Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration/ are food and money. And the only time we see the duplication charm in action, we're specifically informed that it doesn't circumvent Gamp's Law and that the duplicated items are still worthless (eg, duplicated items are significantly different from the originals).

It seems straightforward to me that duplication is a transfiguration type spell (since we would otherwise have to posit an additional fundamental law of magic to cover money twice over), and thus it also doesn't work on food.

Also, I know Harry Potter characters are dumb, but they aren't so dumb to literally starve if they could just just magically duplicate food. Especially because they specifically /are/ using magic on the food already to make more of it and make it more appetizing.
