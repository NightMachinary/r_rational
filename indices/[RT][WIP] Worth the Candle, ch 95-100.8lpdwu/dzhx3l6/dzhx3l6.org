Letter 15 got me teary eyed. Also, even while I was ravenously reading I knew the ending was relatively near, and that simple fact left me wishing for more, more story read, more lore from Aerb and Joon and this little adventure.

It's a special kind of hunger I only get when I'm consuming entertainment I really, really like. Thank you for doing this.
