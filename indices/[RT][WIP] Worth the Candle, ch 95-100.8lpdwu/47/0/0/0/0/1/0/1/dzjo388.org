You're kind of treating this as a black-and-white thing, though.

I mostly agree with the SSC article, but there definitely /is/ a correlation between young men being celibates for long periods of time and them objectifying women.

I think the way Arthur talks in this chapter is a good example: he's not especially evil, and he has a certain respect for Tiff, and it wouldn't be constructive to just attack him for feeling the way he does, but the way he talks about girls is kind of unpleasant and objectifying (eg his "50% of girls are below average therefore not worth dating" speech).
