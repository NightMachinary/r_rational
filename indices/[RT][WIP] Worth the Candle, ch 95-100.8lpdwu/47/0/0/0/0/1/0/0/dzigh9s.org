It seems we are conflating two different definitions... I was specifically thinking of the [[/r/incels]] subgroup whereas you are referring to the literal, broader definition of people that are involuntarily celibate.

I think [[/r/incels]] was shutdown for being so hateful. They definitely categorize women into various misogynistic stereotypes.
