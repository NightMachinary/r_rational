Lovely thing, so many chapters. Gaped at it in disbelief, but I guess we didn't see an update in a while, huh. :P

I was worried about Amaryllis going off the rails and becoming an inhuman monster, or at least a highly proficient manipulator. Thankfully, that doesn't seem to be the case.

Plenty of character interaction, with my favorite bit being the conversation between Ropey and Zona... though I am worried, since the title for his chapter wasn't comforting.

Speaking of foreboding titles: "Immanentize the Eschaton" felt like Zona or Amaryllis were going to go completely off the rails, but thankfully it was /just/ a problem with the pregnancy.

Not that it won't be a chancy encounter, just... chapter *100* and that kind of title /really/ set off red flags for me. Now we can get to Labor 101. :P

Also, speaking of various bits and pieces:

#+begin_quote
  */Flow State:/* /Allows you to enter into an analytical flow state, which temporarily doubles working memory with respect to the subject of analysis, halves the penalties for thirst, hunger, and exhaustion, and increases the chance of a Brilliant Insight by five percent per hour (compounding)./
#+end_quote

I love brain upgrades. Or thinking upgrades, so those perks were a real morsel. And this, /this/... felt underused, just another thing he grinded up.

Working memory is the workbench of your mind, and just doubling it's size... it should allow for some advanced considerations of complex problems, like the problems Amaryllis was going to face. Let's not forget the golden nugget of a /Brilliant Insight/, which could become quite certain with a day to spare...

Actually, wait- does every hour get an increasing chance of Brilliant Insight? Can you get more than one BI for a single usage of a Flow State (regardless of it's length), or one every hour?

Either way- that feels like a big upgrade, and I hope to see it in action.
