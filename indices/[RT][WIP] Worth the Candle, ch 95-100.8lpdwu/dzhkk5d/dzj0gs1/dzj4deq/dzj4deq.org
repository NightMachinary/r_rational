[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanentize_the_eschaton][Wikipedia]]: In political theory and theology, to immanentize the eschaton means trying to bring about the eschaton (the final, heaven-like stage of history) in the immanent world. It has been used by conservative critics as a pejorative reference to certain projects such as Nazism, socialism, communism, anti-racism and transhumanism.[1] In all these contexts it means "trying to make that which belongs to the afterlife happen here and now (on Earth)"

The phrase was also referenced extensively by the Illuminatus! Trilogy. Anyways, it works on a couple of levels, tying in to the resurrection project and denial of the afterlife in favour of making a paradise in this world, not the next, and also the house becoming godlike in some respects, and taking on the name [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+28&version=KJV][Bethel]] and turning into a heaven.
