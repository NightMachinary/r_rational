  Incels categorize women (repeatedly) because they view them as interchangeable and solely as sources of sex

Um, that's a rather one-sided and judgemental view? For most lonely people it's not just about sex, even if being celibate obviously is a big part of the problem? See [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/31/radicalizing-the-romanceless/][Radicalizing The Romanceless]], back in 2014 we were already talking about this.

I would guess that even for the very small extreme subset of incels that admit to being ones on the internet, sex is not everything they want; intimacy, trust, all that jazz is pretty common human desire. Though probably many have given up on that.
