Heads up, I want to applaud you for being open minded, and for doing your best to keep discussion civil. That said, I just wanted to say that while I don't know what your previous comment said, the reason this particular comment is getting downvotes may have more to do with the implicit assumption/accusation that people disagree with you because they are “sheep”, for lack of a better word, and that you in your “wrongthink” are refusing to conform to their views. A more productive way forward would be to drop the wrongthink, or to acknowledge that some may disagree with you because of a different and potentially valid viewpoint, perhaps derived from different priors.

Of course, there are some who are dismissing YOUR viewpoint at of hand for the very same reason, but what's the point of being rational if we just assume everyone else is incapable of being rational as well? Might as well put in a bit of effort to try and avoid assuming the competence or incompetence of others when possible, and the ones worth listening to will listen to you in turn.
