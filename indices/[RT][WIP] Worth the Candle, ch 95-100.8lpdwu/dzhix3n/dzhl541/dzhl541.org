Teenager, dealing with his first serious crush, bouncing ideas off a close friend. With that context, I would think less incel and more slightly problematic attitude... which might change in any number of ways. Given what we've seen of him as Uther, maybe he didn't so much change for the better, but he was certainty not celibate.
