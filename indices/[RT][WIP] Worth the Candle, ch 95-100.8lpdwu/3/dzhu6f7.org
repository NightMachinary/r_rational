  “Perhaps,” said Amaryllis. “The argument,” she grunted again, adding in a little bit of lunge that saw her without any handholds for a fraction of a second, “Is that whatever chance there was for a fruitful partnership between us, we acted in such a way that it could never happen.” She glanced at the handholds. “And at the end of it, we suffered some enormous expenses to kill one of the most proficient soul mages in the entire world. Given that he was in prison when we found him, it really wasn't worth it.”

The thing that weirds me out about that arc, that they are never discussing, is that Fallatehr (or someone close to him) betrayed them first, when he sent them a void grenade before they even had a chance to talk.

We still don't know for sure whether it was him or one of his brainwashed minions who did it, but either way, it reflects pretty abysmally on him, and it makes aggressive mistrust a pretty rational choice.

But it's weird because it never comes up. Nobody tells Fallatehr "How can we trust you when you already had one of us killed in cold blood!", and when they discuss whether they should trust him / have trusted him, they focus on the potential of soul magic and not the fact that, hey, he already murdered one of them without provocation.
