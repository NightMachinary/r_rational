They conspicuously arranged for his thralls to die during the prison escape (or at least, very visibly made zero effort to save them).

They also made it very clear (implicitly) that they were only going to keep him around as long as they needed to, and that they would kill him after that.

The situation Fallatehr was in was the same Joon and Fenn were at the zombie city: even though Fireteam Blackheart did not explicitly betray Joon at any point, they placed a death collar on him and their behavior made it clear that Joon would not outlive his usefulness, same for Fenn.

Again, it can be justified by the grenade thing, which is why I'm surprised they never mention it again. Without the grenade, Grak's point ("Is that whatever chance there was for a fruitful partnership between us, we acted in such a way that it could never happen") makes way more sense.
