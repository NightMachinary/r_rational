OK, I've just reread all those chapters during proofreading, and not only do I challenge the idea that they ruined it by being too paranoid, I think it's clear that they weren't even paranoid /enough/. In Juniper's very first lesson, before they even left the prison island, Fallatehr grabbed the opportunity to completely subvert Grak - and was then amused by their "unnecessary" precautions in trying to isolate Grak. He probably /was/ amused, not because they were reacting to nothing, but because he knew that their efforts were insufficient or even futile. He later claimed that he simply wanted information, and made Grak loyal so he wouldn't reveal it - but what was his next move? He pivoted, using his control of Grak to capture Amaryllis.

And incidentally, "I wanted information" isn't /actually/ a good enough reason to make someone your mind-slave. Especially someone who just broke you out of prison. And the fact that they disrupted your plans in doing so doesn't actually make it better when those plans were, "maintain an army of brainwashed clone servants and summarily kill off visitors."

Even Fallatehr's offer of compromise during their final confrontation rings rather hollow. He may have been legitimately interested in becoming Juniper's teacher, but that clearly was to be on his terms. As soon as he thought that he had the upper hand, his offer shifted from "transmit memories for me to study remotely" to "give me full control of your soul and I won't kill your friends."

Sure, the situation was a huge lost opportunity, but all the defection was coming from Fallatehr Inc., not from Team Joon.
