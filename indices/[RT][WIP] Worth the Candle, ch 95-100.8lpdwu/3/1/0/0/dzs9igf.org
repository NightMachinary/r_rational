If comparing the situation to Fireteam Blackheart, I think we need to make substantial allowances for Fallatehr being a notorious and highly dangerous criminal, not just a sneak thief or a randomly encountered stranger. Security measures against him are just common sense. And yet, Team Joon never put a kill switch on him.

I also consider Grak an unreliable witness, because he spent a good deal of that time as Fallatehr's happy thrall. That would have caused him to develop a negative perception of his teammates' paranoia regarding his idol, considering them to be overreacting, and that perception wouldn't necessarily just disappear when Fallatehr was devalued.
