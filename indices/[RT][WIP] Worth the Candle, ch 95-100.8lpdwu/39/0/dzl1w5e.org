    Amaryllis figured that our best bet at that point was a full-body swap

  What's her plan? Some sort of soul magic shennanigans, but what? Try to copy Solace into someone?

This is a reference to ch 93:

  There were some other ideas she'd been kicking around that I was less enamored with.

  “We can rush Solace,” said Amaryllis. “When she's born, you'll take a look at her soul, and if it looks like everything but her body is as it should be, then we'll have you do a wholesale replacement of her physical self. Then all we should need to do is heal her into that form, rendering her a full adult and capable druid a few minutes after I've given birth to her.”

  “That ... does make some sense,” I said. “I would think there would be some problems as far as mass goes. Do you know whether bone magic actually replaces lost mass?”

  “Our only reference book on bone magic is The Commoner's Guide to Bone Magic, which unsurprisingly doesn't go into it,” said Amaryllis. “And yes, that's something that we should test before trying it. Obviously if the magic is cannibalizing other muscle, fat, or bone, we're not going to be able to turn a six pound baby into a hundred pound woman. In general concept though, what do you think?”
