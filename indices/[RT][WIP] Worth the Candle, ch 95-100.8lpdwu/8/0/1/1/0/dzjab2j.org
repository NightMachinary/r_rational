JRR Tolkien was a linguistics professor, he would have written at least a few hundred to a few thousand words per day for his mainstream professional career, in addition to his novels and worldbuilding/backstory writing.

To be fair, both Sanderson and [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]] may write for their mainstream careers (though Sanderson may be full-time) as well.
