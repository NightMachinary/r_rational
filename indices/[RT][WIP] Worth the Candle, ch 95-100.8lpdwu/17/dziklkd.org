I don't think the banter has ever been stronger. These chapters have seriously sold me on Joon/Fenn, and even Grak is starting to grow on me now that he has been shown to loosen up.

Bethel is an interesting addition to the cast, no one can ever accuse this fic of not being racially diverse when one member is a deer and another member is a house. I really liked the whole conceit of their group paranoia souring diplomatic relationships before they have the chance to start, and having to really stick their necks out to trigger Bethel's companionship.
