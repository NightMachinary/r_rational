50wpm would be 3K words per hour, which would be /absolutely insane./ My rate is more towards 500 words per hour, sometimes as high as 1000 words per hour when I'm in a nice flow state (and sometimes much lower than 500 words per hour, when my brain isn't behaving).

I can give some comparisons to other authors. Stephen King has a daily word count goal of 2000 words. Same goes for Brandon Sanderson, who also has that as his daily goal. These are famously prolific authors, writing full time. [[http://faq.brandonsanderson.com/node/309][Per Sanderson,]] the low end of how much he writes is four or five hours a day, which would come out to 500 words per hour.

As another example, Ray Bradbury famously wrote the original version of /Farenheit 451/ in nine days; it was 25,000 words, and his publisher suggested that he double its length, which he did in another nine days. That's an average of 2,777 words per day, done in a frenzy, and considered so fast that it's notable.
