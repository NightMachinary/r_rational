Altered to "when she took away her love of you", but I don't know when I did that, because I went to go make the change and it was already changed. /shrug/

#+begin_quote
  I feel like a full stop isn't the right punctuation here. A --- or ... would've fit better.
#+end_quote

To me, "so ..." is kind of a drawn out sound, like "sooooo", or trailing off, while "so ---" is almost cut off. The reason it was "so." is because the sentence is just coming to an end there without ceremony. (I imagine that using punctuation like that probably drives some people nuts, but it's my preference.)

Fixed all the rest.
