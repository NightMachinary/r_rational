  If you ask me, and I know that you would if you could, I think maybe this is some fallout from when she took away from her love of you.
#+end_quote

I'm never sure with this phrase. One has love /for/ someone, as in, if A loves B, then A contains love directed at B. /Of/ is in my comprehension far more ambiguous. If we say “The love of A for B” it's clearly A's love, but remove the /for/ and say something like “The love of A of B” would reasonably parse as A's love for B, but could also be read as the love for A by B. There's... ambiguity. In that vein, “she took away from her love of you.” would reasonably be read as “Amy took away from Amy's love for Joon.” Given the pliability of emotions by soulfuckery, though, it could /also/ be read as “Amy took away from Joon's love for Amy.”

I know I'm probably making mountains of molehills here, but I like biuniqueness, especially in communication, even if it's tedious. We build pictures and narratives of other people in our heads by what they say to and emote at us, but that medium is communication is faulty. It serves for the most part, but we won't recognise the assumptions we make about the intentions of the message the other sent us, assuming we understood what they meant, and be right a lot of the time, but it's the times we are wrong that screw us over.

In personal communication there's no parity bit to check against.

I recognise my problem with your phrasing is probably rooted in this afore-described beef with communication and preference in biuniqueness, but I felt it worth mentioning, if only to make myself think through and acknowledge this personal bias.

I feel like a full stop isn't the right punctuation here. A --- or ... would've fit better.

  To be honest, I was a little bit afraid, in much the same way that I'd been afraid of the changes the Valencia had undergone.

Remove “the” or change Valencia to another descriptor.
