She had made a reel-to-reel projector, and didn't make a VCR until sometime during Joon's second month.

Integrated circuits were invented in 1959, while broadcast-quality video recording was available in 1958, so that's a simple "yes" on whether you can do it without microchips. I watched [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfuARMCyTvg][this video]] as a primer on VCR technology, just to make sure I correctly understood the mechanisms employed, and so far as I can see, it's entirely analog from tape to screen, which helps matters significantly.

There /is/ the question of what size and form her version of a VCR would take, but I'm going to leave that vague rather than declare its specifications outright, since I worry I would piss off someone with a hyper-specialized knowledge of how you'd go about building a VCR if you were in her shoes. (Though if someone has the engineering chops to keep me informed, I'd be happy to include more details in revision.)

Edit: Shit, I meant to say that /magnetic tape/ broadcast-quality video recording was available in 1958, before that they used aluminum disc for something like twenty years, or a different method that was essentially pointing a television camera at a film projection (or vice versa).
