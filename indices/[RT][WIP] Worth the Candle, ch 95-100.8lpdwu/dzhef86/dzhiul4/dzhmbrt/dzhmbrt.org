I'm not actually sure how good you can make a prosthetic without microchips, which is what most of the modern ones use in order to allow people to have movable fingers and full(er) range of motion in the limb. The problem with losing a hand is that unless you connect directly to the nerves themselves, you have to move the prosthetic fingers using existing muscles, usually by repurposing some muscle function you don't usually use. For example, the "hook" hands usually co-opt shoulder movement; you clamp or release using a kind of rolling motion of your shoulder. (There's a fiction book by Max Barry, /Machine Man/ that goes into some of the problems with prosthetics from an engineering and design standpoint. As a fun fact, it was also written serially, one (short) update a day.) We're passing some of those hurdles now, but the missing piece, aside from investment, seems to have been on-board programming and connecting to existing nerves. (Note: amateur opinion)

Grak got his Loyalty 10 in ch 78, which gave him the ability to see magic without his warder's monocle, among other things.

I'll have to RAFO the other question, because it will get discussed in a future chapter, but the only on-screen amputations have been Joon's fingers in ch 21, and his hand in ch 50, both of which were fixed with a level up.
