Fixed those, thanks.

It's established on introduction that there are two doors to the time chamber, I think that I sometimes use "the door" when meaning "one of the two doors", as when saying "Amaryllis opened the door" to mean "Amaryllis opened one of the two doors". This is needlessly confusing, so I changed it.
