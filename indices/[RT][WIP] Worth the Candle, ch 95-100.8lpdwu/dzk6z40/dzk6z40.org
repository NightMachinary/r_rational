A fan theory I've been noodling lately:

You could make an infinite depth pit by having an array of void weapons pointing down, so long as they can produce void faster than you fall. Presumably you'd also need a magical effect to fill the void with air, so that you'd reach a terminal velocity (and also, ya know, be able to breathe). If you keep accelerating, presumably you'd hit the limit of your void magic.

Because there seems to be a finite volume of water on Aerb (i.e. no infinitely deep lakes), it implies a lack of permanence to the boundless pit, or all the water would have already flowed into it.

If you need access to the sources of magic to Exclude them (which seems necessary, given the Ice Magic story), it could be Uther was trying to Exclude "void" by catching up to the void drills shooting down the boundless pit. But in that case you'd want teleportation magic, maybe try and use revision magic to effectively slow down the descent of things within the pit?

But obviously if you really wanted to explore it you'd have multiple people so one could sleep while the other is the lookout.

I feel Uther would have come to a similar conclusion, so perhaps the pit isn't boundless but actually has a loop in the middle? But then where is all the water going...

I feel the mechanics and exploration of the pit will be important. But I do not know how, or what the mechanics could be.
