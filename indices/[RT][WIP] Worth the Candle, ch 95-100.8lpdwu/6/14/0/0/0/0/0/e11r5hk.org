No problem - I generally don't mind doing it especially if people like you are doing the grunt work of actually finding the typos. I used to do some copy editing as well (like for Glimwarden and Shadows) but I didn't even know WtC existed until he outed himself and I haven't had time to read it from the beginning yet...
