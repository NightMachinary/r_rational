I also couldn't read any obvious context for the title. But the phrase really sets off the doom and gloom alarm bells in my mind. I was thinking of all the ways that the chapter's events could be literally triggering the end times on Aerb or Earth.

- The combination of the backpack and Anyblade's powers and their integration into one autonomous entity might herald the end of Earth in the long term if Joon's theory that the backpack draws only existing objects on Earth is correct. Might be a stretch given the DM's discretion and limits, but I'm picturing Bethel returning to the Pit after the adventures and endlessly dropping Earth matter down the hole.

- Giving Bethel the decisive entad (Anyblade) that sets her up for godhood? An arbitrarily titanic house with established vindictive streaks roaming Aerb?

- Bethel taking on the legendary name could be foreshadowing a coming cataclysm?

- Bethel may be exempt from Aerb's exclusions. Illusion magic is excluded, yet she can still make illusions (unless...some other magic can produce illusions? seems unlikely).
