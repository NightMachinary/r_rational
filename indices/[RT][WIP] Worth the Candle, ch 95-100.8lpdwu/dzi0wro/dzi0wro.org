So I didn't take a good look at how many chapters were released/didn't keep track of how many through I was, and I kept thinking each of them were the cliffhanger you'd said you left. Damn! You found a pretty good place, didn't feel jarring leaving it there, but it's also got some tension waiting for the next one.

Excellent chapters! I'm hoping that Amaryllis doesn't choose to change the mother things, and of course that the birth works out. Though I suspect if it doesn't and Solace dies (can they do this ritual again if they grab her soul?? That would screw with them.and her in particular) then she'll definitely want to get rid of the feelings of losing a child and Joon might disagree. Though I could be totally wrong.

Poor Fenn, glad Joon didn't freak out about it or anything, though now there is the son out there somewhere. Also, poor Amaryllis, the others were over the chamber, she would be seriously stir crazy. What a rough day/months.

Grak has really come through in these chapters with how supportive of Amaryllis he's been, not that he didn't care before hand, but I find in this arc it's come out much more.

New companion! Yay, also, starting to like the house more, and I can see how she became what she is. Must be so strange and disorienting to have parts added to you, that fundamentally change you. So yay for Bethel.

Loved the writing, keep it up, I quite enjoy your story!
