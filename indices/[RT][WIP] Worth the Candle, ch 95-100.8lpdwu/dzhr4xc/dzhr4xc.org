  o a week before we met, I was in prison, held there mostly because Anglecynn might have had a use for me. I was always worried that I'd be part of the next round of sacrifices. That happened sometimes, if you pissed the wrong person off. One day you're eating shit food and trying not to get on anyone's bad side, the next you're facing trial by adversity. I might have fared better than the others, since I had experience on my side, but even if you lived, it was the Host for you, and that was its own pile of shit.

  I keep my mouth shut around you though. I worry about what you'll say or feel if I tell you about something like the time a guard [strike through]got handsy with me[/strike through] raped me.

  “A bit,” I said. “I know what you're going to say though, she's got a son somewhere out there, and that's a gun on the mantle.”

  The house moved around us, creaking and groaning. The hallway shortened, and the closet door disappeared. Fenn held onto me, still with her package of sushi in one hand, and the surfboard banged up against my leg as we began moving. We saw doors sliding past us and closing in on themselves, and rooms collapsing in on themselves.

Moving...? Isn't this like the reversal of moving, at least in light of agency? I mean, you move in the holodeck, inside the illusion, but technically the holodeck is moving you.

  “It's unfamiliar,” said Zona, looking herself over (for our benefit, I guessed, since her eyes were only an illusion). “It won't be as perfect as the girl was, but in time I'll return to that level of fidelity. With less of me to manage, the acclimation should be easier. I have more room to think now.”

There's a pun there, I know it.
