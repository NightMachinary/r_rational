A $200k bottle of wine isn't worth that much because of its intrinsic qualities, but because of its history and some weird quirks of human culture. Much like a copy of the Mona Lisa isn't going to be worth anything hefty, I doubt a copy of the wine would be.

But unicorn blood, now why didn't I think of that?
