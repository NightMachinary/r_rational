Between two and six hours, though there are occasional days that I don't write, or I write something that's not /Worth the Candle/. Six hours of writing essentially means that I'm using absolutely all my free time for the day /and/ staying up later than I should, which happens sometimes if I'm in a groove or really itching to get some specific scene or moment on the page. (I have a bad habit of sacrificing sleep.)
