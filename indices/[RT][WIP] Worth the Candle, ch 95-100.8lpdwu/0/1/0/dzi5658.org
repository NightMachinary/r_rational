I'm currently a stay-at-home dad, so writing mostly happens after my son goes to bed, or occasionally when he's taking his afternoon nap (if I don't need to take a nap with him, which I often do). The economic question is sort of whether I can justify writing full-time once he's in kindergarten, or whether it will be part-time work and part-time writing, or just working full-time (probably as a software engineer, which is what I did before).

As for writing, the first thing I'd suggest is that you spend a lot of time writing, and a lot of time /thinking/ about writing. That naturally has to be combined with reading so that you can see how other people write, and pick up as many of their good habits as you can. Writing is a muscle, and you have to build it up, mostly by pushing yourself in different directions and putting in the effort. I was always pretty fast though, and I think if it were easy to be in the top 1% of writers by speed, more people would do it.

Also, I co-host a podcast that's mostly about writing and fiction with Daystar Eld, Rationally Writing, which you can find [[https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/rationally-writing/id1130741502?mt=2][here]] or [[http://daystareld.com/podcasts/rationally-writing/][here]], so that's about forty hours of me talking about the writing process (though we unfortunately don't have transcripts).
