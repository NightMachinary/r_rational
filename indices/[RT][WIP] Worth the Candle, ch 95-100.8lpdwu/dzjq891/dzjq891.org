  one of the chores was reaching in and gathering up the docile fairies to break their necks and put them in zip-lock bags.

  “You're dodging the question,” said Arthur, rolling his eyes again. “I think it's fine to just say, ‘no, she doesn't do it for me', I'm sure lots of girls would say that about me, I'm not going to be salty about it. Call that metric three, maybe, and even if it were just fifty-fifty that cuts the pool down to eighteen. But, in point of fact, there are a lot of metrics to consider, and even if some of them are correlated, the actual pool of worthwhile girls in our school is in the low single digits, at least as far as I can see.”

  “Yeah,” said Arthur. “It's a patriarchal institution.” He gave a hollow little laugh.

  “Well come on, help me figure out an approach,” said Arthur. “You know her pretty well, what would work on her?”
#+end_quote

Oh my god this is uncomfortable. (in a good way though!)

There have been at least a few hints so far that Arthur had a tendency to objectify women as a teen, but this is becoming almost explicit.

  “You have provided much information, most of it worthless to me,” said Zona.
#+end_quote

Aw. I kinda get why Zona/Bethel (ugh) has no patience for this high school crap, but her casual arrogance and constant snark are getting kind annoying.

  Fenn winced. “I'm on her side, a little bit. I haven't done it myself, because I wanted to talk to you first, but I've really been thinking that it might be for the best to get rid of some attachments that aren't doing me any good. Nothing concrete, just kind of waffling.”
#+end_quote

Yeah, just want to carve out the part of me that still loves my adopted away son. Nothing important.

#+begin_quote
  Zona was looking between the two of us with a smile on her face. “It turns out that I've missed domestic squabbles after all.”
#+end_quote

See, that's more like it!

#+begin_quote
  Look, when you read the letter -- you'll know which one I mean, it's got some kind of heavy stuff in it
#+end_quote

Ahah, pun.

#+begin_quote
  "So I told her about my pregnancy, and the child I gave up for adoption."
#+end_quote

/Worth the Candle/: a lighthearted story with dragons, unicorns, haunted houses, fairies made of sugar, and the importance of family values!

#+begin_quote
  I was always worried that I'd be part of the next round of sacrifices.
#+end_quote

... wait, what? The Empire does/tolerates human sacrifices? That's darker than I expected.

#+begin_quote
  I feel like this letter has already gone on way too long, but I don't want to just leave you on a low note, so I'm going to ramble a bit, okay? (If it's not okay, stop reading now. (See, I can do parentheticals just like you! (I love your parentheticals (and you).)))
#+end_quote

... yes, we all love your sprawling parentheticals, they're not awkward at all. Honest.

(just kidding, they're great)

  She wanted to be a house, and the only reason that she wasn't was because she was settling for lesser pursuits, like torturing and killing people who tried to come inside her, or making war with the tuung, or accumulating power.
#+end_quote

You know, small hobbies to pass the time.

#+begin_quote
  Fenn came out of the chamber like a cat darting out of a door that's been momentarily left ajar, and ran straight at me. She didn't slow down, and leaped up into the air, the better to tackle me.

  “It wasn't from scratch, it was from parts, and you know for a fact that I don't have recording working yet.” She sighed. “But thank you.” Her hand went to her belly to rub it. “She's not kicking.” [...] “If this is a stillbirth, I'm going to lose my fucking mind,” said Amaryllis.
#+end_quote

Quick question: wouldn't Bethel be able to detect whether the baby has a heartbeat, stuff like that? It seems a little strange that she doesn't contribute at all to the discussion.

  “Water broke, four weeks early,” she said. “I'm not in labor. We're going to the hospital.”
#+end_quote

Oh my. How dangerous is a four weeks early pregnancy? That sounds really bad.
