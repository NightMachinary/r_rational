Ooof. That Fenn letter chapter. I guess I was already aware that Fenn felt insecure about herself, but after reading that letter and realizing that she thought any of the stuff that had happened to her might be something worth breaking up with her for, I really wanted every single character to just give her a hug.

Great chapters. I am enjoying this arc much more than the Fallahter one, I think the constant paranoia got to me with that arc (not that I disliked that arc mind). Despite initial appearances the house seems much more agreeable than I initially thought, and things not being quite so strained definitely helps my enjoyment here.

It did make me wonder about Ropey though. Ropey clearly has far more intelligence than Joon believed (definitely above toddler level). I wonder if it could be a companion if he actually started to see it as more of its own person (rope?).
