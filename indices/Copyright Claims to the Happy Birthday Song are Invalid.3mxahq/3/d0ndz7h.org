  None of the companies that have collected royalties on the "Happy Birthday" song for the past 80 years held a valid copyright claim to one of the most popular songs in history, a federal judge in Los Angeles ruled on Tuesday.

  The sisters published the song in a book called "Song Stories for the Kindergarten," and assigned the copyright to their publisher, Clayton F. Summy Co., in exchange for a cut of the sales.

  At various turns in the case, attorneys argued over whether the Hill sisters had actually written the song, whether they had "Abandoned" their rights to what became the "Happy Birthday" tune and even whether Patty Smith Hill had been accurately quoted in a 1935 Time magazine article about the song.
