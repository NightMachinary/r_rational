I posted this, because a significant portion of our reading is fanfiction and copyright law is a big part of writing fanfiction.

I'm hoping for a discussion about this.

This also means that you can now legally use the Happy Birthday song at your party now!

P.S. If people have trouble with this, I will take this down and repost it on the Friday thread.
