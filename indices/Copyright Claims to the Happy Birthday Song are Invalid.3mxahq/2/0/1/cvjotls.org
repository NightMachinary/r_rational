This decision is /very/ narrow and doesn't really do much to set precedent, since it's a matter of /finding facts/ rather than /interpreting law/ (I always think of legal cases as being divided into the categories of "Did you kill your neighbor's dog?" and "Is it legal to kill your neighbor's dog?", which is naive but very helpful). If I ever end up writing that Tarzan fic, it's probably going to be with the possibility of being sued by ERB Inc. in mind (alternately, free on the web, but that would require shutting down my Patreon, which comes with some real frictional costs). Part of the reason that precedent hardly ever gets set is that people aren't willing to fight things like this; it makes more sense to just fold, or never to write a derivative work at all. The somewhat recent /Klinger/ decision regarding Sherlock Holmes wasn't just notable for the precedent that it set but also for the fact that Klinger was willing to press the issue.
