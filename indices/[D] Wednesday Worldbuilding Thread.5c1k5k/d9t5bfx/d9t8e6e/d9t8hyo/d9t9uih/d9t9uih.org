So, ok wait:

We live in world 00, say. Alice exists simultaneously in worlds 00 and 01. One day Alice drops dead, apparently killed by something in world 01, and I want to find out what. Is that at all possible, or is world 01 forever lost to us?

For example, under one way this could work: I get on the phone to Bob x0, who links world 00 to 10, and tell him "Alice 0x" has died. Bob confirms that Alice 1x is still alive (the Alice he can see in his other world), and relays the information to her. Alice 1x links worlds 10 and 11. In world 11, Alice 1x talks to Bob x1, who links worlds 11 and 01. Bob x1 can then find out what killed the original Alice in world 01. Does that work?
