I read "Transdimensional Brain Chip" myself. Really fascinating premise, though I would like to make clear that its attitude towards multiple worlds is similar to my own attitude prior to reading it. Awful art, though, and sometimes offputtingly tribalist, but it's great for what it is.

I'll admit that I'm a bit uncomfortable with this assessment, because I can think of experiments that would seem to produce a countably infinite number of worlds if enacted, but it seems to me that the number of worlds would have to be finite, because every conception of a world-splitter only doubles the number of universes, and you'll never get to an infinite number by doubling a finite number a finite number of times. It seems like you could get an "infinity mirrors" effect from two world-splitters being conceived simultaneously, though, but I think something's probably wrong with that idea.
