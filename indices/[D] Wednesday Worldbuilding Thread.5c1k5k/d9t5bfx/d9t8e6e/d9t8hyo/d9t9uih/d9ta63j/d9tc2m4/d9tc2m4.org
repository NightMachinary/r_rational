Hm. I thought about this a while back when [[http://brainchip.thecomicseries.com/][Transdimensional Brain Chip]] was running. If you do it that way, then even with an average of just two "dreamers" in each universe, there are infinitely many universes in total, which raises some problems.

For example, the threat of memes that can spread across universes. The philosophical questions about whether you can even have an infinite number of computationally distinct universes (for the reasons given in [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/15/answer-to-job/][Answer To Job]] ).

And pertinently, probability theory cannot deal with a countably infinite number of identical worlds. Assuming that all worlds are "equally likely", whatever that even means, then the probability of you being in any particular world can't be more than 0. So the probability of you being in any world at all is the countably infinite sum 0+0+0+0+0... = 0. But obviously you are in a world, so this sum must be 1. Contradiction. QED, probability is wrong. (Or, some of the worlds are "less real" than others, but that opens its own can of worms.)

Which is fine for a story, but you're not going to have rationalists using Bayesian reasoning in a multiverse where probability is wrong.
