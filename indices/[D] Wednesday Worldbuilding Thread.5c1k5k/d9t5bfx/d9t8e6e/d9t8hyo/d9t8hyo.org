Each split - ie, each conception of someone with this condition - doubles the number of universes. It's like each split creates a mirror, and the worlds on each side of the mirror immediately diverge from each other. To overextend this analogy, regular people are like simple panes of glass, while people with the condition are the mirrors - either side of the mirror breaking breaks the mirror, but the mirror only has two sides.
