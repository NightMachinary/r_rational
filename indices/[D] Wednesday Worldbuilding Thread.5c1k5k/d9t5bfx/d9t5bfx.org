So let's say that some people (about 1 in 10,000, perhaps? maybe less by an order of magnitude or two) live simultaneously in two worlds, which split at the moment of their conception. They know everything that each of their selves know, but this link exists only in their brains; the rest of their bodies are wholly unlinked except that when either brain experiences brain death, it induces brain death in the other. Consequently, such people have lower lifespans on average than the general population. They experience some cognitive dissonance from failing to compartmentalize the two worlds (for example, they may forget which one of their selves they are and mistakenly refer to events from the other world). They tend to become conduits of science and art by giving each of their worlds the ideas that only the other world had naturally. Essentially, they're like Coil from Worm, but with only one split ever in their lives (at the moment of conception). The condition correlates strongly with birth defects; not at a 1:1 rate, but people born with it have a >50% chance of being born with multiple congenital diseases. The condition itself is much more likely in children born to older women near menopause.

If this has been going on for as long as the human race has existed, how quickly might we expect their existence to popularize a many worlds conception of reality and a Bayesian conception of probability? How much might they speed up human progress? How popular could the idea that the condition is merely a delusion become? If someone did have a delusion that they had the condition, how quickly would they be found out? What about a skilled conman; how successfully could they fake it?
