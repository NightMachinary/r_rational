In a virtual environment with fast-running mind-uploads and potentially a million subjective years of history, but a finite amount of RAM and CPU power and thus a finite amount of minds... I'm currently trying to properly construct in my head a society that could be described as a cross between the (original) World of Darkness and 4chan, or maybe Faction Paradox and Orion's Arm; kept moderately stable during its mind-blowingly-long history by relatively regular injections of near-normal 2030-era human minds. I may take a day or two off NaNoWriMo writing to get some of this straightened out in my head. Anyone who wants to contribute a thought, I promise to read it, though I can't guarantee I'll use it.
