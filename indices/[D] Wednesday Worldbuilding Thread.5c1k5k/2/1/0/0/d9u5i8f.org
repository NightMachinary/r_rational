Ah! I must have read it too quickly the first time because I saw it as only a future plan to try to retain the advantage.

The biggest and most valuable information I can think of is simply anything at all that has to do with the PTB where there is an advantage to being the only person who knows anything. Also obviously any way to manipulate sims are valuable. /Maaaaaaybe/ being rat-minds might be valuable to just to learn more information about how human minds can be affected, but it would be a bad idea to allow yourself to be examined by any such individuals regardless of whether or not you are willing to sacrifice copies of yourself to unscrupulous experimentation.

A good strategy for some people might be to make their minds more like a virus so they can replicate and spread themselves faster across sims.

I can't think of anything else you haven't written on your Doc.
