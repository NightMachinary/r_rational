If we're following WoD, then it seems like the central conceit is that the game world is kept stable by some sort of "reversion to mean" system which provides consequences to anyone attempting to /radically/ change or destroy it. I'd guess we also populate the world with NPCs of some sort in order to provide fodder for the users to play their games with?

If you wanted "4channess" in a world, I guess the first things that come to mind are anonymity and memes ... but I know 4chan mostly from being a /b/tard about a decade ago, so my knowledge is way out of date. Regardless, I think there's some good worldbuilding fodder in things /like/ werewolves and vampires as basically being memes. So no two werewolves are the same, because they're variations on the same core conceit, and the central concept of "werewolf" (or whatever) is just whatever longstanding meme has survived the fickle population, or is currently a flash-in-the-pan.
