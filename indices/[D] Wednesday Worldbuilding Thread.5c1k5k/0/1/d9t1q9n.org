I would read it.

Partially because of my excessive love for uplift fiction, but it does sound cool. Interactions between the club members comparing and contrasting how they uplifted? Prior World Systems' Effect of uplift speed and efficiency?

In sort of rambling conclusion, I think a possibility for uniqueness here is meta-uplift comparison.

If you need more help or ideas, I would love to assist. Seriously, that whole thing sounds awesome.
