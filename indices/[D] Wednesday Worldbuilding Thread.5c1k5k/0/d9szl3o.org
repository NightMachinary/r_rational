Uplift Society Club:

Some of its members are summoned across the multiverse to uplift less sophisticated society than their own because they are the most well suited heroes.

This causes a panic back on Earth and a media firestorm.

Meanwhile, the summoned heroes across the multiverse works to uplift civilizations of different stride.

Then, they finally come back, with whole new tech and magic, even.

Not sure what to do with this, so I am just throwing it out for consideration.
