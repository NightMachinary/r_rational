The biggest problem I have with your story is what do they have to trade? There are ram and cpu power, but with only these two to trade there should be little interaction with each other. I mean in society there is often a whole wealth of different goods to exchange and as you cut down on the variety it should lead to less trade/interaction between sims. Can you think of anything else sims can trade? Particular pieces of knowledge, difficult skills, certain code, works of fiction/art, news, conversation with the Powers That Be (communication is limited due to clock speed and PTB's attention right? so people can trade talking time), pleasure of sapient company, and anything else that are still desired in a post-scarcity society.

I have heard of World of Darkness, 4chan, Faction Paradox, and Orion's Arm, but I never spent any time involved in these four, so I can't comment on them.

EDIT: I just read the latest part of your story and I'm confused about [[#s][how]]
