World 01 is forever lost to you; your only point of contact with it was Alice. For any given world you can contact, there is only one path of people leading between your world and it, and any of them dying will cut you off from it.

Really weird non-Euclidean geometry reference you may or may not get - suppose that people are like ultraparallel lines on a hyperbolic plane; most people only have worlds on one side of them but some people have worlds on both sides of them. If there's a world you want to get to, and one of the lines between you and it is made impenetrable, you're out of luck.
