Each splitter conception in any timeline doubles the total number of timelines. Assuming that we have a splitter birth somewhere on Earth randomly about every 10 years and the effect was just added to the universe by a wizard, the first birth will happen after about ten years. The second will take five. The third will take 2.5. After a total of about 20 years, the multiverse diverges.

You might want to set your story before that point, or make splitter births magically less likely as the number of timelines goes up.
