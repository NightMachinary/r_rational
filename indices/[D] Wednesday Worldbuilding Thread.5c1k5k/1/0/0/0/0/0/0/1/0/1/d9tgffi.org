I'm still philosophically uncomfortable with infinite worlds. They play havoc with probability. I can't come up with a non-contrived scenario at the moment - [EDIT]

Here's a non-contrived scenario. From the perspective of a splitter, the multiverse is split in half, and each of those halves has equal value. From the perspective of an ordinary person in a world with 1000 splitters in it, the multiverse is split into 1000 pieces (plus their own world), all of equal value. Yet each splitter claims that the 1/1000th of the multiverse they "gatekeep" from you is the same size as all the rest put together. The proportion of the multiverse that each splitter gatekeeps is simultaneously 1/2 and 1/1000 and some other stuff entirely. That doesn't make sense.

You can have a sensible finite multiverse if a single splitter doesn't split the multiverse into two completely disconnected parts. If the paths between them were convoluted enough, nobody would notice without a coordinated effort to map the multiverse. Maybe splitters might notice differences between their two worlds that they didn't cause, but the butterfly effect being what it is, it would be hard to be sure.
