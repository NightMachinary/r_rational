Not a very good comic, but it illustrated my point.

The two world-splitters don't need to be conceived simultaneously to get the infinity mirrors effect. Let me rephrase something I said in the parent comment. /The average number of world-splitters per universe must be less than one in a finite multiverse./ (That's counting minds - if we count a world-splitter's two bodies seperately, then the average is less than two.) I will prove this without any reference to what order anyone was conceived in.

Picture the multiverse as a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory][graph]]. Each universe is a node of this graph; world-splitters are edges connecting two nodes.

  For any given world you can contact, there is only one path of people leading between your world and it, and any of them dying will cut you off from it.

This means that the graph is either a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory%29][tree]] or several disconnected trees. A finite tree has one more node than edges; so if your multiverse is finite and made of trees, the total number of nodes (universes) must be more than the total number of edges (worldsplitters).

You don't have to have a finite multiverse, but if you do then worldsplitters will be very sparse.
