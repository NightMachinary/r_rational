How does this splitting work? If I'm a doubler born in 1950, what happens when another doubler is born in 1960 in one worldline?

I would think the cleanest way to do it might be to just double the number of universes so that there's an A1 and B1 which are linked and an A2 and B2 which are linked, which means everything with the condition subjectively appears to be in the same two universes, even if there are other universes.

Another way would be for multiple universes to all interlink, meaning universe A, B, C, and D would be linked and you would experience 4 instead of 2. This would also increase your chance of death, given you have twice the odds of a single instance dying.

I find both to be interesting and compelling starting points for a story.
