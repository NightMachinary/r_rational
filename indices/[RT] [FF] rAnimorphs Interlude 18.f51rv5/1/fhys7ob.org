Jeez, that's a lot of US cities + Bases. Though the fact that there are many US military bases listed is probably because it's compiled by the US military - there might be other military bases in China that are destroyed, but that the US doesn't know about.

I'm guessing so much of China/India's industrial capacity is untargetted because either a) Visser needs at least some manufacturing capacity intact or b) the Visser has already infiltrated the local governments there? There was some mention of an "Indian Battalion" in the preceding Jake chapter.

Also, I wonder how many controllers died in these blasts, and what the Yeerks must think about that.
