Huh. Guess it was just a common slip of the tongue, then; I always heard it as 'Kadena Air Force Base', but then again I didn't frequent it, just passed through while my dad was stationed there (we lived on Camp Foster, a Marine Corps base).

I assume with the size of Kadena and the existence of like five other bases, Okinawa itself is just really a smoking crater at this point, tho it's not like the mainland is doing much better.
