She stated that she considered the Gods Below his Gods, which, together with the idea that one must listen to the teaching of Gods to become better, suggest that she considers herself Good. The Wandering Bard as we know her would understand the motives of a villain pretty easily, but this isn't a Bard yet. She seems to understand people with inherently different philosofies less, and so needs to understand how one comes to Dead King's conclusion of "living doesn't really matter". Of course, since she's Good-aligned, from her perspective he's an instrument for Below, and his success and odd outlook mean he must have been crafted for a specific purpose.

I suspect that in reality Gods Below care far less about who gets a Name and what they do with it, choosing to emphasize personal traits of the character instead of an underlying uniform code. The current situation is a mystery only for the Intercessor; from the Dead King's perspective everything that has been happening so far makes perfect sense. He hasn't been "made", he just happened to be the kind of person to bite off the exact amount he could chew.

Note the absence of her usual references to the meta-knowedge: the shift from a priestly Role to a narratively focused one must have been accompanied by a shift from looking at Creation through theological/phylosophycal lens to a perspective of a Named reading the script.
