Oh my god, so many revelations!

- The Garden... most likely the first version of Creation where everyone was immortal. And apparently that didn't satisfy the gods, and they feared that someone with unlimited time might learn things they shouldn't which means...
- ...the Gods aren't omnipotent. They are beatable. This sets them up firmly as the ultimate antagonists. Catherine must either make them understand the inherent duality of people with words or actions. So much foreshadowing!
- The "Evil" side is forced to fight in everywhere and everything, leading to several Dread Emperors and Empresses who couldn't abide by /any/ Peace agreement, making any kind of negotiation excrutiatingly difficult for both Malicia and Catherine.
- The Dead King was crafted by the Gods. Which side? Hard to say. And there are hints that there are more of his "kind". Is Ranger the same?
- Bard is... an unwilling actor? Someone who does this to make herself "better" for an eventual break up with the Gods? Is the Wandering fucking Bard turning into a potential ally?

And now Catherine knows all of this. Did the Dead King predict this would happen? He knows she is of Winter, and would use Arcadia to shorten the journey to Keter. And he knows that there are reflections of Creation in arcadia... and probably considered that she had Hierophant with him... Was this the purpose of the invitation all along?

Such an amazing chapter!
