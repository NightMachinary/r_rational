People are interpreting this without making use of the quote at the top of the page. Putting it in that light it is pretty simple, and just clarifies a number of things we already understood.

The gods of Creation are trying to win their eternal game of Above v Below. The first attempt was Arcadia, which failed because the immortals were too restricted in their actions despite being empowered. The second attempt is the current world, where mortals have the potential to surprise the gods, with death being the ultimate check on their power. "Same box in the end," eh?

The Dead King sought to escape the box this by eliminating death altogether- in one form or another he accomplished that for himself, but maybe not for his kingdom. Interestingly the /bard/ also seems to have accomplished it, possibly by becoming the Ref or something for the Gods, working both sides to eliminate people who might rise beyond the great game? She is certainly convinced that he couldn't have reached his power without outside assistance. He, in turn, wonders who it is that speaks on her behalf.

And something about Cat has caught the attention of both of them, at this point. Whoo boy. It seems like it might not just be narrative shenanigans after all that she doesn't hardly have a Name anymore...
