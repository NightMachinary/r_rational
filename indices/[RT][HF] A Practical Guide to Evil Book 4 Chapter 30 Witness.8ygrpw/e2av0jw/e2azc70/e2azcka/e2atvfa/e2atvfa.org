Interesting to see the new perspective on immortals. I'm assuming that Arcadia was the garden mentioned? Also wondering what Cat meant by a different kind of war. The actions of the dead king make her hate him too thoroughly to compromise seem unlikely, but him being the O.G. chessmaster probably freaked her more than a little bit.
