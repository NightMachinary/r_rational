Neshamah means 'soul' in hebrew. Interesting choice of a name, especially with the Garden and immortality mentioned; this chapter seemed very biblical. Also note that the main problem the Gods had with the Garden was that their subjects were at risk of learning something they shouldn't - this reminds me of the Fruit of Knowledge.
