Cat's only been trying to win on the mundane and named battlefield so far but she has barely considered the divine one where neither of the two sides share her goals. Maybe she'll have to play both sides on a meta-meta level to get the kind of peace she wants. Maybe she'll try to leverage her Arcadian influence and distance herself and her followers from the argument entirely. But now she can't pretend that just "making peace" will be tenable for long.
