If Cat make the Gods Above and Below understand the "inherent duality of people" Creation might go the way of Masego's childhood sanctuary. Vanished into non-existence after it has served it's purpose. While I wouldn't put it past Cat to do the impossible the Gods are so much smarter, stronger and unaffected by Fate that her chances of beating or tricking them are close to none. Maybe she'll strike a balance between the two sides or fuck off to Arcadia with Callow.
