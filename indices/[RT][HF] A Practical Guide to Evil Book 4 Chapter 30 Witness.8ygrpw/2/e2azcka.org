Well that was... Enlightening, the conversation wasn't long, but the Bard and the king certainly knew a lot.

The garden of immortals is almost certainly Arcadia, the fae and whatever other immortals it contains are too perfect a description of 'having fallen into closed circles'. And it seems that mortals were created, at least from the dead king's perspective, as a being that could not challenge the power of the gods. The Dead king seems to disagree saying that 'the Splendid' (another great descriptor for the Fae) are bound because if they were not then they might learn more than they should with their passage through eternity, this makes Cat's position as both mortal and Fae rather interesting.

The Bard gives me more evidence for my theory of the gods above being those who seek Rule, *“They make us better, when we listen,”* seems like Heroes only get stronger if they obey.

While the Dead king seems to believe that northern side is meant to win as both are designed to die, because if they don't then they could once again risk learning things that may threaten their creators.
