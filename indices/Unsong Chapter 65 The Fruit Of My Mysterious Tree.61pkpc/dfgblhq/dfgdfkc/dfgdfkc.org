You don't see what the reveal that Robin West had a half-demon child in Hell, the reveal of Malia's true purpose at UNSONG, and the deaths of at least three major characters accomplished story-wise?

Honestly I would be perfectly happy if the /only/ thing that happened in this chapter had been that obnoxious prick Dylan getting his comeuppance. Seeing the narrative logic finally betray him was so sweet.
