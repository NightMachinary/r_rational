This chapter resolved a lot, but in a somewhat unsatisfactory way... as others have said it felt like we just got an interesting backstory dropped only for the character to get killed off. Dylan also got killed, but he was annoying enough in the first place it felt like we were owed his death as an audience... except he finally got interesting in the chapter or two before he got killed off... so even that felt off.
