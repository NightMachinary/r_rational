I mean that I don't see how this ties into the main story of Aaron. How does any of this affects the apocalypse that's going on? If the character of Dylan had never been introduced, would it change anything? I'm reserving final judgement until the story is finished, but right now it just feels like we wasted a lot of time the Boojum storyline.
