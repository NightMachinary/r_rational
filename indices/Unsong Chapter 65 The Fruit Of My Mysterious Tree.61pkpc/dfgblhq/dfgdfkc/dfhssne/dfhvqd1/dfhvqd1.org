Well, Malia and UNSONG were part of Aaron's story, so her death is relevant to him. And Erica was his friend and now she's dead, and weren't they kabbalistically-married-once-removed?

I might just have a different outlook on this, though, because I don't especially care about Aaron or his storyline. I like pretty much every other major character more than I like Aaron. So I don't usually think about plot elements in terms of how they play into Aaron's thing.
