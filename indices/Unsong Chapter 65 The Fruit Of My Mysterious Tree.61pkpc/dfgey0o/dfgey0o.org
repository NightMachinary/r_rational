I don't know how to feel about this chapter. to be honest.

I feel like we've recently gotten a couple of backstory things (e.g. Malia Ngo and part-demons) just thrown at us without sufficient buildup. Maybe it'll make sense in the end, but if there's an eventual rewrite of Unsong then it might be good for some of this stuff to be more spread out.
