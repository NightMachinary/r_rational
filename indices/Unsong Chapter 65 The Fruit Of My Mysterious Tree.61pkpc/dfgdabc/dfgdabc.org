So, the rules of narrative are in full effect here, right? Malia won the placebomantic duel because she had a cooler speech and origin story than Dylan's. Then she died anyway because Erica had her own dramatic, defiant moment that acted as the culmination of her personal arc. Given that narrative logic is king in this chapter...can we pretty much assume that Mark, the one guy whom we didn't actually /see/ die, miraculously survived?

Also, a lot of people have theorized that Robin West is TOK. Does the reveal that she is in hell--or at least that she was at the time of Malia's birth--joss that theory? Is it possible that she escaped? Does anyone remember what the timeline was re: when she died and when TOK showed up?
