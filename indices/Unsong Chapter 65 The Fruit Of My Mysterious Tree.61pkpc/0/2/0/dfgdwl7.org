The timing might just work then, assuming that TCK died not too long after TOK showed up. All we know is that Robin was in hell up to a year after Malia was born. If Malia was born right after Robin died, then Robin could still have returned from the dead as TOK shortly after Malia left Hell. Or am I missing something?
