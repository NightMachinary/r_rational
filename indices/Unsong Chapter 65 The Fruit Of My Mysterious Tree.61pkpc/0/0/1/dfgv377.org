Haha! The thought that Dylan = Thamiel has occurred to me too. Several times. One is a powerful psychopathic terrorist with mastery of names and a talent for lying. The other is also a powerful psychopath who inspires terror with a mastery of names and a talent for lying. Something about the way he manipulates good people into doing evil things on his behalf and being stuck serving him whether they want to or not...coincidence?
