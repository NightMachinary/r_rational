To be more specific: Malia won because she managed to present herself as an underdog. Dylan's story makes him come off as a spoiled brat. Given his mastery of the narrative, I'm surprised he didn't realise it.

Now that I think of it, it looks to me as if he actually /wanted/ to die. Remember when he swore the oath to Mark? He didn't hesitate /that much/, and it may have been mostly to maintain character.

Wait... don't we know someone who's tried that before...?

  “Would you like to get this over with and kill me now?” he asked. “Or do we have to do it the hard way?”

  “Good,” said Thamiel. “I like deals. But just so you know, my BATNA is *killing you, wearing your body like a suit, and slowly poisoning the lives of everyone you have ever loved* until they scream for death.”

  And all my life, I wanted, needed, to convince people that the world was on fire all around them. *Well, now it's the apocalypse, and I couldn't be happier. And before I walk into the flames with a giant grin on my face*, I'm going to kill the figurehead of the old order, Ms. Follow-The-Rules-And-Ignore-The-Human-Cost herself. So come on. Give me your best shot.

So here goes my crackpot theory: Malia's story is true. Thamiel was inhabiting Dylan's body, and wanted to die and get back to Hell; but he also wanted to bring Malia back under his control. For some reason Dylan/Thamiel couldn't just assassinate her on his own; but when he met Erica, he realised she would be capable of doing it. Everything went just as planned.
