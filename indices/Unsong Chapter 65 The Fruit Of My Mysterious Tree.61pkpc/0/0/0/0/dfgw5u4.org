After helping Robin summon Thamiel, the real Dylan Alvarez, curious to know what she wanted, decided to summon him on his own. The summoning ritual trapped Thamiel in Dylan's body. Or something.

Yeah, it is somewhat far-fetched. But still, there's something fishy about Dylan being defeated this /easily/.
