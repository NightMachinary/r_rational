Ah, I should begin by saying that I agree with your explanation. My phrasing of the first sentence was meant to be in agreement with the question.

That said, you did kind of undermine your own argument about "someone, at some point, made a rational decision that an egg-laying rabbit would be the most suitable form for someone exploring the post-singularity future." In particular: "Furries exist in reality, thus their 'wishes' would be manifest in such a "foomed" future as well."

Regardless of the narrator's circumstances, and even regardless of the quality of the work, it really is obvious that the author is a furry.

That said, it /does/ read a bit like the Well World stuff.
