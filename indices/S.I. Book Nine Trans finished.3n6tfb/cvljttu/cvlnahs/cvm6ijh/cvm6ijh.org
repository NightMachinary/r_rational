Despite all the furry /content/, I'm not sure it /is/ a book for furries. To me, it's speculative fiction exploring what an (not-necessarily-friendly) AI foom would do if it worked like a wish-granting genie trying to grant everyone's individual wishes at once.

Furries exist in reality, thus their 'wishes' would be manifest in such a "foomed" future as well. But there are plenty of other weird desires people have, that /also/ end up manifest, and not one of them are really what the books are "about." There are unbirthing zones, [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/xu/failed_utopia_42/][catgirl]]-ization zones (which later become googirl-ization zones), and presumably zones for any other weird thing the human id has ever wanted.

But not every zone (or even most of them) was born from a fetishistic desire; some people would really like Optimus Prime to exist, so he does, as a Pepsi-branded 18-wheeler. A lot of people want their spiritual beliefs to be true, so the Native Americans now get to reincarnate by communing with spirits. And so forth.

Bunny's mecha-fursuit, on the other hand, I'm not sure how to justify, but it feels like it /does/ have a justification---the feeling that someone, at some point, made a rational decision that an egg-laying rabbit would be the most suitable form for someone exploring the post-singularity future. Maybe it'll get revealed eventually, but it doesn't really need to.
