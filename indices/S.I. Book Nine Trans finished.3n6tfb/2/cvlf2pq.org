I just want to mention that I was reading S.I., and as a resident of the Niagara Peninsula who has spent significant time in an around Brock University, the section there was creepy as hell. I've /been/ down the trail by Alphie's Trough. I've ran the stairs of Schmone Tower. I've looked out over the lake towards Toronto.

I've swum in Lake Ontario in the middle of the night.

Like, damn. Creepy.
