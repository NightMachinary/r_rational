While the story contains furries, I have been consciously trying to avoid writing "furotica". I've been keeping a specific content-rating rule in mind: I'm willing to include explicit content only if I'm able to write about it with detached, clinical detail as opposed to in a titillating manner.

Or, put another way, I'm aiming for Jack Chalker crossed with Charles Stross and David Brin. I may be ending up closer to Well World than Uplift, but I'd at least like to think it's better than a kick in the pants. :)
