Ah, this. I remember reading this on Sufficient Velocity, back in 2014. Then I forgot about it until now. It's an interesting exploration of a potential future world, from what I recall, but does tend to lean towards the 'furry' element as others have said. Although at the point I'd read up to, that was only in the fact the main is an anthropomorphic bunny-girl who lactates, IIRC.

Worth a read for some interesting guesses as to what a post-singularity gone wrong could end up as, I feel.
