It didn't grab my interest by chapter five. The characters seemed okay but didn't receive much of an introduction - their opening chapters were more of a world building introduction than anything and the world building is broad but shallow. I understand not wanting to spend too long setting the scene when there are three POV characters to be introduced but I think the solution there is to introduce them gradually rather than one after the other with a short chapter a piece.

The generic action sequence that was two chapters long and still ongoing, following a character I haven't yet formed an attachment to, is the point I think i'll be leaving it at.
