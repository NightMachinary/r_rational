I write an impression from the initial introduction/description/premise before reading further:

"[...]humanity has reached the stars and finds it is not the first to do so. Alien technology has been left behind[...]"

I found this phrasing deeply jarring. If it were 'Dinosaur technology' or similar, humanity's Earth predecessors having gone before us, it would sound interesting and exciting--but it's 'Alien technology', as though aliens reached an alien planet before us, probably because /it's their planet in the first place and they didn't 'reach there' from anywhere/.

Or, to be more analytical, {humanity reaching the stars} can be broken down into 'humanity's territory up until now' and 'the rest of reality'. For someone else to complete the same journey first, they have to share our starting point, or else the structure breaks down as our star and solar system are part of their 'the stars' and so we can't use the same 'the stars' for both. It only works from different starting points if both humanity and aliens had been gazing (longingly?) at the same 'the stars' (though not necessarily at the same time) from different patches of starless void.

At least, that's what causes metaphorical hackle-rising for me as a first impression. (Now to read the content itself..!)

Edit 1: Chapter 1 thought: without a long-term recycling plan, whyever spend so much on decelerating and safely landing broken things on a gravity well (planet with limited surface area), rather than just send the loads of trash towards the system's sun instead, or even out of the system entirely? I feel a little as though someone bent over backwards to make a junkyard planet that no one--after leaving the junk's origin planet's gravity well--had a need for.

Edit 2, Chapter 2: Hollet 3.2 is the second child of the third wife of an inheriting Hollet. Is Gibber 3.4.6.2 the second child of the sixth wife of a Gibber 3.4? Other than a few people closely related to inheritors, does almost everyone have an absurdly long string of numbers as most of their name, instead of limiting it to a family-head name and a child's two-number designation?

Edit 3, chapter 7: No meaningful hardware innovation/improvement/competition? (Why?) I'm a little reminded of graphing calculators. ( [[https://xkcd.com/768/]] ) ( [[http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2582]] )

Edit 4, up to date at chapter 17: I enjoyed the Garu setting, specifically the position and behaviour of the System. I am still quite curious about the (mental) status of the entity from the previous(?) universe. Everything else, I feel fairly apathetic about, though I could be less so if organic-fusion(?) had apparent relevance other than as a semi-simple vector of power in the form of violence.
