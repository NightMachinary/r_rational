They don't really grab me. Read the first chapter, got a little into the second, decided I didn't care.

For me at least it's somewhat unclear what it wants to be about. A elf (or angel? I can't remember my lotr well enough to tell) goes for a jog, he is really fast? Someone is taking to him? Or was talking to him earlier? He tries to hunt ducks with a "pure kenetic blast" it just knocks some back. We end.

Also I found my self skimming the more complicated descriptions.

Sorry if this isn't the kind of comment you were asking for..
