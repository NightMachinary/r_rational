Well I am afraid I didn't like that either. *embarrassed*

The poetic effect of the writing on me was disinterest. It felt uniform and vague, and emotionally flat, and contributed to my sense of nothing happening/confusion. I mean I did get the sense that the characters cared about..something?

But it's quite possible I am just not your audience.
