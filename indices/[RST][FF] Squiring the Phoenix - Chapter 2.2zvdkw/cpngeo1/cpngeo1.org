So Hogwarts, one of the most impressive magical constructs in Britain, was rebuilt after a few months even though the founders were supposedly more powerful than any wizard now living and it even includes the room of requirement which very few knew existed and as far as we know nobody knew how it worked.

Your son comes in with a magical firebird and your first reaction is to make a joke and calmly consider that it probably has something to do with the wizards? What happened to the mission that the phoenix is supposed to take you on when you first get it? And then your second question is what the boy named it? And then he finds out it's sentient and wants to uplift humanity and your though is something along the lines of "neat, I should help."? *Wait, what?!*

Why don't the researchers recognize Harry when they see him? This is the biggest historical event of these researchers lives, magic has been confirmed to be real and an entire shadow government has been discovered and not only was it close to declare war on Britain but nukes went of in Scotland! During the past few months this would be the only thing they talked about on all news channels, in all newspapers and all research communities and the face of Harry Potter would be on everything.

These things just took me completely out of the story as it doesn't make any sense unless the magical equivalents to the Hogwarts blueprints were somehow discovered, Nancy and Fred are hermits or work with government work that require them to lock themselves into a vault without outside contact and Joel's father is insane or confounded.
