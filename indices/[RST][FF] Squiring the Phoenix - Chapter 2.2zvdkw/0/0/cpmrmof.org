Ermmm...no. There's absolutely zero chance that I would forget something that significant. /cough/. Um...look! Shiny object!

Yes, Ignotus gave them the spells and then Dumbledore and a whole bunch of other very powerful wizards did the swishy-flicky thing and boom! Rebuilt school. That's my story (literally!) and I'm sticking to it.

Although, in fairness, once you have the spells it shouldn't be time consuming. IIRC, the founders raised Hogwarts either overnight or over a weekend, I forget which. I refuse to believe that there are no other wizards in the world as powerful as Dumbledore, and there's plenty of money available to hire them -- I guarantee the Ministry would shell out, and plenty of noble families would as well.
