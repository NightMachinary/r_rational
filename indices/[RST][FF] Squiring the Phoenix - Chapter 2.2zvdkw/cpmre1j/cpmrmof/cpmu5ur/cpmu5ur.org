  Although, in fairness, once you have the spells it shouldn't be time consuming. IIRC, the founders raised Hogwarts either overnight or over a weekend, I forget which. I refuse to believe that there are no other wizards in the world as powerful as Dumbledore, and there's plenty of money available to hire them -- I guarantee the Ministry would shell out, and plenty of noble families would as well.

Fair enough. So why hasn't anyone opened a /Yogworts/ just across the street? You know, the knockoff, state funded, Korean-run franchise magical educational center, with half-priced admission and 100% fewer Death Eaters on the board of directors (and enrolled)? Muggleborn and poor-as-dirt blood traitors would fucking flock to that obvious hole in the market.

Or consider the lack of a /Hogtown House Preparatory/, the centrally located UK school for Death Eater legacy applicants /only./

Bugs me seeing a world with magical infrastructure and only one of everything ever even mentioned -- and that the most boringly prosaic version possible. Must be the Ministry magical building codes or something...no wonder Arthur also gets around those, with his house being the only /other/ interesting bit of magical architecture in the entire country.
