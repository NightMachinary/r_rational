There's an AI character in Worm (spoiler so I won't say the name) that I think is represented fairly well. Exactly how it's bound is a little bit handwavey but the story makes enough of the right noises that it kept my suspension of disbelief well intact. As far as representations of AI go I honestly think it's one of the better I've seen, despite it acting fairly "human".
