I'm currently working on a short story involving a turnkey spam filter appliance that turns out to be WAY smarter than intended, and starts interpreting its mission of keeping the company working smoothly with minimal waste of IT resources quite literally and extensively, in all manner of creative ways. Much of the plot revolves around how its own [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality][Blue/Orange morality]]-based motives interplay with people trying to just achieve their professional goals and figure out WTF is happening at the office. Think "Dilbert meets [[http://villains.wikia.com/wiki/ARIIA][ARIIA]]".

The thing is, it's never sentient or conscious in the general sense, just very very very effective and creative in the ways it can interact with its surroundings in order to achieve its goal: it is absolutely resolute and focused on it. I'd say the most difficult aspect of designing such a "character" is that it does not really do any ethical calculations, especially not utilitarian. It has absolutely no self-awareness and no survival intent and does not model its own future presence or absence or plan around any future change of its own mode of operation. It's more like it has a very short set of negative-deontological axioms, where it must absolutely squash some specific actions and intents it can detect. Which means it can model those actions and behaviours, and twist them after its own motives. Which implies it can learn to model people after observing them long enough.

It makes for "fun" development of "character", as it can develop or acquire new capacities and powers that make sense in context at any plot-convenient rate. And you can also revert / reset those capacities when someone reboots or restores factory settings on the appliance because it's acting out. In this specific case, it starts rewriting emails and planning team meetings on its own, then learns how to do perfectly-efficient spear-phishing... all to reorganize corporate activity in ways that align with its own goals (incidentally causing AND solving all kinds of human and social issues along).
