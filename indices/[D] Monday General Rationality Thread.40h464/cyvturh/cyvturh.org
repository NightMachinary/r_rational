Something I sent to a friend:

EV rising above break-even on powerball doesn't mean you should buy powerball tickets (and note, EV STILL isn't above break-even; even at 900 million. Why?

Well, odds of winning are one in 292 million.

A 1/292 million chance of winning 900 million dollars well, then our EV for a ticket of 900 / 292 = about 3 dollars. Given that a ticket costs about 2 bucks, this seems like it might be a good deal, right? But wait! If you take the payout now in lump sum rather than over time, it's only 500 million! so your EV (500 / 292) = about $1.72. Not too great for a $2 ticket.

It gets worse, though! don't forget Uncle Sam! He'll come and take about 40%, leaving you with an EV of about $1.02 for your $2 ticket.

That being said, EV isn't a great way to approach this.

Why? Well, let's say the jackpot was even HUGER. Let's say the jackpot was so huge that it was actually an EV of $3 for a $2 ticket. Should you get one?

No.

In general, any powerball jackpot is the same size. They're all the size of "If carefully managed, you never have to work again and can live in comfort for the rest of your life. Your children won't have to work, either." Like, even the "smaller" powerball jackpots are a hundred million, easily. Even taking it as a lump sum and Uncle Sam taking a fat wet bite out, you're left with 20+ million dollars. Carefully shepherded to, 20 million dollars can easily put out several hundred thousand dollars a year without eating into principal and while fighting inflation.

So given that even a small jackpot would have you and all your descendants living an upper class lifestyle forever, you really shouldn't care that the jackpot is larger now. If you weren't buying tickets before, the fact that the jackpot will end up paying out more shouldn't change anything for you. Either way, it was going to change your life in the same way.
