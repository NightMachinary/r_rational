Now planning by backwards chaining...

FUN!

What would be the most FUN?

Why aren't we having FUN yet? Why's everyone so damn miserable much of the time? Enumerate reasons, line them up by feasibility of elimination, and solve them.

Top reasons we're not having FUN:

- Bad belief systems that teach us not to have FUN, or in fact to treat our own lives and sentiments as worthless from the get-go. These systems are often disguised under words like "normativity", "rationality", "freedom", "security", "God", and "identity".
- Artificial scarcity
- Artificial oppression, often related to above malignant belief-systems
- Natural decline of human condition with age and entropy.
