nostalgebraist does have a point with using diachronous Bayes without having a well-defined distribution... With the statistics of recent studies I've read, mostly about transgender brain anatomy, compared to (p < 0.01) and (p < 0.05), what's the recommended Bayes-ist alternative? The likelihood ratios of the update, or some such? Isn't p a likelihood bound (of the inverse)?

What on earth prior distribution would you even be using for that? Would you have a direct distribution of trans etiology theories? Or are you just pulling a number out of your ass for the odds of "gender indicator":"gonad indicator":"no indicator"? Stuff like this, you could just assign yourself a 10^{-200}:10^{-10}:remainder prior and be bigoted until the cows come home? I just don't know. It seems like an explication of consensus in probability distributions would be best, assuming you can even compute the complexity priors.
