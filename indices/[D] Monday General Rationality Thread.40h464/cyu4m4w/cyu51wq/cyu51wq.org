Getting a handle on global climate change is definitely the first thing to aim for in the next 20 and 100 years. Once there are concerted efforts in that direction, we need to have some big breakthroughs in computing power in the next 10-20 years to get past the Power Wall in Moore's law. After that, goals become less concrete and I haven't given them much thought.
