20: Eradicate polio and take steps to cure other preventable diseases (malaria, HIV/AIDS, TB, etc.). Lift a billion or two people above the poverty line.

100: Fix a limit on the number of living humans that the Earth can support long-term. (Might be anywhere from 5 billion to 500 billion, depending on how tech advances in that time.) Make plans under the assumption that the population and economy will stay fixed in the long-term instead of steadily growing. Solve income inequality and get everyone living to first-world standards.

1000: Make AIs, contact aliens, solve ageing and enough diseases that we qualify as biologically immortal.

10000: I don't know, but I'm sure we'll discover plenty of new and exciting disasters to avert in the intervening time. Either that or our species will go extinct.
