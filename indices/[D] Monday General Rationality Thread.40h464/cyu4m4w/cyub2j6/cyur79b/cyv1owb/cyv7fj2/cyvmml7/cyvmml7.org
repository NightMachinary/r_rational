Slaves are consumers as well as producers, which is why they aren't fully decoupled. A fully autonomous robot is a pure producer by definition, requiring no guarding, supervision, or oversight of any kind. Efficiency concerns, coupled with the fact that slaves are only minimally suited to, for example, banking or administration, prevents a slave economy from accomplishing what an automated economy can.

You are right about it being unlikely, since we'll probably hit on some form of AI before we successfully automate software engineering, which would be required for the robots to really and truly solve their own problems without human intervention. Still, I did say it was a /priority,/ not a prediction. Unlike anti-aging technology or AI, industrial automation is a gradual progression; we can reap the benefits of automated agriculture before we ever consider trying fully automated banking, and vice-versa. It'd be nice if we hit post-scarcity, but even a 1% success will be crazy profitable, and thereby encourage future innovation.
