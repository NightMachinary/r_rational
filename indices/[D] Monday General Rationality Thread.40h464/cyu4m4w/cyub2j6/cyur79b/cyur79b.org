A naive definition of "Post scarcity" is that the amount of work man wants to do produces enough stuff that nobody who wants it can't have it. I suspect that pursuing this with "automated factories" is going to work about as well in the short term future as it has in the mid-term past. (Where's the 15 hour work week Keynes forcast back in 1930?) (Barring an AI foom or something) Instead, I expect the post-scarcity scene to be a gradually growing opt-in philosophical movement.

At least, the following can be said:

1) I suspect that there's enough people out there who view wealth as a relative-social-status thing (or at least are sufficiently ignorant of hedonic adaptation) that you would simply run out of matter in the universe before we got the last 20% of them happy.

1.2) I would suggest that this demand curve is very steep in the first world. I mean, how many more people retire early now, compared to in 1950, when we made much less? Almost zero, either way?

2) The "Financially Independent, Retired Early" people, despite society being basically pitted against them, are able bootstrap themselves (and their progeny) into a "post scarcity" situation, in the present day, with about 15 years of work. (This is, perhaps, not sustainable - but that's not my point.)

3) The difference between the FIRE people and most of society is mostly philosophical, rather than technological. (nevermind that philosophy is a sort of tech...)
