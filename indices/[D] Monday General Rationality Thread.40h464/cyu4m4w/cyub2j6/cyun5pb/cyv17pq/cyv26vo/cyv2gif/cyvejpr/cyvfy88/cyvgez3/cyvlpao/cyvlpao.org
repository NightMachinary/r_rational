You're right, of course. Obviously the people who invent the technology will lose control of it to their investors, just like Jeff Bezos lost control of Amazon, died of typhoid fever, and was buried in a pauper's grave. What sort of crazy alternate universe could possibly have led to him ending up the 4th richest man in the United States? Now, if you'll excuse me, I have coal to shovel for a robber baron.

Again, /examples/. I can't think of a single incident where the scenario you describe /actually happened/ to a revolutionary technological innovation coming out of Silicon Valley. Overwhelmingly, tech startups are owned or operated by their founders. I don't doubt that it happens from time to time, probably to Facebook knockoffs or shitty iPhone games, but actual innovation tends to pay off bigtime.
