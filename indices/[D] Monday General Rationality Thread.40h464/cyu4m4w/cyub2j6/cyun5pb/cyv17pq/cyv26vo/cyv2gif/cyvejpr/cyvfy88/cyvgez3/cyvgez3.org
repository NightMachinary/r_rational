Automation is not a futurist concept and is not exclusive to those with progressive ideas. Its value is obvious to anyone relying on unskilled and minimum-wage workers, particularly as the minimum wage is blindly increased. The /assembly line/ was automation. Automating the old production pipeline is not actually fancy or attractive to techno-futurists. The ones with an advantage will be the existing industry that has regulations built around them, with the experience that is useful in knowing what problems need to be solved, with the land and capital pre-bought, with a massive pile of cash with no need for venture capitalists who only throw pittances at 2.0 dotcom startups. Tech startups are not going to be able to compete with existing industry, and would be vastly out of their depth even trying.

"Take industrial robotics away from its creator" lol you believe in individual creators, or even groups of creators owning their creations when they are under contract specifically so their creations are in fact the company's.
