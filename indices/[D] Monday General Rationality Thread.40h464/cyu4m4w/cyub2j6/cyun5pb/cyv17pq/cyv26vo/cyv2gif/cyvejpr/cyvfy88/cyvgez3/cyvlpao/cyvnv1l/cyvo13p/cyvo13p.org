You keep saying that it's "naive", but you haven't given any reason /why/. Blanket statements are /not evidence/. Can you actually /name/ anything comparable to the kind of robotics technology required for industrial automation that is currently owned or controlled by a traditional, Trump-or-Romney-esque capitalist?

Also, do you seriously have to downvote everything I say? Goodness sake, you don't see me doing that to you. Disagreement is not sufficient justification for defection.
