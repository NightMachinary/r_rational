You're privileging the hypothesis of Enlightened Capitalists when much more capitalists are like Romney and Trump. Additionally, it is the machines that automate the agricultural and manufacturing pipeline that will force-feed their owners with money, not the techno-progressives who are instead in the business of exploring the search space. What are you automating there, skunkworks? Rockets? The most Larry Page and Elon Musk will be able to do is lobby for basic income once unemployment starts rising at a dangerous rate. Just because they have money does not mean they have most of the money, or that they will be the ones to own the future post-scarcity pipeline. The ones to own the future pipeline will be the ones who already own the land, capital, and experience of managing the current pipeline. Corporations, not individuals. The oligarchy will be of shareholders.
