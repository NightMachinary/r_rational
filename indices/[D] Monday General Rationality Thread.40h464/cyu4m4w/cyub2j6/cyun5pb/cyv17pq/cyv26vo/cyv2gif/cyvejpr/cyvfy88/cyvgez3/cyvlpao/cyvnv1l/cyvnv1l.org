I am saying /you are assuming that any substantial automation of our existing infrastructure will be produced by tech startups./ That is /incredibly naive./ And /tech startups/ are sufficiently sociopathic for me to shudder at their being handed anything resembling purse strings! You are pointing to the single most vivid examples of tech philanthropists while ignoring the thousands of people who /actually own and control the pipeline!/

You are also ignoring the difference between production and ownership. A separate producer /sells/ the equipment to the consumer, and it is the /consumer/ that attains the substantial profit gain from automation!
