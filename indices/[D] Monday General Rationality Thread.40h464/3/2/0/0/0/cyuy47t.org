The power consumption (I think), switching time, and read/write/cache speed of physical memory is one of the biggest bottlenecks for performance. [[http://www.agner.org/optimize/blog/read.php?i=417][See Agner's blog.]]

I don't think stagnation is a good idea, our coding style and tools will be maladapted to correct the imbalance where we should be trying to improve everything at roughly the same speed. Luckily the low-hanging fruit of transistor density is drying up, which will allow everything else to catch up.
