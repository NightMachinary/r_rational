Anything concrete off the top of your head that's achievable in 20 years? I know (or strongly hope and suspect) that quantum computing is where we will make a lot of awesome, very productive steps, but that's only on 50+ year scales. A lot of people have been banking on Moore's law to hold for a long time as a crutch for good good coding. While on the one hand, it'll be great for our collective coding skills to have computing power stagnate for a couple of decades, I think the downsides of that scenario outweigh the benefits.
