Point 1: When industrial automation is fully and completely solved, at least one person will have an arbitrary amount of capital to do with as he or she pleases.

Point 2: It is a fair assumption that this person or people will be more similar to Larry Page or Elon Musk than they are to any given politician.

Point 3: Google is working on AI, SpaceX is pretty self-explanatory, it's hardly unreasonable to assume that this owner of arbitrary amounts of capital is going to be futurist-friendly. We /are/ talking about a team consisting of robotics engineers and computer scientists, after all.

Conclusion: I give > 50% odds that in the future the purse strings will be held by a futurist instead of a politician.
