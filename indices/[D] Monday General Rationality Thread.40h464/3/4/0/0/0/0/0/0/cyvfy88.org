An interesting theory, but why resort to speculation when we have real-world evidence to extrapolate from? You propose that, even though there are no old-style capitalists pioneering innovative technologies /now/, one will nevertheless appear (possibly from under a bed?) just in time to swipe one of the most profitable technologies imaginable from right under its inventor's nose?

The nature of the kind of tech we're talking about /attracts/ futurists. Can you name even a single company doing something legitimately new that isn't run by futurist? Here's another example: Amazon's owner is Jeff Bezos, who is invested in, among other things, experimental tech education, nuclear fusion, 3D printing, and Stack Exchange. And if he can keep control of Amazon, how does some punk stockholder propose to take industrial robotics away from its creator?
