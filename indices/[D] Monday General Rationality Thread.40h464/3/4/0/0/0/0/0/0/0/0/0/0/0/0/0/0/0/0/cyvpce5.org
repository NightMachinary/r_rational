Ah, the inevitable degeneration of an argument from "I disagree with you strongly, here are five hundred words explaining why," to "la la la la I can't hear you la la la la." How incredibly rational of you.

Interesting how you edited in "I refuse to be held hostage by my argumentative urges" /right after/ I mentioned rationality, btw. Are you trying to put on a rationality shirt to make my dismissal seem less convincing, even though you're actually saying the exact same thing? Where was that refusal when you started this thread?
