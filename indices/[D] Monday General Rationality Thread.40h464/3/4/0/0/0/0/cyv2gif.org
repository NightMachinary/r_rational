Mitt Romney made his money in finance, Donald Trump in real estate. Elon Musk, if my memory serves, co-founded Pay-Pal, and Larry Page co-founded Google. Both branched out, Musk moreso than Page. I didn't pick those two for any particular reason, btw, they're just the first technocrats that came to mind.

So, tell me, what brought you to the conclusion that our hypothetical oligo-autocrat is going to be more like your two examples, who made their money in traditional, long-established fields, than my two examples, who made their money in bleeding edge, unproven technology? Our hypothetical oligo-autocrat whose hypothetical company is based around, I might add, /near-future robotics and software technology./
