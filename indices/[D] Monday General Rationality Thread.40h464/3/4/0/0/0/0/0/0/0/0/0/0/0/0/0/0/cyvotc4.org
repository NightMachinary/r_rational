I am not talking about "examples of something that we're projecting in the future," I /quite clearly/ asked for /one example/ of your model - which you are apparently confident in or you wouldn't be having this discussion - taking place in the real world /right now./ You claim to have an invisible dragon in your garage, and I refuse to believe you until you let me throw flour on it.

Also, it took me less than five minutes to look up who founded Amazon, and that's the sum total of my research so far. You hold these beliefs strongly enough that you consider me naive for disagreeing, it should /not/ be difficult to come up with /one measly example/.
