  It is a fair assumption that this person or people will be more similar to Larry Page or Elon Musk than they are to any given politician.

That is not a fair assumption at all. You're presuming that the single owner of all the capital (while it will in fact be more of an oligarchy, as it is in the present) will be an Enlightened Capitalist, and that all Enlightened Capitalists are futurists. I find it unlikely that even a simple majority of future capitalists will be either Enlightened or futurist. I find it unlikely that future capitalists will be much more altruistic or connected with the state of the world outside of their bubble of privilege than they are now. I find it extremely unlikely that they will mostly be like Larry Page or Elon Musk than Mitt Romney or Donald Trump.

  We are talking about a team consisting of robotics engineers and computer scientists, after all.

The composition of the team has nothing to do with the owner of the team's output.
