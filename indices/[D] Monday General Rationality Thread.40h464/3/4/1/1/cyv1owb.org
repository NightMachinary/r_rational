Any society in which production is decoupled from labour is, for all intents and purposes, post-scarcity. Because consumers and producers are separate, we can ramp up the ratio as high as we want. Ten factories per human being? A hundred? A thousand? Why not? It's not like we're running out of space in the solar system, here.

For all the fear-mongering about 1% of the population owning the robots and everyone else starving in the streets, it seems somewhat more likely that, with some effort, we'll be able to solve the /mind-bendingly difficult task/ of having enough of everything for everyone.
