Not to nitpick, but wouldn't a society in which production is decoupled from labor only be post-scarcity if the rate of increase of the rate of production exceeds the rate of increase of demand. (ie, if p' = (1-a)p and d' = bd then ap > bd)

For a (pretty bad) historical example: slavery-based societies were not post-scarcity, even though the consumers were not the producers.

In any case, barring some REALLY good AI, I expect that automation will simply increase the effectiveness of what human workers do. (Thus the "Short term future" disclaimer) In this version of events, the case where production is truly decoupled doesn't actually happen.
