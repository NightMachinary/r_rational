Institutions tend to reflect the people who create and maintain them. In order to talk about "humanity's goals", you need to build a causal structure that goes /from/ those goals, wherever in reality you found any such things, /to/ institutions. Right now we have no such structure, because there's no a priori reason for it to exist.
