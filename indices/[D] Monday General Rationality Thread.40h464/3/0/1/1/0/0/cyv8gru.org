  I have never seen people pull arbitrary small probabilities out of their ass in the manner described to get '0.01'.

Funny thing: I've been /asked/ for such a thing. "What's the subjective probability you'll come work here after you graduate?" was the question.

And of course I didn't give an answer, because even back then I knew my brain didn't have a neat mechanism built-in for giving a probability mass to some arbitrary question like that.
