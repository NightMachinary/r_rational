I don't think [[/u/eaturbrainz]] is talking about LW rationality (which, yes, explicitly says that feelings and fun are ok).

Outside LW, "rationality" is often portrayed as the opposite of emotions, which are bad (or, if the author likes emotions, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawVulcan][rationality is bad]] instead).
