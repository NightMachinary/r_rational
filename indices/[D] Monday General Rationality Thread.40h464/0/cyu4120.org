So for the last few years I've been tweaking my personal finance and budgeting system. And now it turns out I've basically re-invented double book accounting.

Obviously, I didn't do as good a job as the accountants who've been using and refining the method for the last thousand plus years.

Now I'm looking for some good software to transition all my records over to. Playing with GnuCash, but I'd ideally like something with better Android support.
