Ah! Well it's okay to dislike that kind of talk! It's not necessary to be into that in order to disagree with climate change denialists. There are tons of people, most people in fact, who aren't really into that stuff, but also reasonably say "the vast majority of scientists and climatologists in particular believe in climate change. It seems reasonable to follow their lead" and that works out great. No need to get too fancy with it.
