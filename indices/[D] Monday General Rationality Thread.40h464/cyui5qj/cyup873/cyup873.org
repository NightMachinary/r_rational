RE: Normative Theory, maybe I can help, since I don't know what normative theory is. Is it "Normative Ethics" [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative_ethics#Normative_ethical_theories][(wikipedia link)]]? I don't know anything about it so it's not packed in with other things for me.

RE: Rationality, if what you're saying is "I don't like rationality (as in, the rationality community on the internet), and I also don't like global-warming denialists and Ray Kurzweil", these are not mutually exclusive beliefs. I think there are lots of people who don't identify as Rationalists who are anti-Kurzweil and anti climate change denialist. Since I think you already know that, I'm guessing I missed something here. What exactly is the problem?
