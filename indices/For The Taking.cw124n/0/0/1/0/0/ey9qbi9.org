  Why can't demons make people?
#+end_quote

I don't believe it's ever explained.

Glowfic magic systems are usually consistent, but don't always come with a Watsonian reason for their quirks.

Demons /can/ copy embryos that will grow into sapient adults. (As they currently do not have artificial womb technology, this only becomes relevant when they encounter an egg-laying sapient species.)

They /can/ copy most kinds of sapient AIs. Exceptions and complications do exist, though it's unclear if those are caused by magic and/or exceptionally good DRM.

They /cannot/ copy even people who come from apparently pure materialist universes without known afterlives.

They /cannot/ copy "magic" things. But the difference between "magic", "sufficiently advanced technology", and "sufficiently advanced technology that relies on different laws of physics" isn't always clear, so you often can't predict whether or not a demon will be able to copy a given thing-that-doesn't-exist-IRL.

  why won't any of the disparate un-coordinated demons provide a copy of the video data?

If the protagonist had kept at it long enough, he would eventually have found an agreeable demon.

One of the unmentioned reason why some ethical demons choose to maintain that masquerade is that it provides a (comparatively) harmless outlet for the less ethical demons who want to mess with humans. If they're having fun trying to convince desperate humans to "sell their soul", then they're not trying to murder them or to go on a rampage.
