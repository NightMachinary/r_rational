  and now the government is going to crack down more and make the process more complicated with extra rules, even though this can't stop it from happening again, etc, etc.

Yup. Later in the timeline, after a few atrocities occur, it becomes illegal in most countries to summon without a license (which requires courses & exams).

But that only restricts conscientious summoners. /Stupid/ summoners are extremely hard to stop. All you need is a writing implement, a flat surface, and a summoning circle template.

Since there was mass distribution of summoning instructions during Revelation, /in a world that has the Internet/, circle knowledge is all but impossible to contain.

(Plus, having liberal summoning laws generates a ludicrous amount of wealth. People are bad at balancing that sort of thing against existential risks, as we know in the real world.)

  It's almost like there'd have to be some Demon Summoner Police out there enforcing the rules and getting into wacky hijinx with desperate summoners...

Later in the timeline, there's actually a police force that punishes /daevas/. It's quite clever: when a daeva is convicted of a crime, the police draws a whole bunch of summoning circles addressed to that specific daeva (you can do that). If that daeva is foolish enough to answer a summon, it's overwhelmingly likely to be one of theirs.

Once summoned, the daeva is made harmless by the circle's bindings and cannot leave until dismissed. The summoner just never offers the daeva a deal, so they're stuck in a perfect prison for the duration of their sentence.

Daevas who got perpetuity still escape on their summoner's death. But more circles have already been drawn for them, so if they have any sense they'll never answer a summon again.

(Though it's not a very humane system. Since daevas - especially demons - don't have human rights, some are left to stew for decades in what amounts to extra-terrible solitary confinement. Including some innocent demons, since demons are not allowed to speak even to defend themselves at trial.)
