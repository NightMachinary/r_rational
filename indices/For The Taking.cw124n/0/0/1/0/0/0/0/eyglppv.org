  Are you the original author of the piece?
#+end_quote

Just read far too many other stories in this setting.

  As the embryos are not sapient (ie: lack a soul), this is sensible.
#+end_quote

It does at least rule out the Christian "supernatural soul infused at conception" model.

  Is the AI fully sapient, or merely a really good Turing impersonator?
#+end_quote

Can't say for certain, any more than I can say of most glowfic humans that they aren't philosophical zombies, because glowfics almost never let you see inside characters' heads. But they behave indistinguishably from humans ([[https://www.glowfic.com/posts/153?per_page=100][or Tolkien elves]], as the case may be).

(Though like I said, the data on this topic is pretty noisy. E.g. those android elves /can't/ be copied directly - the copy would have a braindead brainchip. But you /can/ make a blank brainchip and, separately, a big computer that hosts the mind data, then transfer the mind data into the brainchip to get a sapient elf. BUT this is maybe due to DRM, which may or may not be /magic/ DRM, put in place by the sufficiently-advanced-or-perhaps-magic demigods of that universe. /And/ there's another demigod who's able to run an elf's mind data on a big computer, so it's not like the brainchip is somehow the true source of sapience. It's all shit like that.)

  I'm pretty sure the psychopathic murderhobo demons don't really care.
#+end_quote

True. Thinking further, the worry is more that a troll demon will do something stupid. Most demons have lived their entire eternal life in a world with no death, no serious physical pain (demons have a pretty swell invulnerability), and no material scarcity. I can totally imagine one deciding to paint a continent pink, and doing it /very badly/.

(In the long run I think Daevinity's Earth is doomed. Even though mass-murdering psychopath demons are very rare and so are humans stupid enough to forget key bindings, they both exist. /Eventually/ stupidity will meet psychopathy and there will be a black hole where Earth used to be. No glowfic has explored this theme yet though.)
