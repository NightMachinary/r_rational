This is really good! I like that there are at least half a dozen possible interpretations of what's actually going on.

I do think the "superintelligence maximizing number of souls to take" angle sounds a little implausible, since if demons can actually construct anything, an incredibly smart demon that got loose once could probably construct a self-replicator that made humans breed super fast or something. Maybe taking human souls the old fashioned way is like the demon equivalent of organic farming, but it seems more likely that something fishy is going on with the whole soul situation.
