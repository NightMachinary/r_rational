  Just read far too many other stories in this setting.

OK, so it's a setting with a lot of work by this author or collective works of authors in the same universe? That's cool.

  It does at least rule out the Christian "supernatural soul infused at conception" model.
#+end_quote

That's pretty odd, considering it says numerous times in the bible that "life begins with the blood". If anything, this version seems to adhere more to the 'source material', as it were.

  But you can make a blank brainchip and, separately, a big computer that hosts the mind data, then transfer the mind data into the brainchip to get a sapient elf.

Sensible, as you have to leave an area for mind transferral mechanics to work, so it's always going to be a 'loophole' to the 'no copying people directly' rules.

  I can totally imagine one deciding to paint a continent pink, and doing it very badly.

That doesn't threaten the game, though. That just shows why summoners have to be EXTRA CAREFUL, and now the government is going to crack down more and make the process more complicated with extra rules, even though this can't stop it from happening again, etc, etc.

  Eventually stupidity will meet psychopathy and there will be a black hole where Earth used to be. No glowfic has explored this theme yet though.

It's almost like there'd have to be some Demon Summoner Police out there enforcing the rules and getting into wacky hijinx with desperate summoners... alright, I'm gonna stop now, this is starting to sound like a bad anime.
