Good ideas. They don't work because a summoning circle only has power over the daeva it was used to summon. One daeva per circle, one circle per daeva.

Yeah, once you have immortal summoners things get much easier. Assuming you're okay morally with eternal imprisonment, anyway.

(Daevinity crossed-over with settings that have immortality a couple of times, but it was always immortality + tons of extra magic, so they just used the tons of magic to figure out a more humane and effective solution.)
