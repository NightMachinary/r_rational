Are you the original author of the piece?

#+begin_quote
  Demons can copy embryos that will grow into sapient adults.
#+end_quote

As the embryos are not sapient (ie: lack a soul), this is sensible.

#+begin_quote
  They can copy most kinds of sapient AIs
#+end_quote

Can they? Do they? Is the AI fully sapient, or merely a really good Turing impersonator? Perhaps simply a very complicated Chinese Room or VI?

#+begin_quote
  They cannot copy even people who come from apparently pure materialist universes without known afterlives.
#+end_quote

Pretty sure this is beyond the scope of this specific fic.

#+begin_quote
  If the protagonist had kept at it long enough, he would eventually have found an agreeable demon.
#+end_quote

This.

#+begin_quote
  If they're having fun trying to convince desperate humans to "sell their soul", then they're not trying to murder them or to go on a rampage.
#+end_quote

I'm pretty sure the psychopathic murderhobo demons don't really care. Hence the extra layers of the binding and such which hopefully are used to prevent this sort of behavior.
