Why? Just make concentric summoning circles and add 'layers' as necessary.

From what you said, the circle itself does the binding. Just make 'demon cells' the size of phone booths and stack them on a series of ring plates slightly larger than the previous one as the time begins to run out, having a new guy 'complete' the circle each time.

Put THOSE in an even bigger facility with a /giant/ circle around it that gets updated from time to time.

Alternatively, if they can be summoned by AI or uploaded humans, create or hire "Warden" programs that do the job in perpetuity.
