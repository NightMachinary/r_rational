Right, so we know that souls exist.

Given that demons are /not/ coordinated, and given that some of them do a horrible amount of damage, not caring about their affect on other people, why won't any of the disparate un-coordinated demons provide a copy of the video data?

Granted, the author does state that the souls thing really was a joke in the source material, but I really don't think that fits the evidence as presented in the story.

Of course this presents a very interesting mirror to the whole AI box thing, which I presume was the intent?
