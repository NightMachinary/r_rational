  Did you write this piece? Ifnot, how do you know this?

I've read a few hundred pages of fiction from the same author set in this universe.

It's a setting for [[https://glowfic.com/][glowfics]]. While this piece is a lovely read on its own, and I often recommend it as such, there /are/ canon answers to the questions it leaves open.

(As usual, I /do not recommend glowfics/. The typical writing quality is nowhere near that of this fic, and the format is bad for storytelling.)

  If anything, this would result in morally good post-human spirit beings specifically trying to warn people in order to prevent them from reaching the shitty afterlife.

That will eventually happen. There's one demon in this fic who tries, which is what eventually leads the protagonist to the truth.

At this point in the setting's timeline (20-30 years after Revelation), most of the ex-humans haven't yet figured out how this all works - and they're competing for summons with billions of natural-born daevas who have even less of a clue.

Many won't have met any other ex-human yet. Only Hell has awesome internet everywhere to collate information, and nobody lets demons speak.
