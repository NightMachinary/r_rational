Note that the vast majority of daevas aren't former humans. They just pop up as fully formed adults (with human-like psychology).

And the vast majority of former humans aren't daevas, at least at this point in the setting's timeline, because it only happens to people who summoned at least once. The others go to Limbo, which is a much shittier afterlife.
