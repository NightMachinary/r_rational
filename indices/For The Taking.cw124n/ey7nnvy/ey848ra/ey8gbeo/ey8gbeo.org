It's fairly obvious they don't take souls because they can't. People become demons or angels or whatever after they die as part the natural lifecycle.

The 'not talking' bit exists likely because earlier summoners figured out the game, but then when sharing their knowledge put in limitations to keep people from realizing that humans are just the 'larval form' in the life cycle of these creatures. Explains why not even the most evil among the demons is willing to threaten humanity as a whole (they won't summon black holes or create super-plagues or the like of their own volition, or agree to it if chosen).

Thanks for posting this one, I rather like it.
