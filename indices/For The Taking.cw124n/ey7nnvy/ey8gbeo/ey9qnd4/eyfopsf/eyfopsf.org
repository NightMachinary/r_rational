  Note that the vast majority of daevas aren't former humans. They just pop up as fully formed adults (with human-like psychology).

Did you write this piece? Ifnot, how do you know this?

We know of an example of at least /one/ who is clearly a post-human who wants to get in contact with people she knew in life. We don't know whether this means that /all/ demons are post-humans, or if there's a percentage. At least some are, but so long as one exists, the con is needed to keep humans from figuring out the game.

  because it only happens to people who summoned at least once. The others go to Limbo, which is a much shittier afterlife.

You would have to be the author to know this, otherwise this is baseless speculation. If anything, this would result in morally good post-human spirit beings *specifically trying to warn people* in order to prevent them from reaching the shitty afterlife.
