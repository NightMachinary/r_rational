So, all sound comes from vibration, basically? And we already know sound can get REALLY loud, like sonar clicks from whales and so forth. I don't have a specific headcanon, but I imagine either a purpose-built bladder whose job is to squeeze a lot of air with very high pressure through a very narrow aperture, or a set of fast-twitch opposing muscles that do something like yank a bone back and forth /very/ quickly.
