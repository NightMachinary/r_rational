Neat! I know every material has a resonance frequency (haven't read the article yet), but I wonder how possible it is to design a howl that kills your enemies eyeballs/brain tissue without also killing the Howler? Maybe it does burst their eardrums/liquify their brains or whatever, and they just heal with their super regeneration powers?
