  I dunno which is actually best; I'll probably alter them to all fit the same format when I do a final pass.

FWIW What makes sense to me is morpher/Yeerk in brackets, construct/host in italics. That way, brackets always mean an intentional message is being sent, and italics always mean thoughts/inner monologue.

In the Jake/Cassie conversation I assumed the brackets meant that Jake was choosing not to read morph!Cassie's mind, except the thoughts she chose to send.
