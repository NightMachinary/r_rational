  /When you're in morph, your brain is on pause, right? Being run on some kind of computer? So it can't change[...] state, right? That's why you guys couldn't fall asleep. So if I was able to concentrate hard enough to morph, then I'm going to be fine/ in /morph./

From chapter 7:

#+begin_quote
  I was grateful that I'd slept long enough to have them. It was the fourth night since the construction site, and I had yet to stay asleep for more than two hours in a row.

The kids are setting alarms to wake up and refresh their morph armor every two hours; i.e. you definitely /can/ sleep while in morph.

Chapter 7 author's note:

#+begin_quote
  Sometimes a continuity error is a continuity error, and sometimes it's plot.

I ctrl+f'd through 87 instances of the word "sleep" and didn't find anything saying you couldn't sleep while in morph, and I don't see why the god computer couldn't emulate sleep just like any other mental function. Is that what the fake continuity error was? I've been trying to figure that out for like 2 years now.
