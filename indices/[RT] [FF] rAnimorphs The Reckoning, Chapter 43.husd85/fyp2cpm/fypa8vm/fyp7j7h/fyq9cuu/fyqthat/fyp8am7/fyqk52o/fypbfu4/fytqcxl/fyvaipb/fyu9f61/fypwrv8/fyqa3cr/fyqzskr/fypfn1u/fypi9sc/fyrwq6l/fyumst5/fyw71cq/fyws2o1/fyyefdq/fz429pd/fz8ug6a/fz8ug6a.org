Woooo Howlers! I love the wave at the end, and half expected it to do a thumbs-up instead. Just imagining Rachel's added "...what?" reaction made me laugh.

Also, poor Rachel, but also also, of all the people for this to happen to, my model Rachel feels the most... able to handle it, in a strange way. Least inhibited by it? So it's neat to see her handling it so well.
