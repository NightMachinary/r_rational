I /cannot wait/ (except of course literally) for the remaining chapters. Anyone else up for an online-because-pandemic HPMOR-style wrap party?

[[/u/TK17Studios]] for my cameo I would like to request (as for HPMOR!) a reference to the /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Wizards][Young]] [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YoungWizards][Wizards]]/ series, either as a work of fiction featuring high stakes and noble sacrifice (including by children), or by the names of any of the notable human or alien characters. There are plenty!
