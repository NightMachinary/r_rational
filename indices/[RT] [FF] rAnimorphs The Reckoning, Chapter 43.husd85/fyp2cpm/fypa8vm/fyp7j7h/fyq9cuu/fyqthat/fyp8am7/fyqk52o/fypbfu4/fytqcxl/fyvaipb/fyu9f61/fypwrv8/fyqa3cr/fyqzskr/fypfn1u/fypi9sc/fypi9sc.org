Yay Howlers! Im as happy to see them as they are to see death and violence!

While I haven't commented much, apparently a comment I made for the "React to Visser 3s speech like you are a redditor was very close to being added but wasnt.

I had made a post fully buying into the "I'm a sad dying alien please pity me" gambit.

Would love a cameo as either Greckle, Mira or Emily, whichever works. That's in descending order of preference.
