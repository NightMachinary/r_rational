I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS! But they're all overwhelmed by "btw Rachel fought a Howler".

Maybe I missed it in book 26, but I got the impression that in canon, the only characterization of Howlers was mostly restricted to when Jake morphed one. This one meeting made the Howler seem like a pretty friendly assassin who I was sad to see go. You managed to, in one short scene, from the perspective of a character who still has difficulty thinking in complete words, characterize the Howlers most wonderfully. The only complaint I might have is that it seems slightly less threatening, but I'm not sure why considering that anyone short of an Animorph in Grizzly morph would have died four times over during those 10 seconds.

At this point, I'm not sure if I'm more concerned about the main conflict, or what's going to happen with Rachel, or if someone will introduce the Howlers to DragonBall Z so they can learn how to Goku the nice way.

Also, this is how you write tension. The story over all, combined with the tone of this chapter and Rachel's development throughout mean we have no idea what's going to happen. There are high stakes, but we don't know the precise details. We have no idea what the noise is and have no way of guessing, but there are several suspects, including the inoccuous. And when we get the description of the Howler, the answer is: one of the worst possible. This story does not pull its punches, Rachel is at a huge disadvantage, and if you aren't familiar with canon, it's not unreasonable to wonder if the outcome we got isn't going to have bad consequences anyway. And if you are familiar with canon and noticed the weirdness with Krayak and Ellimist surrounding Rachel, the implications of what just happened could well be extreme. I need to read this again when I'm not half asleep.

TLDR: ! ! ! <3 <3 :o

The tension ramble applies to the whole chapter, not just the ending, now that I reread this to be sure it's in English. The real question is how clear the plot of this part will be when it's complete, for those who read this and the last couple chapters together with the last few. This is kinda like the Tobias and Temrash chapter, with great stand-alone character stuff and weird-but-makes-sense-in-context twists, while advancing the plot. I want to keep going, but I think we might have upgraded to 75% asleep. It's not even night here.
