/Excellent./

Thoughts in no order:

-I 100% fell for the /fungible species/ juke. I was all, “Helmacrons? What? Guess we'll see!” And then it turned out to be everyone's favorite screaming lava monsters. Love it. So, looks like V3 learned how to build Howlers when Crayak signed the data with the 3D model all those zillions of chapters ago. Now V3 has reverse-engineered them, and was inspired by their fungibility processes to control his clonetrollers. That's amazing. Does this mean there was a #26-adjacent adventure offscreen, and one of the other Animorphs planted /waving/ in the Howlers' brain the way Jake did kissing in canon?

-Rachel [in Michael and Holly from The Office voice]: “No more brain damage!” Well, less, anyway. Nice trick with that bone in the Howler. Lucky it deafened her bear so it couldn't keep discombobulating her.

-Kids should definitely /not/ be going through puberty, morph-capable, in the middle of a war. Dates should be, like, getting coffee and going to a movie. Not turning into a corgi and playing fetch with your mentally handicapped girlfriend. How weird! They're gonna be so poorly adjusted after all this trauma :(

-Incidentally, while it's nice that they're dating and everything, I kinda (selfishly) hope it doesn't take much screentime. I find myself pretty consistently bored by romance plots in my fiction, especially when it comes to kids. I recognize that that's mostly just a me thing, though.

So pumped for more chapters, now that everything is finally coming to a close - but of course, it'll come as a terrible blow when it all really does end. Such duality
