The Wikipedia article above has a surprisingly good character list! If I had to pick two, Nita Callahan and Kit Rodriguez plus their not-exactly-imaginary friend the peridexis (aka "bobo" ðŸ˜…) would be the ones to pick.

But there's also Ed "the pale slayer" / immortal great white shark, if anyone needs to be eaten in an ocean, Mamvish the alien sauropod,... lots of options depending on what you want the characters for.
