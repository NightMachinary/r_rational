I'm glad for the d'aww in this chapter. <3

  ‹Yes, thanks to a supreme lack of judgment on Ante's part, and me being stupid enough to think it wouldn't be a problem to give one to him. We don't let him in here anymore.›

  I couldn't tell if he was joking or not.

I couldn't tell either.

  ‹Fuck off, Fridwulfa,› he said blithely, jerking back out of reach.

Relatable. I figure that's a Howler, but still, relatable.

A thing that I think this story's done a few times, is having someone come up with an idea that my reaction is like /wtf are you thinking/. And then they explain and I'm anywhere from /sold/ to /yeah okay I can see it I guess/. I like it. I feel like I'm often more convinced than I ought to be, but it's good to know that about myself, too.

I'd love a cameo under the name Phil!
