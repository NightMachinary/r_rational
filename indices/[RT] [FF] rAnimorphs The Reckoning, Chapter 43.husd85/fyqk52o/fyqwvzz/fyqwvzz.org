re: 1, my headcanon is that Marco considered it but they decided against it because they're all running around all over the place and having a brain-damaged Rachel tumbling out of your morph at an inopportune moment is :(

re: 2, in Chapter 15 when we saw a Marco morph come alive from the Marco morph's perspective, I had the viewpoint character's thoughts in italics and the controlling realMarco's thoughts in brackets.

In Chapter 31, with Jake talking to his awoken Cassie morph, I had them both talk in brackets.

Here, I went back to having the viewpoint character's thoughts be in italics, though this time the viewpoint character is the controller and not the awoken morph.

I dunno which is actually best; I'll probably alter them to all fit the same format when I do a final pass.

re: 3, yes, Rachel and Helium have met, and while it wasn't in the chapter, headcanon-as-author is that they've tried /both/ infestation /and/ morphing to peek at her memories themselves, and it's all just FUBAR. Like, Garrett morphing into Rachel can't make any more sense out of her brain than Rachel herself can.

As for getting inside an alien mind, I do a variety of things. With Andalites, I spent some time thinking about what it would be like to be an intelligent prey species, and what it would be like to be able to see all around you at all times. With Yeerks, I tried to figure out what it would be like to be psychically communicating in a lump, and realized they probably wouldn't be particularly individualized. With the Arn, I just tried to work backwards from "somehow they didn't give a shit about the Yeerks??" and build a viable psychology that has very different goals. Etc. etc. Different stuff every time.

David: check!
