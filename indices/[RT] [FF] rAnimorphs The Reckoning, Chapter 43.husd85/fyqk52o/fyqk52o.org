Love love love love love love love!

I was so ready for the next chapter to be Tobias or Visser; this was an awesome surprise.

One thing I love about this story is how it's filled with syndrome nods to canon plot points, despite a completely different plot. If I'm right, we're at about the right point in the story for "Rachel gets an enticing offer from Crayak"; so it'll be interesting to see what she pulls out of that Howler morph.

A few notes/questions:

1. Did the kids consider that they could keep Rachel safeish/stop possibly worsening brain damage by subsuming her into a morph? I don't think they've even talked much about the fact that every morph is a walking stasis chamber.

2. Are the dialog tags in the morph conversation reversed? Shouldn't Marco's thoughts be in italics since Rachel is reading them directly, and Rachel's half of the conversation in <thought-speak tags>?

3. Have Rachel and Helium met yet? Have they considered having Perd√£o go in and try to repair the damage directly?

Another thing I really love is getting to see inside so many alien minds. What was researching/writing like? I really hope we get a Howler and/or Pemalite POV soon.

If my comments over the years are worthy of a cameo, there's a little nine-year-old version of me who's still in here somewhere, and he would love nothing more than for there to be a good guy David in the Animorphs universe.
