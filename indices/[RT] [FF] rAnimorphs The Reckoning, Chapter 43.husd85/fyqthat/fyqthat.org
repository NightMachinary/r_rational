I did pour a bit of my heart and soul into that one comment speculating about how Andalite thought speech is uniquely suited to break down the identity barrier between yeerk and host. If that counts, I'd like a cameo as JJREEVE (if it's another reddit like chapter) or just Reeve if it's not.

And with this wonderful new update I have the urge to speculate even more. The Holwers, in canon what they did was for fun. The killing was all a game for them. Given how this one acted after getting stabbed it seems to be holding up. Waving goodbye to your opponent seems kinda like the Howler's way if saying "good game". The question is why? Why are they so cavalier about possibly dying? It's one thing to like fighting when you are winning, but to relish it just as much when you lose is a strange thing.

I think it ultimately stems from their shared memory thing. Since every Howler can remember what any other Howler did with it's life they might identify as actually being those other Howlers. They'd still probably have individual quirks and personalities, and it's unlikely that any one Howler could remember the whole race all at once. But for the individuals dying might not register as the end of their existence. Since all that they have done and are will live on in another of the species it's more like respawning in a video game.

So perhaps you have a Howler that considers itself The Clever One, it likes to trick its enemies into clever traps or ambushes, and loves trying out new tactics to keep opponents off balance. It remembers former Howlers that also considered themselves to be The Clever One, and indeed considered itself to actually be the same person as those other Howlers, just as it considers future Howlers who remember it in particular to be their future lives. For a Howler, death isn't cessation of bodily functions, it's when none of the living Howler bodies spend time thinking about/remembering the memplex that served as an attracting point for a Howler identity.

(I hope this makes sense)
