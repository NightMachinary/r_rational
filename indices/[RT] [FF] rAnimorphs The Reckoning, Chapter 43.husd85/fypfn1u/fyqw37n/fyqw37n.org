  The only complaint I might have is that it seems slightly less threatening

Something that will be at least clearly implied and possibly explicitly discussed in the next two chapters (so you can hold off on the very small spoiler if you want) is that the Howlers, having a childlike perspective and a collective memory and basically no fear of death, deliberately test the waters when they're dealing with a new system/species. They send cautious scouts who don't ramp up to 100 right away, but instead poke and prod and investigate and record. This Howler saw Rachel transforming from one form to another, so it wanted to see what she was made of/how good of a fighter she was, rather than just outright killing her.

  Also, this is how you write tension.

  The real question is how clear the plot of this part will be when it's complete
#+end_quote

Hopefully, it'll be unambiguous in broad strokes, though I may fudge small details (like, clearly Marco and Jake were elsewhere running errands, and we may not specify exactly what errands they were up to at that exact moment, but we'll see the gist of what everyone was doing).
