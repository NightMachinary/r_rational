Man, thanks for this! I remember a few chapters ago I said I was having trouble following things and what I'd like is Marco to explain every step of the plot to a literal 8 year old and well this chapter was basically that?

Cute scenes with fetch, Rachel's very real feeling without being annoying to read struggles with memory, and impaling the howler with her own arm stump (which reminsd me of like, every gruesome thing that happened in canon) is everything.

Regarding the cameos, should we be posting full human names? Or just first names? Or just things that look like usernames?
