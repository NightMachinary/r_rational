I'm excited that we are getting close to the end! I'm also sad, because I know I'll want more after this story is complete.

I've commented a few times before, and I also drew fanart of an R!andalite a few years back. If I can still have a cameo, I would like “Liv”. With bonus points for any Liv/Live puns.
