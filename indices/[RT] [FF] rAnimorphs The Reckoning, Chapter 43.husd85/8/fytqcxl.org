I love how Rachel stays Rachel throughout all of this. Even through struggles with thought and memory, her determination and refusal to just give up and be weak is such a core part of her character, and I find this inspiring.

Also, her fight with the Howler. It really highlights how Rachel isn't just a brute-force-no-tactics fighter, as she's so often characterized. Very well done.

This is like my third comment, so it's not a high priority, but if there's room, a cameo under Christina would be fantastic. :)
