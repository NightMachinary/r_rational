Please don't. HP:MoR is not realistic, nor is it intended to be. Donald Trump is not a pure evil mastermind. Acting as though a real politician matches the last popular movie/comic/whatever villain (Palpatine, Voldemort, Amanda Waller, whatever) is a petty and harmful habit.

Yeah, it makes you look cool and funny and it's an excellent way to signal cynicism or whatever, but I don't want any of it here, and I hope most of the community agrees. This sub is about rational fiction, not signaling how much we hate a politician.

EDIT: Okay, this is a weird thing to ask, but please don't downvote me? Or if you do, please tell me why you did? Downvoting is generally supposed to apply to posts that aren't constructive and civil (eg: posts filled with insults, spam, NSFW content), not things you disagree with. I personally want to see interesting posts upvoted on reddit, even if I don't like what they say, and garbage/uncivil posts downvoted even if I mostly agree with the content.
