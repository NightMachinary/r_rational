I think that discussing politics can be great and enlightening, and I respect Eliezer Yudkowsky and his opinions; I think the "Trump is like Monroe" plan is neither discussing politics nor in accordance with EY's philosophy (whatever it's worth).

What this post does is tribal signaling, plus cynicism signaling. I think the intent behind this post is to wave a "Donal Trump is awful" flag (plus a "democracy is broken" flag), so we can all enjoy how we're all part of a group that despises Donald Trump. By comparison, EY's post was about how the media and the electorate (allegedly) create a perverse incentive system for politicians, plus a bit of dramatic cynicism-signaling on the side. I'm okay with that, because I like reading political analyses. I really, really do not like reading people engaging in tribal behavior, and I don't want *any* here, for what my personal opinion is worth.

You can believe that Trump is awesome or terrible, you can even argue for or against him in the appropriate threads, but as far as I'm concerned waiving tribal flags for any cause is beyond the line, whether that cause is against Trump, feminism, Nice Guys, Creationists or whatever.
