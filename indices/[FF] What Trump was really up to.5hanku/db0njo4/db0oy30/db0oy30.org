Oh, lighten up. Eliezer Yudkowsky himself posted stuff like this on his [[https://www.facebook.com/yudkowsky/posts/10153991776834228][facebook feed]], and he's the person who started the whole concept of rationalist fiction. It's funny and interesting, and that's all that matters.

I think a big part of the reason Less Wrong failed was because people got the idea stuck in their head that in order to be objective one has to be politically neutral, which meant tolerating the Death Eaters that came to infest the place - somehow forgetting that the kind of person who becomes a Death Eater in the first place isn't exactly going to reciprocate when it comes to being tolerant.

If you're talking about things we don't want this community to become, "Den of Death Eaters" would be at the top of my list.
