RE Downvoting: I downvoted you initially because of the hostile and irked tone in response to what I saw as an innocent post. Also see my reply below for why I think that kind of knee-jerk reaction to anything political is bad for the community.

I cancelled the downvote when I saw your reasoning, which I thought was fair. Bear in mind that every post in this comment section has gotten downvotes, which always happens whenever a controversial/political topic comes up, so I wouldn't take it personally. I do have sympathy for your 'no politics please' stance for that very reason though - it brings out a lot of status signalling behaviour which isn't exactly the finest aspect of our human nature.
