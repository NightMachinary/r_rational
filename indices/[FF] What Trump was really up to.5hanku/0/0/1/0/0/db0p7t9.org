I know that the Republicans and Democrats are at war (well, at least the Republicans are - I'm not sure anyone remembered to inform the Democrats) but that doesn't explain why the /left/ hates her so much. That's the part that confuses me.

I mean, part of it is that they liked Bernie more and she was his opponent in the primaries, sure. But even before that. Was it just that she ran against Obama? But I think even Cristopher Hitchens wrote endlessly about the Clintons being corrupt. Why?

I suspect a big part of it is the fact that the left is focused entirely around this idea of 'rebelling against the system', which as a driving force has the critical flaw that whoever is leading the movement is also seen as an enemy. Kind of like the French revolution, where every time the leader of the revolution was beheaded for being in charge, and the next in command just kept stepping up thinking it would never happen to /them/.

Honestly the left just seems to have chronic backstabbing syndrome to me, sometimes.
