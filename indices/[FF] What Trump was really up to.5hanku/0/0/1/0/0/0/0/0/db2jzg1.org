Oh, it absolutely does. See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Cantor][Eric Cantor]], one of the most conservative Senators in Congress, who still wasn't conservative enough; he got primaried and beaten by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Brat][David Brat]], who thinks that free market economics only work because of Protestant Christianity. It also occurred with Paul Ryan and McCain, who both faced primary challengers from the Trump wing of the party this election, and at the Presidential level with Bush I, who faced a primary challenge from Pat Buchanan for raising taxes.
