That's probably a bad way of looking at it.

Trump got a lot of hate from centrist Republicans and libertarians, so they clearly didn't fall in line. And, well, Clinton got a lot of hate from leftists because she fought the left, in the same Trump got hate from centrists because he fought the center.

If you saw another run like 1992's Bush I, where he fought off a radical right-wing candidate, you'd see the right being just as pissed again.
