Yeah, I think you've probably hit the nail on the head there: Nothing generates hatred like the feeling that you've been 'betrayed' by someone you put your trust in. It's probably the same reason that the Left in England hate hate hate Tony Blair, even though he did not seem so terrible to me (awful decision to join the war notwithstanding).

I wonder, does the same phenomenon exist on the right? When right wing figures move to the left, do they generate the same kind of hatred? I'm trying to think of some, but when I think of people like i.e. Mitt Romney moving to the centre it doesn't seem to work the same way (though he did not actually become president).
