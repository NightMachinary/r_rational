Our politics descends into mudslinging pretty fast, and things have polarized between the Republicans and Democrats in the last few decades. Used to be that bipartisan bills got passed, but now the two parties are effectively at war. The Republicans need some way to shut Hilary down and she hasn't given them any major failures, so they need to invent and exaggerate scandals. They found a few -- money donated to a foundation that the Clintons control, the private email server that wasn't in alignment with regulations, etc -- and they blow them into giant news. It's all baloney -- they keep investigating her and there keeps being nothing there. Either she is the most brilliant criminal mastermind in the history of the world or she is the subject of an ongoing and successful smear campaign by her political rivals. (It's the second one.)
