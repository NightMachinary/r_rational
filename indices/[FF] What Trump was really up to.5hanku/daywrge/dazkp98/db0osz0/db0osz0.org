The topic of Hilllary corruption is one of those things that just confuses me. On the one hand, every rational person on the planet agrees that Clinton is better than Trump, and when I watch Bill Maher or read Paul Krugman or any of my usual sources of US news they all agree that the whole thing is overblown and stupid.

But then I listen to people on the left like Kyle Kulinski from The Young Turks (who seem fairly sensible), who are outraged and claim that there is vast evidence of Clinton corruption and that the establishment left just doesn't want to cover it because they want Trump to lose. Which I guess is plausible.

But then when pressed for said evidence, all I ever hear is claims of "pay to play" where Saudi Arabia gives money to the Clinton foundation for example, but there is never any evidence that that money is used for anything but helping children in need. So what's the problem supposed to be exactly?

The whole thing just confuses me.
