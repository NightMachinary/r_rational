The left dislikes Clinton for a lot of reasons. Part of that is that she spent a year running against Bernie, and they perceive that as fighting against the policies that they supported, but it's more than that.

Bill basically ran as the most right-wing Democrat in a while, focusing on capturing the centrists at the expense of the left, and the left remembers this. He slashed welfare ("hands up, not hand outs), increased the number of people in jail when his party wasn't as tough on crime, and passed NAFTA. NAFTA, especially, lost the working class manufacturing-type leftists.

Hillary had to deal with this baggage, but also the fact that she was the most hawkish Democrat since LBJ. She wanted no-fly zones over Syria, for example, an idea that Obama, Sanders, and the left generally opposed.

And then there was her stupidly going against full legalization of marijuana when 60% of the country supported it.

And /then/ there were the constant right-wing media attacks on her for several decades.
