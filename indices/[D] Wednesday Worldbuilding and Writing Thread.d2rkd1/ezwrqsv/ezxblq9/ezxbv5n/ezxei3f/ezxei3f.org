If you posit a time travel device which can go back in its own timeline and then go the slow way back to the future it left, the destruction of everything and everyone who could create such a thing is the only way for time to stabilize. Since everything is happening at once, for all intents and purposes, it will appear to happen everywhere and everywhen instantly. Unless the time travel has a DO NOT MESS WITH TIME clause preventing infinite processing power, it will happen by AI. Even if it doesn't, you've created mass and energy, stealing it from a future which no longer exists. Assuming people keep doing this, the mass of the universe will continue to increase until gravity pulls it all back into a black hole. This might not happen instantly, depending on how quickly mass can be created by this method, but it will happen. You might even get an AI which wants to make it happen everywhen at once, stealing mass from the end of the universe to dump it at every past point.

If you want this to not instantly destroy the universe, you have a couple of options. The easiest is to make each jump actually dump you in a parallel universe exactly like your original up to the point of your arrival. Since no time travellers will ever arrive in the same universe, none of them will Big Crunch. You could make it function as a way of viewing, but not changing, the past. You could make it work only a finite number of times per universe. You could make it work like Time Turners, with inbuilt don't-destroy-the-world protections. In fact, if time travel is possible, that's the most likely kind from the pure Bayesian observation that the universe hasn't been destroyed yet.

The reason good time travel stories are rare is because time travel is the most dangerous activity to be treated blithely in fiction.
