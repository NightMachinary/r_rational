time travel in stories always falls into the trap of people being stupid. what rules would encourage rational time travel?

offhand, the biggest problem tends to be one person having time travel and keeping it secret. instead, a corporate lab with a time travel device that consumes a large amount of power makes more sense. a mass (the traveller, their gear, and the time-pod) is sent through time. with enough infastructure, you could build a relay of power supplies through time to extend your range.

so, if the Time Corp has a base in a secluded part of north america, and can send things backwards or forwards for a good span of time (10 or 50 years), then they need infrastructure on the site that will still be there. so as they extend backwards, they change history... unless they move to a new base each time.

if you travel back in time, you had to set up the infastructure somewhere, and keep it running long enough to matter. if you jump in 50 year intervals, and find that the 50-years-ago base closed after 5 years, you start to look for a threat in 5 years time. 50 years forward, and you can check the records of what will have happened.

so, you can easily get a xanatos pileup of operations planning and infastructure. what rational ideas can you add to this line of thought? nuclear war in the future is not that interesting, but a yellowstone eruption would be interesting, and point to a change in base location.
