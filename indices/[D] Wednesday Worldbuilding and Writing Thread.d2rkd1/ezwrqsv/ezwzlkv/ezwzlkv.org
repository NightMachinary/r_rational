Time machines are not something that the-powers-that-be would be fine with just existing. With something that powerful, the company should expect to become the center of a massive political conflict - one that there's no guarantee they'll win. And if they don't win, then time travel is useless for them, as whoever gets the machine in the future will have plenty of opportunities to return and ensure their own victory.

Depending on the mechanics of time travel and the motivations of the users, it could be entirely rational to keep everything hidden. Sorry, I can't explore this any further atm, I'm feeling a bit tired. I am certainly interested in any ideas this thought process leads to.
