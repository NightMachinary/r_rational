Let me posit a simple time travel device which avoids these mass/energy generation issues.

I create a machine which, as part of its operation, draws in a small amount of energy and uses this to create a completely random bitstream. This is the receiver. I run it at a predetermined and well-recorded time (e.g. midnight on the first of January 2020).

I then create a second machine which uses time travel to change the bitstream generated by the first machine. I use this to manipulate the bitstream into being a sentence of recognisable English text (ASCII encoded).

In this manner, I am able to transfer information to the past /without/ transferring either mass or energy into the past.
