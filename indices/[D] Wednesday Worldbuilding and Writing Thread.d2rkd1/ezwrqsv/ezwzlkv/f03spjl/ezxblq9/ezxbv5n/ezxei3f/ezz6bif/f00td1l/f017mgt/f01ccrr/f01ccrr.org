With infinite processing power, someone will try to produce an AI. They will inevitably fail to keep it in the box, because they deliberately made a time traveling AI for some unknowable reason. In the near-certain chance the AI is misaligned, the Earth and possibly everything in Earth's light cone are destroyed. In this case, the destruction cannot proceed back before the first beacon was turned on, but it will occur immediately after that as the AI bootstraps itself into its past and the researchers' present.

One way to prevent this is to make sure there is only ever one active time travel device anywhere in Earth's light cone. The universe could still be destroyed if someone makes an AI on one of them, but the destruction wouldn't proceed back to the first device if it didn't have devices bridging all the intervening time. However, how can the researchers be sure they are the only ones with this tech? Not just on Earth, even, but anywhere in a backwards light cone large enough to encompass the origin of that AI and Earth? They can't.

The existence of this technology means the universe is inevitably doomed. Turning it on means, to some unknowable degree of certainty, that you are doomed. In fact, turning it on is an interesting Fermi Paradox test, as any time travelling AI will seek to find and infect your system before you do it, and if that fails to happen it means you are the only time travel team in a long distance.
