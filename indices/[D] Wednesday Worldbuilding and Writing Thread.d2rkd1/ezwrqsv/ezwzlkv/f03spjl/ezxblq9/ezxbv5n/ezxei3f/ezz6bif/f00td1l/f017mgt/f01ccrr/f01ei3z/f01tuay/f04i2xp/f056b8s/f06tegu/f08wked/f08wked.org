If the world is that doomed-seeming and not already destroyed, it might be safe to use.

Might. I could still assume the blueprints were placed by some grandmaster plot by the AI to increase its complexity before intelligence explosion. That assumption requires a complexity penalty though. At that point I might read the messages, as any AI which can manipulate me through just reading could also probably manipulate the future just with the bitstream itself.

If the message contains code, I would ask a programmer I trust before running it on an airgapped VC miles from WiFi. If it contains instructions to do anything, I would think for at least an hour about how it could go wrong. My primary goal with my future knowledge is to acquire enough wealth to somehow destroy all the beacons, though I don't know how that would happen.
