I always keep one time travel rule in the back of my mind:

in non-paradoxical situations that allow causality-violating closed time loops, e.g., future you arriving to insert the password to defuse the bomb that would otherwise kill present you, you have to keep in mind that your own self-awareness is the most likely element to make such a situation too probabilistically unlikely to happen instead of, you know, future you /not/ coming to save you because the bomb explodes and kills you.

In particular, imagine you are looking at the bomb-defusing terminal. If you /see/ your future self arrive, introduce the password, and defuse the bomb, then by the time it's your turn to disable it for your past self, you'll probably keep in the back of your mind all the little details about how your future self did things, like posture, timing, blinks, etc., and you'll be too likely to (even subconsciously) not to it the exact same way, and so the most likely thing to happen is that future you doesn't come to save you from the bomb.

The take-away is: if you have a time machine but currently unavaliable and are in a situation where future you could save you, position yourself in such a way that you don't notice the particulars of future you's actions (i.e. look away from where you think he'll come from and be), so that your own memories don't jeopardize the chances of him actually coming to save you. Schr√∂dinger's time-travel paradox: the best way to avoid paradoxes is to make sure they aren't obvserved.
