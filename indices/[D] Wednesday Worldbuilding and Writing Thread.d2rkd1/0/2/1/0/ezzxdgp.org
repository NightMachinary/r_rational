plus the timeline is moving forward on both ends at the same time rate. 50 years back means, if i want to send two capsules, i need energy and materials for two of them. initially i will have infastructure for one. pods returning to base will have a password and encryption (basic IT security at least), and use the best encryption availible (possibly one-time pads, provided on departure). there is no explosion, because at no time do we have infinite power to send infinite mass. instead we get information paradoxes, and consider who knew what when.

any pods in the future should know when the arrival points will be availible in the past. if an obstruction prevents transit, then either nothing happens or we suffer a failure state (energy has to go somewhere). if a failure state happens, that is a barrier to entry for new time machines from other sources.

so lets make an assumption: in the future, Dr. Science will build a time machine and travel back 50 years successfully. he then uses his knowledge to build the time company, and his successor runs the company in the future, using the next stage of time travel AFTER the original inventor moves backwards in time. to this point, the company has made most its money from knowledge from the future. the original time traveller is now either retired, or in the past, and either has terrible memory or refuses to tell some secrets.

now, we are back to 50 years in the future, and have a new reuseable time-pod. the next goal is to expand the reach of time travel, and the pod from 50 years in the future travels back to now. this is a new pod created in the future. it has a one-time pad encryption handshake using the system in place, and information from the future. now we have two pods, and one of them will move forward once it recharges (with the confrimation of its arrival). this could involve a paradox test, such as shuffling cards or rolling dice, to check for the butterfly effect.

next, a pod is sent back in time, where it is greeted by the inventor in the past. the data packet helps set up the company, with 100 years of knowledge to bootstrap with. after recharging, the pod returns with confrimation of the job completed. does this impact the timeline it returns to? or was this always part of the original timeline? everyone at the three points in time sit down and study the data for a couple of weeks.

we do get an interesting dilema- if we get no pod from the future, we instead send a pod into the future to investigate. if we find a problem, we will take action to change any bad future to one that will be able to send us data. ergo the future should send us a pod with data unless there is an unavoidable problem. in this time, new pods should arrive.
