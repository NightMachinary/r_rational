A very self-consistent answer. Does the answer change if the design for the Receiver is already available on the Internet, and you are therefore certain that there are multiple other Receivers in existence which malevolent future AI could use to persuade /other/ people? In this case, the existence of your Receiver provides zero additional risk over-and-above the already existing risk.
