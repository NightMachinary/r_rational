Returning to the original question, then; assume that you have access to such a Receiver. You do not have access to a Transmitter (yet). However, on several occasions when turning on your Receiver you will receive messages from someone claiming to be a yourself from a decade or more in the future. (You sometimes also receive messages claiming to be from beings or intelligences further in the future. At least one of these further-future messages consists entirely of a link to what turns out, after careful precautions are observed, to be a youtube video of Rick Astley singing 'never gonna give you up').

Every use of the Receiver potentially changes the timeline - that is to say, every message that you receive may come from a possible future wherein your Receiver gave you something other than the message you just received. (This implies that every time you receive a message from the Future You, you can never again receive a message from the same Future You).

How could you usefully use this time machine to further your goals?
