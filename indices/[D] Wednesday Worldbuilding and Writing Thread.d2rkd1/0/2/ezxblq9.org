With the type of time travel you're proposing, the moment the machine is turned on the Earth /at the very least/ will explode. This is because you will have created an infinite stream of events occuring in finite time, and someone is going to use the time machine to produce infinite processing power and create a misaligned AI. We know it will be misaligned because a well-aligned AI stands no chance once a misaligned one is created anywhere in the timeline or universe. It will have to dedicate resources to protecting humans which the misaligned AI will not and lose on sheer brute force every time. The only way for the time travel loops to end is to either destroy all time machines and people who could concievably create one, or to somehow precommit to using it exactly once and then destroying the machine and everyone who created it. In fact, the time traveller should do everything in their power to prevent their organization from ever having existed, while doing whatever it was they went back for.

Furthermore, everyone who creates such a machine will know that turning it on kills everyone in Earth's light cone. Including themselves. Just using the thing at all is an act of insanity, so attempting to rationalize it is impossible.
