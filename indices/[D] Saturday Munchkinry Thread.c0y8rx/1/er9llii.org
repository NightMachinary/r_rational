Someone finds a genie and thoughtlessly wishes for all the money in the world. The genie fulfills this literally: every single piece of money is immediately transferred to his possession. A massive cavern is magically created under his lawn to store all physical currency. All records and memories of any financial debts he owes are magically erased. At every bank, all accounts are merged into one under his name. Bank cards do not get teleported, but no longer connect to any account. On the other hand, valuable items that aren't actually money, like gold bars, art pieces, company stocks, etc. are not affected.

How would you respond to this crisis if you are the leader of a powerful country?
