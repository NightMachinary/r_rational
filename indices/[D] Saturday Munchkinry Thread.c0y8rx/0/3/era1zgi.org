What happens if you double-think in the truth dome? People can believe two contradictory statements at the same time. Everything would be truth to you, because any fact can be derived from a contradiction. Teach everyone who enters the truth dome the art of double-think and render its lie-detection capabilities meaningless.

What happens if you willingly utter an oath to break your oath? Will the oath bind you to be unbound by the oath, turning the magic of the platform against itself?

What if you take over your country and force everyone in every career to wear the exact same uniform? Would the mirrors be rendered utterly useless, since everyone would only see reflections of themselves in said uniforms regardless of their future careers?

What if you send someone infected with parasitic plants into the garden? Their wounds would heal quickly, but the plant parasites on them would also grow big and strong, giving them more wounds?
