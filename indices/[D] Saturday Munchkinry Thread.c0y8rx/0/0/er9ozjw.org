This seems... extremely open ended, and not quite up to the spirit of rational, but whatever, it seems to be an interesting puzzle.

First one: Using it as a source of high quality statues? I mean, human life has had such a low value over history that having a permanent reminder of the general you defeated in battle would be pretty cool. That would probably pretty violently violate the intent of the place. If it needs a bit more violation of "empire and world domination", protesters with nothing left to lose talking about the ideals of whatever empire ruined them.

Or making someone insane enough that they can answer any question with any answer, get that orwellian lesson on.

As for the oath platform, it's all about taking control of your destiny, so pledging to follow the gods, or pledging to follow something random, or pledging to do something trivial, or a pacifist pledging to murder every last man woman and child, could all potentially work to break the platform, depending on the details.

The mirrors are hard to misuse, unless you use them for omnicidal aims?

As for the garden, figure out a way to make goblins? Those are often held as the "fallen" fey, though something like dwarves would really be the opposite of the fey. Otherwise, using it to become warped and twisted?
