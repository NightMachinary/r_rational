It is indeed open ended. It's not about finding the one true answer, I'm just trying to gauge what people think of when first introduced to the idea of destroying them. Obviously in my story the locations are introduced gradually, and the characters learn about the people that have used them and the forces that created them.

I've had comments before in the Saturday thread discussing how to /use/ some of the locations, but I wanted to do one on destroying them.

The violations don't necessarily have to be on purpose. For the valley, the guy doing the murdering is manipulated into falling in love with one person and grow to hate another as a bitter enemy, only to find out they are the same person during their final showdown.
