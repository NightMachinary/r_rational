There are a few special, magical locations in my world that operate on fairytale logic. There is other magic as well, but these locations do not seem to obey the same rules as other magic. The origins of the locations are shrouded in myth, and boil down to the gods trying to control human society and shape the flow of history. The locations are also powerful seals that limit magic in some ways globally, but the details there are not important. The destruction of these special locations are important plot points in my story, so I thought I'd explain how they work and see if anyone here can come up with a method for destroying them that is similar to what I came up with.

There is a large dome, within which anyone who willingly, knowingly lies immediately turns to stone and dies. Humans use it for international politics, very important trials, important business dealings, etc. You can change your mind /after/ saying something, but it has to be true when you say it. The dome was crafted for a civilization similar to ancient Athens, a fledgling democracy with aspirations of empire and world domination. Obviously a lot of wars have been fought for control over the location.

There is a large floating platform at the end of a rainbow bridge where any oath you 'willingly' utter binds you for eternity, similar to a HPMOR style unbreakable vow. You can't be mind controlled into swearing an oath, but you can be tortured/threatened/tricked into swearing, and it's still binding. Intent matters. The location was crafted for a civilization that believed that almost everything in life was outside of human control and subject to the whims of destiny, and that the only way to really take control of your life was to swear oaths on the things that are most important to who you are.

A valley where emotions (Especially love and hate) are magnified to the extreme, to the point where it's basically impossible to hide your feelings. It won't make you murder that guy who cut in front of you in the store yesterday, but you'll have to practice quite a lot to not glare when you see him. It was crafted for a civilization that had historically had problems with nobles who schemed and manipulated each other horribly and who made a point of not showing emotions.

A hall of mirrors that shows potential futures for whoever looks into the mirrors. The mirrors assume that you will not die anytime soon, so a child dying from brain cancer will still see distant future events like different career choices. The mirrors do take impending geopolitical events into consideration. If there's a famine coming, your reflection is not likely to be fat. You can't send information back in time with the mirrors, they just elucidate what sort of personality and life you are likely to end up with, with some vague intuition about what paths in life will take you there, and what current you would think of future you. The hall was crafted for a small religious cult that thought the gods were manipulating important world events and who sought to become a 'second foundation' style guide to humanity. Why would the gods give them this tool? Because gods scheme against each other too and plot reasons, that's why.

And finally, a large garden where wounds heal quickly, plants grow big and strong, and people bodily and mentally shine with the things that they love, and depressed and suicidal people turn to ash and die. It was crafted by a sorta-honorary-god fairy queen who wanted to make one human civilization more like the fey.

Over the course of my world's history, in each of these locations a human does something that so violates the intent and 'essence' of the location that it breaks and its magic dies. I would be interested in hearing what sorts of ideas you can think of that might qualify. If you want an example, the valley is the first to break, and it breaks because someone murders the person they love inside the valley.
