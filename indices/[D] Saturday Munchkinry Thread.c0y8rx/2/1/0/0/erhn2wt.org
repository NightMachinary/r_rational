One possibility is that it might be very hard to steer something that you're standing on - much like trying to move a pencil across the room while balancing it point-first on your hand (and only touching that point).

It's clearly /possible/, but it's going to take a lot of practice not to occasionally zoom off along unexpected directions and have to correct for it.
