  I think that a better way to break the dome would be, rather than trying to get around the effect, to use the effect for a purpose that completely goes against justice and negotiation. If it were to be used as a form of execution might be a good start, but that is tied with the idea of law already. Instead, using it to murder someone might be interesting.

Very good! That would do it. The way it shakes out in my world, it breaks when the judge in a trial deliberately condemns a man he knows to be innocent, without ever quite lying until he says the word 'Guilty' with the force of law. Ten points to Gryffindor.
