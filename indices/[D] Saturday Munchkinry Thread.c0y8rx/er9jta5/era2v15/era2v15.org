Truth dome: GÃ¶del it. Have someone expendable say "I am telling a lie".

Oath platform: there must be some magic verifying the oaths, so maybe swear some sort of encryption oath - vow to solve something with certain parameters, then provide a solution that's arbitrarily difficult to verify so all the magic is expended on figuring out if you upheld your vow or not. Probably any civilization with both a theory of computation, access to this platform, and a supply of expendable oath-swearers is going to end up doing this though.

Emotion valley: put a p-zombie in there. The valley will go nuts trying to push its emotions around.

Hall of mirrors: parade some gamblers through it? Or maybe station some guards and kill everyone who exits the place.

Healing garden: engineer some magical hyper-cancer-ebola thing; the garden's powers will keep it alive while it kills everything else.
