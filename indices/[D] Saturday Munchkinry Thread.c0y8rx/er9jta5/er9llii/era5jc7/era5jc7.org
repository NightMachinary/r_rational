Repudiate all former currency, reboot the economy. This is, basically, a jubilee. The wisher is now in possession of.. a lot of paper. And a lot of metal. About the only way for the wisher to actually benefit at all is to become a scrap metal merchant. This will likely be less disruptive than you would think - Rebooting monetary systems has been necessary before, and while disruptive, it does not end capitalism or anything.
