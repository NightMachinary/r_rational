I was just thinking that the removal of all digital accounts would be a nightmare, backups are at best digital but air gapped now, but if the magic didn't change processing histories they should be able to reverse engineer people's accounts. If it wiped all that too it's a mess where only big companies and the mega rich people can force accounts to be recreated and credited to them. Also only everyone's positive accounts are lost: all the debt records remain.
