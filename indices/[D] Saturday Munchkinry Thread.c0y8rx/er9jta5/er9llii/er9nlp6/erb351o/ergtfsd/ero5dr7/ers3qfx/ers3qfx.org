Re. Rocket Equation: my main point of confusion is whether it would be more efficient to point the portal at (any particular part of) the star, or if it would be better to use it as storage for chemical rocket fuel. It's been difficult to find the information to estimate the general ballpark range of what the former could do, and the latter seems like it would be more complex, unless a big enough chamber for the exhaust to pass through was needed and required a way to avoid overheating.

I thought of the light-based propulsion, and don't think it'd be particularly efficient. Maybe in short bursts, which would probably be more useful for minor course corrections, which TK would probably be better suited for.
