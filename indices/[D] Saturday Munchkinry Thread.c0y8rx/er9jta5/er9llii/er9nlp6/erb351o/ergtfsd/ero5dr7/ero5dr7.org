- The portal guy, with the storage capability alone, vastly empowers the group just using traditional rocketry. Usually [[https://medium.com/teamindus/rocket-science-101-the-tyranny-of-the-rocket-equation-491e0cf4dc6a][the rocket equation]] forces you to have exponentially more fuel than payload because you need to accelerate the fuel with you. If you can store you fuel in an other universe until you need it, this primary limiting factor of rocketry goes away.
- Telekinesis: 1.5g on 1000kg = 14.7kN. Apply that on 30 kkg and you get 0.05g. That is enough to get you to Pluto in the order of months (distance, not delta v), if you apply it nonstop.
- Absorb/emit light: How much? Light has momentum. Apply solar sail logic in reverse. If he can emit a lot, consistently, for weeks, it'll get you there.
