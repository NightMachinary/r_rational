I have a group of superpowered individuals who needs a spaceship capable of reaching the outer solar system in a sane amount of time. I'm wondering if they can build, operate, and maintain a viable vehicle, relying on their abilities, and if so, what details I'd need to be particularly aware of. The precise limits of the powers are somewhat changeable, so long as this wouldn't break anything else about the setting or story.

There are effectively 10 powers involved, though none were designed with this in mind, so not all are going to be equally useful.

- The one that seems most relevant, fwict, is the guy who functions something like a portal to another universe. I've put more thought into the rules and physics recently, but there's still gigatons of handwaving involved (something something exotic matter hidden in higher dimentions something mumble). The important part is that he has effective telekinesis within the hidden throat of the sorta-kinda wormhole, and this extends a short distance beyond either end, with much more effect on the exoverse side. He can adjust the size and orientation of the connection, to a limited extent - the Earth side radius maxes out around 1m, and the exoverse side takes doing to move away from the star it ... orbits? My idea is to direct matter / energy from the star through the connection, and use that to propel the ship. Ideally, with him anchored to it rather than pushing, and him somehow not being melted or flattened. I assume that the momentum of the exhaust won't do anything to push him or the wormhole, so some kind of rocket would have to be built around him. While I can imagine this working so that he's being pulled by the rocket, and his powers protect him from direct backsplash from the exhaust, the part of the rocket he's anchored to would probably get impossibly hot rather quickly, and while he /can/ store coolant, etc in the exoverse, he can't access it and provide thrust at the same time. Also, his air supply is probably limited to a volume similar to that of the wormhole, and I have no idea if he would experience any time dilation while doing this.
- Someone has something like tactile telekinesis, only affecting metals. I say "something like", because the effect is more one that falls off with distance from her body, probably with the inverse square but that's not set in stone. For this reason, it seems like using as much metal as possible in the ship's construction would be good, because she can fix or modify those components on demand, and can provide additional structural support to some degree. I should note that the range limit is for activating the effect, not for how much of the metal she can manipulate once touching it. I'm not sure how much force, what size metal objects, or how different metals vary. Ideally, she'd be as close as reasonably possible to the part she's affecting.
- A power I'd sum up as Alchemy. This character can basically do whatever to most chemical bonds in range. Range is similar to the metalkine, but the increased efficiency means that, in practice, the effective range is larger. I don't want it to be too large, but it can be changed if need be. I'm imagining something like 10cm from her body, but this is hard enough to use in combat that it might stretch a bit farther. I mostly see her acting as an extra air-scrubber, but I've probably missed something significant. And no, she's not efficient enough to provide infinite energy by repeatedly burning / unburning things. She mostly only does that when the burning part is immediately necessary.
- Plain telekinesis, not anything like as dexterous as would be necessary to compete with the other powers in their domains. I don't like the idea of this character flying around like Jean Grey, but I also concluded they can probably exert about 1.5g on 1000kg, so no reason they can't fly willy nilly. Those numbers are, though, changeable. My current best estimate for the mass of this ship is 30000kg, which is probably on the low side. Their range is more like a few meters---I'm not sure how many---and I tend to imagine the effect generating a small amount of light. And the more I think about it, the less I like that maximum force. They shouldn't suffer any side-effects from using their power on otherwise dangerous materials. How effective they are through barriers is unclear; I'm currently thinking that extending through a barrier requires that they physically touch the barrier.
- Someone who can absorb / emit light. They have a weird issue where they can't easily emit higher frequencies than orange-ish. Might be able to handle infrared and radio, and can absorb more than they can emit. I see these powers being mostly useless for ship-related things.
- Power over sound. Potential secondary power to convert between sound and radio, because of in-universe backstory which this comment is too narrow to contain. Other than muting people being annoying, I'm not sure how helpful this would be without the radio part. I should note that the sound manipulation applies mostly to air more than through solids; it's something like a very specialized form of aerokinesis. If he does get the radio thing, I could see some value in converting engine noise into radio if the energy involved is high enough to be useful, but I'm not sure if that would be the case. This did make me like the idea that they'd want an ion drive as a backup, or for maneuvers that don't require firing the main engine. Not sure how difficult that would be.
- There is another person with a connection to an exostar, but without the skills in using this that the first guy has, and probably not capable of safely using it this way. Included for completeness.
- The remaining 3 are more nebulous. The least defined is probably the most limited, but for these purposes, we can treat that one as a combination healer / monitor / effecacy booster to the others. The other two are somewhat like the two wormholers: one far more capable than the other. The former being able to basically generate / control fire / plasma, and to a lesser extent electricity. The energy for this, and fuel for the flames etc, comes from mumblemumble magic exotic matter in his skin. I bring that up only because it has generally been self-replicating when certain currents or forces are applied, "metabolizing" whatever it can. This is not an issue under most conditions, but that can't be said for aboard a spacecraft. While he /can/ probably generate enough energy on what's available to power a much weaker rocket, that would probably be an agregiously[sicc] inefficient use of this ability. He has demonstrated the ability to do something that looks sorta-kinda like tk via EM shenanigans, and there are a few other possible exploits due to the nature of the stuff, but the limitations are too nebulous to do anything with.

I have no idea how viable a custom spacecraft with this crew would be. It seems like there are probably tons of wholes in it that I'm not sufficiently informed to have identified. Obviously, throwing together several tons of sheet-metal and strapping wormhole guy to the inside of a rocket chamber isn't going to cut it. And I'm not sure what velocity the propellant could/would have. This entire concept might be unworkable, and I'd need to find a more conventional way to make this trip happen.

Ideas / criticisms welcome.

One more thing: the exoverses can be used to store things for later use. When not being actively accessed, they catch only high energy particles and photons, and let through whatever's on the other side. I'm undecided on whether this requires equivalent energies, or if there's a scaler (put in x, get out kx), or if actively moving things just draws on the same energy supply as the tk. We can assume the wormholes have no or insignificant gravitational effects under most conditions.
