I see the very existence of these locations as contributing directly to the destruction of all four. Holding control over these locations would provide incredible strategic advantage and I don't see them being easily available to the general public for long. I foresee a totalitarian rising in power attempting to claim all of these sites and using their powers exclusively to further their own goals.

An upcoming tyrant may see the subversion of the world's sacred spaces in the hall of mirrors and immediately move to seize control of the area before anybody sees what is coming. A protagonist may have seen this before the army invades and had the options of attempting to warn others and die defending the mirror hall, or run and escape to possibly save the world.

The oath platform is the next area I would have targeted by the tyrant. It's value wouldn't be as obvious to more ethical powers, but when captured soldiers are taken to the platform for mass conversion under torture the threat would become apparent. This grand use of the take-control-of-your-life platform to rob people of control could be viewed as a subversion of intent, but from a writing standpoint I'd almost want to let them use it because ANYONE captured by them and released could be a double agent who cannot willingly reveal themselves. Likely the only way to identify spies would be to the truth dome and watch them turn to stone as their oath compels them to willingly lie...

How you interpret "willingly" in this case could vary. If they are magically compelled to lie by an oath they swore to escape torture, how willing is it? If their oath means that they are unable to reveal themselves then maybe the oath-slaves of the totalitarian state can lie in the dome with immunity and thus subvert the purpose of the dome.

Ultimately, the only reliable way to identify oath-slaves is to require all public officials to pass through the fey garden and those who have been forced to betray their friends turn to dust on entry. The pragmatic use of the garden by the enemies of the totalitarian state may be a subversion of its intent and eventually cause it to break.
