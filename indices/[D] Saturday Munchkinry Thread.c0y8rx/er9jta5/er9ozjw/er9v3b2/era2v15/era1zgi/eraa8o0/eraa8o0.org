So, certain things about the action we take to break the location must be true for it to work. The first thing is that it violates the intent of the location thoroughly. The second, less obvious thing, is that it must not have been done before. Otherwise, the location would already be destroyed. This means the action must be either difficult, or be not very obvious - an obvious example is that I would be extremely surprised if there was no person angry at how a debate went inside the dome that tried to break it by saying something like "This statement is false". With that in mind, some ideas.

The dome is meant for negotiation, presumably. It is suppose to allow truth to dominate, while punishing severely anyone who does not abide by those rules, in a twisted form of 'justice'. I would say the core theme here is, rather than truth, justice. After all, memory wiping is a common precaution, so saying something obviously false while believing it doesn't break the area, even if it is done a lot. I think that a better way to break the dome would be, rather than trying to get around the effect, to use the effect for a purpose that completely goes against justice and negotiation. If it were to be used as a form of execution might be a good start, but that is tied with the idea of law already. Instead, using it to murder someone might be interesting. Force someone to lie with the threat of torture. No negotiation, just pressure. No justice, no chance to talk their way out, just using the system of justice instated to perform an unjust deed. And if that isn't enough? Perhaps getting away with it, within or outside, would be.

The bridge is about binding to a fate to escape the whims of the original fate, rather than escaping randomness. True randomness is very hard to come by, of course, with a lot of things that seem random being generated by things that can be predicted. The fundamental aspect is taking control of your own life. So losing control of your life sounds like a good way to break the intent. Now, obviously the idea isn't good enough on its own, if you can be pressured into it. You can't be mind controlled though, it has to be a decision you make yourself. So what is a way to leave the decision in the hands of something else in a more meaningful way than being forced, or flipping a coin? I would say that forcing yourself to make an oath that you don't know your making could be a good candidate. Swear an oath to follow the oath of the next person who makes one. You, of your own volition, have given up your own volition in a way you don't know, and won't know until it happens. You have abused the methodology to go against the intent.

The mirrors are tricky, since the essence of them isn't really a value that can be considered a proper value as far as I can see. They were made for the purpose of allowing plucky humans to mess up the plans of Gods - but Gods were the ones that made the mirrors, so that's hard to abuse. The only thing I can think of to use the mirrors for the express purpose of not using the mirrors, since the value seems to be the in the use itself, rather than as a means to an end. It's sort of like trying to violate the spirit of something that makes money so that you can have money, instead of something that makes money so you can be powerful, or rich, or have lot's of friends. One way you could violate that sort of money-making contraption would be to use the money for the express purpose of not using the money. Slightly contradictory. You could use the money to devalue the money by flooding the economy - that might be a good way to violate the purpose, as you take a tool only you can use and use it only to make things worse. Let's transcribe that onto the mirror hall. Find some way to make the mirrors your's, and your's only. To make them only useful to your goals, such that their loss would only harm you, rather than help you. If you wanted to destroy the mirrors, you would have to do this through someone who didn't. Then, with your dominance, take the future vision provided and use it to break them. Or, alternatively, don't use them at all. The mirrors are really quite tricky, but maintaining dominance only to not use it might work.

Finally, the garden. Fundamentally, about using growth to improve yourself for the purpose of your passions. Plants 'want' to grow big and strong, humans want to live (except if they are suicidal, in which case they want to die and thus do so). Humans want to do their passions, and so they come to glow with them in the garden. It is about fulfilling values, if I read it correctly. So the way to violate the garden would be to use the improvement as a way to stop your love for things, to block off goals you want to reach and passions you want to indulge in. Lock yourself in the garden so that you can't escape, even though you really want to, so that all the growth does is make your heart weep that you can't use it. Essentially, use the garden as a means to prevent yourself fulfilling your values. Or get someone else to do it, since you want it destroyed in the first place.

Interesting thought exercise!
