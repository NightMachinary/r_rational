What if you sent someone into the garden who is very depressed about living and very happy to die? The moment the person starts turning into ashes he would become extremely happy about it and no longer depressed, making the ash effect stop and making his wounds heal. But then since he's healed and continues to live he'll become depressed again and the ash effect will activate again. But then he'll be happy that he's dying now and stop being depressed in an endless cycle...
