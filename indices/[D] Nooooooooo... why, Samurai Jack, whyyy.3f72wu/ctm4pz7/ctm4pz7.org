Jack is also human. He cares. At this point, he has no clue if travel backwards will erase the timeline. If it does, all well and good - the future becomes hopefully better.

If it doesn't erase the timeline, two men who Jack respects are about to die. His very code of honor will not allow him to abandon them. Jack will be unable to choose to return to the past until the future is safe from Aku, because Jack can't let the future suffer Aku's tyranny either... And the past is gone. He's lived at least several months in the future, and it and its denizens are real to him.

He's too kind to be completely rational.
