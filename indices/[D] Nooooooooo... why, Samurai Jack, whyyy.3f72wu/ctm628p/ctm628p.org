In going back to the past, in my mind one of three things can happen.

1, the timeline Jack was in will disappear, eliminating all life and existence in that timeline, Jack saves the past.

2, Jack goes back in time creating a new timeline and leaving the 'old' one intact (two timelines now exists), however the 'old' timeline has no way of defeating Aku, leaving them to forever exist in a dystopian world, Jack saves the 'new' timeline (past).

3, Jack goes back but time is fixed and nothing changes, everything happens like it did before.

In my mind saving the world he currently is in seems the most logical thing to do, since timetravel is an unknown variable that can strongly negatively effect the dystopian world of samurai jack.
