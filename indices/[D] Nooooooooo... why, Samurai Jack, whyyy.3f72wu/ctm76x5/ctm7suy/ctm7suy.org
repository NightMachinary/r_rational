It's not an otherwise normal sword. It can cut through any mundane substance, given enough force. Which I guess mostly just means it's unbreakable. But he has no trouble stopping Aku's robotic mooks with it. Why would demonic mooks be different?

If Aku has robots that good, he should be able to do /much/ better than you're suggesting. He could drop the sword into the sun. He could build a Nicoll-Dyson laser and melt the planet.

Which I guess means we'll have to even the playing field a bit for the rational version. Or maybe it means that Aku didn't realize Jack would come back, and now he has to stop playing around, and Jack has to stop him before Aku can get his death laser satillites up and running.
