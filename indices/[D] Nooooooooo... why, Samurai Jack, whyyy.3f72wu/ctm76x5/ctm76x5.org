From a rational perspective? Even with the power of Jack's ancient magic sword, Aku beats him. 999 times out of 1000.

"Oh. You have a sword perfectly crafted to slay me. How is it different from a regular sword?"

"It harms your flesh. You'll regenerate much slower. I can even kill you with this."

"So, excluding me, it's a normal sword in every way?"

"Well, yes...."

"Alright then."

He then proceeds to mob Jack with demonic mooks, because Mooks aren't Mooks in a rational Samurai age setting. Even if he demonstrates the aptitude needed to slay them continuously without injury, he WILL tire before Aku runs out of forces to throw at him. Guaranteed.

And, assuming Jack and his men (assuming he has them) retreat and try for some guerrilla warfare, he'll never be able to get close enough to Aku with his sword. Having an unassailable fortress, especially as an immortal demon with no need for supplies, would be trivially easy in this time period. No sufficiently easily deployed long range artillery. No cloaking technology. No flight.

Long story short? Jack keeps trying until he missteps and gets fucked up by Aku's forces. Aku has them seal the sword away in some unremarkable location far from him (a la Quirrelmort's horcruxes) and continues his campaign. The only play Jack could make would be to force Aku's presence somehow, most likely by tempting his arrogance or devising something only Aku could break/win/move, with it standing in the way of something Aku wants enough to venture out. Even then, Jack would need to ambush him so rapidly, Aku has no time to shapeshift into a bird and fly away. And, based on the show, his shapeshifting takes little to no time, and is much faster than an adult male's run.
