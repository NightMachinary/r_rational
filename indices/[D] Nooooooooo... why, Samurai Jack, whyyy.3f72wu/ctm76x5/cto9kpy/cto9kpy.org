In a rational world Jack is at the head of the last great army of the human world, brought together by adversity and mostly-united against the terrible demon threat. After an epic battle Jack alone manages to get through to Aku's inner sanctum to try to fight him. Aku thinks he's immortal and is arrogant, allowing Jack to gain a strong advantage before the beast rallies and uses his inta-win technique, the time throwing thing.

The rest of the show revolves around Jack trying to find a portal to go back to just before Aku was first summoned/created/coalesced and destroying him before he can gain his full power.
