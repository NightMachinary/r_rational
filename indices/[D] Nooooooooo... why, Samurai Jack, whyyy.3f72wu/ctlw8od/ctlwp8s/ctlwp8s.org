I remember watching this episode when I was much younger, and having the same reaction you are having now.

On the other hand, my current reaction is "Man, what the hell ever. A 'time portal' is nothing but a bridge between time lines, and every possible outcome to every possible scenario has already occurred at some point in the 4-dimensional existence axis anyway, so let's forgive Jack some irrational but internally consistent nonsense, because nothing he does will really ever change anything anyway.".
