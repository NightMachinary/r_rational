It doesn't matter if he was a cut above the rest. What I meant was that Jack's sword, aside from being super sharp with enough force, does nothing special. It doesn't let Jack fight at range, doesn't give him superior stamina, or anything. So Jack, for all his skill, is still just your average human. Due to [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell][Training from Hell]] he's probably on a Batman/Captain America level of fitness, but he still gets tired fighting.

And I'm not suggesting Aku's robots are unbreakable but I'm suggesting he has a large enough supply that he can flood Jack with mooks indefinitely. Meaning Jack *will* get tired eventually. And he has no methods of escape, beyond running, which means all you'd need to do is kidnap an orphan in front of him, take her into a cave/building and shore up the exits once Jack barrels in. He clearly displays the type of heroism that shows he'd be easily lured into these sort of traps. Characters find ways out of those scenarios out of narrative necessity (otherwise, the show would be over) but from a rational perspective, Jack doesn't have any technological know how, meaning he'd be easy to trap, even with his sword that can cut anything (And I sort of protest this point as well, remember all the trouble Jack had fighting those basket head robots?)
