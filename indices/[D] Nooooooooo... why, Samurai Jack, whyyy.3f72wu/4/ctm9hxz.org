I would also like to add that it really bothered me when, in Scooby Doo, one of the characters would try to open a locked door by putting both feet up against the door and pulling on the handle. YOU CAN'T OPEN A DOOR THAT WAY SHAGGY, YOU'LL JUST PULL THE DOORKNOB OFF!

I mean, since we're on the topic of illogical cartoons, I just really needed to get that off me chest.
