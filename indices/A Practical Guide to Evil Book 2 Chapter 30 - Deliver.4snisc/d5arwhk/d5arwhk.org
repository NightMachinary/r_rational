Good chapter. Totally called that the big one wasn't the real target. Looks like Hakram came into his first aspect... which is worrisome, considering all the corruption being spread and what happened to Catherine's third aspect.

I may have forgotten if it was mentioned, but does the corruption continue even if the demon is killed? Presumably the answer is "yes," but is the corruption different from the demon itself, or will the demon "live" as long as the corruption exists, able to remanifest itself?
