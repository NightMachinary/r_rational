Can anyone help me with a time travel story?

You have successfully invented a time travel device. Congratulations!

However, the question you need to answer is when you go back in time, there are two possibilities. Are you creating a new timeline as if it's a fork where the two branches correspond to the original and new timelines, or are you overwriting the old timeline with a different one? One allows for an infinite number of timelines and the other only allows for one timeline.

The issue is resolved if you can send back objects to the past. If you are only receiving objects/messages from the future, then you know that there is only one timeline because otherwise you wouldn't exist to remember anything being sent back to the past. On the other hand, if you remember sending something back to the past, then you know that multiple timelines exist and that you are unluckily in the branch of the original timeline (actually it's still possible to only receive things from the future if there are multiple timelines, it's just that it only happens in the 'final branch' where no one ever time travels ever again).

My issue is, what if you can not send anything to the past, and that you can only send yourself directly when time traveling. Both methods of time travel seem as if they look identical from the perspective of the time traveler and I can't think of a test for you to distinguish between the two types of time travel after time traveling.
