Olympic fencing isn't really over optimized, aside from the limited side to side movement. Fencing is a descendent of dueling traditions, not battlefield combat.

Foil is "to the death" with thrusting swords, saber is "to the death" with slashing swords, and epee is first blood with thrusting swords. (To the death is in quotes since duelists rarely executed another, and instead won by the other being unable to continue)

You can argue how unrealistic parts are but sacrifices had to be made to create a fair and safer sport.
