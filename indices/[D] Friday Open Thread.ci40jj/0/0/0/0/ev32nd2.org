I never thought of HEMA as dangerous, how so? Can you elaborate?

Considering the fact that the movement started in the 90s I think it's fairly likely to grow to a similar or higher level of popularity to olympic fencing in time.

This stick fighting looks dangerous, no points just full contact with little protective gear. Interesting but I'm not sure how useful it is for inspiration, weapons tend to be fairly lethal and when double hits are a risk, suicide attacks and full contact are unlikely.

Also historically getting wounded had different connotations because of infections and ineffective medical technology.
