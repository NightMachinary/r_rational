For a whopping £14 off Amazon, the Neewer NW-7000 is probably the best bang for your buck. Voice recording gets into very marginal gains very quickly. I don't use it much, and certainly not for anything professional, but I have no concerns with it when I do. I use some light EQ mostly calibrated by ear, and after some noise reduction to remove the sound of the computer fans I honestly would struggle to tell the difference with a professional setup.

How much you want to spend is more determined by how much you're willing to spend for finish, rather than some price floor you have to hop over. It's not at all like headphones or speakers where £14 mostly gets you garbage.
