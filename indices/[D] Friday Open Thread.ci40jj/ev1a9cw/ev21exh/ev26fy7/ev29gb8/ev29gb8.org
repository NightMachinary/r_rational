  Do you mean equalizing by EQ?

Yes.

To be precise, [[https://i.imgur.com/e6TVcEO.png][this is the curve I use]]. All of 300Hz-3kHz is already pretty flat and it's only the lows and highs that need a greater nudge, so without equalization it sounds a bit sharp, though still presentable. This is also to personal taste for my voice, and might not reflect the mic itself too exactly.
