Some hot takes on media criticism:

- There are no "apple to oranges" comparisons: you can compare anything to anything else and people do it all time. Maybe you'll decide not to watch Stranger Things tomorrow but to play Dark Souls instead. Just because one has a completely different aspect to it (gameplay) doesn't mean that you can't compare its other aspects or even the whole work to the other one and find one better as a whole. It applies outside of art too: just about everyone thinks it's ok if you think going out with friends is better than watching the latest GOT season. If you agree with /that/ and then you can't say comparing books to films or action movies to drama movies is not valid. Not saying every kind of comparison is valid (e.g. you can't fault GOT for not having enough gameplay) but you can always compare how much you enjoyed each experience or whether something is better to spend your time with.

- There is a hierarchy of mediums from best to worst roughly: books, tv shows, films, anime, video games, comic books. While you can find works from any medium that are better that others in any other medium it's difficult to find as many great works in the lower tier mediums than in the higher tier mediums. And no Sturgeon's law doesn't work; the standards for what video game or comic book fans consider as a great story are a lot lower than what book or film fans do. I believe this is related to the barriers of entry to the medium (lower is always better), to the demographics that each medium attracts and the industry monopolies that have captured each medium.
