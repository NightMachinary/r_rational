So, I'll just throw this in here in case someone knows.

I've been thinking of writing something like a novel myself (though I don't think it fits in with "the Characteristics of Rational Fiction") and I'm thinking of hosting it on Wordpress, since I want it to have the main story and something like a glosarry, but I'm unsure if it'll work if I just host it without a free plan or if there's any othr good websites to host something like this.

Hence I'm asking if anyone has suggestion for a good hosting service or if anyone has knowledge on how hosting on wordpress works.
