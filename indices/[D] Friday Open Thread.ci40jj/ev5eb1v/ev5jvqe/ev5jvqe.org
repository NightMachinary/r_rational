The only method I can think of is to identify what mechanisms are allowing for the time travel. Since we usually take the existence of time travel as an axiom for our setting, we can't use this trick, but if I were ever in this situation in the real world I would analyse how the mechanisms for time travel evolve from other mechanics. Unfortunately a dissatisfying answer.
