  Are you creating a new timeline as if it's a fork where the two branches correspond to the original and new timelines, or are you overwriting the old timeline with a different one?
#+end_quote

Send yourself something (bury a ring) and "the lack of something" (steal the family jewels) to the future. More dangerously you can use the "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandfather_paradox][grandfather paradox]]" (without killing the grandfather) and slightly alter a family event:

#+begin_quote
  Despite its title, the grandfather paradox does not exclusively regard the contradiction of killing one's own grandfather to prevent one's birth. Rather, the paradox regards any action that alters the past, since there is a contradiction whenever the past becomes different from the way it was.
#+end_quote

When you go "back to the future", you will have your answer. If the ring is there and the family jewels are missing you are overwriting the timeline. If not you are creating a new timeline.

Looking forward to your story!
