I would /mostly/ agree about your hierarchy of mediums of content delivery. However, I'd shunt anime to the bottom of the list. If you remove [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot][Excuse Plot]] video games and competitive multiplayer crap and sports games, just focusing on nothing but long single-player story-driven games (which really ought to be considered something separate from the rest of the video games), I feel like the standards for anime are lower. No. I feel like the standards for anime are low.

Also, VR will move to the top of the list somewhere between 2027 and 2035 once it finally gets its ish together. VR is the final medium.
