To be clear, my hierarchy is on how many great works each medium has not on how high or low are the standards that its fans have. I would agree with that anime fans have lower standards than gamers.

That said, I still think anime has a bigger amount of great stories than (single-player story-driven) games. Video game stories have characters and plots that are little or no better than your average Hollywood action movie (but on tv-series-like length) and their worldbuilding has no ounce of originality in it, always aping the most popular sci-fi and (especially) fantasy tropes. Meanwhile, while most anime do promote their terrible clich√©s they very often try making unique worlds and systems (with the best of them succeeding) and while most characters are full of melodrama or edginess the best ones turn out to be realistic while video games only know how to write 'action movie heroes'.

I guess for me it mostly comes down to this: if I am in the mood for good gameplay I will find a non-story-driven video game to play because those tend to have the best gameplay. Whereas if I am in the mood for a good story I see little that story-driven video games offer that other mediums don't do better. I can see why one would want to avoid anime. But if you are looking for SFF and/or action in an audiovisual medium I don't think there aren't many options outside of anime.
