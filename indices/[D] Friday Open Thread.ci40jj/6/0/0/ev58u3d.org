I agree that anime is pretty low, but I wouldn't quite put it at the bottom. It's badness is mostly due to strange factors of Japanese markets and production committees. However, when we're talking about the capabilities of different art forms, anime has incredible potential /in theory/ because you can communicate very unrealistic ideas and scenes without millions of dollars of CGI and it will look /good/. Textual prose can do this too, but it's totally dependent on the reader's capacity for imagination and many people don't have much at all.

I disagree that VR is the final art form. It was thinking about arts a thousand years from now, you'd have VR, the future version of tabletop role-playing games, and some kind of comic that perfectly uses images where images are optimal and prose where prose is optimal, but still has no sense of time of its own, unlike the first two.
