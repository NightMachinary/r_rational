Just went on a second date which involved hanging out in the vicinity of the world deaf conference while using a false identity of being [My Name], English/[Specific Indigenous Australian Language] interpreter. It was... actually excellent. (OK I'm extremely smitten. CouteauBleu, comment dit-on smitten en francais ?)

In more relevant, less smitten news, I've got dates for Berlin and Amsterdam now if anyone wants to organise a meetup.
