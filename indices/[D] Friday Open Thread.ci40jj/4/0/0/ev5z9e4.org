Oooo merci! Let's go with ensorcel√©e, but I don't know if it has the same old fashioned charm.

I should make a strawpoll on whether people prefer:

a) weasel love life updates

b) weasel travel updates

c) weasel "isn't france weird" updates (actually, CB, can you buy cooking oil in a spray bottle here because I'm going to get my parents to bring me some from Australia if you can't).

d) weasel silence

e) to be added to weasel's travel live update Signal chat to receive all of the above in real time (..... if you want that PM me and I'll probably add you to it I guess)
