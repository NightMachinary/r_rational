*On Fighting*

I usually try to avoid being an elitist or a pedant but when it comes to action and combat in serial fiction, I can't help myself.

Much like Star Wars fans reacting to Rey's unexpected proficiency, a character with limited athletics and no background in combat successfully wading into battle will get me frothing at the mouth.

There are certain areas of combat where there is no definitive source of truth. We don't know a ton about the best styles for armed single combat (especially between characters with different weapons and body types), we don't know a ton about the best styles for unarmed 1v2+ combat, and we obviously don't know the best styles for use of each world's magic system. *If a fighting style can't be practiced regularly on resisting training partners safely, it will be difficult to get to a useful level at that style (looking at you, Krav Maga).*

What we do know a ton about is the value of certain styles for single, unarmed combat. If you have any plans for writing single combat, I would recommend a set of different types of videos. Even if you don't plan on writing about unarmed single combat, these points will still be informative, even if they don't translate perfectly.

1. Watch some videos from worldstar, [[/r/fightporn]] , or 4chan's fight threads. Fights between untrained amateurs (95+% of the population) are sloppy, short, and very odd looking. Size and athleticism make a huge difference. Following the initial adrenaline dump, both participants "gas out" if the fight continues past the 60 second mark. Fights regularly end up on the ground and there is nothing more dangerous than falling and hitting your head on pavement.

2. Watch some random amateur or regional boxing, mma, or kickboxing fights. In this day and age, nearly every prizefight will have a camera or phone recording. This is a good template for writing fights between protagonists and their rivals. Fights between two trained competitors look completely different from street fights between drunken hooligans. Relative advantages in technique, athleticism, preparation between competitors are very important. Differences in style, different martial disciplines are extremely important at this level. Note the vast differences between how fights look when fighters are allowed to clinch, trip, throw, elbow, kick, or knee their opponents compared to when you allow punching exclusively. Note the value of grappling in determining where the fight takes place and the vast gulf between an untrained grappler and an experienced grappler.

3. Look up the early fights of elite combat athletes. Jon Jones' early career ([[https://youtu.be/P1xq7OkEF14][1]],[[https://www.mma-core.com/videos/Jon_Jones_vs_Stephan_Bonnar_-_UFC_94_-_Full_Fight_-_Part_1/10127150][2]]). Vasyl Lomachenko's first few pro fights ([[https://youtu.be/rVhN7-lXaLw?t=385][1]],[[https://youtu.be/SQ0MPEz-2pw?t=1109][2]]). Jose Aldo's early career ([[https://youtu.be/rIhj4NzgRME][1]],[[https://www.mma-core.com/videos/Jose_Aldo_vs_Alexandre_Franca_Nogueira_WEC_34_Part_1_Full_Fight/10117542][2]],[[https://www.mma-core.com/videos/Jose_Aldo_vs_Mike_Thomas_Brown_WEC_44_Part_1_Full_Fight/10117550][3]]). Here you will start to see glimpses of greatness. You will see what happens when someone who just has that "it" factor fights your average trained Joe plumber. This is a great instructional for writing the up-and-coming hero. What is the point of a main character if they don't have that special something? Note the value of pace, the value of top-tier athleticism, the value of specialization in one style or well-rounded preparation. You will find some spectacular, action-movie techniques on display at this stage.

4. Watch a few MMA title fights. Great inspiration for scenes where your protagonist faces off with the BBEG or their killing-machine bodyguard. Sometimes you get a knock-down, drag-out war where neither man can break the other's will. Sometimes you get a dominant performance where the superiority of one man becomes unquestionable over the distance of the fight. Sometimes it comes down to a single failure or minuscule advantage, sometimes it comes down to who wants it more. The better fighter does not always win, but he usually does.

Conflict is the central pillar of prose. Combat is often a central pillar of serial fantasy and serial fiction more generally. Fighting is ingrained in our DNA, in our morphology. Every culture I've encountered has an indigenous form of combat, often some form of wrestling or open rules fighting. Don't ignore the rich history and wealth of evidence at your fingertips. There is no substitute for experience, so don't workout montage or powerlevel your characters, especially in rational or rational-adjacent fiction.
