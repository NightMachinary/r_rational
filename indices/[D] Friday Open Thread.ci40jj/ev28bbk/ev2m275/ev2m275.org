This also bothers me a lot. I'd like to add that there is some knowledge of weapon and armor based combat available and we have surviving manuscripts from the middle ages and ahead that do a decent job at explaining how they fought and how optimized things were.

​

Experimental archaeology, HEMA, certain eastern surviving weapon based martial art practices, we also have a lot of renaissance era military level swordsmanship manuals, soldier memoirs..

​

We don't know what is the best because things change based on the period, their technology, armors and weapons used etc. But we can tell how people fought for the most part with reasonable accuracy specially for the later periods.

​

I'll link a feel youtube channels that are relevant and enjoyable:
