I'm probably Amanda Nunes' #1 fan, so the male pronouns are just because I am writing from my own perspective.

I agree that MMA is not the be all end all for what fights should look like, but I do believe that they are a really good approximation, especially when you take early luta livre and Pancrase matches into account. There, you can see how headbutts, grounded kicks and knees, roundless fights, and more. There were matches where low blows were allowed in the old days, and standing headbutts are legal in lethwai. There are plenty of instances of illegal strikes you've mentioned being used to great effect, but with their illegality it is hard for fighters other than Jon to make them part of their regular game plan.

With that being said, I think historic training methods likely had rules as well, even if actual combat did not. I think MMA is a framework through which you can view other forms of training and combat.

In MMA, we've seen the value of innovation, specialization, well-roundedness, strategy, tactics, psychological warfare, and many other facets of combat. Even if the specifics don't apply to every situation, the story does.
