Not really, HEMA is similar to fencing but they want to account for the mistakes olympic fencing made while becoming a sport by optimizing to such an extreme that it became virtually unrecognizable to it's original function.

Here's a HEMA tournament video, pay attention to the safety gear, structure, points, how after blows are treated to punish suicidal moves..

This is a longsword fight, but in a tournament there are several different weapon competition, everything from saber, sword and buckler to rapier and dagger.

It's a new sport, less than 40 years old, and I'm not sure how successful it's going to be, but it's value for writers, movie directors, and fight choreographers is quite high.

Historical armored fighting would be better exemplified by that channel I linked Pursuing knightly arts. Aiming for gaps in the armor, different sword grips, grappling etc.

Historically knights weren't bashing at each other, they were trying to disarm or down their opponents and finish them off with a stab to the crotch, armpit, neck or other areas that are hard to armor.
