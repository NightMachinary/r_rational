This is not my argument but theirs, but that's what generates the problem. If the winning condition is hit first even if you get hit after as long as the hits can't be so close together as to be considered simultaneous actors will optimize around it.

This leads to tactics you wouldn't have seen in historical fencing because people have self preservation and what they are trying to practice, and use that martial art for is for actual real life application.

By over optimizing for getting points in a sport without consideration for double hits the swordsmanship and most forms real life application of the swordsmanship skill are mostly gone.

What you end up with at an optimal level is a who can hit first game.
