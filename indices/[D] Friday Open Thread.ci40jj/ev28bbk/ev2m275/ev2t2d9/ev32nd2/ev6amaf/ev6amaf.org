I just wanted to add that double hits are a huge risk historically, and the best answer to them was wearing armor. I don't think they are usually the result of "suicide attacks" but usually just from one person advancing and the other keeping their sharp thing pointed at them.

Saber and foil fencing have rules of priority as a result of how often this happened when people had equal weapons and armor (the person with priority wins during double hits).
