I suppose what I would add is that people shouldn't use MMA fights as a template for how the fight would /look/, just how fighters look as they skill up and some insight into fighting techniques that you might not have thought of if you didn't think about it (before Royce Gracie did people think the ground game mattered? idk.)

Like, I've been a fan for about 5 years now, and as entertaining and skillful as fights are, and as much as I LOVE grappling, it's... not realistic. It's as close as you can probably get to realistic while still having a sport that isn't waiting for someone to die, but MMA fighters are not literally trying to kill each other. A lot of the time they even /like/ each other. They aren't allowed to fish hook, low blows, soccer kicks, grab clothing, use weapons, leave the confines of the cage, spend too much time trying to wear someone down without advancing position, spike people onto their heads, hit the kidneys, hit the back of the head, fine joint manipulation, headbutts, scratch, bite, poke eyes (unless you're jon jones amirite) etc. Those are all banned, essentially, /because they are very good strategies if you want to injure your opponent/, and that's what people would be doing in realitic.

Also, so many great MMA fighters are women so I just want to point that out as you've applied male pronouns pretty liberally. Nunes in particular, I love her. However I think the Rousey Holm fight is probably instructional about fighting with hubris, or something: maybe watch Rousey Tate II and then Housey Holm for a bit of contrast.
