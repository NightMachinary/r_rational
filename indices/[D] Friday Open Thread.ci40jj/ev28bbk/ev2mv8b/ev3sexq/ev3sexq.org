The very early days of UFC are worth checking out, there really were very few rules back then. It's probably the closest you can get to televised real fights between skilled fighters.

Also, Royce Gracie really did revolutionize everyone's idea of fighting in UFC 1, it's fascinating to watch just for that alone.
