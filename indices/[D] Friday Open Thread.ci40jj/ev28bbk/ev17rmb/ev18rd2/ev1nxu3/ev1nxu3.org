[[https://www.glowfic.com/posts/575?per_page=100][Filtration]] is I believe the oldest Daevinity story, and the only one I can recall that's entirely contained /in Daevinity/. Daevas are just so much more interesting to strand in other universes and [[https://www.glowfic.com/posts/325?per_page=100][watch the fireworks]].

Mind you, past the inital wariness it's very much a saccharine wish-fulfilment story. Part of the [[https://www.glowfic.com/boards/44][Incandescence]] continuity, and therefore falling prey to the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bxvocf/d_friday_open_thread/eqf6cqn/][glowfic pattern]], so remember you're allowed to drop it when you get bored.

 

[[https://www.glowfic.com/posts/153?per_page=100][twilight of the idols, baby]] has a daeva summoned into a sci-fi variant of the Silmarillion. The Silmarillion has Melkor and Sauron in it - /high-tech/ Melkor and Sauron - so, not so much with the saccharine wish-fulfilment.

  "I prefer not to prompt anyone to consider my emotional state a particularly salient feature of the situation?"

  "...okay. I'll try."

Sad Cam is best Cam.

 

I know a couple of other cool Daevinity stories - even some where Cam isn't the protagonist! - but they're super deep into their respective continuities, can't get to them without a ton of glowfic context.
