I've got a Blue Yeti and while it is a good value mic, it may not necessarily be the best choice for audio narration. If your environment is a little loud, it will pick up a lot of things other than your voice.

Honestly, the room or environment where you record is more important than the quality of your mic, 9 times out of 10.
