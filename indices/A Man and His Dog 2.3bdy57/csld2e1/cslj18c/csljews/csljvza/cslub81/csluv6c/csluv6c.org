They have been paranoid enough so far :) Given time, it's possible that he might find a way to leave data for himself.

However, there are a series of significant problems.

The more complex the data is that he tries to hide, the more susceptible it will be to either detection or damage due to human interaction with the appliances during maintenance.

There's only so far anyone can compress data without loss, and the more highly compressed the data is, the more difficult it will be for the next iteration of him to identify as data.

The smaller the data package, the harder it is to compress it without loss.

There are a lot of constraints, from many different directions.
