*A Man and His Dog*

Chapter 3B

He nodded. "Go on, Doctor Smith."

"First, I want to make sure you understand the rocket equation. Please paraphrase it."

He cocked his head a little to the side. "Geometric expansion of fuel requirements. As you add more fuel to a rocket so it can generate more delta-V, it takes more fuel to accelerate the fuel that accelerates the fuel, ad infinitum. Doesn't take a great deal of required delta-V before the fuel requirements for moving anything adds up to more mass than there is in the known universe."

I never knew Doctor Ajibana had any interest in space - probably because I had no interest in space other than as a far-off goal for recorded humans to become part of space industrial and exploration efforts. He had clearly rattled off the reasonable explanation of the rocket equation without thinking about it. "Good. Now, do you know the generalized energy philosophy for beamed power propulsion?"

"Sure. Reduce the mass of a payload to the least you can manage, then providing the energy to accelerate it from a source far from the payload. Lasers, particle beams, and solar sails. Beamed power methods have abysmal acceleration though. It takes years to get anywhere far from Earth. So slow we've never bothered building anything but a few solar sails as proofs of concept." He crossed his arms.

"Good. Standard rocketry is based off of the rocket equation. All of the energy required for the mission is carried internally or attached, as fuel. Beamed power relies on energy external to the payload for acceleration, and normally for mission requirements as well. Completely different ends of the energy spectrum. Carryout vs. delivery, in pizza terms." I paused. "What's in the middle?"

He was silent, thinking for several seconds. "VASIMIR and other particle accelerator propulsion systems carry fuel with them, but the fuel is accelerated via power collected by solar panels. That would seem like a hybrid method. The acceleration is still anemic but not anywhere near as bad as pure beamed power methods." He nibbled his lip. "I can't think of anything else."

I scrubbed Penny's head, and she laid down next to me in the grass. "There are a few other hybrid concepts. One uses lasers to burn solid reaction mass attached to payloads. That's far less efficient than particle accelerator propulsion systems, and a tiny mistake can slag the payload. We have to build the giant laser too."

He was nodding as I spoke. "They did some live flight tests of that technology in atmosphere a few decades ago. Never went anywhere. The particle accelerator systems got all the funding."

I clapped my hands and rubbed them together onscreen. "OK, now we get to the fun part."

His eyes opened slightly in anticipation. With a smile, he said "Give."

"If a military aircraft needs to go somewhere beyond where the fuel can take it, and the mission is important enough, the aircraft will get refueled in flight by a flying tanker. We've been doing it for 80 years, though the first midair refueling was done by civilian aircraft being fueled by fast moving vehicles on the ground."

He paused. "Yes. I didn't realize we were doing it so long ago, but I knew we had been doing it for at least 50 years. Go on."

"Next example. If an orbital habitat or satellite runs low on maneuvering fuel to help it keep station, we send up a fuel capsule, a specialized fuel ferry grabs it, and takes it to the satellite or habitat in need of fuel, and bingo. Orbital refueling. We've been doing that for roughly fifteen years now."

Doctor Ajibana nodded, but looked confused. "I understand but-"

I cut him off, gently. "What is the common denominator of those two examples."

He nibbled his lip. "Both aircraft and satellites are refueled to let them do what they are doing longer?"

"Exactly. Now, what prevents us from doing the same thing for deep space missions?"

He sat up straight in his seat. "Wait. What? Some sort of deep space remote fueling method?"

"Exactly. We've always built our rocketry-based missions in space around the one-lump-fuel concept. Rocket staging only reduces the inefficiency, it doesn't make it more efficient. We're not just carrying the fuel in one lump, we're accelerating tankage too." I paused with a huge smile. "So, we just deliver the fuel a little bit at a time to keep the mass ratio low."

Doctor Ajibana stood up suddenly and his chair rolled back. "If we deliver only very small amounts of fuel to a payload, it won't violate the rocket equation, but the mass ratio present when accelerating will give a-" He paused. "How do you accelerate the fuel to the remote payload? That's going to require a lot of energy."

He had seen one potential pitfall quickly enough. "For low or moderate delta-V missions, you are absolutely correct. It's not worth doing. We can do them with standard rocketry or VASIMIR easily enough. But what if we wanted to, say, survey the asteroid belt? Lots of delta-V required if you want to get a good look at many different objects, over many years. The asteroids are rather far apart in reality. Usually too far apart to see more than one at a time."

I hadn't seen Doctor Ajibana in collaborative mode in nearly a month, my time. It was nice to see it again, and I was getting excellent modeling data.

He pushed his chair under my old desk and started pacing back and forth, faster and faster. "Multi-year missions. You could accelerate small quantities of fuel out by accelerating them with a launcher system, correcting trajectory and matching velocities with some sort of delivery system that was able to accelerate itself, and then capture the delivery for the payload to use the fuel."

He turned around and stared at me, wide-eyed. "That would make the fuel costs for asteroid belt exploration..." His mouth dropped open.

I finished the sentence for him. "Linear."
