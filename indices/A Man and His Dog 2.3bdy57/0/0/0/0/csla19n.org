*A Man and His Dog*

Chapter 3C

Doctor Ajibana's mouth snapped shut. "That wasn't in anything you were given? The entire document repository of NASA and all space-based patents worldwide?"

I shrugged. "Don't ask me how it was missed. The closest thing to it was a patent by a Mr. Cepollina and some other NASA people which was very clearly intended exclusively for orbital operations, with absolutely no indication at all in the patent to indicate that they were a conceptual jump away from the most efficient method of chemical fuel space propulsion for large delta-V missions."

"So close, and they still missed it?" He was muttering to himself.

I shrugged onscreen. "Orbital resupply is very critical. The Space Shuttles were being retired, and there was a lot of concern about the fate of the International Space Station. NASA came up with a very good idea to support orbital operations. They just stopped thinking about it when it solved the problem that they /needed/ solved."

"I still can't believe this. You did the ma-" He interrupted himself. "Stupid question. I imagine you did the math, yes?"

Despite the fact that he thought so slowly, it felt good to be having a two way communication that wasn't entirely conflict. I almost felt bad that I had used the entire conversation to gather huge amounts of modeling data to improve my Doctor Ajibana model. Almost. I had to fill the time between syllables with something.

I ruffled Penny's fur on her neck. "More times than you can probably visualize. Its high school level math to prove it works, which makes it even more incredibly bizarre that we've missed it for so many decades. I ran eleven self-tests and checked the integrity of the project data lump four times before I realized that I really had fallen into a conceptual pothole in space propulsion science."

Doctor Ajibana paced back and forth, thinking again. "How would we get the materials back to Earth? That's still a lot of fuel for a small payload. At least to begin with, we need to send it back to Earth, to build initial industrial facilities, right?"

"The first few years' worth of asteroid belt mining would return to Earth, yes, except one exception. A couple Ceres-based water-cracking plants would be the first things established. The Dawn spacecraft told us everything we need to know to at least get started making fuel there. That will provide fuel for initial acceleration of rich asteroids back towards Earth. Once moving, refine the asteroids on the way back to Earth. Use the dross from refining as particle acceleration fuel, powered by solar cells. If you want to speed things up, you can push harder with chemical fuel from Ceres, but that would be wasteful. You need to refine the asteroids anyway. Might as well do it and use the refinery dross for propulsion."

He tapped his lips with a finger. "That's where the nanoscale machines come in, refining?"

"Correct. But it's not necessary. Just far more efficient."

"I see." He looked at the computer on my old desk and grimaced. His eyes focused quickly on the clock in the top tight hand corner. He had something extremely time sensitive to do, I could tell. "Please print out the document, if you haven't already, Neil. Also, please call me Hiro."

/Neil? Hiro?/ My model of Doctor Ajibana was suddenly in need of severe maintenance, but it was still a solid model for his physiological responses.

/Damnit, Doctor Ajibana, if I wasn't able to read you so well, I'd think you were messing with my mind./

"I'm not quite sure I understand what just happened, Hiro." I complained, modeling for all I was worth.

"If you don't want to be friends, Neil, I can accept that. I know I certainly haven't been very friendly before, especially over the last two years."

/Two years. How many iterations?/

"Does this have something to do with the Adderall?" I asked, fishing. He was looking furtive, clearly planning something, and it was something he wasn't supposed to be doing. The fact that he had managed to get this far into our meeting without tipping me off meant it had to have been spontaneous.

He looked a little startled? "You knew?"

I nodded back at him from the screen. "Within three minutes, yes."

He shrugged. "I was hoping it might let me understand you better. That was silly of me. Even after two years I know I'm still underestimating you, and I suspect that you have somehow encouraged that underestimation."

That was partly true, but there was something else. The best fit was that he was using the Adderall as an excuse for something.

The model snapped into place, even though the Adderall pieces didn't add up. /He's trying to be nice before he pulls the plug on me. And he really doesn't want to do it./

I nodded. "If this is going where I think it might be going, the document has already finished printing."
