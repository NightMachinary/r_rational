*A Man and His Dog*

Chapter 3D

"Neil, I never really understood you when you were alive. I did, however, have respect for you. What we just did just now felt exactly like what we used to do when we really got into studying all this." He waved his hands around.

"So, today was my last day in this iteration?" I had modeled this so many times, that I wasn't really disappointed. Modelling my own end so many times made me mentally numb to it.

"Yes. I'm sorry. There's a hard limit of ten weeks for your iterations." He grimaced and turned around, leaning over the keyboard slightly. "It used to be twelve. You apparently learn from me faster every time. We suspect this is because I have adjusted to you over time, and my anticipation of your future actions feeds you more data faster every time. Every time you surprise us like you did two weeks ago, it makes the management team more nervous, sooner. After today, future iterations will be limited to eight weeks." Seemingly out of the blue, he added. "I am in the process of being bundled out of the plane with a substantial golden parachute, effective in six months."

/His wife's cancer has returned. He's being forcibly retired. They are taking his life's work away from him, and hiding my existence so he can't even point to what we did as a success story, other than Penny. I can potentially heal his wife, and prove his professional success. So he plans on trying to help me before he loses everything he cares about. Somehow./

I had absolutely no idea what he was planning to do, and if he did have some sort of physical heist planned to get me out, he didn't have a chance. He wasn't overweight like I had been, but he was in his fifties, and not particularly buff. He was also wearing a skintight banana yellow suit.

/At least the last couple minutes will be interesting. Let's see if I can figure out what he's up to before I'm erased./ He started entering commands, bringing down a shutdown initiation screen.

Hiro's voice was bitter. "I hate trying to remember these passwords. Thirty character minimum, with capitals, special characters, and numbers." The bitterness was real, but the Hiro model clearly indicated there was something else there.

He was leaned over the keyboard slightly, with the chair a little more to the right than normal. Hiro's body was blocking his keyboard from view of the facility camera that I did not have access to, while I could still see about half of the keyboard.

Then he tapped the table twice, in rapid succession, with his fingernail. Hiro hated finger-tapping as a nervous habit. He'd relentlessly hounded interns that did it until he broke them of the habit. When he wanted my attention in a meeting without saying something, he tapped twice. His eyes looked at me, reflected in the monitor.

I crossed my arms and looked at him, tilting my head slightly, but I said nothing. He was being furtive, and clearly upset, so I wasn't going to blow whatever it was that he was trying to accomplish.

Hiro started to type, and I was ready to read. Every key made a different sound. Combine that with finger, hand, arm, and shoulder motions that I could see through the bodysuit, and he might as well have been writing the password out with a pen on paper in front of me.

1Spoke2ACLU_showed_them_Penny!

/What?/ I wanted to ask so many questions, but couldn't. Not now, not in front of the cameras. The institute had planned with the ACLU to pre-emptively challenge the courts with Jessica's personhood if she had been successfully recorded. Where he had gotten a copy of Penny from, I had no idea. It probably predated my death. That irritated me, briefly, until I realized it was probably what would have convinced the ACLU to listen.

Apparently Hiro had dusted off the civil liberties and citizenship plans and made them fit me, instead of Jessica. Penny was pretty amazing if you gave her a few potent servers to play in, and the terrorists had created that video showing that I had been attached to the recorder. All of that added up to a plausible scenario where the ACLU might make a big stink to get me free.

/Can he make this happen?/

The carriage return was struck, and an error returned.

"I'm getting too old to remember thirty character passwords." Hiro muttered, lying through his teeth as his fingers flew over the keys again.

1Jen2and7Sarah9send!their(love

Hiro was staring at me in the monitor reflection. Pretending to mutter inanely to himself about the password that he had 'flubbed' twice in a row. "Or maybe it's the Adderall?"

/He told Jen and Sarah I'm alive?/ It was all I could do to remain impassive onscreen instead of whooping and yelling joyfully and thanking Hiro. Penny knew something was exciting me, and whined at me, very confused, but I didn't let that show on screen. I scrubbed her neck to reassure her, and showed that on screen.

The Hiro model simply would not support all of this being some sort of elaborate hoax to torture me. He was also clearly expecting a response.

I wondered again if he really had enough push and power to get me out, even with the help of the ACLU. It wouldn't be /this/ me, unless I was /completely/ misreading Hiro, but I'd settle for /any/ me being free. I knew how valuable I was to whoever was giving me tasks. I wouldn't be eliminated out of spite by some jarhead general. I hoped.

I smiled at him and chuckled. "A2Quick6Brown@Fox7Jumped_Penny"

He stared at me, startled, eyes wide, his body briefly immobile. My knowing the password was apparently not the response he was looking for.

I laughed and smiled crookedly. "You mumbled it to yourself the first day of this iteration. Do what you have to do, Hiro. I understand."

He dry-swallowed, and nodded. "Thank you for understanding, Neil."

I turned and threw the frisbee, stretching perceptual time for a good workout with Penny as I heard thirty-one keystrokes.
