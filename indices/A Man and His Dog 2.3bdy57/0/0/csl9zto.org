*A Man and His Dog*

Chapter 3A

Doctor Ajibana returned again two weeks later. The first thing I noticed was that his eyes were not reacting properly to light. I quickly verified his pulse and breathing were not within normal ranges, but the variation was not dangerous. I modeled him against various health conditions and drug interactions and determined that he was likely under the influence of a psychoactive drug. My first guess would be Adderall, but there were a couple more possibilities.

Without knowing the drug, it would be difficult for me to accommodate what I observed during today's meeting into my model of him. Even knowing the drug, my knowledge of the chemical structure of the drug and by extension, its brain interactions would be imperfect, despite the fact that I had studied psychoactive drugs and their effect on the mind while taking refresher courses after I had seen peer-reviewed white papers indicating that Adderall had a positive effect on learning curves. If I had teeth, I would have started gritting them. Doctor Ajibana had always been a teetotaler. The chances of this being an attempt to interfere with my modeling approached unity, very closely. Based on his expression and apparent nervousness, he wasn't happy with it either, but I didn't /know/ that, because of the drug.

I began brute force calculations of all potential molecular combinations of Adderall and matching them against molecular-level models of the doctor's brain, comparing the results to what I was observing.

In a nervous tone, my warden greeted me. "Good Day, Doctor Smith. How does the research progress in the space industry project?"

"I am still optimizing, but I have the first five years ready to print. After that, it's more nanoscale technology."

He sighed. "Doctor Smith. You know the rules, we cannot accept code, circuitry designs, or nanoscale technology from you in any form, for obvious reasons."

I nodded the head of my avatar. "That was not detailed in the documentation I was provided. However, yes, I knew to expect that limitation. That is why I stopped the preparations for printing once I had gotten to the parts that I would be allowed to present."

"You didn't continue beyond where the most efficient path would require nanoscale machines?"

"I'm not a person, remember? If the people who give you orders want me to solve all their problems for them AND demonstrate initiative when their instructions are poorly worded, then they need to consider treating me like a person."

Doctor Ajibana was very uncomfortable with that comment and went silent for over thirty seconds as he nursed his cup of coffee and stared at his computer screen, watching me in the reflection. It was a little disconcerting that I wasn't able to model him with the precision I was accustomed to.

"So, I'm going to admit to some curiosity here. Is any of the industrialization plan that you have laid out simple enough for a hobbyist to understand?" He turned to face me and leaned back in his chair, far more relaxed than I had seen him in any of my memories since my death.

It had taken me three minutes to isolate the molecular composition and current dosage of Adderall in the doctor's system. I fed the entire meeting so far into the models with the Adderall data, and it was certain. The doctor was favorably inclined to me today. He had made a decision, but I couldn't be certain exactly what it was yet. I had seen very little data to model him by, when he was favorably inclined to listen to me. Despite the oddness of his demeanor, it was plain to me that his favorable inclination seemed to be tempered by some fear.

"Actually, yes. There's something so absurdly simple at the root of it all that it caused me to doubt my own accuracy for several seconds.

He relaxed a little more, and smiled. "Do tell."

This was actually something of a problem. I had been prepared for a recalcitrant, even belligerent opponent. I had modeled millions of meetings. I was certain of my ability to convince him to try to help free me.

Then he arrived, under the influence of performance enhancing drugs, with a demeanor completely different than what my model demanded.

I was now falling back on my memories of him prior to becoming electronic, and that was dangerous and very crude. Still, he was interested in the space industry idea as a layman, and it /was/ rather startling. I would model him in a new scenario, and hope I could ever develop a very high confidence model in far less time than I expected, or perhaps his attitude would shift.

For a moment, I considered intentionally shifting Doctor Ajibana's attitude. It wouldn't be that hard. That plan hit a conceptual roadblock. In the end, I still had some desire for intelligent companionship. I decided to allow Doctor Ajibana to stay in a good mood. "This will only take a couple minutes. It's a fairly quick energy study."
