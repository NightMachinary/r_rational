This discussion is becoming something that could quickly develop into a brawl. I understand that some people might object to this patent.

I have spent hundreds if not thousands of hours working on this. It is not what I do for a living. I could have simply dropped it into the public domain, sure.

However, I would almost certainly get lost in the shuffle. Maybe it's vain, but I'd really like my name permanently associated with this method. Maybe I'm greedy, but I'd like some sort of financial reward for coming up with the idea. Hopefully large enough that I could spend the rest of my life writing and perhaps coming up with other ideas.

That doesn't mean I'm vain and greedy enough to want it monopolized. I drew the line there, and I hope you approve of at least that much.

So I am only patenting it in the US. That will lower it's financial value, I'm sure. It may also make it less likely my name sticks to it. Fine. I have potentially sacrificed some of my own desires in order to make sure that this won't be buried in a box somewhere, or abused by a single entity.
