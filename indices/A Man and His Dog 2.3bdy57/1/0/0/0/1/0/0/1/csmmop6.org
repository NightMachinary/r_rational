After the last comment, I had a thought strike me out of the blue.

There IS a way I could sell the idea, without selling it to a company.

Kickstarter. A kickstarter to put the patent into public domain. I'm not going to think about it too deeply right now, because I don't have the patent (chickens, eggs, hatching), but it is an alternative, and on the surface, it looks to be a good one.
