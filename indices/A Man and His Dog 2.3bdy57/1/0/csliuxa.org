Nope, nobody is helping me. I simply chose to write my main character as a singularity human, which means he's going to feed fairly easily into most of what [[/r/rational]] people want to see written about.

As for the space thing? It's 100% legit. It's abbreviated here, but the concept is sound as well as the brief description. I am working on patenting it now, in the US only, so that it can't be claimed by me or any worldwide entity and stuck in a box. I hope to be able to get some value from it as a reward for myself.

As a word to the unfamiliar, patents in general are evil, and method patents in specific are worse. Especially when applying without a law firm, and specifically when the examiner decides that your method patent is anticipated by another method patent that has nothing to do with your own, and starts making you jump through hoops to prove it's not. This is how the patent system works though. I can understand it and be irritated by it at the same time.
