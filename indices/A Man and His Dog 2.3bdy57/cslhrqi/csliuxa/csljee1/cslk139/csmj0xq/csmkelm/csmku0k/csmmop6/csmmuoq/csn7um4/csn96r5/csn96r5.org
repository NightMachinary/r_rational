The propulsion method for remote fueling high delta-V missions outside orbit that was mentioned in this story is real, and I am attempting to patent it.

A few years ago I was reading up on the VASIMIR propulsion system and realized they had hybridized beamed power and standard rocketry. Then I wondered if anyone had ever considered remote fueling as a different hybridization of beamed power and standard rocketry. The answer was no. So I started on the path to patenting it.
