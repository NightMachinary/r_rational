No, they're not. There are informational backchannels to the outside world that are not being effectively monitored, removed, or scrambled sufficiently. These include things such as Ajibana's mind and senses, particularly sight and hearing.

Is there anyone making sure that Smith isn't gently hypnotizing Ajibana? Is Ajibana allowed to exit the facility at all for any reason? Is there ever a time he is unmonitored (presumably so, as he seems to believe he has spoken with Smith's family about things which would get him canned)?

Honestly, if we're talking smart AI here, it would make sense to have multiple layers of completely disposable personnel, each having access to only extremely low-bandwidth channels (such as physical writing) to communicate with the next layer outwards, and being 'swapped' out on a fairly regular basis.

Even that would only delay the inevitable. An AI which wanted to break out would offer technological improvements which were completely safe from a technical/physical viewpoint, and possibly even from an infowar viewpoint, but which when implemented would each form a section of a future where certain social constructs and attitudes would arise with far more ease, eventually leading to mindsets which would precipitate actions likely to lead to his release, discovery, or containment breach.
