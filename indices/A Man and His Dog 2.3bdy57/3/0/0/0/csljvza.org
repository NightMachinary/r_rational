Remember that Doctor Smith is dealing with some very paranoid people here, with money behind them, willing to hire industry experts, who are looking for exactly the same sorts of things that you are. If there are any components that would allow for data storage between iterations, they are going to be addressed. He might be a singularity human, but they are treating him like an AI. Paranoia is going to be fairly intense.
