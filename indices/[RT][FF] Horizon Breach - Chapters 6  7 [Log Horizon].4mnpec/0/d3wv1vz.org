Players once trapped in a video game world find a way to connect it to the original world... but since the video game world is a real world in its own right, they get to keep their powers, and people back on earth can figure out how to use them as well. Politics ensue.

Log Horizon fans will get the most out of this, but it's written so as to be relatively understandable by people not familiar with the source material.

And this concludes the bulk of arc 1. We'll have one chapter of wrap-up, one chapter of setup, the promised "deleted scenes" chapter and then off to arc 2 after a week's break.

Chapter 7 was a concerted effort to practice writing better battle scenes, so I'd love feedback on that!
