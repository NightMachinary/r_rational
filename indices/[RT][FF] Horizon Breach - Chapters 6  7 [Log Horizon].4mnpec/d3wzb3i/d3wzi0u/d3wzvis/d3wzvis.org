You mention multiple barriers being formed but not in what orientation or where.

Something like... "The barriers enclosed the monster, trapping it in the path of the truck, unbreakable walls cutting off any hope of escape.

And in the microsecond before the truck hit it, its eyes - not operating on the slow speed of nerve and mortal flesh - began to widen...

And then that imperceptible amount of time passed, and the monster was splattered across every lane of traffic as it inadvertently found itself between an immovable object and an unstoppable force."
