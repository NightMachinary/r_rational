The monster tried to intercept the truck, she set up a shield in the truck's direction of movement, and the monster was smooshed in between the truck and shield. It wouldn't have been an instakill on its own, but the monster was already heavily damaged by the other members of minori's team.

I admit, though-- I heard some confusion from my beta when he read the part. Could you suggest how to make that clearer?
