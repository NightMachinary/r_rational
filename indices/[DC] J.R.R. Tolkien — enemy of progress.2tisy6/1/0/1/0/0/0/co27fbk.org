Actually, Central /is/ the good guy...or, at least, isn't a bad guy. It helps to organize and run military campaigns that cause a lot of bloodshed and it convinces the protagonist to do some things he doesn't want to do (and to /not/ do some things that he really wants to do), but it plays straight throughout: it gives people the information and lets them make their choice.

Of course, you could make a case that it's lying throughout and that all of its evidence is stacked in order to force people to choose the option it wants, but the result does actually seem better than what was there before it started.
