Sounded like it could be part of a larger setting, separate from the Colonies that I imagined.

There's human civilizations in the stars, even in separate galaxies that have memories of Earth, those their tales each differ.

Earth itself is undefined, though I imagine it to exist in the 20th and 21st century, unaware that there is already a human diaspora across the Milky Way, even to separate galaxies.

Got this idea from a nBSG fanfic.
