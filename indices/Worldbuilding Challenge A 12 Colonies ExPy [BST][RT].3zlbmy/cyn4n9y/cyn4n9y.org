The cosmos is a very lonely place.

There are quintillion of sun-like stars, and even more planets that orbit those stars.

Only a fraction of those planets are Earth-like, and still a smaller fraction with the correct condition for life to prosper.

Only a fraction of life-bearing planets will develop intelligent life as we know it, with civilizations, technologies, and science.

Only a fraction of those will survive the long crawl to a stellar civilization. Nuclear war or natural disaster is likely to kill them off.

But then there is the final test.

Faster than light travel is considered impossible.

Rather than pursuing the impossible dream, most surviving stellar civilizations focused on something else.

They exited the universe.

That is the great filter.

They exited the relatively barren universe for better pasture, for a universe fine-tuned to their specification for even more life.

It is better to ask ourselves in this galaxy how many intelligent species for the last million years, on a single hand, existed.

Fortunately, somebody decided to stick around. And in their travel between the galaxies, they noticed us, two hundred thousand years ago, just as we were rising up in our cradles.

Those bipedals were complete savages, possessing not even a civilization, let alone recorded history. We were still in the stone age. But there were potential.

So they decided to scatter humanity across distant sectors of our galaxy. Most failed. Those that succeeded left for their baby universes, once again concluding that FTL was impossible.

But one civilization in our galaxy stuck around, eventually ascending to a higher dimension. This was more unique, even rarer than manipulating the very fabric of reality to punch a hole to create the ideal universe.

Fifty thousand of years ago, they noticed Earth. Seeing our potentials, they decided on a long term experiment.

In their study of physics, they had discovered that a form of FTL was possible, in spite of all their expectation. It didn't violate causality or cause time travel. What if their long lost unascended cousins were gifted FTL travel and spaceships? Where would they go?

Thus, they begun the long process of scattering humanity in isolated sector of our galaxy and to different galaxies beyond the local cluster across fifty thousand years up until several thousand of years ago.

Earth, our homeworld, was the unfortunate control sample.
