I've always liked the idea of an interstellar civilization inside an ancient globular cluster. Arctic worlds lit by the full-moon glow of a thousand nearby dwarf stars. The dim glow of the Milky Way dominates every night sky for half the year.

Fleets of ancient colony ships, mining gas clouds and stellar winds for organic compounds. Nomad cultures, tribes within tribes, both unified and divided by their common needs. Maintaining and recycling both tech and resource, every higher element rare and waning.

The myth of Earth, then, is a story of some ancient spacefolding error that threw them afar, and the story of how each tribe scraped together a life in spite of it. Strange tales of warm planets so verdant you couldn't see the rocks for all the carbon compounds atop them, where heavy metals were so common they were a nuisance, and where natural ecosystems casually gathered enough phosphorus and potassium for everyone.

Post-apocalypse, as it were. Civilizations of that sort.
