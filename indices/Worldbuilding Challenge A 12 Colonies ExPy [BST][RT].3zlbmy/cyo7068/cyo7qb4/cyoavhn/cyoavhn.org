So say we have the fairly innocuous and safe looking FTL in the form of a Tele-porter as we saw in BSG.

How are we going to deal with momentum?

If you conserve momentum, transporting yourself between two planetary orbits is extremely dangerous, and you also just found a cheap way to bombard anywhere on a planet with interplanetary speed ballistic missiles.

Okay lets get around that by saying you can change the properties of your momentum on arrival to 'sync' with a given destination then it just became even EASIER to drop something out of a teleport with a relative speed between it and a target arbitrarily high.

Um Okay, Maybe you just end up at momentum zero relative to a near by gravity well. Well you now just got a perpetual energy machine by jumping a big massive object to the top of a high place in a gravity well.

Um okay, let's say you have to fuel the energy difference between your starting position/momentum and your destination position/momentum.

Well now your starships carry around fuel stores that are needing to be sufficiently energy dense your probably looking at antimatter or something equivalent.

And we have not even begun to get into what happens if you just decide to FTL a chunk of a city into the sun. Or a chunk of the sun into a city.

This is without getting into anything like how horrific the ability to warp space time represents. I'd anticipate any civilization that has FTL capability is living under MAD diplomacy.
