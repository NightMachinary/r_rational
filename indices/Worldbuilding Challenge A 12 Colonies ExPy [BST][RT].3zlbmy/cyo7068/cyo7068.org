The means of transit is inherently destructive in direct proportion to how much space it covers divided by time it takes to cover it.

This is more or less my foundational rule for space opera.

If they have FTL they have the biggest baddest weapon of mass destruction you can possibly imagine. If you think you've engineered a mechanism where by the FTL is not a weapon of mass destruction you probably have not fully appreciated the secondary weapons it has allowed you to build.
