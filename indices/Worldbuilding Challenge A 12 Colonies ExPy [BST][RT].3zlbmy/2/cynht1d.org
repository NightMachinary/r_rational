I've done lots of world-building before for civilization-RPGs (play either the entire civilization, or leaders of/within it) - in that they're universes designed to "have room" for other people to make their own stories - and there's a few things that, I think, made the Secret Sauce (not all are necessary):

- Empty, flexibly isolated habitable areas. This is where your "players" put their creations in way that doesn't /require/ joint development, but that also allows for as-desired contact situations. Typically, if you can cause a historical diaspora, you can get this.

- Something Weird. The one time we tried doing "hard-SF" it didn't work nearly as well as everything else. If you're not breaking from the real world - on a physics level or historical level - you're heavily restricted the stories that are basically "speculative history". This can be something that's actually hard made easy (see: Nexus, Daemon, Ready Player One), or it can be totally out there (re: "magic" universe). Regardless, you need hard things made easy, and then that's what people investigate.

- Hidden History: AKA, that every fantasy universe has an ancient, collapsed civilization that left valuable wreckage. Also see Mass Effect and Larry Niven's Known Space. You know you've done it right when wars are fought over history books - not writing them, but access to them.

- Work backwards from the type of story you want to tell. You can have anything from a story sketch (say, youthful hero's journey heavily featuring rationality) to a "vibe" (I want quasi-benevolent trickster gremlins! or, I want steam-powered blimps!) and then alternate working backwards to figure out what you'd need to cause some element of that with working forwards to determine other consequences of those historical points. See "Set in Stone" for an excellent example this process.

Good examples that are google'able that I can think of for places for inspiration for this:

- Larry Niven's Known Space
- Asimov's Robot City
- Sufficiently Advanced RPG ([[http://suffadv.wikidot.com/]]) (disclosure: I've contributed to this setting!)
- Singularity Sky
- Child of Fortune

The other setting that comes to mind is Yudkowsky's "Bayesian Conspiracy" setting, although I don't know if that can be used for anything beyond parables and fables.

From my perspective, the trick is to create someplace interesting and investigable that isn't just some simple important realization that ends up functioning like the Word of Power. If you can summarize an understanding that gives you immense worldly power in a paragraph, that's not going to be good for very many stories.
