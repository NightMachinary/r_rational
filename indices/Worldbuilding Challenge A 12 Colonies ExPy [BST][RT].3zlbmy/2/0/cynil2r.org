Thinking on it more, a more fundamental key bit of this kind of fiction - and very importantly, much of what Rationalist stories are about - is that people are wrong about things. Stories about recovery of past glory is - to an extent - people being wrong about what is possible, or how things can be done. Stories about Something Different can be interesting - or told again and again, or longer than short story - because the people's understanding of the Difference is wrong.

So as you think on this, you might want to make sure that there's room in the story and setting for people to wrong about the nature of things - from reality to history. I don't think you need to know what the correct story is - actually, I think it would be a detriment - I think you need to make sure that each an every part of the character's understanding /can/ be wrong, regardless of whether it /is/.

In other words, take any explanation and history you come up with, and fit it into this sentence: "People think X is true, but they're wrong.".

However, this may bias you towards stories wherein the protagonist is more right than anyone else (aka, stories about how most people are wrong), and I'm worried about the resultant reader bias that would create. I mean, the MRA movements can be described as "people who view themselves as heroes because they understand that feminism is wrong." On the other hand, the feminist movement can be described as "the establishment is wrong about gender."

Which kind of makes me want to ask the question: is there any story that's not about the protagonist being right about something that the antagonist is wrong about?
