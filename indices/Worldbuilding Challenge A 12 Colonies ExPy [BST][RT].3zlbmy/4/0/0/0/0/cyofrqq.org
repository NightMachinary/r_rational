True, the desire of what you want to write kind of trumps some stuff. Although it seems like it would be rather hard to write a space opera rationalist fic that also uses our physics and avoids a MAD option.

Unless you write a space opera with Slower Than Light Travel.

Which is really REALLY do-able and I wish I had more examples I could point at for it besides a good chunk of Alastair Reynolds' work and "When We Were Real" by William Barton.

FTL is not necessarily a requirement for the kinds of things space opera gets up too.
