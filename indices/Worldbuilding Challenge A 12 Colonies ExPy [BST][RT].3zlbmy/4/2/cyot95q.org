This is wrong. Trivially: FTL communication + upload + reembodiment are all possible. Closed time line curves self-sensor - any array of linkages that would permit have the weakest of it's links fail. FTL movement of spaceships is impossible. Heck, the known speed record for a sub-light spaceship that actually carried enough hardware to another system to open ftl coms was well below 10% light. You can talk to aliens when they discover ftl themselves. You can go visit if you are willing to trust said aliens with an uploaded copy of you. There is a freely available database maintained by a very stable alien species some 1640 million years of old recording, among other things, every attempt ever made to aggress via ftl com links and the appropriate defenses against every single one of those methods. This section of the data base hasn't been added to in a very long time.
