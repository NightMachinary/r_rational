  Isn't it annoying how cool plot ideas work out better in fiction than reality?

That's because the problems there aren't caused by lack of technology.. That's a silly idea. The problems there include corruption, war, late imperialism, lack of infrastructure, disease, droughts...

​

Believing lack of technology is the cause of Africa's problems is naive and uninformed to say the least. If it was that simple their problems would already have been solved.

Technology helps but it's not a magic pill with instant results.
