That'd require a long answer, while I agree with some points and not with others, I do agree that it'd be harder than it's often portrayed.

​

I don't think they'd die from disease, unless they are a child or old. Most of these diseases don't kill healthy adults, at most they may incapacitate you. At a social level it's a big problem, not as severe for individuals..

​

Authority figures resisting it are a problem, but there are ways around it, like doing it in secret until you can oppose them, or if you are individually powerful in some cases.

​

Infrastructure depends on the scale you're dealing with. It's much more expensive and difficult to build roads in an entire country, than just to a village and its surroundings.

​

In africa we also face other obstacles like not being able to take control of the countries ourselves or installing a puppet without the UN blocking you. There's a big difference in what you can accomplish with direct control instead of needing to rely on a corrupt government to do it for you while deviating most of your funds..
