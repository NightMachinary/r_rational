I'm curious, do you really think that all of those problems would not be present in a situation where someone from our times is sent back to a more technologically primitive age?

Guilds would veto technological improvements. War would sap resources. Monarchs would not look kindly upon attempts to educate the peasantry. Infrastructure would not be present, either. Diseases would probably kill a modern person before they could even attempt to get any sort of technological uplift project.
