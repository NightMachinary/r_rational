While I certainly agree mass extinctions probably massively impact the overall "relative fitness" of life (compared to that on parallel Earth's) it seems like there's some issues with mass extinction /frequency/ as a great filter:

We know of plenty of more turbulent solar systems which would experience more mass extinction events (if life can even arise and survive there), but we have no reason to expect most habitable planets to have vastly fewer mass extinctions.\\
From what I know it seems as though we are /already/ on the far end of the distribution for stability, so habitable worlds with fewer mass extinctions than our own should be even rarer than worlds like our own: Planets around smaller stars (which are far more numerous) are too close and have to deal with intense solar activity early in their life or even tidal locking. Our stellar neighborhood is less battered by supernovas than most. We also have an unusually large moon and a gas giant which shields us from many impacts.
