  For this to work the change to the atmosphere would need to be both deadly to most life and something autotrophs could benefit from outputting.

That change could easily just be "even more oxygen". If you introduce a sufficiently fit photosynthesizer into the ecosystem (such as mirror cyanobacteria), a major part of the threat it represents would be how quickly its sudden dominance would introduce oxygen into the atmosphere, clogging up the O2-CO2 cycle by overwhelming it.
