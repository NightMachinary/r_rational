  in order to be mass-extinction causing, however, all you need is a simple chemical process. it already happened once when plants added oxygen to the atmosphere. get something that changes the atmosphere, spread it too widely for people to find and stop it in time, and that does the planet in.

For this to work the change to the atmosphere would need to be both deadly to most life and something autotrophs could benefit from outputting. The closest thing I can think of that might work would be life adapted to use say chlorine the way we use oxygen. However for this life to be dangerous when introduced to Earth seems unlikely for a few reasons: The life would already need to be adapted to survive high oxygen environments. Chlorine is very reactive and building up serious levels of it in the air will take geological timescales. Chlorine isn't terribly abundant on earth in forms that would be useful to chlorine producing autotrophs.

Overall it just doesn't seem like given the composition of Earth that organisms will be able to even compete with Earth life without an oxygen based metabolism. Simply because O2 is what's available for oxidation and CO2 a really great carbon source (since we're assuming carbon based life).
