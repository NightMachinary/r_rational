[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_Against_the_Chtorr]]

this book series is actually about the terraforming of earth by hidden alien biome-seeds. most the focus in this alternate-timeline dystopia is on the actual fight against the big fuzzy worm critters called the chtorr, with some subplots of mature theme. there was even a GURPS book for the setting.

in comparison, there was an X-Com game where the aliens were trying to turn earth into a giant organic supercomputer.

in order to be mass-extinction causing, however, all you need is a simple chemical process. it already happened once when plants added oxygen to the atmosphere. get something that changes the atmosphere, spread it too widely for people to find and stop it in time, and that does the planet in.
