I'm not sure this matters as much as number of mass extinctions. Evolution doesn't normally have any way to distinguish between niche-specific and cross-applicable adaptations, because normally most niches are already filled with well-adapted life that can outcompete niche-switchers. After a mass extinction when many niches open up, species with cross-applicable adaptations claim more of them, making these adaptations more common across all niches. I think the build-up of traits like omnivorism, variable calorie burn rate, flight, and intelligence are what lead to super competitive animals.

If this is true, this has a few implications:

- All life on Earth has been through the same number of mass extinctions, so we have a skewed idea of how varyingly-competent life can be. We don't get to see just how dopey and slow early tetrapods were compared to, say, a squirrel.

- A planet situated somewhere with many extinction events (due to meteors, say) is also situated somewhere where a 100% extinction event can happen, which life doesn't bounce back from. Planets that have experienced many large extinction events become rarer the more extinction events you're looking for.

- If a bunch of cross-applicable adaptations are prerequisites for human-level intelligence, then this is a candidate for the Great Filter. Life is common, but it's mostly stuck in the local Cambrian-equivalent.
