I like this a idea lot. I can't recall any SCPs that use this exact concept (though I can think of a few with similar concepts). I can see it making an interesting 001 Proposal and a canon hub.

It fits the bleakness of the setting, eventually the student will have simulated enough history that they no longer need to keep running the Sim. Hopefully they are in the far far future.

I can see the sim using narrative-based bots and algorithms to save on computing power, resulting in some of the narrative-based glitches and anomalies. If the narrative engine is meant to smooth out bugs, the Foundation might be willing to leverage it a bit, but not so much that it erases them. This provides a way to incorporate narrativist logic and meta-narrative SCPs without it going OP or breaking reader disbelief and No-limits-fallacies on it.

Memetics could be the result of viruses subverting the emulation of people to spread themselves and gain additional processing power.

Reality benders and Scranton Reality Anchors must be using related exploits... perhaps a a flawed interface between the mind emulation and the world emulation enabling imagined constructs to directly breed through? I can see some potential for a memetics/reality bender creating SCP that is also secretly the source of SRAs.

If the Student is simulating multiple realities simultaneously (perhaps they have computing resources to enable many parallel processes but not to run them as fast they would like) and occasionally rolling back or resetting sims this can even be made canon with SCPs involving alternate realities and tine travel. This also adds to the tension/fear if the Foundation can guess the conditions that will get their reality shut off.

This does leave a question of the goals of the other Groups of Interest. Does Marshall, Carter, and Dark know and just not care about the big picture? Or to use a darker theory, maybe they know and are actively helping the Foundation by occasionally manipulating and blackmailing politicians to keep history on track. Prometheus Labs know and is optimistically hoping to find a way to hack their way out (the Foundation is less optimistic, the Student might be a hack and an idiot, but the Future has mastered cyber security to an extreme extent). The Wanderer's library has more modest plans, aiming to get their stories and books out of the sim and into the “real world” even if they all perish. While the Serpent's Hand uses pocket realities and Ways made with carefully managed exploits to provide a more humane but riskier alternative to the Foundation's and GoC's strategies.
