The [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/][SCP Foundation]] is a collaborative collection of horror/sci-fi/fantasy stories primarily in the form of documentation detailing the secure containment procedures for a variety of anamolous objects, people, and places by the Foundation. In [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2xn9h9/mk_challenge_how_would_you_munchkin_the_scp/][past discussions]] on this subreddit, its been concluded that the setting is designed to be impossible to munchkin, and it isn't really a single setting in the first place as various authors haven't been consistent with each other. In fact, the website explicitly has a variety of [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/canon-hub][canons]] in which various groups of authors written their own takes, some focusing on different aspects of the Foundation, some introducing elements that strongly deviate from the standard generally accepted canon, some focused around particular meta-plots, etc.

So with that in mind, what would a rationalist SCP canon look like, keeping in mind the following constraints:

- Keep as many articles canon as possible, in particular the [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/heritage-collection-arc][classic articles]] that even people that don't know the setting very well know about. Obviously, some SCPs have to be excluded because the imply stuff like the world is about to be destroyed or is already doomed and some are completely ridiculous.
- For some reason, the world hasn't already been destroyed by anomalous phenomena and for some reason it hasn't been uplifted into a paradise by anomalous phenomena. Try to come up with an in-universe reason for this beyond just anthropic principle (although many SCP articles imply or directly involve alternate realities/timelines).
- Keep a reasonable number of common setting elements present (groups of interest like the global occult coalition, organization of the foundation, etc.), but feel free to heavily rewrite them.

For my attempt to rationalize the setting, I would explain the setting with some sort of meta-rules to reality along the lines of Old World of Darkness or Nasuverse in which the collective perception of humanity influences reality. The Foundation, at its highest level, is at least partly aware of this, and this in turn drives their obsession with maintaining normalcy at all costs. This collective perception might also work against world-ending phenomena but the Foundation doesn't quite trust this enough to risk it. Thus mass producing/distributing/utilizing a seemingly beneficial anomaly would both destabilize the collective unconscious consensus about reality and also run into weird problems. This doesn't prevent the Foundation from trying munchkiny ideas at the small scale and utilizing anomalies as absolutely necessary (in fact, certain key bits of 'technology' like Scranton reality anchors are at least semi-anomalous), but they are constantly afraid of this backfiring.

For stories set in a rationalist canon, I would feature these small-scale attempts to utilize anomalies and how they succeed and backfire in various way, along with a overall plot about trying to scientifically test some of of the meta-rules of reality in ways that don't get everyone killed.
