Hopefully this type of question is allowed here. Someone please correct me if it's not.

Currently I'm outlining an epic fantasy project that involves the common, Tolkien-esque fantasy races. However, given that the story plays with some subversive elements of generic fantasy, I was hoping to make something unique out of these races. Or even come up with new races to serve as analogues.

So what do you guys do to put an interesting spin on or deconstruct the traits of fantasy creatures?

And, alternatively, if someone were to make their own races as analogues to common ones, what would you propose they do to keep it from coming off as simply a knockoff?
