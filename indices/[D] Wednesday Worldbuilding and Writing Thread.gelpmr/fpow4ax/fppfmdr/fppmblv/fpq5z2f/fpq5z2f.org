Personally, I get most of my ideas after binging something. Occasionally some of them don't work out and I have to roll them back, but I usually get something out of every binge. So if you want to put twists on different races, try reading/watching a long series with similar races. Maybe you'll find things you like or dislike about them in that setting, and you can change your own version accordingly.

And if you haven't read the Silmarillion, definitely do that.

  And, alternatively, if someone were to make their own races as analogues to common ones, what would you propose they do to keep it from coming off as simply a knockoff?

Don't worry about it. Just do your own thing. A little overlap is fine, and to be expected.
