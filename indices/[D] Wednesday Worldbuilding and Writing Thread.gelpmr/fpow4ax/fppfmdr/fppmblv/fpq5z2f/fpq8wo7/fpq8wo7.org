One thing I like to do when playing with a trope is to turn it Up to Eleven.

For example: Elves. What are some of their core traits? Longevity, magic power, holier-than-thou attitude. So, our elves are a society of one-upmanship, competition and immortality pushing them to increase their power exponentially, until some eventually manage to ascend and become the gods that the mortals worship.

Or, taking it another direction: Elves are graceful and beautiful. Using their inhuman charisma, they maneuver their way into becoming tyrants over the other species. However, they are still admired greatly, and it is as if they can do no wrong, ruling over their brainwashed citizens. The world is their stage, and every elf has a kingdom - their coming-of-age ceremony involves building up their own.

Another example: Dwarfs. Underground-dwellers, works with metal. Their vast empire lies deep, deep within the earth, where they maintain the clockwork that keeps the planet running. Or, miners and blacksmiths - they can swim through the ground like water, have a built-in metal radar, and can sculp a lump of the stuff into usable items with a flick of the wrist.

Alternatively, you could also completely invert the trope. Elves become ugly, subservient slaves, a la Harry Potter or Santa Claus. Dwarfs become tall, thin, wispy creatures floating in the wind.
