Society usually has advanced notations and concepts ready, but not wide-spread. Math in our history is often developed in advance of applications. For example, we invented complex numbers way before anyone dared to use them outside of math. Even now lots of people don't know about them.

Some notations are used in only narrow fields of application. AFAIK, tensors are only used in some branches of physics. I would guess that other fields of science could use them, but those fields are not ready yet.

That is not to say that math is always ready for new application, of course. For example, Newton had to develop Calculus in order to solve celestial mechanics.

So, in Avatar universe you could just add a small group that has been developing mathematics in the background all this time. (Number-benders?)

Also, in Korra's time the industrial revolution seem to have already happened. I don't remember anything about math there.
