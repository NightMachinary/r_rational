Something I've been thinking about a lot is how you might get earth-like alien life which is overwhelmingly more or less competitive compared to Earth life:

One might for instance imagine that should we find alien microbes on Mars it might not be able to compete with Earth life due to needing long generation lengths (such as those among lithovores) and thus having had less effective evolutionary time to evolve (though that depends on a few assumptions that may not be true). Alternatively should we finally succeed at replicating something like natural abiogenesis in a lab one would probably expect it to be unable to compete with natural life due to a massive evolutionary headstart. So the most naive guess here might be that how long earth-like life evolved for would be the main determiner.

Ultimately though I don't think the number of generations spent evolving (barring order of magnitude differences) is necessarily going to matter as much as chance. A major reason I think this is that we know that by [[https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2014/09/plant-engineered-more-efficient-photosynthesis][genetically engineering rubisco]] yields can be /significantly/ increased. This is simply because rubisco evolved for an environment where CO2 was vastly more concentrated and O2 vastly less concentrated and has seemingly been stuck in a local optimum for billions of years.\\
So the question is how many other local optimums did the ancestors of all or major groups of Earth life fall into? It could have fallen into disproportionately few (for anthropic reasons), an average number or even more than average. While we might intuitively expect much more efficient/competitive life to be more likely to evolve say complex multicellularity due to more available energy, there are conceivable reasons this might not be the case.

In order to get a sense of what local optima Earth life might be in it is useful to consider parallel Earth's diverged from our own after the advent of life. It seems like there's quite a few different "stages" in evolution where local optima can exist, from conceivably before the existence of modern life's LUCA, to endosymbiosis, the development of multicellularity and later.

Edit- question now better gets at what I'm asking:\\
*Imagine portals appear connecting our Earth to an uninhabited parallel Earth which diverged from our own some time after the advent of life. Invasive life coming through the portals is outcompeting and driving extinct species native to our timeline. What differences in biology would you expect among this invasive life by virtue of outcompeting native life?*
