I should note that there's still a pretty significant limit on how quickly the atmosphere's oxygen content can be increased. After all far there's less than percent CO2 in the air today, so increasing the O2 levels significantly requires introducing massive amounts of new CO2 (from periods when the earth had more oxygen).

That being said sufficiently successful autotrophs could certainly cause a mass extinction by simply removing enough carbon (being potentially hard to decompose compared to Earth life) from the air to trigger an ice age. Though this still takes time and humans would probably just release greenhouse gasses to counter this.
