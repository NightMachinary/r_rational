  Not providing sustenance to Earth life isn't going to be enough
#+end_quote

Once it got enough of a foothold that it couldn't be trivially wiped out by good luck, I think it clearly would be enough of an advantage. Anything that can't learn to avoid the mirror food is selected against, more strongly the more mirror food there is. (This is even more true if the mirror food is actually /toxic/ as opposed to merely being empty of nutrition; it's unclear to me.) Anything that can learn to avoid the mirror food creates selection pressure in favor of the mirror food. It would come to dominate one area after another, pushing other life out in a self-reinforcing cycle, and the only thing that could interrupt this process would be the introduction of something capable of digesting the mirror food (most likely mirror animals). Even that scenario would render the global ecosystem much more precarious; it would just avoid a guaranteed immediate mass extinction comparable to the Great Oxygenation Event.
