Tagging [[/u/Teulisch]] in, too.

It's incredibly simple. You just need something that photosynthesizes and has [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_life][inverted chirality]]. Literally just taking some regular Earth cyanobacteria, accurately scanning it, flipping it around in your computer, printing it out, and dumping it into the ocean would be extremely likely to cause a mass extinction event within your (now quite shortened) lifetime, possibly even wiping out all macroscopic life. Chirality is apparently arbitrary, and it's a coin-flip which chirality life on Earth wound up with - but life can't process many nutrients from mirror life. If a mirror animal were introduced into the world, it would starve to death. If a mirror plant were introduced into the world, it would starve everything else to death.
