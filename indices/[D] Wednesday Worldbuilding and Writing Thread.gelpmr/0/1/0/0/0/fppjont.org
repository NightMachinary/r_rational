  Once it got enough of a foothold that it couldn't be trivially wiped out by good luck, I think it clearly would be enough of an advantage.

I should note a few things here: Mirror sugars and other compounds shouldn't taste noticeably different so evolving not differentiate them might take a while and/or only happen among rapidly mutating microbes. So the mirror life would need to establish itself first (without any initial competitive advantage) then stick around long enough for normal life to evolve to avoid it. I was also not imagining means of exposure that would be selective enough to introduce mirror algae without also bringing along a bunch of other mirror microbe hitchhikers, so any superior alien organisms need more fundamental advantages than just being incompatible with normal life.
