It might help to keep in mind that, when Tolkien did his worldbuilding for Middle-Earth, the wildly-inspirational world he created was ultimately inspired by and reflective of his own personal passions. He was a linguist and philologist, who wanted to create a world for his invented languages to live in; he loved ancient mythological sagas and decided to write his own since no one else wrote them (at the time); he wanted to reconcile his love of ancient mythology with his personal religious beliefs. And in recent decades, we have G.R.R.M's A Song of Ice and Fire, which is heavily inspired by his fascination with Medieval English history.

So, with the above in mind, my advice is to use your own personal interests, passions, favourite subjects, to inform your worldbuilding. Maybe you're a fan of a lesser-known or -represented mythology and want to incorporate it, perhaps by drawing parallels between it and the Tolkien-esque model and syncretizing them. Or perhaps you're more into science than religion/myth, you might love finding a way to make your worldbuilding a reflection of the Tolkien model mixed with natural selection, or genetic engineering! Or if you're more into physics/chemistry/engineering, different race/cultures could have differently developed knowledge/technology trees (with or without magic), influenced by their different temperaments and or the resources of their territories. A fan of boats and sailing? Make the worldbuilding revolve around a massive archipelago (like Earthsea!), with each race/culture having its own seafaring style, or a lack thereof.

TL; DR: Try to make your worldbuilding a reflection of what you'll love exploring and writing about.
