Is it possible for an industrial revolution to occur with an easy to use numerical notation system like Hindu-Arabic numerals? In the Avatar fanfic I'm writing I'm trying to see what kind of numerical system the Fire Nation would use. The Chinese numerical system is very similar to the Hindu Arabic one but would it be as easy to multiply and divide? Would things like the periodic table come as easy? I think it would but I'm not sure. Thanks for reading.
