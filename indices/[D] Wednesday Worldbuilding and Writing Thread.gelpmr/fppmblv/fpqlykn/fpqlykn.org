I've recently found some headcanons on Tolkien that make his elves a lot more interesting here: [[https://lintamande.tumblr.com]]. One thing I think that makes these takes on Elves interesting is all the weird traits they have that emerge as extrapolations from their place in Tolkien's cosmology.

So to generalize from this method, think of your settings cosmology and how your fantasy races tie into it. Just having a unique and well developed cosmology is enough to add unique varieties to otherwise generic fantasy races.

So one of the god's craft dwarves from stone. A generic enough starting point. But how does this affect their biology? Beyond just the standard durability and resilience maybe they literally eat rocks, or more generally they have the ability to interact with rock as if it were soft flesh (applying their nature as stone made flesh against the rock to enable them to work and shape and mine it easily). Let's extend this concept... elves made from the trees giving them the ability to work wood... etc.
