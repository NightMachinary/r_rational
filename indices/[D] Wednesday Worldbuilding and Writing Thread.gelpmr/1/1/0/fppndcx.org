I have not, thanks for linking it! I have read a fair bit of â€˜pataphysical' (I.e. meta narrative based) SCPs (2747 is one of my favorite SCPs) and stories, but I missed this one. Narrative as a metaphysical force (as in Discworld, Practical Guide to Evil, and Pact) does make for a interesting meta principle behind the mechanics of the setting but I feel on its own it's too unconstrained to drive science research focused rationalist canon.
