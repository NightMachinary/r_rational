The world is a computer simulation. All of it. This is known to the Foundation (who also know a number of proofs of this statement). In fact, the Foundation has managed to salvage text from a number of documents kept on the same computer (more on that below).

Furthermore, the Foundation is aware of the purpose of the simulation. The world is being run by a university student (who has access via said university to Serious Computing Hardware) in an attempt to gain the necessary data to write an /incredibly/ accurate history paper.

Unfortunately, should the student ever discover that his simulation has /diverged/ in any significant way from the actual history of the world, he will immediately end the simulation - killing all the people in it, including the entire Foundation.

And the SCP objects which they contain and hide? These are all bugs in the simulation. A few computer viruses, some segfaults, the occasional snippet of unauthorised memory access (including the abovementioned documents), that sort of thing.

The real aim of the SCP foundation? To ensure that the student never ends the simulation, killing a world. And it does that by trying, with every means in its power, to ensure that every time the Student looks in on Earth (which is at unpredictable intervals, and without warning) everything that he sees /looks normal/.
