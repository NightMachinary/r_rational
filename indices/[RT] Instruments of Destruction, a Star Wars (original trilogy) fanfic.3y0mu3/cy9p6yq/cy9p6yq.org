It's hard to imagine the sheer, mind-boggling gall of the screenwriters who first thought that a second Death Star would be built from scratch so shortly after the first was destroyed. Personally, as a kid I just imagined that it was started long before the first was destroyed, since back then we had no idea of the timelines involved. I was using that explanation as my head-canon until now: I rather like this explanation better.
