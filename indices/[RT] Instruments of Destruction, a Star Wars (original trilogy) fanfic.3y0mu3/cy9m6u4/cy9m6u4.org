This is really great to read for anyone who has been on a project like this. All the little touches really bring it home, though-- the Death Star "tragedy", the description of sabotage and supply chains, and of course the character's ambition and desperation. It's how you imagine a PM for the Death Star V2 would feel. Not cacklingly evil, just trying to get the job done* on time.
