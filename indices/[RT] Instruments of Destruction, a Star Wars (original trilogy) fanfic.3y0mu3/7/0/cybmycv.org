The idea is that building an /Executor/-class Super Star Destroyer takes about ten months if you're doing things optimally, but if you want to break the backs of everyone involved and be a weasel about what "complete" means you can get it done in four months.

Canonically, the original /Executor/ was a rush job following the destruction of the first Death Star because the Empire needed to push forward its strategy of "terror styling". The /Executor/ was the biggest ship in the known galaxy at the time of its construction for exactly that purpose.

So the timetable for the first of the /Executor/-class gets shifted up dramatically, resources are devoted to getting it done as soon as possible, and the ten month timeline gets bumped down to eight months. To get down to /four/ months, you have to just say, "Okay, half the decks aren't done, life support is unstable, but it can fly, so those are all just going to get fixed in the future." Especially since a lot of what the /Executor/ needs to do is just fly around and look intimidating.

All subsequent /Executor/-class ships get built in a more sane way. (Though in truth, it's more likely that the "real" build time for one of those ships is actually eleven months and a whole contingent of hard-working people are busting their asses to get them done in ten.)
