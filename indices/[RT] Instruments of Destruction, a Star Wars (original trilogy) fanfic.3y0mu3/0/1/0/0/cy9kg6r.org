You diagnose the empire's obsession with stupid superweapons as a failing on the part of the emperor--this is possible, but doesn't really jive with our knowledge of him as a canny manipulator and strategist (in the first three movies, at least). My headcanon is that the two deathstars [[#s][and now]] were a sop to a strong military-industrial lobby; the flaws in all three were planned obsolescence.
