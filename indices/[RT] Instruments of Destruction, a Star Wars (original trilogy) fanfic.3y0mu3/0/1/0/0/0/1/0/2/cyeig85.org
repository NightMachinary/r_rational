EU 'levels' of precognition is hardly required. Palpatine within the new canon remains a very powerful precognitive, and this is demonstrated in ROTJ when he foresees Luke's surrender to Vader on Endor, and his line "Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen."

I would assume Palpatine knew the weapon itself was operational, and that part of Jerjerrod's directive was to ensure the weapon was operational in the very early phases.
