Fair enough. I also like scruiser's implication in another comment (that this was an efficient way of getting an operational death star that didn't /look/ operational, in order to trap the rebels--without alerting enough staff that the trap leaked to the enemy) as an explanation.

From a story point of view, though, I don't like the idea that Sidious's great flaw was his drive for personal power--in the story, he's defeated not because of this but because of his underestimation of the power of the bond between father and son, or something.
