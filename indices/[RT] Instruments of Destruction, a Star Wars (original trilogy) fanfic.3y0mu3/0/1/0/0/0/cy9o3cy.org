I think it's a symptom of Sidious craving power and control, not necessarily stupidity. A dozen Super Star Destroyers are almost certainly a better investment than a single Death Star, especially against a decentralized enemy like the rebels, but the Death Star allows Palpatine to sit on his throne and have the largest personal impact on proceedings. If there were a dozen Super Star Destroyers, Sidious would only be in control of a single one of them. In the context of maximizing /personal/ force projection rather than Imperial strength, the Death Star sort of makes sense.

In /Legends/ canon it sort of makes sense as a weapon against the Yuuzhan Vong, assuming that most of what Sidious was doing was to prepare the galaxy for the invasion that he alone saw coming.
