The Jedi Order was widely seen as the peacekeepers of the galaxy. In order to justify building the large army that was necessary, revealing the Jedi as incapable of preserving that peace was essential. Additionally, their very existence was a crutch upon which the galaxy was relying. Removing them forced them to face the fact that they couldn't rely on others and must police themselves, paving the way towards the creation of the Imperial Forces that could have defended the galaxy against the threat of the Yuzuhan Vong. Also, I don't see the Jedi allowing Palpatine to dissolve the Senate, a step necessary to sidestep the bureaucracy and do what was necessary to save the galaxy.

Regarding Alderaan, that was arguably Tarkin's choice, not Palpatine's. Though I'm sure it had an amazing detterence factor, which may have justified it in the long run - thousands of planets got wiped out by the Vong. Destroying one planet to make a point isn't as far-fetched as it initially appears.
