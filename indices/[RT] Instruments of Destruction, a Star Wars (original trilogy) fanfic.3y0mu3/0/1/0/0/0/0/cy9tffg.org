For context for those not familiar with the theory, here are my ramblings that I wrote while procrastinating studying for the bar:

Was Palpatine really the bad guy? And hear me out before commenting.

I know that when we all think of the Emperor we think of him blasting Luke with Force lightning, ordering massacres, and various other 'dark-side' behavior.

However, if you look at the Palpatine that Timothy Zahn has developed, particularly in the Heir to the Empire series and Outbound Flight, there are strong hints that the Emperor was attempting to unite the galaxy in order to fight the Yuzhan Vong. Thus the instigation of the Clone Wars, with both sides secretly being manipulated by Palpatine, in order to not only consolidate power into his hands, but also to build up a powerful military.

Consider that the Empire was constantly focused on military might, with Star Destroyers, Interdictor cruisers and stormtroopers (albeit the lower quality, Centax-2 clones as opposed to 1st generation Kamino clones). Consider his conversation with Thrawn in Outbound flight, and his sending of Thrawn to the Unknown regions to bring wide areas under his control, and possibly to serve as a buffer to the Yuzhan Vong, an early warning system if you will.

Consider the Death Star. What was the point of such a giant weapon? Fear of a world being destroyed? Sure, but couldn't that be accomplished by an orbital bombardment, turning the planet's surface into slag? Now consider the efficacy of such an instrument against the Yuzuhan Vong worldships. Suddenly such a device makes sense.

But, you'll tell me, he was an evil person! He blew up Alderaan. He ruthlessly put down all rebellions that came his way.He was responsible for the death of millions!

But, I ask you, how many died in the Yuzhan Vong war? Trillions. (According to the Star Wars wiki, 365 Trillion, though i'm not sure where they get that number.) A staggering number of people. And why? Because the New Republic was fractured, weak, and ill-prepared for war. A galaxy-wide democratic process had slowed response times and effective leadership to nearly nil.

Now, imagine if the Rebellion had lost. The Empire was still in charge. An Empire with thousands of Star Destroyers, a cloning system for creating new stormtroopers, who, unlike the Jedi, could fight the Vong just fine (think of how well the Mandalorians did), and a United, cohesive leadership and stratagy, created by such minds as Grand Admiral Thrawn and the 12 other Grand Admirals, with an Emperor able to spread his word with a network of Empire's hands. It would have gone a lot differently. And that is why I believe that Emperor Palpatine was actually the misunderstood hero of the story.
