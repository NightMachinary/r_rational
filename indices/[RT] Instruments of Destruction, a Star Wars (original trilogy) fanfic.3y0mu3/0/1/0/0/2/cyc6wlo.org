I'm inclined to think of it as something like the great leap forward in China. Everyone at every level has an incentive to lie to the level above them (overestimating production, underestimating costs) and there is no external check on the numbers. So the people at the top level may sincerely beleive (as it seems Mao did) that by removing corruption/excellent leadership, etc, they have massively increased productivity, as they have no accurate numbers.

PResumably in [[/u/alexanderwales]] scenario the emperor is surrunded by cronies who tell him what they think he wants to hear, and he is comparing thi particular project to a few thousand others that he is paying less attention to, so doesn't realise are falsifying numbers, the Death star guys have the bd luck that theirs are actually being checked.

You could make this into a eneral point about overly heirarchical organisations, everyone can be competent at every level, but if their incentives don't line up with honesty, and the good of the organisation more generally, the system falls apart.
