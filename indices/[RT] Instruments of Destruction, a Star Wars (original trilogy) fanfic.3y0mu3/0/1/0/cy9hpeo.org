Overtaxed officers. Though I didn't get the brunt of it on this particular occasion, I just watched the trainwreck from relative safety with minimal overtime or stress. My manager, on the other hand, didn't fare so well (but also has not yet been killed, so there's that).

Edit: There was a point a few weeks ago where a co-worker stopped by my office and said, "Hey, did you see the new project plan that _____ sent out? What the fuck is he smoking? Who is he trying to fool?" That project plan became known as the unicorn plan, because it was a complete fantasy. But I put in my 40 hours a week and just went home, because in this case I wasn't one of the people who would get yelled at when the plan met with inevitable failure.
