Actually, it is fairly clear that Grand Admiral Thrawn was aware of the vong threat, and the purpose of the "mapping mission" that he was supposedly exiled to the Unknown Regions was actually to gather resources and allies to fight the Vong. It is also implied that the Chiss have been fighting some part of the Vong fleet for quite some time.

And since we know that Thrawn was aware of the threat, there is no reason to assume that the other 12 Grand Admirals weren't aware of it as well.

It also helps explain why the Emperor had a hidden redoubt in the Deep Core, as well as his obsession with superweapons, such as the Sun Crusher, Death Star, etc.

As far as pulling Mothma, et al aside, there's no reason to assume that they would believe him, and even if so, honestly the people that formed the Rebellion are the kind of idealists who would be unable to make a cold-hearted logical decision to sacrifice certain rights and people in the short-term in order to create the type of system that could stand up to the Vong.
