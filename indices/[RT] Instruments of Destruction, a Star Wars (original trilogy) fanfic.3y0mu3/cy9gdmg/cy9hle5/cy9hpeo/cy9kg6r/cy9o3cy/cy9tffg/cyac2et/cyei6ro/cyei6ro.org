The Jedi, as we see, are not willing to tolerate Sith presence. They would rather commit treason against an elected official whose allegiance to the Sith is not illegal than let a single Sith Lord survive.

Furthermore, the Sith and Jedi have been at war for thousands of years. We have the explicitly deathist Jedi who committed genocide against the entire Sith species or whose Jedi Covenant killed all their Padawans simply to prevent a single unknown Padawan among them from becoming a Sith as a vision had told them, or the Sith, whose initial goal was to provide immortality for everyone, restore dead worlds, create life and galactic utopia, and who /did/ tolerate their Jedi brethren before they were exiled. When you have a war, and preemptive action is necessary to prevent the Jedi from illegally murdering you as they had many Sith forebears, and /if your side is more in the right/ to an IMO rationalist view of EU history, then I think Order 66 is quite justified.
