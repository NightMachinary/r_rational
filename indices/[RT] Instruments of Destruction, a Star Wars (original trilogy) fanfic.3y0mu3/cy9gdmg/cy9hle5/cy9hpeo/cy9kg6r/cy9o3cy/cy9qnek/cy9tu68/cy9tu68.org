  I also like scruiser's implication in another comment (that this was an efficient way of getting an operational death star that didn't look operational, in order to trap the rebels--without alerting enough staff that the trap leaked to the enemy) as an explanation.

If that was Palpatine's plan, it was kind of risky, unless you assume* EU!wank levels of force-precog or that Palpatine was actually reading between the lines of the reports to guess that the main weapon itself was operational. For example, Tian Jerjerrod could have decided to focus on just making the outer structure complete because that would look the best visually, and then leave the main super laser totally inoperable.

*Edit: wrote awesome instead of assume, fixed
