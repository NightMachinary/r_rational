The wunderwaffe? I just looked it up on wikipedia--it does seem like (aside from the V-1 and V-2) these weapons didn't make it to the battlefield. But was it because they were lobbyist- rather than strategist-driven? Or because of the low success rate of any serious research project, especially over a 6 yr period?
