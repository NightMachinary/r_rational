It's difficult. I don't plan to write it from Taylor's perspective, but rather from the perspective of the rest of the world slowly catching on to what's happening. I know how I want Taylor to abuse her power, and have pretty much figured out where that leads her, but I haven't figured out particulars or how to get the ball rolling.

Suffice it to say, she won't be behaving at all like Light.
