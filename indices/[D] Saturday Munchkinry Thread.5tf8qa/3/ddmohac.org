Inspired by a discussion on [[/r/asksciencefiction]]:

You get the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Note][Death Note]]; the same way Yagami Light does, it drops out of the sky and you pick it up, and you've got Ryuk helping you out.

Potential goals:

a) take over the world?

b) bring world peace?

c) just become fabulously wealthy?

d) challenge mode: any of the above, but L is looking for you.
