The Death Note lets you control your targets in the time leading up to their death, which you can postpone by up to a month if I remember correctly.

It also basically requires sociopathy to use effectively so I'm assuming that. Expect hufflepuff bones.

So first of all, Light is an idiot. Your default is 'dies in an accident' unless you need otherwise.

So it's also a temporary mind control device. Find a mid-level millionaire without direct offspring in your area. Have them spend some time with you, create a story about how you saved their life or something which they tell everyone, and have them give you some money or change their will.

Alternatively, find out who picks the numbers for the lottery.

Now that you have some start-up capital, pick a business you dislike. Short their stock for your entire value. Take control of a couple of their C-level officers and create a massive scandal, timed to go off shortly after you short-sell, but before the return is due. Then some of them commit suicide, others die in accidents.

Once you have a decent nest egg, you can start looking at politics. Begin by eliminating all the biggest threats - avowed terrorist leaders die in either huge explosions or malfunctions which also eliminate much of their groups, or die renouncing their previous views publicly creating massive infighting. Dangerous world leaders come down with pancreatic cancer and peacefully transfer power to a better candidate before dying in their sleep.

Then the minor ones. Public scandals, accidental death. To ensure people don't take your threat seriously, have Alex Jones write about how several of your random deaths are caused by reptilian mind control, and then die trying to attack some military installation or something.

Misinformation and public expectation are your greatest allies. Muddy the waters, use different methods, and pick targets and execution methods which are in character, or at least which pattern-match to that type of person.

I'd advise you to never actually try to take power yourself. You just become the moral compass which trims the fat, and allows your chosen leaders to reach the top. Become a reasonably successful investor and venture capitalist in the meantime

There, that takes care if a, b, and c.

In the case of d), you just need to add in a bunch of white noise. I assume hundreds of others will also benefit from the stock trick, so really the only way to find you is whatever method you use to get start-up capital, and that's also going to be milled with white noise.

I mean, or I just write "L Lawliet dies of a heart attack", since I already know his name and what he looks like.
