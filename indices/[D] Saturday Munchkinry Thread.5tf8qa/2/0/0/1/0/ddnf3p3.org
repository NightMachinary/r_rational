(I got the idea from [[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19723-summon-a-demon-to-turn-information-into-energy/][this article]])

Put a rotor in the fluid. Fluid molecules move it either clockwise or anti-clockwise. Use your precognition powers to record the times when rotor is turned clockwise in the future. Then, put this information into a machine that will unlock the rotor only if it turns clockwise.

I am not sure if it is really enough to make a perpetual motion machine. It all depends on how much energy is spent on locking/unlocking the rotor and how much energy you can get from the rotation.

Edit: I am becoming increasingly doubtful of this solution. The information must still be read in some way. Also, mechanical parts will degrade eventually. (Second issue can probably be addressed by making a similar installation that gets energy from random electronic excitations caused by thermal fluctuations)
