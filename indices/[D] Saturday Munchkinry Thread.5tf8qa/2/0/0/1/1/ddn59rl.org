Yeah I know the theoretical aspects but I was hoping somebody on here had the engineering talent to actually come up with a plausible outline for how you effectively turn free computation into free energy.

I mean given how many people on here likely have a good knowledge on necessary information theory and computing I bet somebody can.\\
Given how many settings have magical means of obtaining information without doing the necessary thermodynamic work some logistical details would be nice to know for thinking about these things. As opposed to just being able to say that it's definitely /theoretically/ possible.

Anyway if this doesn't get enough attention maybe i'll repost it in the monday general rationality thread.
