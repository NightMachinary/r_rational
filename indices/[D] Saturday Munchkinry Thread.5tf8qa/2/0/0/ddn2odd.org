See I think those two types of thermodynamic violations are more interchangeable than you think. I probably should've brought up Maxwell's Demon because that makes my point more obvious, but oh well.

Basically if you have information about the position of particles in a system (without having to expend energy to get that info) you can basically run a heat pump without having to expend any energy. You can start with a box of gas or liquid particles then selectively open a gate or otherwise control their motion in order to get one side hotter than the other, then allow them to re-mix and get free energy.\\
So it seems like you could use a system like that to get a heat differential in order to run a stirling engine. So now that it's clear that getting free energy /is/ possible the question remains as to how to effectively manage it. After all it's hard to imagine a system efficient enough to actually make use of a maxwell demon style system with lots of little tiny gas chambers with gates between them, in an actually useful way.\\
However those sorts of questions are about logistics, just because something's physically possible doesn't mean it's easy to actually leverage it.
