The idea of a perpetual motion machine is defined as:

#+begin_quote
  A perpetual motion machine is a hypothetical machine that can do work indefinitely without an energy source.
#+end_quote

On the other hand there's Landauer's principle which dictates:

#+begin_quote
  If an observer loses information about a physical system, the observer loses the ability to extract work from that system.
#+end_quote

It's subtle, but there's a difference between the two. Perpetual motion is about /gaining/ energy without needing to do any work. Violation of Landauer's principle is almost the opposite where /no/ energy is lost as we learn the results of a computation or work is done without using any energy. The first violation involves a machine operating without limit to do an action while the other violation involves the same action being performed without needing to turn on a machine in the first place.

So while they both involve a violation of entropy, they do it in different ways which are not interchangeable. Hence, precognition can't be leveraged into perpetual motion machines.

I could be wrong about my above speculations, but this chain of reasoning sounds right to me. Feel free to correct me if you think otherwise.
