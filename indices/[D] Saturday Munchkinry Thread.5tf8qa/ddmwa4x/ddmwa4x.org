You have the ability to see 5 minutes into a simulation of the future, that doesn't include the results of you seeing this simulation. Obviously you can pass messages back within the simulation from as far forward as you want so actually there's no real limit to how far you can see.\\
How do you use this ability to make a perpetual motion machine? Assume post singularity levels of tech if necessary, but simpler more elegant designs are better.

This power lets you precommit to doing computation then getting the results without having to actually expend any resources thus allowing you to blatantly violate [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer's_principle]]. Given this violates thermodynamics it ought to allow free energy to be produced, but how does this work in practice?

If your answer generalizes to getting free energy out of nearly any magic ability that lets you get information without expending the necessary thermodynamic work then that's even better.
