The obvious use of this power is training people to like you and want to do things for you, which requires long exposure and a certain base amount of trust and positive feelings. Doing this successfully with someone who is aware of this power would be more difficult, but probably not impossible. Probably best used by a person who is already good at manipulation, who would craft a persona to appeal to the target without using this power at all at first, then gradually over a very long period build a relationship in such a way that the increasing satisfaction feels natural. Eventually, through careful manipulation and judicious use of power, it should be possible to make the target dependent on you, or at least highly inclined to listen to you.

Alternatively, if there are any genuine physical threats to the target--kryptonite--you don't have to build a relationship with them if death is an acceptable alternative. Just get well enough acquainted to use the power long distance, have some sort of monitoring in place (easy if you can pretty much universally train people to want to do you favors), and start sending good feelings whenever they do something risky for them--like get near kryptonite. Encourage dangerous thrill-seeking, and escalate the satisfaction the more dangerous the situation. They'll probably get themselves killed eventually.

For insanity--maybe repeat above scenario but instead of dangerous behavior reward pain, or something the target would consider evil or immoral, or maybe even something nonsensical. At the very least you can confuse them.
