Talk to actors. You'd have easily enough English-speaking actors to reconstruct the text of all of Shakespeare, most Broadway musicals, other big plays (and the appropriate scripts would also be relatively easy to locate, since they'd be in use).

Then you could reach out to the hardcore fans of a lot of media and cross-reference that with the transcripts and recordings. That gives you the ability to figure out how the writing is pronounced, too.

Books are actually harder, since they're lengthier. You might find people who have memorised sections; poems are probably a good way in here, too. Certain versions of the Bible or other holy texts would be viable.

And once you've got a basis (say the most common 1,000 words or so) you can start using dictionaries to fill in any gaps.

I don't think it would take very long at all to have the knowledge required to translate 99% of all English texts. Maybe a few months, if people were able to organise effectively.

The most crucial stuff could be translated immediately, but other things would have to wait for years or decades (probably never, for the vast majority of produced works).

What would happen in the meantime would be interesting. I don't know enough about the pipeline that goes into providing services (especially power, the internet, and mobiles) to know whether it would even be possible to organise.

They may be able to hold crash courses to teach people how to use computer interfaces and the like, but if anything went wrong you'd have a snowball's chance in hell of debugging the process.
