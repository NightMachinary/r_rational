You have the ability to induce satisfaction in others, which works on acquaintances at arbitrary distances, and on everyone in line of sight, but does not give any feedback. You can only induce levels that can naturally occur in humans.

Your goal is to kill/dominate/dive insane a supernaturally strong, durable and fast person who is aware of the possibility of such control, but not of you specifically.
