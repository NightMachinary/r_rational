Yeah, there are a lot of win conditions here that don't involve literal death. Messing with their body and brain, containing them, convincing them, etc.

You might be able to convince to willingly deactivate their power if they can, but any timeline where that happens might be prematurely destroyed (which would also allow them to precommit to turning off their power in timelines where their goals are sufficiently thwarted, which would work in all but the "permanent coma" situation).

*EDIT:* And if they can't turn off the power, then they're incapable of suicide no matter how unbearable their circumstances. That's horrifying, in a way, but on the plus side they'll avert the heat death of the universe at least in a small radius around them (enough to keep them supplied with the prerequisites for survival).
