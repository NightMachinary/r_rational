I think having them as an enemy would be worthwhile. I know that we will develop anti-aging treatments within their lifetime, there won't be a gamma ray burst annihilating all life on earth, no plagues, etc.

As for /fighting/ them, step one is to hope that they haven't figured out the power of precommitment yet, and step two is to destroy their armies (if any) and then throw them in jail.
