#+begin_quote
  For sanity's sake, let's say you'll get at most a dozen simultaneous shadows at once
#+end_quote

Is this immutable? If I'm able to distill things down more, such that I only need to know a little about each shadow, would it be possible to use more? One particular idea would be to have the shadows all do /almost/ the same thing, but at slightly different offsets - I would then only care about the extremum of the union of the shadows, rather than each individually.
