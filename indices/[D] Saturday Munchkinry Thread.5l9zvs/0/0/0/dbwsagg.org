I'm not sure your uses are maximizing the biggest opportunity here, which is the ability to get the most out of one-time events.

You might not be able to brute-force many passwords /instantly/, but some passwords are made safe only by cooldowns. For example, a 4-digit PIN might allow you 5-10 guesses before it locks, but you can brute-force this at ~6 guesses per second, or in roughly 13 minutes, without raising /any/ alarms.

As another, consider disarming potential bombs. Consider finding out what's inside a container without permanently damaging the container. Consider running prohibitively expensive tests for free (testing nukes comes to mind, but that's probably a terrible use of your powers).
