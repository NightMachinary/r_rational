[[http://coppermind.net/wiki/Electrum#Allomantic_Use][Allomantic Electrum]] from [[/u/mistborn]]'s Mistborn books.

Precisely how the power behaves has yet to be spelled out in exact terms by either the books or Word of God, so I'll take the liberty of defining the constraints using some educated guesswork, as well as simplifying the mechanism down to the bare bones/assuming mastery:

You are an Oracle. By consuming electrum (a gold/silver alloy at ~$20/gram), you can know the future. But only /your/ future.

For every gram of electrum you consume, you can "burn" it at will to annihilate it, for a total of five minutes of burning. While burning, you see a "future-shadow" of your future self (including clothing and held items) exactly as and where you will be 2 seconds from now. This shadow doesn't obscure your vision, isn't actually dependent on your eyes (so 360 vision), and your mind is enhanced to the point of being able to track it without undo mental strain or distracting you from other activities.

The shadows are branching and non-recursive. For every reasonable alternative course of action you might take based on information gleaned from the future, another shadow is spawned to represent its consequence. Each shadow acts exactly as you would if you stopped using your power /right now/ and went about your day for another 2 seconds: so no passing back sign-language messages for 10 hours in the future.

-To be clear, you are the only person with such "options": the shadows are always right. If you had the ability to see other people's future shadows, then you would see a single shadow that their body inevitably followed through on; the only exception would be if you communicated your own future-knowledge to them: at that point their shadow would branch into two shadows.

For sanity's sake, let's say you'll get at most a dozen simultaneous shadows at once, representing the 12 most reasonable branches of the future actions you might take. Your ability to process the extra information scales as more shadows spawn, but there are diminishing returns.

There's more detail/example/background to be had, but my first draft was egregiously long, so I'll leave it at this. Munchkin away and good luck taking over the world.
