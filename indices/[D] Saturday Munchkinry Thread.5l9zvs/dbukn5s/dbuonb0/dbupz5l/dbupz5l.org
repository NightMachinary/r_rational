The source material uses language like "cloud of images", and the feedback loop of two people looking at each other's futures (not-spoiler: that's a thing too, just not with electrum) is described as making "dozens" of shadows. So 12 might be a lowball estimate, on reflection.

All that aside I said 12 more for the sake of establishing firm constraints and stopping people from solving arbitrarily hard search problems more than anything else. So if you've got some zany idea that involves unions of shadows then have at it, though I'd judge that it's likely a bit beyond the scope of what Sanderson would ever do: examples given for how electrum might have mundane utility are [[http://faq.brandonsanderson.com/node/162][combat and tennis]], not computation, so any computation you squeeze out of it is probably from the margins (assuming you're going where I think you're going).
