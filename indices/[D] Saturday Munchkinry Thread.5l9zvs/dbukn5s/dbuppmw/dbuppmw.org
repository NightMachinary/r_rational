The limit on shadows means that I can't brute force passwords (or lock combinations) which is a shame. In fact, that limit means that I'm pretty much limited /only/ to passing information back to myself from among 12 candidate futures.

I guess I go to the casino first, divide my shadows up into bets on the roulette wheel, and hope that I can overcome the costs^{1} involved in burning electrum, which really shouldn't be that hard especially if I start with seed money. Hand signals from my future selves allows me to send information back. If we're keeping to a limit of two seconds though, I think I'm probably not going to be able to place any bets quickly enough on anything but slots (and even then I would have to pick one that was very fast /and/ was programmed in the right way to get different values from its RNG).

From there I hit the stock markets, where I engage in human-assisted algorithmic trading that intends to make the largest possible profit within the timeframe of a few minutes. Hopefully this doesn't attract too much attention. Again, the limit of tracking only twelve futures mostly just slows things down, but I'm immediately a better trader than pretty much anyone without that power. (We're still some ways from seeing stock markets in Mistborn, if we ever do, but I have to assume that they'd be radically different given the existence of electrum mistings. Actually, /Alloy of Law/ should be past the invention of the stock market if it's close to earth standards, though I can't remember if it was mentioned in any of the books.)

But that's about it. No manifold futures means nothing all that broken, and the time limit means that I can only evaluate extremely short-term things. If I could see /all/ future selves, then I could use a computer to generate ... well, virtually anything that I could see within the span of a few seconds.

1. The Mistborn RPG book says that electrum burns at a rate of 10 minutes per charge, with one of their examples being 4 charges in 1 ounce, which means that ~7 grams gives you 10 minutes of future-sight, or about ~$14 per minute.
