Thanks for the MAG reference; I should have taken the time to look that one up myself rather than spitballing it. I'm not sure how much I trust the RPG's numbers given other liberties it takes ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/Mistborn/comments/42o8aq/mistborn_secret_history_explanation/czoo6u3/?context=3][particularly with the metals]]), but it's better than nothing.
