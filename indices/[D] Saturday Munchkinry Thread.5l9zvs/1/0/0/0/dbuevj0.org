The power lets them cause literally anything that has nonzero probability if they can precommit to turning off their power and committing suicide unless that specific thing happens.

However, I think the vast majority of people, possibly everyone, lacks the ability to precommit that strongly. There are likely many timelines where whatever event they claimed would trigger it happens or doesn't happen anyway, but something extra happens that causes them to not follow through.
