The difficulty here is that if you imprison them, you need to be sure they have no way of committing suicide, because while that would never happen, it would still keep those timelines from existing.

I think the best option is simply to capture them and then restrain them so they would have no way of killing themselves. Then anytime you need to take them out of their restraints simply knock them out with drugs. Honestly it's not that hard if you have government resources behind you. If you don't however then you will need a lot of money.

The difficulty here is that being sedentary nearly constantly, and being frequently drugged unconscious, might reduce their lifespan. So as a result timelines where they achieve immortality might be much more prolific in if they don't get caught.\\
Of course a lot of this depends on how they were eventually going to obtain immortality since any path to that will become certain.\\
However on the plus side this person's very existence makes certain types of unfriendly AI less likely. Of course it's also possible any superintelligence will find out about them post-takeoff and plan accordingly to keep them alive regardless of friendliness.
