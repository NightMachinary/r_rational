Oh, I interpreted that to mean that Clark would set Sisyphus onto a collision course (that would take an unstated amount of time to strike the planet) if he didn't get his demands met within one calendar year.

Or probably more accurately, that Clark had set a dead man's switch on Sisyphus; if he didn't send an "all clear" command within one calendar year, Sisyphus would initiate its course change.
