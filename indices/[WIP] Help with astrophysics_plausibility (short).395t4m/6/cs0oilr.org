Using Wikipedia magic i found [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%286178%29_1986_DA][this]] for which you would need [[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%287.1+km%2Fs%29%5E2*2*10%5E13kg][roughly all the oil in Saudi Arabia]] to bring into low Earth orbit.

So, if one would exaggerate this asteroids orbit to actually come pretty close to the earth, and have a huge nuclear engine on the asteroid, that uses the asteroid itself as reactive mass (meaning it would fire continuously), then maybe slingshots from Mars and Earth could work.

Problem a) getting in more than one slingshot from either of those would take really really long. Problem b) WHY WOULD YOU PUT AN ASTEROID INTO LOW EARTH ORBIT. It would definitely crash into earth unless its orbit was constantly corrected, never mind it destroying all current satellites.
