Mind you that particular asteroid is overkill. See my other comment, but 1999 FN53 is 680m diameter (that is, less than 1/3 the diameter -- less than 1/27 the volume), and an asteroid of that size with HALF the estimated density of (6178) 1986 DA (and therefore less than 1/54 the mass) would still be enough to wipe out all life on the planet.
