I only picked that number because that's (roughly) the size of the Chicxulub asteroid. If that can be adjusted downward to be a bit more reasonable and still give an extinction level event, I'll do it. The question of where the energy comes from is also a head-scratcher, and a place where I'm out of my depth. My vague thought is that if you found an asteroid with an irregular orbit you might have less work to do, and if the plan is to give it nudges every once in a while at the moment of highest impact ... maybe?
