Yeah, I'm no astrophysicist. I was working mostly from some basic equations and dimensional analysis, assuming 100% efficiency, and forgetting about Newton's third law. Of course, I KNEW I was being exceptionally simplistic, so I figured I wasn't any more accurate than "approximately the right order of magnitude, give or take a couple", but it's an idea of just how big of a rock we're dealing with. :P
