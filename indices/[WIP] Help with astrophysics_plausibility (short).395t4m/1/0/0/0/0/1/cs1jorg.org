What about reeling out a few tens of kilometres of electrodynamic tether, and just sucking energy out of the system to induce electrodynamic drag and lower the orbit? Or would that take too long? I know you can't actually get much acceleration/deceleration out of such a system, but it can run constantly without the need for reaction mass. Solar sails might be another option, or even something like a big orbiting focusing lens that superheats a specific part of the asteroid's surface, causing thrust as the asteroid ablates.
