Is there any way around that energy requirement? For example, using the Oberth effect? Assume a really preferential orbit that's not necessarily in the asteroid belt? (If you were looking for an asteroid to bring back to Earth, you'd probably try to find the low-hanging fruit, right?)

I'll update the asteroid size.
