Earth's L3, L4, or L5 Lagrange points would be useful. It just takes a little bit of extra thrust and a lot of patience to navigate to those -- once you're not in Earth orbit anymore, you can just coast along in your own solar orbit until the asteroid catches up with you. Then you just break off pieces and chuck them back to Earth (likewise coasting along a solar orbit), and catch them from a processing station in high Earth orbit.

Lunar Lagrange points are also options but I'm not certain we want something that massive in THAT close of an orbit to Earth.
