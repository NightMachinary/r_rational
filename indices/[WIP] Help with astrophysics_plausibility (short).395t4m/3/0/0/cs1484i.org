Dead man's switch in your computer that activates on detection on any intrusion/transmission of data packets to anywhere but sisyphus and instantly sends kill orders. That computer is used only to send messages to sisyphus(encrypted with desired one time pad). Additionally, have Sisyphus automatically lock down unless it receives a packet every X minutes to prevent people from disassembling computer. All packet transmissions are sent through this computer only. All other computers sending packets after the time of this story will cause dead man's switch to activate(Clark left today as a window where that didn't happen for hubristic purposes). Any communication with the outside world happens through another computer. The protected computer is linked only to Sisyphus(Not sure precisely how...does Sisyphus have its own comsats?)
