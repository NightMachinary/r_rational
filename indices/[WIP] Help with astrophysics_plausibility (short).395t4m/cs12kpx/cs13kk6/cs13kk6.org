If I can get some help then:

Let's say that you're Clark. You have completely subverted /Sisyphus/ by having written the vast majority of its code, having full access to the repos, and having applied two "hotfixes" that let you slip in whatever code you needed to. You're a clever guy with a huge amount of hubris, and you're more or less in complete control of the situation until the point where you have to lock down the control systems on /Sisyphus/ and make your blackmail attempt.

Your parameters:

- /Sisyphus/ should respond to you, and only you.
- There should be risks associated with trying to ping /Sisyphus/ so that the enemy can't try to brute force it.
- The greatest minds in encryption and the best supercomputers in the world will be working against you.
- You can/have set /Sisyphus/ up with a dead man's switch.
- You /most likely/ need to be able to give /Sisyphus/ actual instructions, not just go/no-go messages.

How do you set up the crypto?
