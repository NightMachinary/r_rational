There's an issue with code generation which may lead to his plan being foiled. Basically, in order for this to be safe for the God Emporer to do, he would need to be able to generate the codes in his head, because /everything/ he does is going to be observed to find out the code generation process.

Unfortunately for the God Emporer, this is equivalent to a stream cipher, and we don't have any stream ciphers you can implement in your head. While he would have the advantage of security by obscurity and only one output stream, given that he's going to have to be inputting a lot of numbers and the whole world is going to be working on the problem, I think there's a good chance someone will figure out how he's generating the codes.
