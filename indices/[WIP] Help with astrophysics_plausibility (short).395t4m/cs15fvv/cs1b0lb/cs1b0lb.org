Thanks for the advice.

Isn't there a question of credibility? What's to stop Clark from simply sending off the spacecraft and telling everyone that he's set up this program, when in fact it's a complete bluff? (That's probably a different story; where people argue over whether the emperor actually is threatening earth, or whether he's pulling the most successful ruse of all time.)
