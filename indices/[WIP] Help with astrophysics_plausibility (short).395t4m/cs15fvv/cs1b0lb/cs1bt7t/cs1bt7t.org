Well they presumably have a record of the git commits that they didn't look over carefully enough the first time, so no trust involved. There could even be some dramatic scenes of people trying to verify whether the code would actually work/if there are exploitable mistakes.

Also them knowing the source code won't help them to predict where the craft is as long as there is some random or unknowable element to the machine's decision making (e.g. if a line of the source code says something like "of these 10 million useful orbits pick one at random" or "based on x data do y" where x data is something only the craft can see).

I actually have a fair few things more to add now that I know you're interested, I'll post those too (have to write them up first). Edit: I added some extra stuff. I feel there's more I could say, but that's all I could think of for now.

(also I looove all your work!!! >Insert unashamed squuuuueeeeeees<)
