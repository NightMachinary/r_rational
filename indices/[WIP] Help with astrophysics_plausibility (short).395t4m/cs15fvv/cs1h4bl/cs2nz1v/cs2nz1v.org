I've been trying to work out what this means in terms of story; what changes to the text-as-it-exists need to be made in order to make the science more accurate while keeping the structure of the story the same (there's a problem, there's some setup, there's a reveal, there's a speech).

I'm not sure that I'm there yet, but this is very helpful. I'm /almost/ tempted to just make the wording vague enough that the science matters less, since I figure most people know even less about spacecraft and orbital mechanics than I do. But I'll work on it (probably next time I'm enthused about the idea), and let you know if I have additional questions.
