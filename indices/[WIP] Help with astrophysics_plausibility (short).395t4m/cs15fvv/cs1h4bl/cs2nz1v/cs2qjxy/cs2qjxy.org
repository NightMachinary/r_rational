To me it doesn't seem like there needs to be too much of a change. I'll break it down based on the structure you mentioned:

- The problem: (this is referring to the non-respose of the craft, right?) This can remain exactly the same. When I said "recently launched" I probably should have clarified that's still a window of time large enough for the rushed hotfixes plot to remain the same (I'd guess off hand at least a week).
- The setup: This changes but really its just substituting the details of the asteroid mining company's plan and progress so far. Though its a bit awkward about the name "Sisyphus" and all the clever prose surrounding that since its no longer a good description of the craft. If I think of something I'll tell you.
- The reveal: This can go down exactly the same way.
- The speech: This can be about the same, just substituting the details of what Clark did/plans.

Also, yeah, abstracting the details is, of course, a totally valid strategy.

And I'm eager to answer any questions you have. As long as I get to answer them in a ramble of excruciating detail, of course :p
