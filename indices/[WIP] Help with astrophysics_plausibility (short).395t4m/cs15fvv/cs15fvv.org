You can vastly improve the realism by making a small difference that (imo) slightly improves the drama of the story. The primary realism issue is that no company is going to send an asteroid mining craft off to the asteroid belt in order to alter its path to orbit Earth when there are already plenty of asteroids that come really close anyway. Even if you did, you'd never do it with an asteroid of the necessary size as it would requires too much energy to get it to orbit. Even if you changed the story so that craft has landed on a closely approaching asteroid, the point in the orbit in which you'd mine is way too close to change it to hit Earth. Further, from an audience perspective, it /feels/ suspicious that there aren't a lot more precautions in this procedure anyway because even without an evil megalomaniac, getting an asteroid to orbit Earth /feels/ like you're doing something risky anyway. That makes Clark seem less like an ingenious opponent and more like the company is incompetent. The secondary issue is that if the craft position and asteroid is known, it gives ample opportunity for humanity to send a counter-craft

Now for the change: The story starts with the craft being recently launched. Even though its only going to mine the asteroid from near-Earth orbit, it does still actually have enough fuel to get far away from Earth since, in order to mine the asteroid, it has to match velocity with the asteroid and then get back to Earth. It only needs to be able to match velocity to have whatever orbit the asteroid has.

If the craft makes an unknown course correction and does not send signals then it is essentially invisible. This means you have a craft that can go by basically any asteroid or asteroids, and alter their course to hit Earth. For asteroids near enough to their apoapsis (peak of their orbit where its easiest to alter their course) that would normally be a near-miss this requires very little energy (to note: this course alteration is vastly less energy intensive/tricky than getting an asteroid into a nice orbit around the Earth). The craft does need a telescope with the ability to see nearby targets with the right composition. By "right composition" I mean it can't pick, say, a comet with a very visible tail. This way, by the time scientists are able to observe these targets, it would be too late.

Now as far as security goes, you have to use a Dead Man's Switch (this even applies in your original story). Not only does this make it much more realistic, it creates the opportunity for a very dramatic scene/image. Everyday the emperor could get on a livestream to perform the daily ritual of entering in the codes while the whole world watches and hopes that the emperor didn't fuck up entering that day's code (he would, after all, have to either memorize many many codes). In order to obfuscate the position of the craft, this code is then broadcast to millions of different points corresponding to millions of potential orbits of which only one is the actual orbit of the craft (not even the emperor would need to know which is real, only the craft's computer would need to know). If the craft gets that day's code then it continues on not altering any asteroid's course. If it fails to get the code in a particular day, then it goes into Earth killing mode.

This security feature also gives everyone enormous incentive to care deeply about the health and safety of the emperor, for if he dies for any reason, then so does everyone. Also, if he does die, then it becomes a desperate and I believe hopeless struggle to try to develop the technology necessary to find either the craft or be good enough at finding asteroids to be able to detect any collisions well in advance. While the world unites in this effort, everyone would know that at any point scientists could announce that they've found the asteroid that will kill us all and its too late to do a damn thing.

And as for the initial dramatic reveal, since it seemed the company wasn't doing anything that sounded too dangerous to begin with, the betrayal seems way more unexpected, which makes Clark appear to be that much more of an unstoppable evil genius.
