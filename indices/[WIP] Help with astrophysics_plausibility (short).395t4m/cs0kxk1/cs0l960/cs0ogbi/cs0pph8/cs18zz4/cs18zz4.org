The idea of stopping the asteroid is a good one, because what we really want to do is something like a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit][Hohmann transfer orbit]], which is something like "slow it down so it drops from its higher-energy orbit to our lower-energy orbit." But unfortunately you're missing a very important puzzle piece: delta-v. Rocket engines don't actually output energy (or at least that's not a super useful way to think about them), they consume free energy and output momentum (almost all of the energy goes into accelerating the rocket fuel [the fuel goes way faster, and energy goes like velocity squared], but the momentum has to be split equally and oppositely). This point of view explains, for example, why we have to consume energy to slow down an asteroid with rockets, rather than being able to capture that energy like regenerative braking on an electric car.

Suppose you wanted to use conventional rockets, which get about 5000 Newton-seconds of momentum per kilogram of fuel (keyword "specific impulse"). Now the math of slowing down the asteroid is easy: if its starting momentum is 2.5x10^{15} N*s, to stop it dead (before it begins plummeting into the sun), you just need to spend 5x10^{11} kg of fuel. Which, as a quantity on earth, is actually only a couple years worth of Earths' oil production. But as a quantity in space, you may note that 10^{11} kilograms is about the same mass as /the asteroid you would like to use this fuel to move/. Ion thrusters powered by a nuclear reactor can do better, but only by about a factor of 10. And it's not a lot easier to get the asteroid safely to earth than it is to stop it in place and let it drop.

A more reasonable solution might be one Asimov used to move comets - send up the nuclear reactor, but not the rocket fuel; instead use the asteroid itself as the reaction mass. To do things this way requires (aside from ridiculously good automation and some luck besides) about the same energy as the conventional rocket approach (assuming you have exhaust velocity similar to a liquid fuel rocket) - about 10^{19} joules. Now things are easy - all you have to do is send up a collection of generators that can together output 100 times the output of one modern full-sized nuclear power plant, for 10 years, with no humans around. This is way easier than the other ideas - but in lieu of using the asteroid's weight in fuel, this idea uses futuristically advanced automation to basically run an entire automated city on the asteroid, devoted to feeding the asteroid underneath it into the maws of nuclear furnaces. (Put that way, this seems very unlikely to make economic sense.) It's a bit tricky to find Clark's place in this massive undertaking - maybe he's specifically the guy who wrote the 0.1% of software controlling the radio receiver? Narratively, this design just seems to have too many programmers involved (and them having no coworkers was already a stretch).

I'm not sure about using gravity assists - using more sophisticated trajectories it's possible to dramatically cut down on the amount of delta-v you need (factor of two? As I said, not sure), but a factor of two isn't going to change much qualitatively. However, this is narratively useful because it will take some extra time that otherwise would have been unaccounted for (though perhaps not ten years?).

And also, yeah -\\
"“They'll shoot it out of the sky,” said Rachel," cursing the fact that asteroid shield funding had been cut drastically 5 years ago. "Which isn't even hard, they'll just have to shoot something at it that breaks a rocket motor or a fuel line or something."

"Not likely" said Clark. "“From here on out, the orbit is going to be changing in ways that can't be easily predicted because of the force applied by the engines. By the time they're ready to launch, I'll have made enough course corrections that it'll be nearly impossible to hit Sisyphus.”"

"Okay, first of all, I have no idea what you mean by evasion - a trillion kilograms of rock with a huge plume of rocket exhaust coming out its behind is neither inconspicuous nor maneuverable. But second of all, it's not like we included a bunch of extra fuel for the fun of it, or gave ourselves a bunch of extra time - any course with a chance of intersecting earth has to use a very limited budget of resources. So, uh, go ahead and make a bunch of ornamental course corrections, I guess."

EDIT: Okay, thought of how to bring costs down and make everything work. /Evvvvvverythinnnnnng/. Well, some things. The trick is to use lower exhaust speed, which saves on energy at the cost of reaction mass. So what you do is you build a nuclear powered cannon that literally mines up rocks (okay, still needs futuristic automation) from the asteroid and flings them out into space at only a few thousand miles per hour (say, 1 kilometer per second). If the asteroid is moving at 25000 km/s, you only have to launch, well, basically all of it in order to bring the last remaining little fragment to earth's orbit. The energy requirements can be handled by a single nuclear reactor, which only has to output ~10 megawatts for a few decades. Sure, you only get a tiny, tiny portion of your initial asteroid, and could have much better spent that time using a somewhat bigger cannon to chuck rocks from earth into space, but it's the moral victory that counts.
