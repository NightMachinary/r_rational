Is this something that could be solved by assuming the right asteroid orbit? That is, could you have narrow enough launch windows that delta-v is too prohibitive outside of certain times, and have the impact be timed so that it comes prior to the next launch window?

I was going to include something like this, but I'm already talking halfway out my ass; I have just enough knowledge to bullshit, but I'd prefer the story be able to survive some scrutiny.

The solution might have to be lowering the travel time to Earth, but that makes the question of energy considerations even more apparent.
