This helps you see some of the maths on asteroid extraction. I suggest Anteros as a better option. It's close, yields a trillion dollars, and would still cause massive damage. Or 1994 AH2 which also gets pretty close, yields 4 trillion, and has platinum. Or 3200 Phaethon which would yield 18 trillion and is pretty big. It gets pretty close to earth too.

I also have a suggestion for the propulsion. As it is, it would take several decades to get to earth so they have time to get a solution.

What about propulsion using nuclear weapons strapped to the asteroid? Then he could hack the digger program. He'd then place the nukes in the asteroid and set them to explode and disperse a storm of fragments if any attempt was made to knock it off course, or disable any landers.
