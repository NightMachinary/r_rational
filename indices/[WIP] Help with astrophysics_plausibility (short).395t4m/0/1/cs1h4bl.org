Some additional clarifications/explanations (this isn't particularly necessary to know but fills you in on some details).

I've spent a bunch of time scrounging the internet and a bunch of papers trying to figure out if the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN for short) could broadcast across the entire solar system and expect to get the signal to the craft or if it would have to be limited to broadcasting to a number of fake orbits (+ one real one). If its the former then the following is possible

Since the craft can pick and chose multiple targets at will, the emperor can threaten Earth with devastating but non-extinction causing disasters. I'm not sure why this would be used (perhaps to make the fear more visceral and make people super certain that he's actually capable of carrying these strikes out). I /think/ the safest way to implement this from a computer security point of view would be to send the devastate signal by not by not sending the Dead Man's Switch code signal for a day. The next day if the craft does get a proper signal it will send a devastating strike, whereas if it doesn't get the proper signal yet again then it goes into extinction strike mode. (the other way of sending a "devastate" signal introduces an unnecessary computer security attack vector, imo, also this means the emperor would have to fuck up the code twice in order to cause extinction, a problem which could also be solved by accepting one of N codes a day but at this point I'm rambling haha). Either way, this introduces the conundrum. In order for this to work, the craft would have to break one of the orbits that was initially given. This means that if DSN can broadcast completely blind there's no issue, but if it can't then it won't be able to broadcast the craft again. The craft would have to broadcast new positions, which would be fine cause you could give a million positions/orbits again, except for one issue. When the craft sends the signal, I believe that this could be used to find the actual position, based on the difference in time that the signal is received by various telescopes (and some other stuff I think).

On to a different topic; I'm going to explain why I think its reasonable to assume that the telescope on board the craft would be powerful enough to do what I described. In order for the craft to land on a near Earth asteroid, its going to need to get detailed imagery of the asteroid in order to find good landing sites. The farther away course corrections can be made based on this data, the less fuel-expensive they will be which justifies a fairly powerful telescope. This combined with the fact you don't need anywhere near detailed imagery to select potential candidates, gives a decent range for the on board telescope to spot candidates. Finally, its biggest advantage vs. Earth telescopes is simply that its distance to asteroids compared to the minimum spotting distance required for Earth to do anything is waaay smaller. And in regards to competition vs. other spacecraft telescopes of the same magnification or greater, the emperor's still wins because it just has to be able to find an asteroid of any it comes across that is suitable, whereas the competition has to scan the entire area to find any dangerous asteroids (and/or the tiny tiny craft).

With regards to the energy difference between setting an asteroid on a collision course versus a course that ends in orbiting Earth:

There used to be an absolutely massive amount of asteroids that could get into orbit around Earth with relatively little energy. The reason these asteroids aren't around any more is because they became Earth. Ones closer to the Sun became Venus and Mercury and the ones farther from the Sun became Mars. This is why the Asteroid Belt is both the best best and a terrible bet, they're the closest stable* orbits for asteroids and still very far away. The amount of energy an asteroid in a circular orbit around the sun has is equal to -GMm/2R (G = grav. const., M = sun mass, m = asteroid mass, R = radius of orbit). If you plug in the energy for the orbit of an asteroid of mass 10^{11} kg at 2.7 AU (where the asteroid belt is) vs. 1 AU (Earth orbit), you get a difference of [[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%2810%5E11+kg%29*%28%28G+*+%28mass+of+sun%29%2F+%281+AU%29%29-%28G+*+%28mass+of+sun%29%2F+%282.7+AU%29%29%29][5.6 x 10^{19} Joules]] . This about half the electricity consumption of the United States for a year. Which I think is kinda sorta a lot. It only gets worse when you try this with an elliptical orbit. An elliptical orbit is basically the same as a circular orbit except /slower/ when it reaches the same distance from the Sun (assuming the circular orbit is at the apoapsis (peak of the orbit)). Slower means less kinetic energy. Since the total energy is potential+kinetic, and the potential is the same at that point, this means there is less energy to begin with, which means there's more energy to make up for.

Now compare this to the energy to get an asteroid to collide with Earth. Its 0. Well, sorta. "Colliding" is really just having to coincidentally be at the same place and time. Now making that coincidence happen artificially might require some doing. But to give an idea of the scale, I'll quote this [[http://www.internationalspace.com/pdf/NEOwp_Chapman-Durda-Gold.pdf][paper]] "Roughly 3x10^{-3} joules/kg are required to change a body's velocity by ~10 cm/sec, which is what would be generally required to change a predicted strike one year later into a miss." Or in this case, from a miss to a hit. To compare that to orbiting, that means a 10^{11} kg objects would take 3x10^{8} Joules to divert, or roughly 200 billion times less energy (which is 7 times as much as the calories Michael Phelps eats in a day, thanks for that wolframalpha!).

*Completely off topic but "stable" is really a relative term, orbits are far more chaotic than people realize on a large time scale. Something that's really surprising to a lot of people is that Neptune's orbit was closer than Uranus' until they switched.
