Decades to Earth is a total guess on my part; I didn't do any math on it. I might change that around to be some lower number of years.

I am doubtful that nuclear weapons would be considered a good propulsion method given the potential for radiation; the original plan is to use it for materials in orbit, so it still needs to be able to accomplish that. I'm open to arguments otherwise though. For now, it might just suffice to say "engines" and let the lack of specificity work in my favor.
