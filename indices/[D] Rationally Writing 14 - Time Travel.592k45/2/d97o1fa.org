Oh man, I'm really looking forward to the multiverse episode. I think the multiverse concept is a huge well of untapped potential; I like it better than time travel, but I'm pretty sure it's less popular. I wish the multiverse concept were used more for its own sake rather than as a patch to make sense of a time travel plot. I have to give Rick And Morty a lot of credit for this, although I think that you could get a much more dramatic series out of the concept - particularly if you use different mechanics, although I don't think that that's necessary. We need a /lot/ more crosstime travel fiction.

I had one neat idea for a premise-technology for a novel I never wrote; it was essentially a portal where, whenever you push the button, it splits the universe in two, and the portals in each universe connect to one another. I have a hardline stance on timeline divergences: "for want of a nail" doesn't even cover it because the butterfly effect means that events microscopically change pseudorandom factors in other events in a way that spirals out of control, and the butterfly effect doesn't even cover it because quantum randomness means that events are actually random even with /no/ external cause for change. So, when the portal's opened, the universes on each side of it /immediately/ diverge and there are essentially two different people on either side of it talking to each other. With multiple such portals you can essentially create an infinite network of universes split off around the same time.

Eventually, once the setting is already well-established, a time-traveling variant on the portal is introduced. These portals, when their button is pressed, save the state of the universe and open up a portal to a copy of the last such saved state. From the user's standpoint, it's a flip of the coin - you either open up a portal to the past (by being the original universe opening up the copy) or to the future (by being the copy opened up by the original).

Unfortunately this multiverse gets pretty fucking doomed because over time, the probability of someone somewhere creating a self-replicating nanomachine apocalypse that propagates through portals increases and the very popular and useful "infinite-universe networks" are like dry forests for that shit. The infinite-universe networks are more interesting the longer they go between resets, but also more hazardous because of the aforementioned "apocalypses capable of propagating through portals".
