Yep, I've read all of them. Sam is much more focused on the narrative aspects, especially in those cases where the "system" is intuitively understandable by the reader but does not make logical sense (with examples including /Looper/, /Braid/, /Back to the Future/, etc.). It's possible to have a time travel model where the model is not internally consistent and yet still functions for the purposes of literature/film ... but that's not rational fiction.
