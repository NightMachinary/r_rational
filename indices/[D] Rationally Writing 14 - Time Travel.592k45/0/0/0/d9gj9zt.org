I recommend [[https://qntm.org/time][all of]] qntm's time-travel related posts. There are posts considering the specific time-travel models utilized in Primer, Looper, 12 Monkeys, Bill & Ted, Back to the Future, About Time, Dr. Who, and the computer game Braid, discussing in detail both the models' mechanics as well as their literary features.
