Hey all, welcome back! This week we discuss the ways Time Travel manifests in fiction, and the various challenges and story space created by each.

Reminder that there won't be an episode going up next week, and to stick around after the episode for [[/u/alexanderwales]]'s book recommendation!

Finally, if you have an itunes account and would like to leave us a review, it would be super appreciated :)

Hope you enjoy the listen, and all feedback welcome!
