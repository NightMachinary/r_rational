Have you also been watching /Frequency/? I have been enjoying that one a fair amount and I think it is doing fairly interesting things with its model (which, being only the transfer of information back and forth, is in fact a model you dismissed as uninteresting fairly early in the episode!). It underestimates the butterfly effect pretty horrifically, but (a) I think it does enough other interesting things that I sort of forgive it and (b) at least the time-difference is 20 years and we don't know any characters on the show younger than 20, so it doesn't have that cardinal sin of the magically destined sperm+egg that you talked about.
