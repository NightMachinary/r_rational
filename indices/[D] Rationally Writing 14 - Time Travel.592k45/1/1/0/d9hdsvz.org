It's not that I find it uninteresting (necessarily) just that there's this large set of "time travel stories" that includes things like:

- Fish out of water stories
- Stories which are almost entirely the same as prophecy stories
- Alt-history stories

And while those can lend themselves to interesting stories, they're not what I immediately think about when I think about time travel stories, since the crux of them is not actually time travel. The Pauly Shore classic "Encino Man" could easily have been a "time travel" movie without changing its central conceit (cave man comes to live in the present) or plot beats ... which would make it not really that much of a time travel story, in my view.

And we'd just finished our episode on prophecy, which covers the majority of the "information from the future" stuff. (The movie /Frequency/ is a bit of a different situation; I haven't yet seen the show.)
