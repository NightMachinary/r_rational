This episode was recorded prior to me seeing the new show "Timeless", so here's some griping about that:

The premise is that they're trying to stop a criminal from making changes to the past. They know the time and place that he time travels to and have to follow him to prevent him from changing history. This, at least, makes some sense and is one of the boilerplate forms of time travel. In the pilot episode they find that the bad guy has prevented the Hindenburg from exploding; by the end of the episode, the Hindenburg explodes under different circumstances, and the team goes back to the future ... where the home team thinks that nothing at all has changed. All historical documents reflect the changes that have been made to history, all home team memories have been altered, and only the away team remembers things differently.

That's all more or less fine. The Hindenburg explodes at night due to some terrorists rather than during the day due to some malfunction, but [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSpiteOfANail][In Spite of a Nail]] is a well-worn trope that I don't have /too/ much of a problem with in that it greases the wheels of the story (as discussed this episode).

But what comes next is that at least one of the characters finds their life /completely/ different, and the home team expresses disbelief at this fact, going so far as to say that /of course/ you never had a sister, what are you talking about, we have a dossier that would have mentioned her.

This is braindead! They know that history changes, they know that they won't remember how it originally was, yet they deny changes that they'd have no evidence against, and they make no effort to keep a log of history beyond what the away team can remember. Worse, their entire rationale for bringing a historian along is that she'll know enough about the past to successfully navigate it ... but with every time they go back into the past, the future they return to gets further and further from the one they originally knew, and the cascade of changes alters the pasts they they'll keep going to. Changing the when/how of the Hindenburg doesn't completely change American history in the show, but there are clear effects. Go back to 1937, then go to the changed future, then go back to 1962 without doing your research, and how can you know that your information is any good?

Needless to say, I think this is probably a pretty good canon for making some rational fiction. A team tasked with keeping the past intact, or failing that preventing the end of American democracy, doomed to come back to lives they don't recognize, carrying with them records of histories which have been erased, useful only to see how badly they've bungled their missions.
