Yeah, that sounds like some pretty badly missed potential. I don't think I'd be able to watch more than one episode of characters that are so low-effort. If they were regular folk who stumbled upon Time Travel, sure, but an organization tasked and prepared for it that doesn't take some kind of safety measures like you suggested is about as immersion breaking as a firebreathing dragon showing up to torch the Hindenburg after they save it.
