I don't see why that's desirable, posts last as long as the interest in them and in the comments last.

​

Trying to artificially prolong it by decreasing their frequency just overhaul reduces the activity in the sub.

Slow weeks are expected, so are very active weeks.

​

By making posts less frequent they also become less current, we won't be able to discuss recent happenings as easily..

​

Yes technically we get 1 post per month that's more active than the average weekly post, but on average that monthly post will be less active than the combination of every weekly post..

​

We have a better than average understanding of statistics here, so why make changes based of assumptions we know are flawed?
