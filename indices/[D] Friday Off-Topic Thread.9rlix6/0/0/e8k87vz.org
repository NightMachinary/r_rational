Ballroom dancing tends to have more women than men; I did it with my wife for a while, and they were almost always short on male dance partners.

Aside from that, arts and crafts are usually female dominated. Pottery, sewing, painting, knitting, et cetera might be a good bet.

That said, I'm currently a stay-at-home dad, and childcare is one of the most female-dominated areas left. My experience with that has been that being the only guy is sometimes a bit awkward and/or excluding. I imagine this being different from the way that it's awkward/excluding for women to be in a male-dominated space, but I don't know for sure. Just something to watch out for.
