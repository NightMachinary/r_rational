A thought I often get back to when I'm looking into dating (whether on dating sites on in bars) is that, as a young man who's working in computer engineering, training in parkour, interested in video games, tabletop roleplaying, superhero and fantasy literature, and with a social circle that's more of the same, I'm in a situation where basically every single social circle I know is 90% guys and 10% girls who are already dating.

It feels like I should be looking for opportunities the other way around; try to get into social circles and hobbies that are either gender-neutral or heavily female-dominated, but I don't know where to look; I'm thinking maybe handball or theater right now. Do you guys have any idea what kind of activities I should look into?
