Most styles of dance are heavily female-dominated (the only exception which comes to my mind right now is breakdance). Especially contemporary dance would go really well with your training in parkour I'd say, see e.g. this trailer for a workshop: [[https://youtu.be/NtjEjn9CtfA]]

Yoga is mostly girls as well and a good complement to other sports.
