One of the primary purposes of the weekly threads is to consolidate low-value discussion, a purpose which I think is much better served by having them be weekly rather than biweekly. Looking at raw number of comments for the last five weeks:

| Thread                  | Current | Last Week | 2 Weeks | 3 Weeks | 4 Weeks |
|-------------------------+---------+-----------+---------+---------+---------|
| Monday Rationality      | 6       | 15        | 3       | 2       | 23      |
| Wednesday Worldbuilding | 6       | 21        | 27      | 34      | 27      |
| Friday Off-Topic        | 7       | 31        | 51      | 41      | 37      |
| Saturday Munchkinry     | 74      | 32        | 60      | 14      | 16      |

Based on that, the only one that I think could be justified as going biweekly would be the Monday Rationality thread, but we're not going to do that, because 1) it's a useful tool to help people 2) it's a useful dumping ground for things that aren't appropriate as top level posts 3) there's less question of when/where it will be.

I also disagree with the premise that putting the threads to biweekly would help discussion, but that's a separate issue.
