Sorry, my comment wasn't very well written. I am against sparser threads unless there is evidence that it is better. My issue with short post life is that if I can't come on reddit for a few days or I think of something later then I miss out on discussions / can't expect anyone to return to talk with me. If it's Monday and I want to talk off-topic, it's better for me to wait for friday again than to go back to the previous friday thread.

If people are in the habit of checking back on previous threads, then we can sort by new to get the recent comments that people make, and feel confident that any comments we make will be seen. Positive feedback spiral: more comments -> more visibility -> more comments?
