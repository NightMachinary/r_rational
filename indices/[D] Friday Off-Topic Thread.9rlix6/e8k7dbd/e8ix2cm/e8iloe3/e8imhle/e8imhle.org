Did anyone think about making the weekly top-level posts only every other week? Or was there a discussion somewhere?

I think that could put more content into one top-level post.

And that would make it worthwhile to open it.

And if more open it, there will be more replies and also more content/questions/scenarios.

And if one really wants to post something in an off-week, they can still use the old post.

Which should encourage people to read again the old post so they can see the replies and comment themselves.

Off course I could be wrong, in which case it could just returned to weekly.

Also, munchkinery probably can stay weekly.

It is just that I have the experience that too often can sometimes kill participation.

Also I hope formatting works... I don't know if the app still uses markup or not or both or something different.
