For the first time in a long while, I have access to a library, meaning I have /real/ books available. I've been meaning to read both Prachett and Sanderson for a while, but looking at the catalogue's a little confusing. Any ideas where to start with Pratchett? Is Sanderson like Pratchett, with two or three books in a series and multiple series in the same universe, or am I misremembering?
