Pratchett's Discworld series is in chronological order from first-written to last-written, but it consists of sub-series that follow a particular character, area or institution, but some sub-series are longer than two or three books (the Watch subseries has five or six, off the top of my head). The first few books follow Rincewind, and while they're good, they're not the very best. The Ankh-Morpork Watch is pretty widely considered to be one of, if not the, best introductory sub-series, as far as I'm aware. I started with it, and really enjoyed it - I also didn't feel like I was missing any background information.

So my personal recommendation would be to start with Guards, Guards! and then Men At Arms. After that you can either keep reading more about the Watch, or switch to a different subseries, or start reading all the books in chronological order.

Another good starting point, although it's more YA, is The Wee Free Men. It's shorter and has less setting, but is also the starting point of a subseries.
