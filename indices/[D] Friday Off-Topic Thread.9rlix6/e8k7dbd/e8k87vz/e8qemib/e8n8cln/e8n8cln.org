Roller Derby's a good one, women play and men can be referees and non-skating officials, and it's got a good community spirit. If you are happy to learn to roller skate, of course! (Referees can rollerblade, if you prefer).

There are also a few men's teams but if you want to hang around women more then you probably want to stick with reffing in a women's league.
