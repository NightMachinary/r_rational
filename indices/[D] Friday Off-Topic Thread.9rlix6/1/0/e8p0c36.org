Finished it over the weekend, along with Greg Egan's "Phoresis", since both just came out recently. Very much enjoyed both; Phoresis is overtly rational (and not abstract as Egan can be), FWIW. I'm certainly tempted to say Collapsing Empire is rational-adjacent; the MCs (and antagonists, for that matter) are smart and often solve problems through creative application of available resources, though there is also a certain level of deus ex machina.
