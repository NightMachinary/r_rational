It was an interesting decision to left the motivations of the angels and God completely unexplained. Was the God just a bored kid playing with ants, similar to how people torture sims in The Sims games or was there some ulterior plan? Was he just a self-obsessed tyrant who wanted complete devotion for its own sake like the dictators of our world? Or was he seeking some kind of artistic beauty and harmony? It's obvious that he still paid attention to people, making all those decisions.
