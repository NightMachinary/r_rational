Thanks! I really wanted to drive home the point that a lot of things go wrong purely because of small and totally unnecessary mistakes, so I'm glad I got that point across. It's sort of a "banality of evil" argument, except for irrationality.

This chapter was also meant to show why Shikamaru couldn't be the main character of the story. A lot of people asked me when I started writing why Naruto should be the MC, and not someone smarter like Sasuke or Shikamaru or Sakura. And the explanation for that is, well, intelligence is simply not enough to make you rational. You also have to care, and be creative, and *want* to save the world. Shikamaru fails as a rationalist because he does not start thinking until the fight has already started, and that is simply way too late to make a difference. Like the Fourth Hokage said, battles are decided by the time swords are drawn, not when they are sheathed...
