The idea of "mistakes" that I talked about was inspired by the below section in Chapter 12 where Kakashi is answering Sakura's question of why he is telling stories about his painful past. It wasn't explicitly spelled out but I believe the implication is that Minato made a serious mistake by only giving one summoning Kunai to his team when he could easily have given multiple. If Minato had given each member of the team a summoning Kunai then Rin could have easily received a rescue and the disaster that broke their team would never have occurred.

(“Sometimes, tragedies happen for important reasons that you just can't do anything about, and if that's the case there's no point in beating yourself up over it. But most of the time, terrible things happen for stupid and pointless reasons, like seeing your teacher make a mistake but not saying anything because it would be just too awkward. Or having your team fall apart, because you did not think it was your responsibility to keep it together. If all of you were to die, and I could have easily prevented it just by telling you a few stories...” He smiled at her, and it was visible even through the mask. “Well, that would just be too pathetic.” )
