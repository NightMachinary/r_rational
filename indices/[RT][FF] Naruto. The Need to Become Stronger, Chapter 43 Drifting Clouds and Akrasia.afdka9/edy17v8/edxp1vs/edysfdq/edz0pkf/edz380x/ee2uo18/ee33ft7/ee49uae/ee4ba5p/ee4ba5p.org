Honestly, I do think that wanting to save the world follows logically from the starting preferences most people have. If you care about your friends and family on account of their qualities, and if the world is filled with people with similar qualities who you would also like if you got to know them better, then it follows logically that you care about the world. I think humans are really bad at imaging things of a vast scale, whether it's the size of the galaxy or the suffering of humanity as a whole, but I don't think being physically or mentally unable to feel empathy for everyone on the planet means that those people are not included in your utility function. I really do believe that any rational person with the potential to save the world, barring extreme exceptions, would do anything in their power to do exactly that.
