You're describing the difference between being /proactive/ and being /reactive/, or when it's applied to a main character, the difference between an /active protagonist/ and a /passive protagonist/.

Setting aside the obvious benefits of the former from a rational perspective, /proactive/ characters are far more interesting in a storytelling sense, at least when the story follows them continuously, because they have goals and ambition to accomplish something, and set out to do it the best they can. Things don't just 'happen' to them, they happen in response to their actions.

You never want your main character to be a passive protagonist, as it almost always comes across as less interesting, if not outright boring. You see this a lot in YA or kids fiction, like in Hunger Games or the Series of Unfortunate Events. Great for their age category, incredibly dull for older people as you really don't /care/ for the characters. But for side characters with a high mortality rate, like these? It's great, because you give a contrast to the main character that shows why the latter /is/ the main character.

Sophronius is totally right. Intelligence is just an attribute, its how you use it that counts. Shikamaru is about as far on the passive side of the active-passive spectrum as you can get. He did well because of his intelligence and powers, but he never really had much motivation to use them. This is a far more likely ending for even the /original/ character in its universe.
