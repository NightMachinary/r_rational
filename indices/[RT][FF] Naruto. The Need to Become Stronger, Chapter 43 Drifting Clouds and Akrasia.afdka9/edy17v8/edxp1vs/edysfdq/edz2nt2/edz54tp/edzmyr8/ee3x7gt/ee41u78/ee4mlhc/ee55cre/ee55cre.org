Oh, I'm not saying Kankuro isn't a badass. He's my third favorite character in the entire series, and I do love watching him win. It was just odd that it was so easy and fast against Akamaru when it seems that, realistically, it wouldn't be. Even the change doesn't really address that.

The puppet has more than just the four arms, right? Maybe something along the lines of "four of its arms grabbed hold of one of Akamaru's limbs, mechanisms locking into place with an audible /click/ while both body and limbs extended blades. Akamaru struggled with the restraints for a moment and had just begun to howl in fury before being silenced by the sounds of whirling blades and tearing flesh as the remaining limbs spun in different directions. With an almost casual motion, the bloodstained puppet tossed four separate bundles of crimson fur back at Kiba"

I can't really see it doing what was said with just its four arms, but if they /also/ work as manacles to hold an enemy for capture while the other limbs can be used to kill them?

I'm cool with the characters all being 'smarter' but still limited in their views. I didn't even really think of how the trauma would affect Sasuke beyond the 'power at all costs' bit, but with or without that, he's working exactly true to both character and how one could assume he would react.

I never assumed Naruto was not smart. If anything, he's very smart, he's just bad at expressing it, and social skills in general. It just seems odd to me he still has the 'hate Sasuke' fixation carried over from the anime, or is somehow angry at the entire village after all this time to where he can be manipulated.

I had figured the 'killing Gaara' moment was a major character building part for him where he realized that not only do the 'adults' understand exactly what he is saying, but they see it as a desirable goal, and why even normal people wouldn't want to accept what he says. They don't want to listen, because if they accept it, they will be killed.

I don't know, I still like it, and still enjoy the story, it just seems like he's backslid a bit from where he was. The logical conclusion to "the entire nation, if not world, is set up as to such a way that magic-using child killers is a desirable or necessary outcome to survival" isn't to rage at random people for not listening or enabling it, but to either find a way to survive, adapt, or change it. Or, you know, at least rage at the people who perpetuate the system from above within limits that don't get you killed.

Still, love the story, please write us more!

*EDIT*: OK, I have to point out one other, very good thing. I like to focus on storywriting and the flow of it, Properly laid hints or details that later come to fruition are the signs of good storytelling, and they are a joy to see.

So when I read /this/ at the beginning:

#+begin_quote
  " In truth, they should not even be wearing those jackets: Their team had failed the chÅ«nin exams miserably, and all of Shikamaru's supposed genius had done exactly nothing to change that. But in the end, family ties and politics had achieved what genius could not.
#+end_quote

And then saw the result at the end? *VERY* well done. He was proven correct, that such a decision to 'pass' them was foolish, and it was shown in the most brutal of ways. Properly foreshadowed, demonstrated well, and makes good logical sense.

I love this stuff, and find it often in your stories. Thought I should bring that up.
