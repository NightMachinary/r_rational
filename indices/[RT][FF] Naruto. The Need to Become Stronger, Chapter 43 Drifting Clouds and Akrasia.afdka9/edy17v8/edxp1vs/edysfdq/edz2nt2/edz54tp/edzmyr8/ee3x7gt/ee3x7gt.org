This was a good solid reply.

  Choji's technique works by creating a shell of chakra around his body That makes a lot of sense, actually. Still, this is one of those situations where one has to wonder why they had such a limited variant of a technique, and why it wasn't developed to be more useful. But that's on the original show. I can accept this explanation, it makes sense.

  You're right that this still shouldn't be enough strength to rip Akamaru apart, but remember that Kankuro's puppet has saws and blades installed. So he did not so much pull the dogs limbs apart as hack them off and then toss them back at Kiba.

This explanation, not so much. It is still predicated on the assumption that projecting chakra at a distance and enhancing the puppet will provide /more/ strength than an already physically strong opponent using chakra to boost their own muscles /directly/, which seems really hard to believe.

There was also no 'hacking' or 'sawing' going on in the original description. Within an instant, he was drawn and quartered before he had time to mount any sort of response whatsoever. It seems rather unbelievable, honestly, especially as this requires Kankuro's projections to be both faster and stronger in actions than Kiba's. It's your story and all, I just find it really hard to believe that it would be done so quickly and effortlessly.

I can picture the entire battle in my head as I read it, but this part always just brings me right out. Still, it's your story, and my nitpicks don't mean I don't appreciate it. I enjoy the rest of it immensely and its been a great read, so thanks for that.

  he can get Naruto to take just about any position just by pissing him off and playing on his lingering feelings of resentment

See, I guess I get the Sasuke thing, he just seems super reckless about it. If I simply go with him not being a Rational character (or one whose failed at a key calculation), then it's less of an issue. He's in a hurry and wants his power now, and really doesn't care who else suffers for it. So I'm good with that, because it makes sense with the character development he's gone through.

I just don't get why Naruto has all the same emotional and inferiority baggage as the original. He's supposed to be the Rational protagonist, and he's overcome some of his other issues while logically having others (his drive to learn more about the system tends to blind him as to many of the implications, and he rarely pays attention to the complexities of social interaction), but this version has the same fears and neuroses toward Sasuke as the original. And it doesn't quite make sense to me as to why. Why does he have these negative feelings toward Sasuke in this version?
