  I find it unusual that the guy who works with extreme body-modification would fall so easily to poison.

It's not body modification - that would be ridiculously powerful when taken to its logical extreme. I didn't have time to explain it yet in-story, but Choji's technique works by creating a shell of chakra around his body; essentially using a modified version of the shadow clone technique to create a second, larger body around himself. You can see that this is also how it works in canon, like when Choji takes a hit and his giant body 'pops' just like a shadow clone.

  Also, since when is the puppet that strong? Both Kiba and his dog are super-charged with some 'savage' chakra that vastly increase the strength of their already impressive muscles, but the guy that uses telekinetic strings is somehow able to move them with greater strength?
#+end_quote

Two chapters ago, Naruto and Kankuro discuss the puppet technique, and they mention that it's a two-parter which uses chakra strings to 'project' the puppet technique (this part is also canon, I think). In other words, Kankuro uses chakra strings to cast a kind of spirit-projection technique onto his puppet so that he can move it like his own body, and with much more strength than the strings themselves. Otherwise there would be no point in making a humanoid puppet, just like you said. (Naruto also points this out in Kankuro's fight with Tenten, back in the chunin exams)

You're right that this still shouldn't be enough strength to rip Akamaru apart, but remember that Kankuro's puppet has saws and blades installed. So he did not so much pull the dogs limbs apart as hack them off and then toss them back at Kiba.

I hope I didn't upset any dog-owners with that description. :c

  I'm unsurprised it backfired on these guys so easily, but I'm still curious as to why R-Naruto and R-Sasuke would be so eager to include the Sand Duo, earlier, especially as they live in a world full of paranoid killers.

In the case of Sasuke? Well, as the great Emperor Palpatine once put it, "[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg14jNbBb-8][POWAH! UNLIMITED POWAH!]]"

Sasuke wants vengeance. He is up against a ridiculously powerful opponent who he *knows* he cannot beat using just his own abilities, so he'll take any opportunity he can get to become stronger. He was perfectly well aware that he was endangering the Leaf in the process, but who cares when it helps him achieve his real goals?

As for Naruto, if you go back two chapters, you can see how he was originally dead-set against the idea only to be played by Sasuke like a schmuck:

#+begin_quote
  “You want to trade techniques with us?” Naruto looked around at the others, searching for any sign that they thought it as mad as it clearly was. “But we fought each other during the chūnin exams. How can you possibly want to trade with us after I ki-”

  Sakura yanked Naruto back by the shoulder, nearly causing him to stumble and fall. “What my friend is trying to say is that we wouldn't want to get you into any kind of trouble. Surely the rest of your Village would not be too happy if you shared your secrets with us?”

  Sasuke and Sakura glanced at each other, though Naruto was honestly not sure what the glance was supposed to convey. His teammates might both consider him ‘unbearably naïve', but when it came to trusting ninjas from a foreign Village whose sibling he had murdered he was hardly about to disagree.

  “All right,” said Sasuke. He turned towards the Sand ninjas. “In that case...”

  “Hold on,” Naruto protested, “this whole meeting was /my/ idea. Don't I get a say in things?”

  “Fair enough,” said Sasuke. “What do you think?”

  “Uhm,” said Naruto, realizing that he now had to come up with an opinion. “I mean, I kinda agree with Hinata-chan that the whole thing seems... weird. But if they really do wanna work with us, it could be a very good thing. Uhm, meaning the benefits outweighs the risk, as long as we don't reveal our biggest weaknesses to them or anything.” He absolutely /had/ to get his hands on that puppet technique, and so did the rest of the group, whether they knew it or not. Besides which, this could be a once in a lifetime opportunity to try and mend the mistakes of the past and maybe even prevent a war in the future.

As Sasuke hinted at when he was training Hinata, he can get Naruto to take just about any position just by pissing him off and playing on his lingering feelings of resentment, and then taking the opposite position:

#+begin_quote
  The illusion crossed its arms. “I refuse! I stubbornly refuse to follow your perfectly sensible suggestion even though it's exactly what I would have done anyway. But since I know that's what you would /expect/ me to say I'll instead do the exact opposite of what I just said purely out of spite. So there!”

  “See,” said Sasuke, “that whole process would have taken a lot longer with the real Naruto. I think I keep making him too self-aware by accident because he has access to my brain instead of the noodle-fuelled mush inside of his own skull.”

Add in a little Sharingan genjutsu like you saw in the last chapter, and yeah, Sasuke can pretty much play him like a flute.
