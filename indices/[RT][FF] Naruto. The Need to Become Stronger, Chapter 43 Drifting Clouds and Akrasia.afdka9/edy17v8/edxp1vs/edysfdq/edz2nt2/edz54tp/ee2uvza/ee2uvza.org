A powerful enough poison can kill with a drop, altering his size wouldn't help with such a large dose; and there's such a wide variety of ways they can mess up your body it's unreasonable to expect anyone but a medic who could modify every metabolic process on the fly (which would be an insane amount of skill) to become immune to all poisons.
