Something that I really liked about this piece of fanfiction is how you emphasize the existence of consequences for the decision to avoid unpleasant topics and tasks. You did a great job with Kakashi when he talked about how one of the reasons why his team died is that he was just to embarrassed to point out an obvious mistake made by Minato and in this chapter you did a similarly great job of showing the consequences of Shikamaru's laziness.
