Okay, sure, but you have to have *some* type of goal. Instrumental Rationality is defined as your ability to optimize towards achieving your goals. I don't think you can meaningfully call someone rational if they just lie in bed all day. Also, I think people vastly exaggerate the number of people who genuinely have zero empathy - I think that most people who are called psychopaths just have some kind of mental illness or brain damage, or care about some people but lack the imagination to extend that caring to others, and such a person could hardly be called rational.
