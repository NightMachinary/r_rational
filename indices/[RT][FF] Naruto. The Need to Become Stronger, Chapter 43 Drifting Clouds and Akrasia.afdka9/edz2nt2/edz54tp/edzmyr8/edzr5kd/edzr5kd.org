Shadow clones can also hit things! Sure, you can damage your knuckles punching someone, but it hurts the other guy a lot more or else you wouldn't be doing it. Also, there's a reason why NTBS!Choji prefers to increase the size of his weapons instead of making his entire body a bigger target: If you have your technique take on the properties of hardened wood or steel rather than flesh, it's much less likely to get damaged and therefore disrupted. Naruto also prefers to have his clones fight by using techniques or throwing explosives for exactly that same reason.

It's also possible that your technique is less likely to get disrupted if you know its about to get damaged, because you can adjust the flow of chakra accordingly: I.e. when one of canon!Naruto's clones intentionally gets stabbed to trick the enemy into thinking he's the real one.
