  There was also no 'hacking' or 'sawing' going on in the original description. Within an instant, he was drawn and quartered before he had time to mount any sort of response whatsoever. It seems rather unbelievable, honestly, especially as this requires Kankuro's projections to be both faster and stronger in actions than Kiba's. It's your story and all, I just find it really hard to believe that it would be done so quickly and effortlessly.

  I can picture the entire battle in my head as I read it, but this part always just brings me right out. Still, it's your story, and my nitpicks don't mean I don't appreciate it. I enjoy the rest of it immensely and its been a great read, so thanks for that.

Cheers, I really appreciate the feedback. I did actually worry in this part that I was doing a disservice to the characters by having them beaten so easily, but I kind of figured I needed events to happen quickly to keep that saw shock value of Shikamaru losing his allies one by one right in front of him. So maybe I do need to edit that passage to make it more clear what's happening.

In my defence though, I also think its easy to forget how scary Kankuro was in the first half of Naruto - he literally slaughtered every opponent he fought the second they came within melee range of his puppet:

He even managed to beat Shino to a draw, and Shino had a perfect counter to his chakra strings AND he had already managed to place a queen on Kankuro before the fight started. The Sand Siblings were no joke.

For the rest, @GreatSwordsmith pretty much has it right. The characters in NTBS may be smarter than in canon, but they're still human: Sasuke is traumatized and cannot think clearly where his brother is involved - Itachi is even scarier than in canon and unlike in canon Sasuke *knows* how utterly outmatched he is. So he's desperate. Naruto is indeed driven nuts by the fact that everybody in the Village dismisses him out of hand, even when he is repeatedly proven correct like when he said there was a war coming, while the guy who tortured him in chapter one pretty much gets a free pass for everything he does. Naruto's resentment to Sasuke went up to eleven though because Sasuke mindraped Hinata, who was one of Naruto's only childhood friends, and the only person who ever expressed something like romantic interest in him. So yeah, Naruto has every reason to be pissed off.

It's funny though: I originally intended this to be a lesson for the audience to show that just because a character really *feels* unreasonable because nobody listens to them in-universe doesn't mean they actually are. Instead, however, I ended up learning the lesson that anything that is not made explicit in-universe is assumed not to be a thing: I.e. if Naruto is called stupid by other characters, then the reader will assume that he is in fact stupid unless stated otherwise.

Edit: I have now changed the passage to the below. Hopefully this will make it more clear what is going on:

  The pair circled their enemy with perfect synchronicity, Kiba pouncing towards Temari while Akamaru leaped onto the back of Kankuro's puppet and began to tear into its wooden frame. Before Shikamaru could react the top half of the puppet spun around and its four bladed arms each grabbed hold of one of Akamaru's limbs. There was a sound of whirling blades as the wooden arms spun in four separate directions, and with an almost casual motion tossed four separate bundles of crimson fur back at Kiba.
