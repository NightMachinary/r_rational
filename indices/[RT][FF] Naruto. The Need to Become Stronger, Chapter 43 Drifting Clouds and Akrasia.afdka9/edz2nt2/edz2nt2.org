Hmmm. What an amazing (un)surprise that the people from another village you share your deepest secrets with (despite only having previously met them as antagonists) could /ever/ possibly use that against you. A shocker for the ages.

I'm unsurprised it backfired on these guys so easily, but I'm still curious as to why R-Naruto and R-Sasuke would be so eager to include the Sand Duo, earlier, especially as they live in a world full of paranoid killers.

I find it unusual that the guy who works with extreme body-modification would fall so easily to poison. Even if he didn't mess with his metabolism or alter his body at the physical and chemical level (all possible ways for his size and mass-manipulation to work) that could interfere with foreign chemicals, it seems reasonable that his increased size would result in a thicker layer of body fat (or empty space between the layers for when he goes into 'balloon mode'), which would serve to prevent attacks from small poisoned weapons from delivering their payloads to anything but his capillaries (which would be one reason to do it in the first place). I mean, his schtick really isn't helpful against these guys on his own, so he'd probably die anyway, this just seemed an unusual way to go.

Also, since when is the puppet that strong? Both Kiba and his dog are super-charged with some 'savage' chakra that vastly increase the strength of their already impressive muscles, but the guy that uses telekinetic strings is somehow able to move them with greater strength? I'm surprised this guy bothers using puppets at all. If he can move objects with such power, he might as well just use their universe's equivalent of really thin piano wire and move it so fast it could cut through limbs while being barely visible. He could thus have physical 'strings' that most people assume he needs to control and manipulate the puppets by maintaining a chakra connection. If anything, this serves as a layer of deception to his powers that gives him an advantage, as people tend to focus on the puppet as the real threat, only to find out too late that the strings themselves are far more deadly. A rational Kankuro is NOT an enemy I would ever want to be forced to fight, ninja powers or no.

*EDIT* : Also, amazing update to an amazing story. Thank you for continuing this series.
