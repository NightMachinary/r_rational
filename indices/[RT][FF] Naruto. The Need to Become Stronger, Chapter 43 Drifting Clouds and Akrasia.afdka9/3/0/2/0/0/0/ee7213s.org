Naruto was not wrong from a moral perspective - he certainly had every right to defend himself after Gaara tried to kill him in Jiraiya's apartment, and even before that it was clear that Gaara was a psychopathic lunatic. But Naruto definitely made a mistake in the sense that he never considered the political ramifications of killing the Kazekage's son. And more broadly speaking, he was foolish for even entering into a fight with a psychopathic lunatic in the first place, especially considering he had no real plan for what he was actually going to accomplish there.
