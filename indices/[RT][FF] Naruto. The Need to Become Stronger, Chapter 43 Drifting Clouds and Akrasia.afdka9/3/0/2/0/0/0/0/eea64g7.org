Political ramifications?

Did no one consider the political ramifications of allowing the Kazekage's son to murder children of ninja families in the Leaf village on a lark during what was supposed to be a non-lethal tournament? Did everyone go into that going "Nah, this is totally cool, let's let him kill our kids for no real gain"?

Because it looked to me, whether you wrote it that way or not, like the Hokage (and Leaf Village leadership in general) was totally cool with it... like having Naruto kill Gaara was the *ONLY* politically acceptable solution, as they were both Beast hosts and the descendants of village leaders. If some common kid had done it, there'd be an uproar, and if no one had done it, Leaf would be out quite a few ninja and possible heirs.

Naruto stepped up to the plate because he knew he was the only one /capable/ of stopping him in that scenario, and because (more importantly to him), he thought maybe he could talk Gaara down or knock some sense into him. He was at least trying to be rational. I'm good with that, as I'd much prefer him to be rational that politics-savvy.
