Kankuro's puppet doesn't have to be faster than Akamaru in order to take him down with blades, first off the puppet is probably strong enough to take a hit and keep going so even if Akamaru got some good bites in before the blades came out it wouldn't make a difference. Secondly the puppet is not a human, the blades that cut apart Akamaru wouldn't come from the arm area, where they would have to move a sizable distance before they could help, the blades would come straight out of the chest area, barely having to move at all before they could take Akamaru out.

Your other point about why R!Naruto made such a stupid mistake is pretty interesting. Firstly Naruto hates Sasuke here because during their spar way back in the first few chapters Sasuke was pretty sadistic towards Naruto. That kind of intentional infliction of pain is the sort of thing that colors your opinion of someone forever. The reason why the hate is so deep is because despite it being clear to Naruto that Sasuke is a psychopath, no one else takes his concerns seriously, even when theyre presented with the same evidence. Because of Sasuke's ability and predilection to manipulate people, and due to Naruto's experience in the land of waves where he took Sasuke's stated motives at face value and got burned for it, Naruto is subconsciously assuming everything Sasuke says is a lie intended to manipulate him, if he were doing this consciously he would realize that reverse psychology is a possibility, but this is just a dumb reflex Naruto learned after things going horribly wrong every time he took Sasuke's advice, so right now he's pretty easily manipulated.

The other reason why both R!Naruto and R!Sasuke were okay with the sand technique trading scheme is that while it is very dangerous and probably a bad idea, I don't think it's as bad an idea as you seem to think it is. They clearly prevented the sand siblings from looking at every technique they shared, unless more trades happened off screen the only effect of the trade was that the leaf knew about the chakra string technique, and the sand knew about the poor man's flying thunder God technique. If we look at this fight, I don't think the result would be appreciably different if the sand were turned away. The main reasons the leaf lost this fight was that the sand were prepared, they got knowledge like how to counter Shino and Tenten, not from the technique sharing but from the chunin exams, and shikimaru used all his actions to stop Tenten from doing stupid shit. I mean in this fight most of their opponents werent even a part of the technique sharing session.
