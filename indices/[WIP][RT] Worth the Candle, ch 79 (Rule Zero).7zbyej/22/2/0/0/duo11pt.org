I'm not sure what you mean, exactly, but the DM has access to a suite of tools that make the notion of putting one over on him kind of doomed.

Like, dude stops time. It's a thing he did. Presumably across all the Hells, all the planes, (across earth too?). It didn't seem to take any effort.

He can tamper with June's mind at will. He hides away the memories of his disclaimer conversation, he redoes the whole 'murder fantasy' portion of this thing.

The only way thing you are gonna get out of him is what he consents to. If you 'munchkin' him, and somehow it doesn't go as he likes, he can just rewind time and fix things. He is seemingly both omnipotent and omniscient.
