The number of times I've played a tabletop RPG can be counted on one hand and you'd still have fingers left, as such my insights into rules and laws governing role playing games of that kind are basically baseless, but the title of the chapter, Rule Zero, evokes three particular rules for me:

- “The DM is always right.” As in, rules can be bent and broken by the DM as they deem fit in order to facilitate a good game experience.
- “Have fun.” A game is made to be enjoyed by the players; everything else is malleable.
- “Zeroth Law of Robotics: A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.” To translate this into the Worth the Candle setting, “The generation of worlds and persons as a whole must overall improve the situation of the worlds and persons in question.” In other words, the DM can generate as many people and worlds as they want, as long as the generation of them facilitates an improvement to the ‘real world' at large, or the sum of constructs. That way, even if Aerb was generated ex nihilo with actual people inhabiting it and in the crapsack way it runs, it would still be deemed moral with the addition of Joon and his desire to improve the state of the people of Aerb and the world at large.

If I make the allowance that the creation of worlds by the DM allows a wider toolset than the post-fact interaction (that is, an overarching rule that the internal rules of a setting must be adhered to after initialising the world), then the whole nudging by the DM as admitted by same makes sense; they aren't allowed to throw random stuff around, at least not if it isn't following the internal rules of the setting.

Though of course that might simply be a self-imposed restriction of the DM rather than an overall rule the DM is working under.
