Hot dog executions and/or bombs. Wish for the hotdog to materialize wherever you want. If you wish for it to materialize somewhere matter already exists, probably one of three things happens:

1. The hot dog instantiates first as a point mass and then quickly unfurls, pushing surrounding matter out of the way.

2. A hotdog-shaped void instantiates, instantaneously followed by a hot dog.

3. The hot dog actually instantiates such that it occupies the same space at the same time as the preceding matter.

It would be easy to differentiate these possibilities experimentally using only two wishes: wish for a hotdog to materialize mid-air, fairly far from you. This differentiates Scenario 3 from the others, because if scenario 3 is true, you should find a terrifying explosion (just that an explosion of any kind happened isn't sufficient to differentiate---see the following paragraph) or something similar because you just violated the Pauli exclusion principal and nature doesn't like that (ymmv in a fantasy world). At least you should find something weird. I think nuclear radiation is known to exist here, and you'd get a radioactive hotdog from the strong force binding atoms that got too close.

The second hot dog would be used to differentiate scenarios 1 and 2. You might get an explosion from scenario 1 or a loud pop, or even some slow air displacement, but you'd expect none of that from scenario 2.

Scenario 2 could be used to kill/maim by instantiating the hot dog within someone's brain.

Scenario 1 could be used similarly, or used to propel ballistics, depending on the alacrity of the unfurling process.

Scenario 3 could be used to wipe out a city, if the hot dog were instantiated within something of sufficient density.
