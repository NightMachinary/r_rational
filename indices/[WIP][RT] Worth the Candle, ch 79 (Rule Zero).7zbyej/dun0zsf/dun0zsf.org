Given Aerb's level of technology, I would be interested to know if computers, modern ones, count as mundane for the purpose of pulling out of the backpack. Even if it's just something as good as a decent phone, that's still a huge amount of computing power compared to not having computers at all, so long as it can be leveraged well.

... Probably not possible, actually. What phone comes installed with a compiler? Some laptops maybe, but I kind of doubt that would be considered mundane.

Also, pulling books out of the backpack would be cool. Technical books would be the most useful, but novels would be nice as well.

Oh, deodorant! Who wouldn't love modern deodorant when you're in a society that is only roughly in the industrial revolution?
