So just started binging through a few days ago, finishing yesterday.

I actually had tried to pick up this story once before, and stopped partway through the first chapter. I saw the length and a few common LitRPG tropes, and I was worried that the LitRPG premise would be too generic and suffer from the same problem of turning into a power fantasy with no tension that dragged on. After reading Contratto and really enjoying it (after seeing a recommendation in a thread asking for rational vampires), I decided to give WtC another chance. I wasn't sure that WtC was going to be worth it until I got to the first explanation of "dream-skewered". It was an interesting enough device to keep me going. I think around the introduction of Fenn I realized I was really going to enjoy it. The story hasn't disappointed, the tension felt real, like anyone could actually die. The overarching question of simulation vs. ROB vs. other possibility has proven an interesting driver of both plot and themes. The meta gaming of the narrative hit just the right level of meta without taking away importance of the characters actions.

As to finding out about your alt pen-names (I wasn't sure, although Contratto made me suspect and I recall your other penname admitting to using alts recently, after nearly finishing my binge, I saw the recent thread were you acknowledged your alts), I think it was a good choice if it gave your the motivation or freedom or whatever else you needed to write this. It probably made me slower to give this story a chance, but on the other hand, I went in with fewer expectations.

As to the latest chapter... a risky choice I think, but you made the ROB trope work at close to the best I've seen it. I am expecting we will learn more possibilities when the party pursue the talk to the gods questline.
