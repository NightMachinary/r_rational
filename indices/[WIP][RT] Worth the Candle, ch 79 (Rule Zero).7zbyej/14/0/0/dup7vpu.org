He does nudge small things, why would he not arrange for a book to get into Juniper's hands?

We know that there's no narrative now, things aren't happening because they must happen but instead it's just some nudging here and there by the DM, which means that coincidences must be happening as a direct effect of that nudging.

How likely would it have been that a librarian was reading a book, that he later wanted to give to Juniper, which contained exactly a clue about Arthur?

How likely would the glove rocket on the way back to Barren Jewel have caught some sand to fall just a few short miles from the safety barrier, expecially after Juniper had just finished thinking about how in a similar occasion when he was DM he did exactly the same thing to give the players just enough tension for their out-of-the-box solutions to not make the final boss trivial?

Those all smell of DM involvement to me and I'll probably catch even more as I go on my reread.
