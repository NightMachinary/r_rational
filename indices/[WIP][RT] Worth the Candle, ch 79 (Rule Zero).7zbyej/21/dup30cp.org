Bon, caught up (1 week of binging haha, my girlfriend wasn't happy) and while it's an awesome story I can't really stand the fact that 80%+ is character drama that very often feels like filler, the fights are... unimpressive and very swiftly dealt with, the training is often glossed over and, last but not least, there is barely any munchinkry, something that's usually a staple of D&D fiction. The unicorn fights allowing for instant capping of skills especially stands stark in my mind.

Additionally, Joel doesn't feel like a rational, let alone rationalist, actor at all and more like a typical teenager controlled by his emotions and standing strongly against his hormonal impulses due to the Feminist indoctrination from Tiff and his own White Knight impulse.

Overall a good story, very good, but the further I went into it and the more I felt that the Game element could have been removed and very little would have changed.
