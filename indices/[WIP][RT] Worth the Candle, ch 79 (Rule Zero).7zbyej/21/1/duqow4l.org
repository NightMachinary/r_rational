Am I crazy for feeling like Juniper is far more reasonable and thoughtful than your average teenager?

Personally, the character drama is why I feel this is AW's best story. Two of the chapters I enjoyed most were the 1 on 1's with Juniper and Valencia. Additionally, Fenn is probably my favourite character he's written.
