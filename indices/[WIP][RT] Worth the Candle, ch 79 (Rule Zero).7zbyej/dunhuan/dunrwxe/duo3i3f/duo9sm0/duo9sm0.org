Oops, that was quite an unfortunate phrasing. To clarify:

The DM is a godlike entity with access to seemingly-unrestricted mind manipulation. I would be very surprised if he doesn't have perfect memory and eidetic imagination, which make the entire concept of "notes" moot. Moreover, I'll admit it varies from person to person, but the way people keep personal notes significantly differs from the way they keep work notes intended to be shown to someone else. Personal notes are frequently haphazardly-ordered, full of personal jargon, and extremely compressed; now add the aforementioned mind manipulation to the mix. If the DM is a lonesome ROB, I would expect his "notes and recordings", if they even exist, to be utterly incomprehensible to anyone else.

On the contrary, the way he worded these statements implies /methodology/, that he is following some kind of script and formally cataloguing acquired data, and that someone else getting access to it is even a concern. There's no good reason (i.e., a reason that can't be reduced to "it amused him") for him to do so if he is both nearly-omnipotent and alone.
