I got a vague impression that the DM is answering to/working with someone, from these lines for example:

#+begin_quote
  “This meeting may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance purposes.”

  “You would be monitored, with no privacy. I'd be the one doing the monitoring, no one else would see my notes or have access to my data, unless you wanted them to.”
#+end_quote

Why have recordings and notes if he works alone? That seems way too formal if he is just arbitrarily having fun. "Unless you want others to see your data" implies that there /are/ others, and so on. Of course, it could all just be him being misleading. We don't even know if he is human-like or /sentient/, strictly speaking.

There are good reasons for him being so familiar with Juniper's group, though. He needed to pick Juniper's brain apart to create Aerb, and before that he probably searched for a suitable subject, which, with his abilities, probably involved mind-reading.

I see two constructive^{1} possibilities here:

- It's a simulation, and it's done for research purposes. It's either mad/extremist science, or it's conducted by aliens, or there's /another/ layer underneath the Aerb reality that makes it not-evil (e.g., there's no actual people in the hells, everyone else who suffers either fully consented to that or isn't sentient).

- The DM is a ROB, and its plot is to create more ROBs. This process --- putting someone in a world constructed as reflection of their personality, then giving them an opportunity to ascend --- is, somehow, the only reliable or the most effective way of doing so.

They're both pretty flimsy, especially the second one, but still.
