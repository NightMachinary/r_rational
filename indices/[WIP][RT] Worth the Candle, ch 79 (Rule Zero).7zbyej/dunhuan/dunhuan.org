  “He's real,” said the Dungeon Master. “I know how much he meant to you. I'm not going to say how that's possible, but you can draw your own conclusions, if you decide that I'm not lying. And he's out there, somewhere on Aerb or one of the other planes. He spent most of his life on Aerb, he's not going to be how you remembered him -- you know that, that's not news -- but the Arthur that came to Aerb wasn't just Arthur as you remembered him. He's the real deal, Arthur as he actually existed.” The Dungeon Master had, finally, taken a solemn tone.

I see two possible implications here. One is that, as several commenters have written, the DM is a "Random Omnipotent Being." The other, which I think is more likely from context, is that Earth, like Aerb, is a simulation; Arthur can be transported from Earth to Aerb with no technological difficulty because his 'data' is already on file.

This leaves some interesting possibilities -- what would it be like to be put on Earth with Juniper's game powers? Juniper is very concerned with all the suffering on Aerb -- what about the suffering on Earth?

I'm also not yet convinced that the DM is truly a "Random Omnipotent Being" -- he seems too concerned with Juniper's D+D group to be a random being. What would his motivations be in taking Arthur and Juniper, specifically, into this portal fantasy? I wonder if he's Reimer, for example...
