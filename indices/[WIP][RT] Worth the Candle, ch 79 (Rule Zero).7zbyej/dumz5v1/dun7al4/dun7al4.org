I'm reminded of this quote from Unsong:

#+begin_quote
  The orthodox conception was different. God is ineffable, invisible, unspeakable, unknowable. He is the author of the world, not an entity in it. But sometimes it's useful for an author to have a self-insert character, so to speak. Thus Metatron. Not God. Definitely not God. But slightly less not-God than anything else in Creation. And the things in creation were already rather less not-God than most of them would have expected. So Metatron's not-God-ness was very low indeed, practically a rounding error.

The Dungeon Master might not be the author, exactly, but I feel like he's more of the author than anybody else in that universe. If nothing else, they have many of the same goals.
