It's from the web fiction [[http://unsongbook.com/][Unsong]], a story where, to quote an online poster (Scott Aaronson):

#+begin_quote
  Though not trivial to summarize, Unsong is about a world where the ideas of religion and mysticism---all of them, more or less, although with a special focus on kabbalistic Judaism---turn out to be true. In 1968, the Apollo 8 mission leads not to an orbit of the Moon, as planned, but instead to cracking an invisible crystal sphere that had surrounded the Earth for millennia. Down through the crack rush angels, devils, and other supernatural forces. Life on Earth becomes increasingly strange: on the one hand, many technologies stop working; on the other, people can now gain magical powers by speaking various names of God. A worldwide industry arises to discover new names of God by brute-force search through sequences of syllables. And a powerful agency, the eponymous UNSONG (United Nations Subcommittee on Names of God), is formed to enforce kabbalistic copyright law, hunting down and punishing anyone who speaks divine names without paying licensing fees to the theonomic corporations.

The actual quote came from chapter 71, but if you have some spare time it might be worth reading the entire story.
