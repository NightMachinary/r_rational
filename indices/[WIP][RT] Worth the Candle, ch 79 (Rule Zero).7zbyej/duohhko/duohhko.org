Ahh Joon, opening with the age old question. The not-God DM throws him a bone, echoing Joon's grimdark worldbuilding and post-Arthur anguish. But Joon seems to be missing or ignoring all the hints that the DM is closely related to himself...

And the DM implies a point to the game! Someone once mentioned that this could be some form of intensive therapy for Joon and there's a reasonably strong case for that now. Consent + patient confidentiality? Joon was suffering from anhedonia and anger at an indifferent world after Arthur's death. Now he gets to confront the reality of his own death, fight back against concrete evils and enemies, solve immediate problems on his hierachy of needs, self-improve in a medium where everything aligns to his interests, and to top it off with some conditioning, fulfilling most of these gives a dose of pure pleasure (leveling). I've recently discovered [[https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/7ypb18/japanese_reason_for_being/][the Japanese concept of "ikigai"]] and Joon's situation has significant overlap, with everything aligning.

ED: some leveling math. DM confirms 100 as hard cap. With primary/secondary caps being a respective x3/5, Joon needs 34/20 (base 2). He'll need to be at least level 22 to hard cap any skill.

Essentialism also got me considering munchkin-ing gold magic. Gold magic's pitfall is the call of the gold, but soul magic value editing probably counters that indefinitely.
