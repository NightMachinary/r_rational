This does seem plausible. But why is DM saying "*but* the Arthur that came to Aerb wasn't just Arthur as you remembered him" Juniper would love Arthur being real and not his memory construct, why that "*but*"? If it is as you say, that makes me even more disturbed by the Junipers "Give me Tiff and him Tiff comment" that's such a bad thing to ask.
