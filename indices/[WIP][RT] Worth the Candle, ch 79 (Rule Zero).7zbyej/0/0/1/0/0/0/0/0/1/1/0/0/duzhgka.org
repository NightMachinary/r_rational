It's still 'think'. Your point was that Joon had an unhealthy obsession with, had homoerotic feelings for, and/or deified Arthur. This quote shows he was already aware that he emphasized the best aspects of their friendship: so no, it's not deification or unusual obsession. It's just rosy retrospection.

  So it was said that real Arthur and their relationship is not how Joon remembers him, even before the DM implied it.

What's your point? Joon remembers the old, Earth, "real" Arthur fine, if glorified a bit. At least once or twice, he thought about how Arthur might have changed on Aerb, so the DM didn't say anything surprising.
