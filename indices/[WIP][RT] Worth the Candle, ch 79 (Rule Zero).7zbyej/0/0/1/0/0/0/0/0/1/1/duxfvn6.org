I didn't reply before because I really think you're looking too hard for evidence that's not there. Anyhow, I've been doing a slow re-read and got to an adjudicating quote from c42:

#+begin_quote
  Looking back, I have to wonder how much of Reimer being a dick to me was just him trying to process the grief in his own way, in the same way that I started to lash out at pretty much everyone around me for every little slight, or anything that could possibly be interpreted as disrespect to Arthur. I was his best friend, and he was mine, that was how I saw myself after his death, and I applied as much paint to our relationship as possible, until it was sometimes hard to remember that I'd been anything but a perfect friend.
