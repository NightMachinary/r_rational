Yeah, "i don't want him to be this way or is it just me seeing him like this" - is probably true. " Arthur seemed to be an all-around swell guy and the truest of BFFs" i think maybe DM alluded to something

  He spent most of his life on Aerb, he's not going to be how you remembered him -- you know that, that's not news -- but the Arthur that came to Aerb wasn't just Arthur as you remembered him. He's the real deal, Arthur as he actually existed

, but i think Juniper is heavily obsessed with him non the less.

I actually was hit with a sudden revelation a couple of hours ago. I probably can pinpoint why i feel like Juniper is regressing in character development or what my problem with the "narrative" or story itself was as more chapters came by. It's such an obvious and stupid thing to miss. I was really concentrated on details and not missing context that i never question what did or didn't Juniper and party accomplished or tried to do.

I will wait posting it till the next chapter, cause maybe it will change my mind. But i really think i grasped why i'am so harsh on Juniper and what i feel is lacking in his character and maybe lacking in the story for me. It also a very short realization and not multitude of bullet points or paragraphs.

You are right, me obsessing over details and trying to understand Joon made me unable to see the forest for the trees.
