That's quite the rant. You've mentioned some of these in the past and I still agree your first two points, though I also feel you're obsessing over details or personal interpretations of why Juniper acts the way he does, with an overarching tone of "I don't think/want Juniper to think this way."

Regarding Arthur, I think you're missing some context. It's not deification. "So-and-so is the best" is a very common English phrase. From Joon's descriptions, Arthur seemed to be an all-around swell guy and the truest of BFFs. And when you consider that Arthur is dead and that we often view the dead and past [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosy_retrospection][through rose-colored glasses]], there's nothing unusual in Joon glorifying Arthur's memory.
