  I don't want to bring this up, but time actually heals. I didn't have friends die cause of an accident, but i had friends betray me, it hurts but you move on. The closes i had to that is close family dying, but it was long process cause it was illness related in both cases. You are broken when it happens and i wan't say you stop blaming yourself, but over time it either passes or you break.

To start with, I'm so sorry about your loss, even though it was so long ago. Death sucks, no matter what form it comes in.

I'm going to have to dispute your overall point, however.

A sudden, traumatic death early in your life can be extremely derailing. The younger or less emotionally prepared you are for it, the worse the effects. It's been less than 5 years since Arthur died (I can't remember, but probably actually less than a year or two when the story starts, which would have been short on the grieving time scale regardless).

It's not so much "you get over it or you break." It's more, you live life, but you're broken somewhere inside, sometimes in non-obvious ways, sometimes for years and decades, and it colors your whole life, your emotional world, and your choices.

Source: My childhood best friend was murdered when I was 8. I'm still not over it, and the wrecking ball it took to my psyche. It took well over a decade before I even started making progress on the things that were broken. In the meantime, I got by. I'm a lot better now. But it /really, really/ eff'ed up my early adult life.

Here's how I see it:

If Joon is obsessing over Arthur and getting him back, I'm guessing that it has less to to with Arthur, than with getting back the Joon who existed pre-Arthur's-death. It probably feels like reversing Arthur's death can fix what's broken in Joon and make him happy again. It's the magical thread that can pull the broken part of Joon that is lost out in the void back into his life again, returning all the missing feeling and meaning.

The real problem isn't Arthur being dead, though. The real problem is that Joon can't (or simply hasn't yet) figured out how to successfully exit out of and dispel the trauma he experienced due to Arthur's death.

Not everyone suffers this kind of trauma with a sudden death (thankfully!), but definitely some people do, and it seems pretty obvious that Joon underwent some major emotional and behavioral changes that strongly suggest trauma to me.

Before, Joon felt powerless to do anything about the symptoms he was feeling (which I'm arguing are coming from the trauma Joon incurred in the event as much as the lingering grief of Arthur's death, but that probably feel to Joon like they were flowing directly from the fact of Arthur's death). Because it was so sudden and threw his world so far out of whack all at once, he didn't manage to create a powerful story about what happened and where it leaves him that could have kept him from being traumatized by the situation. Instead, the situation just overwhelmed him, and he broke a few things inside that aren't healing up, because he never did create the powerful personal story about the event that he needed to process the trauma successfully.

Since then, he's just experiencing brokenness that doesn't fix itself and he doesn't know what to do.

Now, he feels like he has a roadmap that will take him out of the trauma. Back on Earth, he had no roadmap at all, just a box of trauma he was living in that was derailing his life. Now he has the possible hope to exit the event successfully, restoring his narrative of self and his sense of power over his own destiny --- by saving Arthur and making the story end right.

This isn't the usual recommended way of dealing with trauma, or of reprocessing an event in a way that allows it to finally heal. Most people don't get to resurrect the dead as a way of finally healing.
