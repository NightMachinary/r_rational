I pretty much agree with you and i found out why it exactly it was bothering me after sleeping on it. I 'm going to elaborate on it in the comments to the next chapter, cause i already wrote a lot about it here and i want to see if someone else resonates with the thing i'm going to bring up.

Of course everyone processes that differently and it still being with you is true. My problem is it was over 500 years fro Arthur, this is not ending in a good way if it's going to be realistic. Also, he is reacting the way he is, because he kinda was obsessed with Arthur to begin with.

As you said the younger or less emotionally prepared you are the worse it is. I was 17 at the time and i was not in a good place for a couple of years.

  Now he has the possible hope to exit the event successfully, restoring his narrative of self and his sense of power over his own destiny --- by saving Arthur and making the story end right.

The trick is even if he finds Arthur that is a very unhealthy solution and in fact i think it will be only worse for Joon in the long run. Cause people die and you can resurrect\save them all you want, but as you said it's not really about Arthur it's a trauma and it doesn't solve itself if you act like an asshole to current people in your life, that care a lot about you.
