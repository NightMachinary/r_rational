Well, mine wasn't a trauma per say. But i dealt with it by having to deal with the same thing again (having to care for somebody who was essentially dying). Discovering that friends are not friends and them not really caring happens. So i realized i can enjoy life or talk with people i like or have similar interests with. I don't need a life time, once only friendship., i can be just nice to people and they be nice back, if not no big deal. There so much amazing stuff to enjoy, i can't be down or wounded all the time.
