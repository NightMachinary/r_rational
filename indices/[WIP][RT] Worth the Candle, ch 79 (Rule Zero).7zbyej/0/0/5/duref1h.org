Late replying, but thanks so much for your response. I absolutely adore Worth the Candle and everytime a new post goes up is a little unearned joy. I got into reading it somewhat late (was scared away by the Portal Fantasy tag) and since have extolled to people how here is a story that justifies that premise, which subverts and plays variations on expectations in the best ways. Worth the Candle wouldn't be what it is if it stopped doing that and went for length, and whether it were to end a week from now or 2 years from now I would still consider it a gem, so I hope I didn't come across as suggesting length matters. I just want it never to end.
