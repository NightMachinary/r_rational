Agreed on the need for pacing, but I actually feel that MoL is better paced than Worm/Pact/Twig/Ward.

For instance, Ward is 4 (nearly 5) arcs in, probably around 200-250k words in if I had to ballpark (i.e. about the length of arc 1 from MoL or half of WtC thus far,? Alternatively about 2 Harry Potter books haha), yet only as of the latest chapter does it feel as though the main plot /may/ be introducing itself. Similarly, Pact's Toronto arc could definitely have been shortened without much adverse impact to the story, whereas Worm's time skip left a /lot/ of critical team-building off-camera (IIRC Weaver had spent something like 50% more time with Golem and co than with the undersiders after that).

Don't get me wrong, I've been reading Wildbow's stuff live since 2012, but brevity is not his strong suit haha.

Each of the authors have their strengths, and I enjoy reading all of their works live!
