Context: just finished binging through yesterday and am commenting for the first time now.

  There's no way that this can possibly have Mother of Learning's longevity unless I slow way down or really pad things out.

In contrast to the top comments request, I think this is actually a good thing for the sake of the overall quality of the story. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the length while binging, but I feel like many web originals have strained under their own weight and even if the content was an even quality throughout, the overall themes of the story were stretched thin (I think Worm built up its themes continuously and evenly, while MoL, although fun, feels a little stretched). This story has avoided turning into a generic power fantasy and has maintained some motifs and themes well throughout, and it feels like it is building up to a definitive conclusion at least.
