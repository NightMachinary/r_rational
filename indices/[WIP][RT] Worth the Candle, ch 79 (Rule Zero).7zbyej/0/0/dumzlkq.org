There's no way that this can possibly have /Mother of Learning/'s longevity unless I slow way down or really pad things out. Some math, because I've been entering data into a spreadsheet for [[https://www.patreon.com/alexanderwales][Patreon]] (and I like metrics):

/Worth the Candle's/ average daily word count is ~1,800 words, with the average for February being 1,912 words per day. /Worth the Candle/ has been running for 223 days. /Mother of Learning/ has been running for 2319 days. If /Worth the Candle/ ran for as long as /Mother of Learning/ has currently run for, it would end with 4.1 million words. Or, in other words, what's written of this story /now/ would only be a tenth of the entire thing.

Which I think I /could/ do, but not without inserting a fair amount of what I would regard as filler.

(Also, fun note, at current speeds for both, /Worth the Candle/ will pass the word count for /Mother of Learning/ in about 120 days.)
