I had been worried that meeting the DM might short-circuit a lot of the implied quests (and better yet, unexpected instances of litRPG fun) that make this so enjoyable inbetween instances of awesome narrative payoff. I could imagine a path where this story turns from time invested in those aspects and focussees more on hitting the needed plot points to bring this to whatever crazy conclusions await us (as HPMoR may have diverged from its own initial premise/promise), and though that wouldn't be bad per se, it would be a waste not to spend more time with such a thoroughly enjoyable and fascinating setting. So I am really excited that this chapter managed to be both as interesting as I quite quickly learned to expect from WtC, and to have left the setting, if anything, more intact than it had been. Dear DM, if you're reading, I'm not saying that this /needs/ to have Mother of Learning's longevity and 4 times MoL's ultimate length, but whatever length you care to write, without bound I'll continue to love reading it.
