I think the rocket thing was subtler than that. The knowledge on how to build a rocket came from the game layer, and it intentionally gave him inaccurate knowledge in a way that would ruin the plan, not enough to kill them but still enough to challenge them.

Mostly because I don't really think the DM has as much fine control over the environment as that, he said it himself he arranged some things in person like the archery contest.
