  Portal Fantasy, Summon Everyman Hero, Trapped in Another World, Probably Isekai as well, athough I'm not into Manga/Anime, which is why I didn't mention it. I have seen the term around though.

weeb here, can confirm isekai = portal fantasy. means "another world"

iirc they don't often have ROB and aren't simulations either. I mean. some (errr most?) have video game layers, but they're at least posited as being real worlds in their own right.
