Huh. Somehow I wasn't expecting a ROB. I think I like it better than the "Computer simulation" theory though. I've never really liked books set in virtual reality. It makes everything seem cheap and pointless, and ruins any real sense of drama or stakes for me.

The fact that everyone is real, and the plot and people won't be altered too heavily by the GM is a good thing.
