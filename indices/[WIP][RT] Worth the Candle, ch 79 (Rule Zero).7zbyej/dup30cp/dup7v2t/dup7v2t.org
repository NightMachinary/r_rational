  the fights are... unimpressive and very swiftly dealt with, the training is often glossed over and, last but not least, there is barely any munchinkry,

Those are basically exact reasons why I like this thing. I find most fights explained in text boring, they /should/ be short. I enjoy plots that move on without a fight or a glossed over one.

Training would get very repetitive if described in detail, and munchkinry is fine in stories that are about gaming the system, I'm okay with the fact that this is not that kind of story.
