This ROB encounter feel underwhelming to me. No philosophical disputes on the problem of evil, questions about life, universe and everything or meaning of consciousness. Killing the god with fists and wandering in infinite emptiness afterward would be a novel plot ending, but that did not happens. Not enough sarcasm or cynicism not even any political ax grinding. I'd prefer this chapter didn't exist.

PS It could be potentially saved by later revelations but I don't have high hopes for that.
