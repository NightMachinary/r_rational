Anyone else feel like the party are gonna be salty as hell with Joon?

June "Hi guys, I met the DM, so I figured I'd punch him a bunch of times."

Amaryllis: "How'd he take that?"

Joon: "Not well. Then I swore at him a bunch, it was super cathartic."

Grak: "You assaulted and insulted the being who created us and everything we've ever known?"

June: "Yeah. I also called him evil and said he was bad at world building."

Null Pointer Exception: "I'm new at this, but that seems super stupid to me."

June: "It's cool. He gave me three wishes and I used them to try and make you guys not be in love with me."

All: "Well, that worked."
