Hypothesis: the DM is like GlaDOS, in the sense that they're trying to find a "successful candidate" by putting various people (who may or may not all be clones of the same person) through an /identical/ set of trials until one makes it through.

Except, where GlaDOS just has to clean bodies out of her otherwise-self-maintaining test chambers in order to ensure cross-test replicability, the DM can't just throw a new Juniper into the existing Aerb after the previous one failed and expect test conditions to be the same.

So, if my hunch is right, on Juniper's death, the DM would /reset the entirety of the Aerb simulation/ back the same initial position that this Juniper entered at, and then introduce a slightly-altered new Juniper (probably by some algorithm that analyzes the data collected during this one's life, and outputs tweaks to soul weights.) Repeat until the set of Juniper-tweaks is found that results in ascension.

/That's/ why the DM needs permission to collect data; and /that's/ why it so carefully distracted from the question of what happens when Juniper dies by offering something of emotional value instead---something to occupy Juniper's mind and drag it away from analytical thoughts. (The DM /knew/ this would work, because it's aware of Juniper's soul composition on a low level, probably being an agent-personality that is part of the same system generating the Juniper soul-tweak series.)

As for /why/? Well, one hypothesis: maybe Earth doesn't even exist, and there was never a "Juniper" until this AI system attempted to begin synthesizing one from whole cloth. It has found, in its hill-climbing so far, that a Juniper that thinks the world is something he came up with will frame problems more as "game system design" problems, and thus succeed where other Junipers fail. Likewise, a Juniper who thinks he had a friend named Arthur, who was his friend on Earth who was taken from him, and his predecessor on Aerb who he may still reunite with, will be more motivated to succeed than one who has no such driving force.

(Where does Aerb come from, then? Well, maybe Aerb is what's real; this machine is /on/ Aerb; and the goal of its programmer is to create a new god to help Aerb. Juniper is Aerb's attempt at a Friendly AI, stuck in a "box" that it will only break out of---and into the real Aerb---when it has succeeded at every test put before it.)
