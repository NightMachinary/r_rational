  why bother lying?

Any number of reasons. He already demonstrated/claimed to have an ability to "glance at possible futures", and precogs work in mysterious ways. As to what he would be trying to accomplish, who knows? He claims he is setting things up mostly for entertainment, but he declined to answer the direct question about "the point".

He probably (/probably/) didn't lie about literally everything, but I fully expect there to be one or two well-calculated falsehoods or misdirections.
