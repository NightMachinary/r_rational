Don't think so. It's a pretty obvious twist, probably even Juniper considered it, and the DM was explicitly described as someone Juniper didn't know. Of course, that only means the DM didn't /want/ Juniper to recognize him, but still.

Additionally, Juniper described DM!Arthur as playing with kid gloves, which this DM definitely doesn't do. Of course, Arthur may have learned, or lied, or Juniper's memories of Arthur's DMing are false, or something else. Still, it's an evidence against.
