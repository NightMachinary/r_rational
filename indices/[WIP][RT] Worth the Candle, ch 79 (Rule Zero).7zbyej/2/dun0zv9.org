Nice. This chapter actually restores some tension that was previously lost for me. Knowing* that there are stakes, that there can be a good ending, that the world is real (or at least its people are real), and that the DM only nudges things slightly sometimes rather than manipulating everything, makes a big difference.

* Well, ok, the DM could be lying about everything. But I think he's probably mostly telling the truth because, well, why bother lying?
