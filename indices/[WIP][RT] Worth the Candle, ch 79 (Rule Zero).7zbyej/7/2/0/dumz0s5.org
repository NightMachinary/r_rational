As mentioned by NotACauldronAgent, it stands for Random Omnipotent Being. It's a plot device used frequently in fanfiction, Quests, and a fair amount of actually published fantasy (A ROB decides to grab a human from earth for some reason to a fantasy world, there are dozens of books with this premise, though I forget the actual trope name.)

Few have the quality of worldbuilding this one does, however. It's sometimes used as a easy writer's tool to allow self inserts or simply someone from Earth, so they don't have to change write their protagonists thoughts/knowledge any differently from how they themselves think, but it's not a bad trope on its own. Like most, its how you use them that matters.
