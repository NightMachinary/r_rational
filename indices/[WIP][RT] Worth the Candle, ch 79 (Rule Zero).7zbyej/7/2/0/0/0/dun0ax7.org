Portal Fantasy, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonEverymanHero][Summon Everyman Hero]], [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld?from=Main.PortalFantasy][Trapped in Another World]], Probably Isekai as well, athough I'm not into Manga/Anime, which is why I didn't mention it. I have seen the term around though.

None of them specifically require ROBs, although they are a method used to explain the transition to a new universe.

Edit: I'm not sure there is a trope specific to ROBs, actually. I suppose like all good wiki's, one could create one, but there are already so many overlapping terms...
