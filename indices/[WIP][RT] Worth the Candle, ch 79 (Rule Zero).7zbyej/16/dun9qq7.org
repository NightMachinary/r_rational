After the end of the last chapter, I am glad that we didn't have to wait too long for this one.

Did Joon get shorted on his wishes?

He asked for a hundred more wishes (hot dogs), which presumably has now been granted cause he can just pull loose hot dogs from his new backpack (gross) whenever he wants.

He wished to know what would happen to his companions if he died (not granted). And then the DM suggested a third use of a wish (backpack), which was the only one really granted.

Am I forgetting anything? Also, I know the DM said the relationship shouldn't be adversarial, but I am concerned that Joon took his suggestion of the backpack. I feel like that is what the DM wanted to happen from the whole exchange anyway. Maybe I'm just too paranoid though (or maybe not paranoid enough?).
