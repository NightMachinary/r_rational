  Conflict of interest or unwilling allies.

I think this would make the story interesting... right now, the companions all have the loyalty meter so there is less tension about their relationships. Some temporary partners or allies, like Solace, would keep things interesting in this regard, but from an in-universe perspective, why should they get less reliable non-companion teammates when they can be assured of the loyalty of their fellow companions.

  In regards to Arthur. It feels like Juniper had\has an unhealthy obsession with the guy.

I had a best friend in elementary school and a best friend in middle school, Juniper's obsession feels pretty plausible/realistic to me. Maybe a little unhealthy, but not unrealistic, and I am sure if he find Arthur the story will address the unhealthy part of it.

  If we didn't have access to his inner thought, i would think he is a self righteous douchebag a lot of the time.

It feels like the author is somewhat intentionally deconstructing the typical behavior of SI protagonists and LitRPG protagonists, so hopefully other characters will continue to call Juniper out and remind the reader of this.
