It's plausible to have a friend. I think it's just real Arthur and Arthur in his memories\head a totally different people. it feel like it's guilt made him feel like Arthur was what he is to people of Aerb almost ad deity, like he can do now wrong. It's the part that starts with "Arthur was the best." in chapter 76 that made me feel like, okay are you in love with Arthur or just heavily obsessed, cause at this point you kinda care more about him when current\previous girlfriend.

  why should they get less reliable non-companion teammates when they can be assured of the loyalty of their fellow companions

Cause in reality they are not omnipotent and should have people that want the same things they want or have mutual goals with someone without killing them in the process. Like with White tower incident, they didn't actually kill the guy, but only because he was more powerful when them. The loyalty narrative aspect was kinda my problem, cause it made me feel like world outside of their party didn't exist and people have no ambitions or goals. Like are they gonna butcher the whole royal family and every single god over time, or maybe "just talk" is an option?

  hopefully other characters will continue to call Juniper out and remind the reader of this

Yeah i'm with you. It just felt like Juniper talks\thinks a lot on how to be better to people, but totally forgets about it as soon as they are out of sight. Like the whole loyalty thing he brings up constantly, when says he learned something new about the person and how to treat them better, only to fall back to trying to grind loyalty with disregard to people. With his "level up" obsession it was explained, by literally being an obsession. This is kinda going in circles or making excuses to himself.

Like he wonders who the guy is that Fenn cares about, but the second he is left alone goes to "Give me Tiff". Fenn might have problems cause she wondered alone for 10 years, boy is she immature - Let me not care for a dying companion and want Arthur above all else the second i have free time. Like he has this great, immersive, relatable, emotional and logical dialog with himself, seemingly to grow as a person when plunges deeper into learning nothing.

I'm just not sure if he is just one of the people that say that they changed, but in reality they don't, he is not supposed to be seen as such and it's just me being mistaken, he is just unstable even tho he thinks he is fine. Like for every issues and analysis he did on others, boy does he have at least twice a much problems.
