Yeah, but what do you define a "problem" as? People who lose very close loved ones deal with extreme grief. That's a problem that has so many angles and no "correct" solution.

I read your posts in the new thread and left a mention. I don't want to belabor the points as I read them as opinion. I do think you have a tendency to couch your viewpoint in very strong terms - like "this is just wrong" rather than "I think X or I feel Y".
