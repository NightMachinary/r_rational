It's not long. Mine was al other the place and pretty long itself. The whole point of it is to provide different views or an opportunity for people to disagree\agree.

Real world was regarded as truth by comments here. It also felt kinda strange how it was implemented at times. That "party separation" and "interpersonal problems" stood out the most.

I don't know the line is:

"I want Tiff. Two of her, one for him, one for me" yeah that's a shitty thing to ask, i don't understand why he thinks Arthur after so many years would care.

"And Fenn?" is asked by DM "I want Fenn too, god damn you, you fucking made her just for me" good job at treating her as a human Juniper. Like the loyalty rising cause he is essentially saying what she and others want to hear was pissing me off.

  I'm sure Joon is actually meant to be an asshole but someone will open his eyes eventually.

That's what i thought i thought this journey was slowly changing him. That Solace's death had unhinged him a bit and shown that "This is real, they are people". But the childish attitudes of "i can't understand the dear therefore it can kinda die, but it's not my fault" and the whole "loyalty" thing kinda got to me.

  I think you have to have lost someone before you can understand what Joon feels

I kinda understand that, but this is a very bad place to be and it seems to me like he went from "Depression" to maniacal obsession and knowing what is best for others. I don't want to bring this up, but time actually heals. I didn't have friends die cause of an accident, but i had friends betray me, it hurts but you move on. The closes i had to that is close family dying, but it was long process cause it was illness related in both cases. You are broken when it happens and i wan't say you stop blaming yourself, but over time it either passes or you break.

It seems Juniper already was over breaking point and see him swing back into it, kinda feels shitty. Cause every bit of inner struggle he has of "I treated Tiff and guys so badly" is worse cause he is doing the same thing to his party and Fenn, only this time it seems he can't throw away the feeling of them not being real so it's an excuse.

This chapter and parts of previous one seem to address the problems i had. But the Arthur flashback in 76 was just really deifying the guy and it kinda felt out of nowhere in it's intensity.
