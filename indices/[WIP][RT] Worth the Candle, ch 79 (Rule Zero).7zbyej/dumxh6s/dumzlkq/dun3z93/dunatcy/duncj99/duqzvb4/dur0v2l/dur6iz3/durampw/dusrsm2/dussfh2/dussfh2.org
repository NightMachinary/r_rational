Thanks. I hope you will also enjoy yours and have people to care about and that care about you.

Related to the actual story and start of this discussion. You brought up good points in our discussion points and in a twist of irony i discovered even more stuff that bothers me about Juniper and doesn't make sense. My small discovery and next "rant" might have just grown. I wanted to check something out and saw something that i missed or misremembered in the summary that you can read before the first chapter.
