Yeah, it's not a particularly healthy solution, but for some reason fantasy fiction tends to lean that direction (resurrecting characters as a solution for dealing with the emotional aftermath of their death).

As for whether finding Arthur would solve anything, it's really hard to say. My understanding of trauma is based heavily on Peter Levine's books, especially Waking the Tiger. I'm coming from the angle that solving trauma is mostly about finding an effective exit for the endless self defeating loop of emergency response (ie fight, flight, freeze, collapse).

Based on Levine's work, it's as much a nervous system problem (physical) as an idea problem (mental). You get overwhelmed by a situation that is beyond your power to cope with, so you get stuck in emergency response mode on some level. Even though you survived the situation itself, you don't have a proper cue that the situation is actually over, so you don't "come down."

If Joon can take proactive action to restore his broken narrative about life (by saving Arthur), he may actually defuse much or all of the lingering trauma (in this narrow sense) simply by feeling like he has taken effective action to resolve the crisis he's still, on some level, physically revved up to fight (in game terms, removing his affliction of powerlessness).

That's a big "if" there, still --- there are no guarantees that saving Arthur will unlock anything.

And, as you've pointed out, this doesn't make him mentally healthy precisely. He'll have to cope with the changes in Arthur from the 40 years or so that Arthur was on Aerb without him (I'm assuming/hoping that the lost king is unconscious all this time --- kind of like the medieval Arthur legends, so not 500 years old).

But all this is the work of grieving and personal growth, in my mind, not so much the work of dispersing trauma. I would argue that Joon hasn't been doing that grief work mostly because the grief and the trauma are bound up together, and it's hard to deal with grief when it's tied up with trauma.

Your mileage may vary, of course. Trauma is still a wild west right now, and lots of people have ideas about what it is, what it means, and how it can (or if it can) be effectively solved. I've had a lot of good luck with Levine and his theories, so I tend to lean on them. A big part of the aforementioned "doing much better now" in my own life.
