This I actually agree with you about. I'm not sure it would make the story better if the cast got bloated, though. I'll defer to the author here. It /feels/ wrong to me but that's just a feeling.

  This was some time ago, but it's relevant in other form even now. Real world segment that are inserted into the story aren't always "true" or come as a sign of things might occur. By not always true i mean, they feel more like Juniper remembering something similar or relevant happening, not like a universal truth of Aerb mechanics and systems.

Did they pretend to be? Almost always they seem to be either narrative justifications (the DM often uses Joon's style) or character development. Mechanics almost never apply. If there is a way to munchkin things that Joon already knows, it never works, or it only partially works.

Regarding 5, I think you have to have lost someone before you can understand what Joon feels. It feels realistic to me, anyway, and I'm sure it's not meant to be healthy in the first place.

Regarding 9, he's regressing because he's desperate for that number. Remember it already fucked them over when Grak was compromised and they had no way to know. Also, the theme of the arc seems to be inter-personal dynamics (addressing your 6), if I'm reading the author right. I'm sure Joon is actually meant to be an asshole but someone will open his eyes eventually. And in fact, Grak addressed most of the stuff you're saying already.

Regarding 10, I'm pretty sure he didn't mean "I want a Tiff that would date me", having Fenn. They had pretty much broken up, so I assume they'd stay friends. He just wants a way for Tiff to not have to choose between Joon and Arthur. Or that was my read anyway. Not sure how it would work in practice, though...? You may have a point there.

I feel like 3 or 4 of your points are about narrative talk/narrative munchkining sucking, which I agree with (and mentioned it last chapter) but this chapter addresses that pretty well. You've said that yourself so /shrug.

Also, yikes, this reply got pretty long. Thank you for the opportunity to argue a little.
