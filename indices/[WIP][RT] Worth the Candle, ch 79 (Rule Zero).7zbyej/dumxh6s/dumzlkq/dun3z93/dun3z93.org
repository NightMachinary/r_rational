Sorry, since i spotted you and this "rant" would be as much directed at you as at other readers, i will post it as a reply. I would highly appreciate if other people agreed\disagreed with me and wrote their responses as to why. You yourself don't even need to respond or confirm anything, i partially don't won't it to affect story in any way. Since it's so rare that you can direct your thought at the author, i hope this at least can be entertaining or useful to you.

I will start with things i liked, them being shorter in descriptions is not them being any less great. I honestly very much like characters and character interaction in this story, world initially was very intriguing and this chapter kinda fixes problems i started to have with it as the "narrative" became a bigger part in the story. Character thought and descriptions are pretty detailed and it's a fun read of Junipers thought and justifications to himself.

Now a list of somewhat personal gripes that i had with the story, but it seems this chapter implies that they can be fixed. Maybe others share this opinions or think they have no ground to stand on. I will start with some that i feel are more visible and maybe relatable to by other readers and will end with more personal gripes. This list might be just me being confused or reading to deep\not deep enough into things.

1.  I brought up D&D as being a limiter in ways some chapters ago. This is in relation to people and companions of Aerb. They fell into vendor, companion, enemy categories to easily and there was no nuance to them. It's kinda fixed by the bonemage interactions, but this is what i meant by nuance

2.  Conflict of interest or unwilling allies. People can form temporary alliances, meet each other later of have conflicting goals without going into murder or becoming a party member down the line. It makes the world less of a D&D and more of a real thing. People can be temporary companions just based on a mutual goal, without getting murdered or "diapered" from the story. They don't even need to have a lasting effect, but it would show that it's actual living beings Juniper is interacting with.

3.  This was some time ago, but it's relevant in other form even now. Real world segment that are inserted into the story aren't always "true" or come as a sign of things might occur. By not always true i mean, they feel more like Juniper remembering something similar or relevant happening, not like a universal truth of Aerb mechanics and systems.

4.  My example of real world segments not really being "narrative truth" is this. Party separation - this was not really a thing as Juniper started, cause pretty separated from Amaryllis when he was dying in the sewers. They were pretty separated from her again when she was captured. Unless "party separation" kicks in as you have more than 1 companion, it's not really a narrative thing to punish you for doing stuff on your own. People actually being people and not just party members, helps the world to feel alive.

5.  In regards to Arthur. It feels like Juniper had\has an unhealthy obsession with the guy. In chapter 76 real world segment it honestly felt like Juniper was actually in love with the guy and in denial about his own sexual orientation, or was in serious obsession that went to not so good places. "Arthur was the best" is repeated in the span of two paragraph and that whole segment felt like Juniper almost deifying the man.

6.  Real world discussion about, there not being enough "interpersonal drama" doesn't really feel like there will be more of it as narrative force. Cause in reality most of the later story was nothing but personal drama. This is more to readers, i don't think we should treat real world segments as a sign of future developments or narrative cause of said developments.

7.  Last couple of chapters and even to an extent with this one i started to think that Juniper is an asshole and still treats his companions as being not real or living. I thought death of Solace would affect him or change that view, but boy was he ready to ditch everything for Arthur or still treat them as numbers for loyalty points. Thankfully Grak kinda called him out on that, but it doesn't feel like he stopped doing that.

8.  Narrative talk and double and triple questioning everyone and everything was starting to be my most disliked thing, cause i was caring less and less and it slowed thing to a crawl for me. Stuff like "i knew, that she knew and she knew that i knew" or "i was going to do this, but what if this was going to do that" is a great show of characters thing before acting, but it started to blur together for me and i think there was more time spent on Juniper pondering over things than actually doing them or talking to people. "Just talk" is a part of the problem for me. He often thinks to himself "i better ask" "but what if" "i'm a bad person for doing this", but he often still does the thing regardless or spends multiple chapters pondering over the same stuff. It's like me going in circles in this "rant" and over explaining things to myself with disregard for others.

9.  Juniper in the last chapters especially after Grak called him out felt like he was regressing with his mental state instead of progressing. Like he says multiple times from the start of the series "i better not treat loyalty as gaming the system" , treat people as real people and still doesn't at the end of the day. He goes into "game better not screw me with achievement, oh it made fun with achievement, oh you game" loop they to much, it kinda feels pointless to me. Him going and showing emotion to DM this chapter was great. At other times it just feel like he (and his real world friends) go onto most nothing first year at college studying psychology tangents ever, only to come of as shallow, pretensions kids that talk about concepts and actually never talk or interact with real people. In recent chapters it felt like Juniper talked at people, not too them and his fuck the deer, give me Arthur, give me Tiff talk didn't help. He goes into "depth" about philosophy, human interaction and "being shut from the world", but boy does he act like an asshole to people lately. If we didn't have access to his inner thought, i would think he is a self righteous douchebag a lot of the time.

10. *Like holly hell that "I want Tiff." was one of the scummiest things Juniper ever said. He ponders over Fenn having someone she likes more than him, but as soon as she is not near him he goes and treats her as an NPC at best.* Also, how many times he said to himself that Arthur is not the same one he knew? How many times it was said that Arhur had a family, multiple lovers and kids? What makes him think or gives him right to create living person that would care about him or Arthur in any way, why would Arhur after God knows many years would care about her. Like i would buy it if it was actual teenagers talking about their crush of few years back, but even when just meet new people dude. This is what i'm talking about with the whole "pretensions, shallow philosophy" Juniper is on the right track to be worse than DM with his Hells, cause this justification is "i wanna, give me" levels at best. You are not going to sop with Tiff or thinking you know better what overs want if you get this. *His obsession with level ups was lower than his obsession with Arthur.* Was Arthur his number 1, cause it feels like it?

11. Narrative and self questioning, was kinda wearing on me. I'm glad that his chapter kinda dresses that.

All in all it feel like a good direction is ahead of us with this chapter and i hope some of the problems i had will be solved, or less relevant. Man was i not digging the last few chapters for some reason. I probably should explain myself better next time or condense my thought, that's why i ask for feedback from others who are reading this.
