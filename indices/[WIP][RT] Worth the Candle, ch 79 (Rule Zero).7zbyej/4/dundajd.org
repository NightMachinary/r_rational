This chapter includes a conversation with the DM that Juniper wouldn't remember. But, as [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/31229865][chapter 73]] demonstrated ("((()))"), Juniper /is/ our narrator, at the end of the day. That implies that this memory would be returned to him at some point between now and the moment he sits down to tell the tale. That may be significant.

(Unless our narrator lied that he is Juniper, of course.)
