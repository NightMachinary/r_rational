This one will probably wrap up at least whatever's about to go down in Salia, and that, together with the fact that every next book is 25 or so chapters longer than the previous one, may mean up to the same amount of chapters as there currently is (likely less; consider that this book and the fourth were originally part of the same one, split roughly in half due to the over bloated Everdark arc, which gives us the low estimate of another 20-30 chapters).
