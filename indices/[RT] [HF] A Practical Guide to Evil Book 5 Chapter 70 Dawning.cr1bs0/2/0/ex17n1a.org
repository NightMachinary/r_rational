I had a thought, back in book 4, that Cat was planning to turn Winter into the Accords. To bind the whole thing together with Oaths, so any who broke them would be instantly destroyed. She can't do that now, but I do feel the Accords need to be something more than just paper. They need an enforcing intelligence, something bound to them and neutral to all external conflict, to act as arbiter and executor of what will become the new Law. We'd call it an AI, but why make it artificial when you have a perfectly good soul to shove in there?

Akua will become the Shade of the Accords, bound to them as surely as she is bound to the Mantle of Woe right now. Her very thoughts will be constrained to follow only the Law, which will be made Law rather than mere law by her intelligence. All her cunning will be twisted to serve a higher purpose, her ego shattered, her individuality crushed, her memories remaining only as a reference and so what little of /her/ remains knows what it has lost.

She'll get what she always wanted: power and immortality. But it will come at the cost of her agency, her dignity, and her /self./ Her existence will become a single, eternal regret, and all creation will be better for it.

It's the longest price Cat can make her pay.
