Back in the early 1990s, I was Whitehawke on IgorMUD ([[http://igormud.org/]]), which is apparently still around and presumably the oldest MUD in existence. I created a major castle and the Loremasters Guild, which is also still in play.

Damn, I wish I still had the password, or the email address. I would love to be able to log in again and see the old stomping grounds.
