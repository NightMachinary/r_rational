I've had this idea bouncing around in my head of a superhero/supervillain whose power is "controlling entropy", but I've more or less hit a brick wall actually trying to define that in a reasonable way.

I'd like for the power to work in an internally consistent, predictable way, but not just devolve into reality-warping; I wouldn't want him to just turn into Dr. Manhattan or Molecule Man, for example.
