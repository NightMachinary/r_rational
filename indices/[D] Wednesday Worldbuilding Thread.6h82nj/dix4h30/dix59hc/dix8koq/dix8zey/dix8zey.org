What would reversing entropy even look like? Enthalpy of formation for chemical compounds reversing? That would also disintegrate people for entirely different reasons.

And what would stopping entropy look like? Time freeze? I don't think these things work.

You could Manton-limit the power to stop him from disintegrating people, but then he could still drop people into pools of toxic/radioactive sludge on command, depending on how fast his power works.
