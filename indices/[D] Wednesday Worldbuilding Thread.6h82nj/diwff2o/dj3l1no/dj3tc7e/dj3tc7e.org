That would be the case, except all of the alien companies want us to be dependent upon them. We are a new customer base that they're out to squeeze as much profit from as possible, and the people in power are willing to let them do that because the technology they offer is so advanced. So the aliens don't want humans to build any of their products, they want to drive all our industries out of business with imports. Even if they needed humans to help adapt their products to us, they'd still do it at minimal cost.
