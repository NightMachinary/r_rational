Well, if the colonists wanted to invade we really couldn't stop them. It took decades to fight off undisciplined pirates with poorly-maintained tech who just wanted to screw around with the primitive locals for recreation in between the real work. The colonists are from a galaxy-spanning imperialist power who never cared about us until we subverted their expectations, so now they think we're worth to time to exploit economically.

These aliens are not altruistic, they knew what the pirates were doing and decided to do nothing about it. I didn't say they were analogous to The Fair Folk for nothing, they are cosmically powerful and do not care about humans except for what we can do for them. The only reason they're allowing our planet to, in effect, join their empire is because the return on their investment for taking it by force would be too low.

The world government knows all of this and probably could tell the aliens to leave without risking much, but there are too many ways humans could benefit from trading with a civilization over a century ahead of ours. Not only that, but this is an opportunity to pay off all the public debt the war accumulated without austerity measures that would conveniently have forced people to rely on the companies made rich by the war.

While many politicians see this as a way to enrich themselves, alien lobbyists have very deep pockets, others see this as a way to finally create the utopia they've always dreamed of without sucking up to the rich humans they always have. Things these aliens see as a passing fancy are miraculous to us, why not take them up on the offer? Even if we get annexed, their standard of living is so much higher than ours it might be worth it.
