  Well, if the colonists wanted to invade we really couldn't stop them.

This puts Earth in pretty much the same place (militarily speaking) vis-a-vis the aliens as Mauritius is relative to America.

  The colonists are from a galaxy-spanning imperialist power who never cared about us until we subverted their expectations, so now they think we're worth to time to exploit economically.
#+end_quote

So, here's the question; how /exactly/ are they "exploiting" us economically?

They can get cheap raw materials by mining more conveniently-located asteroids, so it's not that. Our technology is laughably primitive next to theirs, so it's not that. If they're trying to deny us access to their technology, then they're clearly not looking for skilled engineers.

Honestly, the only thing that we've got here that can't be easily found on Mars and other empty worlds is organics and the results of processes that start with organics (e.g. fossil fuels). Are they really that interested in complex organic molecules?

(I guess it's not impossible. I do remember reading a very good short story once, in which it turned out that corncobs were the raw material for a nastily addictive alien drug; and all the flying saucers seen around Earth were either drug smugglers or police)

  I didn't say they were analogous to The Fair Folk for nothing, they are cosmically powerful and do not care about humans except for what we can do for them
#+end_quote

That's reasonable. I'm just having trouble seeing what the aliens get out of the deal. Allowing our planet to join their empire means a bunch of extra paperwork (and, apparently, going to the trouble to make Earth-compatible tech) - what return are the aliens getting on /that/ investment?

#+begin_quote
  The world government knows all of this and probably could tell the aliens to leave without risking much, but there are too many ways humans could benefit from trading with a civilization over a century ahead of ours.
#+end_quote

Trading, yes. Subjugating ourselves to the point of not having some top-secret lab working on reverse-engineering the tech?

#+begin_quote
  While many politicians see this as a way to enrich themselves, alien lobbyists have very deep pockets, others see this as a way to finally create the utopia they've always dreamed of without sucking up to the rich humans they always have.
#+end_quote

...you know, this bit does make a lot of sense. I can really see the politicians being bribed into accepting this all too easily.
