50 years ago, an alien empire established a new colony at Alpha Centauri that quickly became a major trade route. The colonists decided little would be gained from first contact with Earth so they decided to leave it be, but 30 years ago pirates decided our solar system would be of use to them. Being the morally upstanding people they were, they began abducting and terrorizing humans for recreation. They had no interest in invasion because we had little of value to take.

The governments of Earth soon figured out what was going on and banded together to stop the threat, but decided not to tell the public since there was no strategic advantage to saying UFOs were randomly attacking people. A new military-industrial complex was build with the goal of inventing and building new technologies with the largest R&D grant program in history. No idea was too insane so long as it would help, even social scientists received funding to examine unusual scenarios.

The war was long and victories came slowly, but 5 years ago humanity finally forced the pirates out. Surprised by our resourcefulness, the colonists opened diplomatic relations and the truth was revealed to the word. The colonists turned out to be far more technologically advanced than anything reverse-engineered from the pirates ramshackle ships, which placed the fabulously wealthy corporations firmly against any trade. However, they found themselves astronomically outbid.

The announcement that trade was even being negotiated with the colonists had a detrimental effect on the economy. No one wanted to invent new tech that would soon become obsolete, so millions of engineers and scientists were laid off. Those that stayed were given high-risk projects with minimal funding by morally unscrupulous people desperate to stay relevant. Trade negotiations have stalled over tariffs, which will be needed to pay off the war debt, but the damage will not be undone.

This is a world where geniuses had to take their work home or on the street, espionage and sabotage of businesses has became commonplace, mad science experiments frequently escape or go haywire, robots and mutants are running loose, aliens and AI have civil rights but morally dubious goals, and there's a global army of special forces cyborgs ready to swoop in on any terrorist who advertises themselves. You've seen urban fantasy, now I give you urban science fiction!

My explicit intention with this setting was to create a sci-fi analogue to The Dresden Files. Wizards are STEM majors, human-like creatures are mutants, inhuman creatures are robots, The Fair Folk are aliens, and gods are AIs with cyborg servants. This setting could used for pulp adventure, mystery, or intrigue with an eclectic cast of characters. Criminals have hi-tech gadgets, illegal experiments are escaping, dangerous projects are being stolen, and sinister conspiracies are afoot.
