  No one wanted to invent new tech that would soon become obsolete, so millions of engineers and scientists were laid off.

Engineers and scientists are going to be massively in demand to figure out how to make the new stuff themselves and incorporate it into our world. For example, the super-alien-computer might have a holographic screen and more storage space than Google, but someone is going to have to teach it how to understand Earth's data transfer protocols and interface with the internet (along with the GalacticNet, of course, which it presumably handles by default).

And /somebody/ is going to be doing a lot of frustrated screaming when it comes to trying to get the alien tech to communicate with a user in /English/.

Actually inventing new tech is only a tiny part of the production cycle...
