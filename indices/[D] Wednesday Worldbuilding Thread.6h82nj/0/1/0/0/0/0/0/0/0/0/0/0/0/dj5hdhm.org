I didn't think all that much about out what the colonists get out of this deal. My working assumption was that the one thing Earth has that they want is a species that's demonstrated surprising ingenuity and ability to cooperate. If they can make humans economically dependent upon them, we could make intelligent laborers who work for cheap due to our lower standard of living. They basically want us to become what third-world immigrants are to America, probably leaving the Earth as a banana republic.
