[[/hmmm][]] If they're surprised by our ability to cooperate, then that implies that they don't have it; that they're individualistic and competitive, far more so than us. If they're surprised by our ingenuity, then they're going to be blindsided by it again a few more times, in all probability... it's quite possible that they took thousands of years to get as much technological progress as we did in a mere hundred years, for example, which means they are /not/ going to expect humanity's tech to catch up to theirs as quickly as it will.

As for cheap labour - simple, repetitive tasks will be cheaper given to robots. (The aliens do have industrial robots, right?) And anything else will require the aliens to provide a certain amount of education to their new workers (in a "this is how you build a warp beacon" kind of way) - which will result in said lessons being leaked back on Earth...
