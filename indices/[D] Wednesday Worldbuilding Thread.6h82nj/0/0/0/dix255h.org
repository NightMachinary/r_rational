  Maybe the economy has taken a hit, corporations are releasing some strange products, and everyone is mildly obsessed with the videos from Alpha Centauri, but if you were transported to this world, you wouldn't immediately notice anything out of place, or seem out of place yourself. The really interesting stuff would be just below the surface.

Thanks, that's exactly what I was going for. I was originally inspired by the show Gargoyles, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6g8z4s/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dioeue3][as explained in the second half of this comment]], but think I ended up with something closer to Fringe. I like the idea that this setting has the potential for such a wide range of stories.
