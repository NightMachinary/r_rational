I like it.

A big part of the appeal of urban fantasy is that it empowers extremely relatable characters in extremely familiar settings. If you met Harry Dresden or Sookie Stackhouse in reality, you probably wouldn't notice anything unusual about them- and that also suggests that you yourself and people you know could exist in these worlds without any significant changes.

There's a lot to be said of awe-inspiring settings, larger-than-life character archetypes, and fascinatingly alien cultures- and those can all work to some degree in urban fantasy, but what the genre does best isn't the sort of escapism that transports the reader to another world. It's escapism that works by recontextualizing the reader's own life and experiences as something more fantastic.

So, if you want this setting to be distinct from cyberpunk with aliens or pulpy quasi-retro-futurism, my advice would be to design the setting so that the most radical departures from our reality haven't significantly altered the lives of ordinary humans. Maybe the economy has taken a hit, corporations are releasing some strange products, and everyone is mildly obsessed with the videos from Alpha Centauri, but if you were transported to this world, you wouldn't immediately notice anything out of place, or seem out of place yourself. The really interesting stuff would be just below the surface.

Going that route would put some serious restrictions on the world-building, but it could also give the setting a type of appeal that you don't often see in sci-fi.
