I've been reading a lot of ASOIAF/Game of Thrones fanfiction in the past few weeks. Of them, I'd have to say that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8614734/1/In-Good-Company][In Good Company]] is by far the best. It's mainly a character study that focuses on Stannis and his strained relationships with his family in an AU where he stays in King's Landing as Master of Ships instead of spending all his time at Dragonstone.
