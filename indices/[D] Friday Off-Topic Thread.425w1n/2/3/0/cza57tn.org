My mother is awake, aware of her surroundings, and answering questions coherently. She had very high CO2 levels in her blood when she was found, and very low O2 levels. It's possible her CPAP machine had a kink in the air supply hose when she went to sleep, but I have no reliable confirmation of that data point.

She is still in the ICU, but things are looking significantly better than they were a few days ago.
