Here is [[http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-ideal-marriage-according-to-novels][an interesting article]] about how male vs female authors tend to write about romance and marriage differently. I found it largely convincing, even though it suffers from overgeneralization from a few examples (which I think is almost inevitable given the subject matter). Others [[https://twitter.com/awfulfantasy/status/643466605154955264][have remarked]] on these kinds of patterns in sci-fi and fantasy (as opposed to the sort of literary fiction discussed in the above article).
