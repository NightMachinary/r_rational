  How does that comparison even work?

Her spreadsheet was laid out like this (this entry is completely made-up by me):

| Act                                | Level of pleasure | Duration of pleasure (min) | Food of comparison |
|------------------------------------+-------------------+----------------------------+--------------------|
| Inserting finger into left nostril | 1.5               | e - Ï€                      | Honey Nut Cheerios |

I asked the question after comparing self-pleasure to General Tso's chicken, in intensity of pleasure, duration of pleasure, and effort required. (General Tso's won by a country mile, of course.)
