My previous thoughts on this topic: [[http://i.imgur.com/kZ3Ybrd.png][1]] [[http://i.imgur.com/UoWuYcX.png][2]]

tl;dr:

1. It's unreasonable to expect Person A to trust Person B without a slow build-up of boring questions, punctuated by occasional bursts of impropriety.

2. It's unreasonable to expect each participant to be able to think of enough such questions that the conversation isn't bogged down.
