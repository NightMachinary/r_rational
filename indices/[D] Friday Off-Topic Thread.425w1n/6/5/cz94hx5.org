Referring to them as "Friend 1", "Friend 2", and so on seems a bit dehumanizing/clinical, no?

I any case, I think lists of questions are great under the right circumstances -- I've made ample use of them on long road trips and hiking trips on occasion, and they've provided a springboard for plenty of 10-15 hour long conversations. I think one issue with the ones you're using is that a lot of them are really boring and don't really provide fertile ground for followup discussion. I've probably most enjoyed going through Greg Stock's books (e.g. [[http://smile.amazon.com/The-Book-Questions-Revised-Updated/dp/0761177310?sa-no-redirect=1][1]], [[http://smile.amazon.com/Book-Questions-Love-Sex/dp/089480619X/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8][2]], [[http://smile.amazon.com/Book-Questions-Business-Politics-Ethics/dp/156305034X/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8][3]], which you can pick up used for a few bucks each), as well as the [[http://smile.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=if...+questions&rh=n%3A283155%2Ck%3Aif...+questions]["If..."]] series and books of [[http://smile.amazon.com/Pig-That-Wants-Eaten-Experiments/dp/0452287448/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1453572385&sr=1-1&keywords=pig+eaten+thought+experiments][thought experiments]]. Each question usually provides 5-120 minutes of conversation, with median time being, I dunno, 15ish minutes.

And I'll second recommendations on getting out and doing other things while conversing with people *in person*. It doesn't have to be too active -- a walk will do.
