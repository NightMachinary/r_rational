Wow, that arcanine guy is really rude. That said, I think you're underestimating ordinary friendship. One of the nice things about a good friendship is that the other person knows you well enough that if you decline to participate in a particular activity they'll think nothing of it and invite you to do something else later. Also, while real conversation involves more than just a reciprocal exchange of questions and answers, this works in real life too. I've made friends with strangers by just walking up to them, introducing myself, then just asking a question that interested me about their field of study or how they dyed their hair, then continued that into a conversation. Questions are good ways to meet people, but friendships should eventually evolve to be more than just that. Glad to see you're trying though.
