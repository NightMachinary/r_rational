I'm in a proselytizing mood, so--here's another spiel for my brand of "friendship"!

--------------

[[http://i.imgur.com/VCZSnwZ.png][Description and discussion of the underlying mechanics]] (warning: 933Ã—10959-pixel image)

In a nutshell:

1. Person A asks a question, which is labeled with an ID number.

2. Person B gives for the question an answer with the same ID number.

3. Person A gives for the question an answer with the same ID number.

A participant can ask or answer multiple questions in the same message, as long as each inquiry or response is labeled with the proper ID number. It's recommended to set solid guidelines for frequency of participation--e.g., "Each participant should ask and answer at least one question every three days." The questions can be delivered through any text-based medium: My own first six "friendships" were/are conducted through Facebook messages, but two ancient precursors to this system were conducted through emails, and "Friendship" Seven was conducted through Reddit messages, whose formatting I absolutely /loved/ after dealing with Facebook's plain text for such a long time.

Obviously, this arrangement offers over ordinary friendship (as far as I'm acquainted with that system--which isn't very far) the advantage that upon neither party is imposed the burden of participating in disliked activities at the demand of the other party. What could be a lighter task than asking and answering questions? Who doesn't want an opportunity to say what he thinks, or to extract the thoughts and opinions of a fellow human? And coming up with even many /hundreds/ of questions isn't /too/ difficult--I am /by no means/ an original person, but I've still managed to think of several hundred unique questions over the three years during which I've been conducting these relationships.

A quick overview of "Friendship" Six, my most productive:

- Part 1 (721 questions between 2015-02-20 and 2015-08-24, averaging 3.9 questions per day): [[http://i.imgur.com/whHrWCn.png][Graph of question-asking ratio]], [[http://pastebin.com/5UFFzJst][list of asked questions]]

Here, there was a hiatus because I was both low on creativity for thinking of new questions and disgusted with myself for putting up for so long with so many people for whom I had little personal liking--so [[http://i.imgur.com/GH6Kux6.png][I ended all three of my active "friendships"]]. Soon enough, though, I found the social contact available through my semi-regular participation in [[/r/narutofanfiction][r/narutofanfiction]] and [[/r/rational][r/rational]] to be insufficient, and was forced to come crawling back.

- Part 2 (198 questions between 2015-10-14 and 2016-01-19 [the day on which I typed this comment and uploaded the following three items], averaging 2.0 questions per day): [[http://i.imgur.com/0vaDkWA.png][Graph of question-asking ratio]], [[http://i.imgur.com/iqiHXgh.png][record of activity]], [[http://pastebin.com/t3X32v5r][list of asked questions]]

My plans for the future of my social life are somewhat uncertain ([[http://i.imgur.com/tZ3U3kO.png][1]] [[http://i.imgur.com/aF9QZyw.png][2]] [[http://i.imgur.com/TwikKNt.png][3]]). It's most likely, though, that I'll try to go after a "Friend" Eight a few days or weeks after "Friendship" Six eventually ends.
