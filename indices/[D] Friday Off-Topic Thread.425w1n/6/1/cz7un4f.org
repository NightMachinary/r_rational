Have you ever had RL friendships that don't rely on dialogue?

I have friends who I rarely, if ever, have extended conversation with-- instead we have shared activities we do together that bond us together in a nonverbal way.

Examples: biking, gym, playing music together, cooking food together, etc.

I obviously also have friendships that are based mostly on shared interests/obsessions we can argue and discuss together. Examples: a friend I discuss effective altruism and morality with, a friend I discuss drug use and weird states of consciousness with, a friend I discuss social situations and gossip with, etc.

And then there are the rare friendships that encompass both shared activities and interests, both nonverbal and verbal interaction.

Have you tried developing nonverbal (by which I mean not based on conversation, not entirely quiet) friendships in real life?
