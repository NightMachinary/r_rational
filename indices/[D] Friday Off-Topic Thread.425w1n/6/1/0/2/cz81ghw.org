Try groups sports. Or exercise groups. A reputable Crossfit box/gym in your area, an adult soccre/football/basketball league, runing club in your area, etc.

They're all low-dialogue high physical connection activities.

I should also state that your 'system' of friendship honestly doesn't really resemble most RL friendships I've (and I would think most peoples') experienced.

I don't mean to be rude, but in school or at work, have you ever had normal relations with people?

Is friendship something you desire?

I hope I'm not being presumptuous or committing the typical mind fallacy by assuming you want more friends-- I'm giving you advice only because you posted on this and implicitly are engaging in a dialogue on the value and creation of friendship.
