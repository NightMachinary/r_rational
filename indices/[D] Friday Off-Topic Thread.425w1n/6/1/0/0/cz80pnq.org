If you like dancing, go to some free intro classes if available in your area. A bunch of people on LW used to recommend contradancing in particular with some frequency.

It has purpose beyond fun and friend making: it'll anesthetize you to ugh-fields regarding in-person social interaction. Don't plan on making friends - rather, don't go in with that as an ulterior goal constantly in the background of your working memory - but if you find you enjoy talking to someone there, and feel you can continue to do so at an outside venue, tell them you enjoy your conversations and ask whether they like to do activities that you may do together. In actual conversation, that sentence might look something like, "This is fun. I enjoy our little conversations; want to meet up and get some calories or liquid, so we can talk more than once a week? We can do other things too, but I don't really get out much."
