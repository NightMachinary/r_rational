I'm a big fan of stories as circular, mostly because I like parallels, symmetries, and palindromes in my fiction. I recently read a Dan Harmon post on tumblr ([[http://danharmon.tumblr.com/post/57779240046/could-you-explain-your-story-breaking-process][this one]]) that clears up a few things about how to make a pleasingly circular story.

So think of a central idea, then break it into halves that please you in some way. One half is your overworld/underworld divide, the other is your revelatory divide.

If the central idea is "Stories" then our overworld/underworld split might be "False Stories" and "True Stories", while our revelatory split might be "Reading Stories" and "Telling Stories".

This gives four simple phases:

1. Our hero starts off as a reader of fictional stories. Then something happens and ...
2. Our hero starts reading /true/ stories (histories, biographies, science books, etc.). Then something happens and ...
3. Our hero starts /telling/ true stories. Then something happens and ...
4. Our hero starts telling /fictional/ stories.

These phases don't have to be (and probably shouldn't be) equal in size, and I'm leaving out the important "something" that happens during the transitions, nor the character stuff that propels our character through their thresholds (and obviously structure is just a suggestion to be junked when it starts getting in the way of the actual story). But I think this is a pleasing way to arrange a character-driven story, especially a longer one.

I've been trying to look for pleasing divisions that work well using this method, which means those that have identifiable and interesting halves to them (preferably more than one). Politics is easy, since there are already lots of two-axis models to pick and choose from. Science also seems like an easy one, since there are theoretical/practical divides and soft/hard divides.

One of the interesting things about this particular structure is that the shape of the story /completely/ changes depending on what order you put them in. Once you're slicing up political thought into four quadrants, you have eight different ways that you can circle through them, each with their own "natural story" of character growth.
