I've done intermittent fasting (1 meal/day) for a little over 6 months now, and have done around 4 48-hour fasts during that time period, just for my own personal enjoyment. I also did a couple 72 hour fasts 4+ years ago, when I was still religious.

I don't feel hungry at all when doing intermittent fasting normally, but neither have I felt hungry when doing 72h fasts. I personally really enjoy drinking tea (or hot water, if I'm doing a water-only fast) while fasting, much more than I do when not fasting. I generally feel (all at once) light and happy and serene and foggy and like all of the world's problems can be solved by friendship and self-sacrifice when I have been fasting for 36+ hours, and this sensation is heightened when taking casual walks, and diminished when playing games or being unproductive online. I definitely recommend doing this fast over a weekend (eat your last meal before the fast on a Thursday evening, so you can eat again on Sunday evening). This will allow you to distract yourself with e.g. games if you want to.

Regarding clear-headedness vs. brain fog, my experience is that you feel a sort of pleasant fogginess (the same one I described I described in the paragraph above) that you can recognize as such, but that feels, ah, um, /righteous and correct/ if you're in the right state of mind. This fogginess is somewhat conducive to meditation.

Obviously, your mileage may vary, and this is all just anecdote on my part. 72 h fasts can be rewarding, but if you feel like doing a 48 h fast first, that could be a good intermediate step. Good luck :)
