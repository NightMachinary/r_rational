Can you explain what you do to meditate? I kept reading that it is very good for emotional and mental health while I was in school, but I couldn't stand the idea of taking time out of my day to just sit still. I have more free time now and would like to give it a serious try. Is there a guide or anything you would recommend or advice to start what would become regular meditation?

This is the first time I can remember it being mentioned on this subreddit. Do any other redditors have advice for meditation?
