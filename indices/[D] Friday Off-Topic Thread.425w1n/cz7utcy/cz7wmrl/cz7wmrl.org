  Will we crave food? Will we feel clear-headed or experience brain fog? Etc.

As someone with superbad appetite who as a result does a lot of intermittent fasting... Nobody can tell you that. These kind of things are very different from person to person. Totally depends on your individual reaction to low blood sugar etc. If you dont react badly to 24 hours you should be alright, I suppose. Hope your friend has experience with fasting already?

I'd keep some fructose ready in case things go badly and you really need to get some sugar for your brain right now. EDIT: looked it up, science says glucose is a lot better than fructose for replenishing glucogen storage; only advantage of fructose is that it avoids the insulin spike from too much glucose.
