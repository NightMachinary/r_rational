My friend doesn't have much experience with fasting, so much so that she thought I had an eating disorder the first time I casually mentioned intermittent fasting.

The experience of a 24 hour fast has varied each time for me, though some consistent experiences for me have been that:

a. not eating at all is much easier than small meals or candy during the fast

b. fat can stay off hunger far more effectively than equivalent calories of carbs.

c. meditation help me with the mild hand tremors I get from fasting, and meditating helps me with the unpleasantness of fasting.

Yeah I'll keep some candy on hand for emergencies if need be.
