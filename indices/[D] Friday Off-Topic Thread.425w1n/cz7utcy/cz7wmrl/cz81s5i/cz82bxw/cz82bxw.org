As for your friend, I probably wouldn't go from zero to 72 hours. Some people react really badly to fasting; some of the worse things that can happen:

if I go too long my body first stops thermogenesis (and I become really cold as a result), then get heavy panic attacks/depressive symtoms. Bad headaches/migraine are also common. Good luck with the project!
