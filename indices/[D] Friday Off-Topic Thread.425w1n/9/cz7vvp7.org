How do you organize your bookshelf?

I currently have mine set in descending alphabetical by author, as it seems like the most efficient way to locate specific books. Yet I can't help but think that there's a more optimal way to categorize the whole thing. Now I do realize that thousands of answers are just a Google search away, but I wanted to hear your opinions first. How does a rationalist organize their books?
