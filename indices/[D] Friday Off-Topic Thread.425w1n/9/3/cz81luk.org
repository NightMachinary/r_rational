I don't have enough books (I have, including my college apartment + home, maybe 2 full large bookshelves each bookshelf having 5 rows, each row ~ 15-25 books per row) to need a really grat system.

How many books do you own?

I find having a running GoogleDoc of great quotes, arguments, etc. is great for having stuff I reference over and over again. Also using my Goodreads as a repository for my thoughts on book in the form of reviews helps.

And I use Anki to remember information I really like.
