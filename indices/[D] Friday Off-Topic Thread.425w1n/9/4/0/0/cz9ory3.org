[[http://calibre-ebook.com/][Calibre]] works best for downloading the most fanfictions since the plugin, FanFicFare, takes care of that for you. However for most webserials, I just make my own copy in Microsoft Word through copy-and-pasting. Although, the most popular ones like HPMOR, Ra, or With This Ring will have an offline copy available by the author or by the fans.
