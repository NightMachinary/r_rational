I don't; I just have electronic copies, because physical copies are too expensive for my tastes unless I explicitly want to show the author my appreciation in some way.

I organize my books by using Calibre which helpfully sorts it by title, author, size, or by custom columns for me.

However all of my books are sorted into 'libraries' which are shown below. '->' means what subcategories I further divide a category into.

- Fanfiction -> Fandoms
- Series -> Lengthy (5 books or more), Short (4 books or less)
- Comics -> Manga, Non-manga
- Webserials (SB, SV, QQ, or just copies of online stories)
- Stand-alone Books -> Some popular authors, some are sorted based on protagonist's age (it's different when reading about an adult versus a child), some are more typical genres

I'm probably going to eventually resort the 'Stand-alone Books' category since there are too many books in there.

I have another library where only my absolute favorites are stored and one for only rational fiction. They are different because they can include stories that I already have in other libraries.

TL;DR - I sort based on what tends to be the most memorable characteristics which for me, is where did I first find the book?
