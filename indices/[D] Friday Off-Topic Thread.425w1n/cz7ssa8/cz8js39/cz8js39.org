I've looked over what you've written, and have become fairly confident you are either socially starved and have warped views of socialization due to inexperience, or have a mind that values other intelligent beings in a way that neurophysiologically differs from most humans.

If the first, follow my other advice. If the second, I think you should consider what you desire in human companionship. Is it intellectual validation? Is it just people with whom to share your accomplishments, thoughts, or opinions?

From what you've written, it appears you feel curiosity for other humans, but do not empathize, sympathize, or otherwise care for their well-being; for example, if the sole life goal of someone with whom you had spent quite a bit of time was to revolutionize the field of knitting, and that person were to gain renown by succeeding in a knitting competition, would you feel genuine, visceral joy for their accomplishment?

Even if the answer is no, it doesn't mean the above supposition is correct. It might, however, inform your introspection and recollection of what you value in companionship, and help target your efforts towards more directly and efficiently satisfying that value.

Some hypotheticals and a corresponding suggested course of action for each:

- You want to share and have others recognize things you spend effort in producing: use LW study hall or join a related forum in which to post your progress.

- You would like conversation partners for discussing anime you enjoy: ask people in the LW IRC channel, or the people of the IRC channel dedicated to that anime, whether anyone would wish to join in such a discussion (careful not to interview).

- You enjoy the intellectual stimulation of engaging in interactive discourse with other sentients: take improv classes.
