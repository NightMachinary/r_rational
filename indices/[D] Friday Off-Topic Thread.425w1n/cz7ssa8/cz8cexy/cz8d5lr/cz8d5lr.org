  Would you say your relationships are driven chiefly by the participants' underlying curiosity?

Well, "Friend" Six at least has said as much explicitly, IIRC--I don't know much about the others' motivations. On my side, though... [[http://i.imgur.com/46hD8PI.png][is "wish fulfillment" the right term?]] Even if I'm not as awesome as Yagami Light or Lelouch vi Britannia, this is a nice little pretense that makes me feel a little better. If I can't make people write books for me and give money to me, I can at least get them to give random information to me.

  Do you have a selection process in place to adopt friends who value that exchange of information as opposed to valuing something else, like physical companionship?

In order to use a selection process, I'd have to be well-acquainted with the people being selected beforehand, wouldn't I? No, I just pick acquaintances who've seemed relatively-friendly toward me.
