This is really interesting, and I can't believe I haven't seen it before now.

It's been my experience that because people seek out particular benefits from their connections, rewarding relationships arise when both partners' objectives align. Verifying (either by asking or through a test) that a friend's motivations are in line with your own creates trust- which allows further interactions with less degree of risk. You wouldn't ask someone you just met to help you bury a body, as an example, but instead work out an arrangement with someone doesn't want to see you arrested.

Would you say your relationships are driven chiefly by the participants' underlying curiosity? Do you have a selection process in place to adopt friends who value that exchange of information as opposed to valuing something else, like physical companionship?
