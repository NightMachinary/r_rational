The second one is the only one that isn't almost entirely clinical. The third one is, I suppose, conveying your fascination for the shape of Cuba?

The first one is exactly what I'm talking about. 'a hawt gurl (?!) applying appeasing pressure to her throbbing groin,' 'I'm so horny, but I don't want to <list of steps>,' 'But I need a climax.' It's not intimate; not personal or sensual. It's almost anti-sensual. The details you include are all logical, spatial, and mechanical. Why is this girl talking to herself? Who even talks like this? It's blatant puppetry, and smacks of, well, masturbation.

It could be that you can't yet write good erotica and I was simply estimating this beforehand. But I think that still stems from your clinical affect.

Could I please have the full first question and answer? I'm curious as to the context, what conjures up that image in particular?
