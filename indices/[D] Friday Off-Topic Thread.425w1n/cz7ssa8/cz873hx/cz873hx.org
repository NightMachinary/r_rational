Why don't you ask more "juicy" questions, or ask upfront if someone would be willing to answer them before you commit time and effort into thinking up and answering questions that you don't particularly care about? I'm sure a fair amount of people wouldn't mind answering those types of questions to strangers, as long as they agreed to it upfront.
