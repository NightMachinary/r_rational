  Referring to them as "Friend 1", "Friend 2", and so on seems a bit dehumanizing, no?

Were you expecting me to use their real names here?\\
In any event, I also refer to them by more familiar-sounding nicknames--for example, "Friend" Six is also called [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Isaribi][Isaribi]].
