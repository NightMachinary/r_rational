*tl:dr; Yes, the overworld is whatever literal or metaphorical place the protagonists was in, while the underworld is whatever literal or metaphorical place the protagonists travels through.*

To back up a few steps, in 1949 Joseph Campbell published /Hero With a Thousand Faces/, which was a theory based on comparative mythology which posited that most myths have a common structure to them. Lots of people expounded on this, including TV writer Dan Harmon, who took Campbell's descriptive monomyth and decided that if stories share a common structure across so many cultures, maybe this is just how stories should be shaped to hook into something elemental in the human brain.

The Harmonian monomyth forms a circle. Starting from the 12 o'clock position and going clockwise, a protagonists is in a place of comfort, something is wrong, they get the call to adventure, they go down the road of trials, they have a death and rebirth, they get some kind of boon, they make their way back, and return, having changed.

The top half of the circle is the world of the known, the natural world, the ordinary world, the protagonist's home, etc., what I call the overworld. The bottom half of the circle is the world of the unknown, the unnatural, the special, the place to be journeyed through, etc., what I call the underworld (and often, especially in myth, it's literally an underworld).

So for some examples:

- In /Die Hard/ the overworld is the office party and McClane's wife. He gets the call to adventure when terrorists attack and goes into the underworld, which in this case are the unfinished upper floors of Nakatomi Plaza. He goes through trials and tribulations, shows his wife he really does love her, kills Hans Gruber, then returns to the overworld again, wrapped in a blanket and surrounded by civilization.

- In most sports movies, the overworld is playing for fun and the underworld is serious competition. Usually the call to adventure happens when they need to raise money, or they get challenged, or something like that, and from that point on they're going through these trials and tribulations until they have the metaphorical death and rebirth, after which they win the championship and return to the overworld, sometimes with promise of another adventure in their future.

- In /The Breakfast Club/ the overworld is normal life and the underworld is Saturday detention, where our heroes get broken down and come out the other side, having changed.

So depending on how you align your axes, you can make pretty much anything into the underworld. If a starry-eyed teenager joins a political campaign and quits in disgust after he's been disillusioned by the election process, the campaign office can be his underworld. Or if we're watching someone take hard drugs until they suffer a near-fatal overdose, after which they battle addiction until they can return to a normal life, the underworld can just be drugs (or addiction). We can make the soft sciences into the underworld by following an undergrad who gets seduced by not having to use qualitative data, until eventually he loses his grasp of the truth and comes to his senses at a crucial moment of change, then returns to the hard sciences (the overworld), having changed.
