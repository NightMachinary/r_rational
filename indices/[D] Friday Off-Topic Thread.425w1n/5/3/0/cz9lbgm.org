My meditation practice is anywhere from 10-20 (used to do longer, but I've fallen out of the habit this year) minutes of focusing on the breath.

I put earplugs in, find a nice quiet spot (ranging from the library to a big community garden to my apartment), set a timer on my phone after putting it on Airplane mode, and sit with a straight back. Then I close my eyes and focus on the sensation of my breath going in and out. That's it. I spend a lot of my time being distracted, wandering off into other thoughts, etc. but I always try to bring my awareness back to the breath.

I should note that meditation is hard work and relatively boring to most people when starting out. But it can be quite rewarding in the calmness and self-awareness it brings.
