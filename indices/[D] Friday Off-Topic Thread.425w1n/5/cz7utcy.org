Does anyone here have any regular meditative or ascetic practices?

I meditate somewhat regularly and fast very occasionally (~24 hours each time) and have found the former to be very important to my emotional well-being. Also it has lead to weird and wonderful near-psychedelic experiences.

A friend and I are planning on a longer 72 hour water-only fast together mostly to see what its like to be without food for a while and also to see how it affects us mentally. Will we crave food? Will we feel clear-headed or experience brain fog? Etc.

I recommend trying some secular (or religious, if that's your preference) practices like this. They're interesting experiences, and meditation has some cognitive/emotional benefit.
