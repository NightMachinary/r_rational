Let me make sure I have this straight:

Your priors were that the games that lost were much more popular and should have beaten Undertale completely.

A point of data appeared, Undertale winning the contest, which did not match your belief.

Instead of experimentally verifying this by playing the game yourself, you went looking for evidence to support your prior belief.

You found a sounding chamber that supported your prior hypothesis, most likely consisting of the people who raided the Undertale subreddit after said contest. This group of people confirmed exactly what you already knew to be true, so you continued not playing the game.

You then posted on the rational subreddit that you were not going to test your beliefs but still felt comfortable expressing them.

Is that about right?
