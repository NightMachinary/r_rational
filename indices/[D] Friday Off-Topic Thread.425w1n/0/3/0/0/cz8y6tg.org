Didn't really find any sounding chambers, per se. I did research, and saw plenty of salt, but I wouldn't say it helped me validate my own beliefs overmuch.

I never had an overwhelming urge to play Undertale. I was a bit curious, because I'd heard it was good, but I wasn't going out of my way for it. I don't currently care enough to bother playing Undertale to confirm whether my dislike is justified or not, it's mostly a whim, and I would never use the Gamefaqs competition in a serious debate about the merits of Undertale, outside of stating that the results left me, a long time gamer, feeling quite salty and biased.

And yes, I'm more than happy posting unverified beliefs about a video game on the rational subreddit. Again, I never claimed that Undertale was a bad game. I merely showed how my experience in a recent popularity poll affected my previously neutral stance on said game. Which, I'm fine with. It's just a game, after all.
