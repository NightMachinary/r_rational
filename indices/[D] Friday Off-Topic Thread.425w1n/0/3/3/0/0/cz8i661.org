So, you don't want to play the game because Gamefaqs like it! Ah! I don't really follow Gamefaqs so I didn't know what sort of competition it was. Well, even a broken clock is right twice a day! Reversed stupidity is not intelligence! Gamefaqs happens to be right, this time, in my opinion. Even if you hate them it's possible for them to have a good opinion.
