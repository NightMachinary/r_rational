I had this idea for a fanfiction about SOIAF but I don't have the time nor will to write it. Yet I'm intrested in discussing it so could I post it on this subreddit or it is against the rules.

The idea is based on this video [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMgUIPvAlLI]] tl;dr Westeros is a post-apocalyptic world. Long winter is a nuclear winter and there is race of telepatic aliens trying to destroy westeros.

Reasons I find it intresting: most of fanfcitions lack any good villains. This could provide nice enemies once the character finished munchikin the world.
