I'd like to renew the recommendation for [[http://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/][Undertale]] on Steam. Do not read any reviews or spoilers for the game, unless you're VERY sure the reviewer won't spoiler you. This game is much, much better if you're not spoiled.

Here's what the author put as the description:

  Welcome to UNDERTALE. In this RPG, you control a human who falls underground into the world of monsters. Now you must find your way out... or stay trapped forever.

  ((Healthy Dog's Warning: Game contains imagery that may be harmful to players with photosensitive epilepsy or similar condition.))

  features:

  - Killing is unnecessary: negotiate out of danger using the unique battle system.
  - Time your attacks for extra damage, then dodge enemy attacks in a style reminiscent of top-down shooters.
  - Original art and soundtrack brimming with personality.
  - Soulful, character-rich story with an emphasis on humor.
  - Created mostly by one person.
  - Become friends with all of the bosses!
  - At least 5 dogs.
  - You can date a skeleton.
  - Hmmm... now there are 6 dogs...?
  - Maybe you won't want to date the skeleton.
  - I thought I found a 7th dog, but it was actually just the 3rd dog.
  - If you play this game, can you count the dogs for me...? I'm not good at it.

I consider it game of the year for 2015, and so do the good game reviewers (like that guy on youtube who never breathes). It's one of the best games I have played.

The nature of the game prevents me from giving it a stronger recommendation, because anything more convincing gives away info about the game, making it less fun. Don't look up reviews, don't look up the OST, don't watch a let's play of it or get ANY info about Undertale. Just play the game.

People on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] who liked it, make comments saying you liked it so that people get an idea how awesome it is without learning more details about the game! That should work!

Get it on steam. Worth the money. Worth the time.
