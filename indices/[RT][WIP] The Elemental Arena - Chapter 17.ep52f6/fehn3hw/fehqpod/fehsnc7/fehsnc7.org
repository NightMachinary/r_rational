Yup. Personally I'm a little iffy on Advanced Healing being their equivalent, because it's just a strong skill rather than a whole new dimension to the game with its own strategy, so to speak. Trying to fit in common game subsystems, there are a few that have yet to be introduced.

- Potions/Alchemy - the consumable side to equipment crafting, and what I'd peg for Water's unique skill

- Enchantment - the pseudo-blacksmith angle makes it a candidate for Metal imo

- Private Messages/Minimap - not likely to be a class-based thing since the Maps skill was introduced already.

The only one I can't think of off-hand is Fire's. Possibly some kind of monster taming/summoning system?
