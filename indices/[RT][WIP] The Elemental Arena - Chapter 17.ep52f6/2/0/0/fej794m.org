Both Ava and Angelo are Water Primes, and both show signs that they weren't initially very physically fit; i.e. they got in due to high Mental rating. With the first-in-zone bonus to Prime rating, they also both meet the requirements to learn /Advanced Healing I/. Angelo ran a dry cleaning business, and so very likely knows how to sew, suturing injuries to gain the skill. Ava's background isn't well-known, just yet.

It would make enormous sense for there to be a skill for detection, removal, and setting of traps.
