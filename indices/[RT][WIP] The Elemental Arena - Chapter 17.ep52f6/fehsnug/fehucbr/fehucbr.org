The affinity required to gain this skill is pretty large.

What I'm scratching my head about now is that at least 4 of the 14 players (Nathan, Emma, Harrison, Lilly) started with +1 to their prime affinity. Either the prime-only reward is far more common, or else the players are insanely lucky with epic reward choices.
