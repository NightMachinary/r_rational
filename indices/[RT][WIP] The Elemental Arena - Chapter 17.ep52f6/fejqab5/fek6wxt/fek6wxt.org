I think Tygerion himself probably does have some very compelling reasons to make the arena as it is. It would make the story better to have a much-maligned character have some very understandable motives.

As far as meeting with other humans, the red dot on the map is likely to draw attention - but then, Ava could simply look to see if any others are approaching. That skill of hers is a very mixed blessing. Knowing where others are is important, but you're helpless to do anything if you see them clustering together and winking out of existence.

Communication is important enough for there to be a /Language I/ skill. Maybe advancing this skill can unlock some form of telepathy? Alternately, maybe there's an elemental or general skill unlocked by communicating over a long range. (Smoke signals, use of the scimitar and fire to reflect light, or waving of flags all spring to mind as things to try.)
