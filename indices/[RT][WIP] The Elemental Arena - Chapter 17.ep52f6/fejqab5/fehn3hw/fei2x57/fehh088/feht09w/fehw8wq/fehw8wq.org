I haven't seen any really scientific measure of upgrade time. There seems to be a threshold of around 130 Physical where upgrades no longer knock out the player. They're still largely helpless, but can at least stay aware of the world and call for help.

This implies that what you're predicting will come to pass. Recovery buffs don't seem to help based on what we've seen - but Nathan's faster downtime may well be due in part from /Rapid Recovery I/.
