I love that the author takes these things into consideration, it's what puts this story head and shoulders above the works of most authors I've read.

It kind of signals that it's okay to think deeply about the story and get engaged with it, and I find exploring the process a very enjoyable reading on its own.

I have some high hopes for the out of shape characters, they must have some first class mental stats to be picked and have made it this far despite the severe physical disadvantage. Like if they were the kid who was enthusiastically curious about everything and went on regular Wikipedia binges and actually retained most of the info or something.

Might not be great in direct combat but could become a fantastic force multiplier if they are allowed to grow. So much of a scenario like this is about discovering and making the right choices and learn fast from mistakes at as small a risk as feasible.

Industrialize the monster harvest with all the traps and cages, mwuahaha!
