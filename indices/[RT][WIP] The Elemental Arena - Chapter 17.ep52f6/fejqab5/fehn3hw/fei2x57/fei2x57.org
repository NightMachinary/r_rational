Listed options were:

- Simple Tent: sleeps two (does not count as a building) - 50 NPs.

- Medical Tent: houses two patients - 150 NPs.

- Weapons Vendor: Tier 1 - 200 NPs.

- Armor Vendor: Tier 1 - 200 NPs.

- Gear Vendor: Tier 1 - 200 NPs.

- Food Vendor: Tier 1 - 200 NPs.

- Simple Outhouse - 75 NPs.

- Wooden Fence: 5 meters length (does not count as a building) - 20 NPs.

The players have just spend 150 NPs on a Medical Tent. They recovered 70 NPs due to a system reward for investing into a building the first time. They started with 284 NPs, and so now have 204 NPs remaining, plus 13 for the monster attack, plus a further 6 or so from harvesting and unlocking a new skill.

With 223 NPs remaining, they could just about afford to get a second Medical Tent, plus an Outhouse. This would guarantee them the first settlement in zone 14, and probably net them all a new reward. Waking up Zhang could get them the rest of the way.
