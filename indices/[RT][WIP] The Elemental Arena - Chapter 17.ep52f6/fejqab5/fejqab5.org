Caught up a few days ago. I really enjoy this take on a litRPG.

I wonder if Tygerion the Maker is actually sort of a good guy.

Maybe Tygerion knows about an impending crisis that humanity might not survive without the rewards. Maybe the RPG setting, however violent, is the best way he thought of to design trials that look fair to every species, but actually give a huge advantage to humans who are familiar with the concept. Maybe he thought he needed to kill almost 80000 constestants in order to improve the odds of saving the entire population of Earth.

  "He is one of the most enthusiastic Trial Masters in quite some time." (chapter 3)
#+end_quote

This is weak evidence against my theory. It is most probable that he simply chose the RPG setting because he enjoys it. But he could be both doing what he believes is right and having fun in the process. (Another possible reading of this quote, but this seems too far-fetched: he is relieved to receive a possible solution to a crisis he knew was coming and works very hard on the trials to make this solution a reality.)

In chapter 16, I am a little surprised they don't even consider travelling all together to regroup with the other humans South. I am not saying they should have done this. But they don't even bring it up as an option. Of course there are downsides: the food issue, the two wounded (although Nathan now has the gloves for Emma to use her healing skill so they could travel once both are healed), setting up farther away from the central dungeon... But it would be a two hour trip instead of the four hour round trip Nathan dislikes. It would let them gather more people faster, since the other human groups are even further South. This means more people to contribute NPs to buildings sooner. And if the other players have already started putting up buildings, then it is better to expand on that camp than set up their own distinct camp (in chapter 17 we find out that they are the first to purchase a building, but they didn't know that).

Actually, they never consider that when they send people off to gather more groups, those groups might have similar reservations to travelling: wounded of their own, buildings that they don't want to abandon...

They could try and position themselves on the map to spell HI, or move in a pattern that other players could notice and respond to (for example an alternatively expanding and shrinking circle). They can check Ava's map to see if it is recognizable enough. This is a long shot: other humans need to have the map skill and check their map at the right time. But it would not have a high opportunity cost if they do it while discussing or eating or sleeping (if they can still stay packed enough for security). If they do manage to establish communication, conveying information would be long and tedious (spelling letters would work; chinese caracters would carry information faster but may be too complex to draw this way). Still, long distance communication with people they haven't even met would be invaluable. And who knows, it might unlock a phone skill.
