Very intriguing. Second chapter in a row that we've cliffhangered with a new piece of the game system revealed, lol. I'm going to take a guess and say that equipment fusion is going to be a wood-prime skill. It would fit with wood's element being a jack of all trades to be able to mix and match different pieces of equipment and loot, and with the game's seeming vision of locking what would normally be fundamental parts of the game to a minority of players.

I agree that medical tent was probably their smartest choice possible, especially since with the revelation that active and passive skill effects stack there's reason to think a building-based skill would, as well. Having a form of healing that doesn't cost EPs is extremely helpful to healers, who can then conserve EPs for offensive skills and hopefully prevent injuries to begin with.

After that, gear vendor is probably their best possible option. Lilly made an excellent point that she wouldn't be able to make a shield without craftsman tools, and now that we know the game's system explicitly supports crafting, it will almost certainly return dividends to focus on harvesting monster parts and wood to make their own equipment, which are the tools I imagine a gear vendor would sell. They'll probably get weapon/armor/equipment crafting as a skill out of it, too.

The part specifying that only /simple/ tents and fences don't count as buildings was interesting, since it appears the medical tent is still just a tent and therefore mobile. Obviously making three medical tents just for the settlement bonus probably isn't smart, but it'll give them a head start for any possible pioneer bonuses for making the first settlement.

In that vein, it seems their group is by far in the lead, which our MC calls out. First to activate an obelisk, first to create a building. If the reward for the first settlement is appropriately high (Say, +2 to prime element?) they may be tempted to invest heavily in buildings, even if they can't sustain them, just to make sure they get it.
