Pets are a relatively common feature in MMOs. Since we haven't seen anything sizable enough to use that isn't a monster, that sort of skill would probably involve a captured enemy.

Ava, the player with /Maps I/ skill, is a Water Prime. Due to that skill's interaction with the environment, I'm guessing it's a Wood 2 skill.

The mini-boss from ch.15-16 used an area Fire attack which seemed pretty powerful. I'm guessing that's the Fire 4 Prime skill, and that it's unlocked by using fire offensively. It doesn't line up with the sub-game idea, admittedly.
