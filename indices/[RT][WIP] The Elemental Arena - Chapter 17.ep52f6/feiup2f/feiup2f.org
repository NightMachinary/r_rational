Oh sweet to see them try to harvest parts from the critters!

There are a few exciting possibilities I see right away.

There is of course building mundane rabbitsnares to catch beavers with Nathan's survival skill, but it proves promising that they might be able to SNARE the goblins and systematically steal their weapons and armor.

Having a shallow hidden spike pit might also be helpful for the boss now that they can sharpen wood with their steel knives, so far it seems pretty simple to lure even intelligent-ish enemies into traps due to their extreme aggression.

Still greatly enjoying this work and all the rational aspects of it. Every time I think "why don't they just...? And someone in the story proceeds to bring up that very question I get a warm happy feeling inside.

I see the effort tge author puts into making this a rational story and I appreciate it.

Also, am an accountant and I hate math, it doesn't come very naturally to me and I use excel and calculators for even the simplest calculations. Accountants who don't intuitively use math is plenty feasible.

And goddammit Johanna, you're a Swede, I know we can be sheltered but goddamn stop being such a Karen.
