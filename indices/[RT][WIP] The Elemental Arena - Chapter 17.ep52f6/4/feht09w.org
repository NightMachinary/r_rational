This chapter nails down at least the weakest upgrades as significantly less than five minutes of time spent disabled. Have we gotten any other data points on how long the knockout effects from bigger upgrades last? I recall Nathan just being generally worried about people upgrading shortly before attacks, but nothing super specific.

I'm interested in the possibility of using a Physical upgrade to heal mid-fight, if the fight looks long enough that an otherwise disabled player could be back in the action before it's over.
