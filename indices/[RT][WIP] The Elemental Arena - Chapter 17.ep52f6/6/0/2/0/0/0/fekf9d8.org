Yeah, I'd also be surprised if that were the case.

My assumption for now is, until proven otherwise, that rarity works by default the same way for both drops and rewards.

Maya's been collecting all sorts of data, and may be able to reach conclusions on this based on drops from Horned Beavers and Guthark Tribesmen.

Then again, those orbs are small and easily missed. It's possible some of these have dropped and been left unnoticed.
