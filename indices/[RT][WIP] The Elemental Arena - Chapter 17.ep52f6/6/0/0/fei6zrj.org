Not necessarily. The wording for Nathan's reward was +1 affinity /of their choice/, which is probably what makes it T1 Epic. A predesignated +1 affinity, to one's prime element or otherwise, is likely just a Rare reward though we haven't seen that show up yet.

Also it's worth noting that from the 4 rewards (total of 20) we've seen, we've got:

#+begin_quote
  40% Common

  35% Uncommon

  20% Rare

  05% Epic
#+end_quote

as the distribution. While epic may still be overrepresented here, a 5% chance of it appearing (discounting a possible Rare-tier affinity up) means that it would have appeared an average of 3.5 times over 14 players' rewards. Not too unlikely to have 4 people with it, then.
