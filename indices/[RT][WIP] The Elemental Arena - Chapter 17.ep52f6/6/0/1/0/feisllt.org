Half of the human players apparently died getting through the preliminaries before learning any affinity skills. Some, like Kean, died before even getting an affinity.

Emma is an example of someone who scored a powerful skill due to high stat and affinity - which she then could not use.

I think there probably is a bias toward high affinity, though, at the very least due to those selecting it likely having a better idea of how the game worked and what was expected from them.

Edit to add that of the earlier monsters, Horned Beavers are Water Primes and Guthark Tribesmen are Earth Primes, so a high affinity in either or both of these could well be pretty relevant to survival.
