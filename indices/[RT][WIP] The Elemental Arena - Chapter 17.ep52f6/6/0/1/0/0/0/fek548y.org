The Physical and Mental stats themselves are human-based, with 100 being average. I wonder how this is impacted on other species. For example, a physically huge species could have an average Physical stat of 200, or they could have an average of 100 (i.e. they're physically powerful, but the system only cares about stats relative to average for that species).

The stats shown for Guthark Tribesmen and Horned Beavers lead me to think it's the first situation, which would support your position.

There's basically nothing known to us about the other species at the moment. It could be that the truly smart ones are also antisocial and physically weak enough that a Horned Beaver represents a serious threat.

The two things we do know about them is that they've orbited their planet, and they've all failed past arenas. A few of them could be seriously threatening to humans, but a lot of them could be physically weak, especially with all of their technology removed. /(Edit: the second point here is almost certainly wrong. At least one of the other species must have a win in their long competitive history.)/

Making an elephant orbit the Earth is possible, but enormously difficult compared to a human-sized creature, so there is probably an upper bound on the size of the rival creatures.

(Side note: We've also orbited our world with chimps and dogs. While it'd completely break the tone of the story, I find the notion of teams of these species to be uproariously funny.)
