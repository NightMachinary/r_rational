If you do wind up writing more iambic pentameter, you can make it a little easier on yourself by not forcing your phrase boundaries to match up with the line boundaries. If you look at some real Shakespeare, his commas and periods rarely fall at the end of lines, and he often switches speakers mid-line, even.
