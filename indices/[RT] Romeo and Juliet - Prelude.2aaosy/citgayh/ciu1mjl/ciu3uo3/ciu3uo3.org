Group dynamics are different from two lovers spiraling into each other in an endless dance of sickeningly sweet blah. I think it is still important to maintain a sense of what each character's internal emotional state is, as that leads to better explored character motivations and a more realistic feel for their part in the story.

I avoid gender and gender roles here because your characters shouldn't be cliches for no reason. Have a manly-jock character, but make it clear that is how they are because of who they are, not because that's just the way males are. Statistically, it is a likely personality trait, but it shouldn't be assumed. Better yet, that might not be who that character wants to be, creating even more depth and complexity for a character.

Bottom line is, for groups of teens, you need realistic teen group dynamics. I suggest just writing scenes assuming that, at any one time and no matter how many teens are present, two-thirds of them are vaguely horny for no good reason and therefore unusually confrontational and impatient. Realize, however, that the other one-third of them are still only partially socialized persons who have just recently been (functionally speaking) complete sociopaths for just over a decade, which they're still embarrassed to think about.

For the horny teens: if their love interest is present, they stay next to them and stare at that person like fucking Edward Cullen in maximum creeper mode. If the teen love interest is also horny, make sure they aren't left alone unless you want the obvious to happen. Because it will happen at least a little, unless they are literally the most controlled and rational people to have ever lived. If no love interest is present, they avoid looking at anyone while trying to act cool (but coming off as antsy), because they still notice how attractive all their friends are and they're not sure if feeling that way about a friend (maybe someone other than their love) is okay.

The other teens are, of course, worried they're about to get horny for no good reason, and are therefore irrationally withdrawn and standoffish to everyone else because two-thirds of them are acting a little insane, they want to avoid "drama," and they also fear they are next. If their love interest is present, they will prefer to stay next to them contentedly, possibly wondering why their love is staring at them like a fucking horny creeper.

Roll dice for these roles, when otherwise not plot important. Now write the scene, and any time someone from opposing horniness camps interacts, they both get offended for no reason, regardless of relationship status, gender, or topic of conversation. Instant realism, "drama," and party turmoil.

And all without having to make one of them be the "bitchy one" or the "jock asshole" just to make it seem "realistic". Filter these sorts of emotional reactions through their rational minds, but make sure they don't turn into emotionless robots just because they've read some developmental psychology, a book about utilitarianism, and understand first year cog-sci concepts.

Oh, and if any adults get involved, all teens present get immediately offended and want to be somewhere else.
