So...keeping Juliet at 13, like the original?

Even an extremely intelligent, mature, and rational 13-year-old might be a little weird as a "lover" in a story read in modern times. Which was sort of old Bill's point even during his time, some think. Tough call either way, though it seems like it would be a bit of a cop out to make them both 16 or 18 just because it makes people squck out. I guess making only one of them (Romeo) that age or older might be even worse...

In any case, seeing "rational" and "teenage love" together will involve some serious dramatic acrobatics. Hope they're smart about this, too. I mean, have you seen the statistics on divorce rates for people under 20 in Verona...okay, well, bad example there. She should still look into finishing college first- okay, again, that doesn't factor in. Huh. These period pieces have sharp edges, don't they? Why are they saving these families, and their society in general from a violent end again?

Oh wait! You didn't say /how/ they were ending things, or bringing "peace." Or what their "stressful plans" might be. Or how rational Romeo reacts to the idea that someone his equal as both a human being and in rationality, Juliet, will never be treated as anything better than beloved chattels by her family and society. Someone is being clever, and I hope it's you and not just me. Or maybe that'll be in the sequel -- Romeo and Juliet: God Emperors of Verona.

Fine. Moving on.

If half of it isn't them fighting hormones and the attendant natural, but irrational biases, I'm not sure it'll be anything but teenagers In Name Only. Perhaps they'll be rational (and ahead of their time) enough to simply take that problem "in hand," so to speak, instead of performing crazy and risky antics, both moonlit and not.

Looking forward to seeing it. I'm sure it'll be great, even if it doesn't cater to my /particular/ brand of madness. I note it isn't tagged "DC", so maybe not. I wish you good writing in any case.
