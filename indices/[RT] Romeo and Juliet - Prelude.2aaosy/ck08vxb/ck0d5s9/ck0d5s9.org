I'm terribly sorry for the delay. My life is caught up in a lot of /stuff/ right now. Call it the planning fallacy, or call it akrasia, but this project took low priority. I hate leaving plans off to die, so I'll try and get finished with the first chapter soon though.

I'll offer up an 80% chance there'll be an update before 2 months from now, but with pretty wide error bars there, in both directions. Quantitative self-awareness is hard.
