Two methods that kinda help me out. 1) tell yourself you'll just work on the project /a little/, like making a list of every character that's going to be in the first chapter. It lowers the barrier to starting, and then you just keep on writing without insane effort. 2) turn off your main distracting device for awhile. Days where I leave my handheld smart-device off and upstairs are some of my most productive, unsurprisingly.
