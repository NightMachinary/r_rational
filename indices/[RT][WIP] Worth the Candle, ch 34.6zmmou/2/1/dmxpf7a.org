This is discussed briefly in ch 8:

  “Helldiver” confirmed the existence of the hells, but it led down a philosophical rabbit hole. Was it better to die or to live a life of eternal suffering? I didn't know that I could properly answer that. Amaryllis had said that the highest level of hell wasn't much worse than Comfort, which seemed bearable, even in the long term. I decided against checking the box right that instant. Similarly, the “Dead Man's Switch” would kill me if I was going to suffer a fate worse than death. That seemed on the surface like a similar deal with regards to death and suffering, but it left me asking the question of “Worse by whose definition?” so the checkbox was also left unchecked.

He later checks the "Hell Diver" option when he thinks that he's about to die in ch 10.

You are right that there's a mostly unquestioned (so far) cultural assumption that death is preferable to eternal torture, but this is a conscious choice on my part rather than just being something blithely chosen/stated.
