They write [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/]["The Last Angel"]].

Without spoilers, humanity encounters a hostile alien race just as its leaving Earth and develops an advanced AI starship during the fight. They lose and the story is told millennia later partially from the perspective of that AI. It's very well done and I think it's been posted here a couple of times. The first story is also complete and Proximal Flame is, I believe, working on the sequel.
