  Much like how Atlas Shrugged was largely a build up to a 60-page speech on Objectivism, Worth the Candle has only been setting things up for a descent into dwarf smut. Prepare to become well-acquainted with the phrase "cloacal kiss". :)

OMG seriously? Dwarves in this setting have cloaca? Like birds? I suppose that is the obvious way for the curse to work, but still. Are dwarven cloacas on the front of their bodies or the back? It would suck if the dwarven reproduction curse actually castrated them.
