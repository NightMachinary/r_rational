Well, every new chapter / set of chapters has been posted by you or someone else. You might as well just post them yourself, since they are going to get posted anyway, haha. I don't think anybody will argue that it's spam, it's one of the consistently highest-voted stories on here.

E: I guess the rule says to post your own stuff once a week max. We'll have to keep doing your work for you I guess ;)
