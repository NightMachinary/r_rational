Individuals have enough difficulty being rational by themselves, when they group together those biases are even more likely to take hold just by pure volume. Tribalism is a significant source of bias, but we can't exactly prevent it since grouping up to pursue mutual interests ahead of others is a basic survival mechanism. Some people have more empathy for those outside their tribe than others, but in the end we all have people whose interests we value more than others even if it's just our loved ones. That's not a bad thing, that's just what us humans are programmed to do.

I would still call it good vs good, it's just that each tribe has a different definition of what is good that is predisposed to helping their tribe over others. It's a politician's job to fulfill their constituents desires, but no one can get everything they want so they negotiate to get as much as they can. Of course, not all constituents will be happy with the end result or what had to be done to get there, so politicians have to project an image that doesn't encompass the whole truth. Outright lying is possible, just like it is for any human, but being found out will destroy the trust they've earned.

Trump is an anomaly in the context of political history, and he can't be used as an example of anything until the campaign is over and we can see the consequences of it. All we can examine right now is the lead up to his campaign, look at the ideological shifts within the GOP over the years. In general, politics around the world has seen a resurgence of populism in response to both rapid change and a lack of change in different areas. Both sides think their grievances are being ignored by the political system and are flocking to candidates that defy the status quo due to their frustration with it.
