I am saying that politics in most, even in rational, fiction is not based on the assumption that voters are rational. The politicians can be rational and still have a rational story while still presenting ignorant opinions.

For example there's nothing saying Trump is an irrational actor. Yeah he probably is but we don't know his goals, and he managed to get second place not by representing the side of good, same with Hillary.
