[[http://gershmanlab.webfactional.com/pubs/GershmanHorvitzTenenbaum15.pdf][Here's a paper.]] It's got a section "Computational rationality in mind and brain" that addresses the question we're talking about. I can also find something from Friston's lab about how economic rationality is a special case of active inference, and how model uncertainty interacts with the economic rationality assumptions (specifically, those have /no/ model uncertainty, so that probability and utility always trade off linearly).
