"The natural modality for genuinely sophisticated literary exploration of morality is a conflict of Good vs. Good, played straight. A conflict between high ideals that the story doesn't try to taint, to cast down, to use to showcase the author's superior worldly cynicism----for this does nothing but weaken the conflict."
