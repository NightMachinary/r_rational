  politics is one of the hardest things for a writer to get right, because there's a strong instinct to just write the other side off as stupid or ignorant without actually trying to pass some form of the ideological Turing test.

I would say that the difficulty in writing politics is making both sides look stupid and ignorant which is a lot more in line with the reality of politics in a non-rational populace. What's the need for coherent sensible politics when buzzwords and catchphrases do more work?
