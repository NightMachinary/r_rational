Of course political debates seem that way when you are detached from the environment, but it's impossible to separate analysis of politics from the environment it takes place in. The people in that environment are the ones making demands and politicians have to listen to them. The USA looks like a circus to Europe, while us yanks are marveling at the absurdity of Brexit and the inhumanity of the refugee crisis.

The best book I ever read that helped me understand how people think about politics, and moral values in general, is The Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt. It's a rational examination of irrational behavior on a large scale and the psychological mechanisms that cause it.
