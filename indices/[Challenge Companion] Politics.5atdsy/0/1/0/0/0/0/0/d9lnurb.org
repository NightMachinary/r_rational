I was speaking our as in globally since I am not from the USA I don't identify them as us.

If you're writing a story which contains two party politics in the back or foreground then I think unless you have a population which is rational making them appear good vs good to a reader seems wrong to me. Go read 90% of political discussions from just 100 years ago from example and both sides would be difficult to describe as good, and that's from both a hindsight and a much more in depth look in than the average citizen would get (depends if your story has your character super involved in the depth behind scene or not). Once you're detached from the environment that political machines have built up it's very difficult to see sides as good.

Of course you can do it and it'd certainly be interesting to read a story about 2 rational political parties debating for a rational audience (though I think eventually you'd get very few debates since it'd come down to axiomatic disagreements).
