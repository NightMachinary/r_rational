To me, that sounds like an oversimplification. The US political system certainly has many systemic problems that have become very apparent this election, but to write off the situation as "people are morons" is unproductive. What is productive is to understand why the system is the way it is due to what interests people are incentivized to pursue.

Political campaigns aren't build on catchphrases, those are just marketing slogans designed to attract attention from potential voters so they might reconsider their position and also give current supporters a tribal identification to latch onto. It's easier for people to process, especially when they're distracted from politics by their own busy lives.
