Not exactly /politics/ (rather anti-politics) but I think the idea of anarchy or anarcho-capitalism has potential in rational fiction. I keep waiting for a story where the 'Dark Lord' gets overthrown and isn't just replaced with another ruler, benevolent or not. The moral philosophy behind anarchy or voluntaryism is also quite rationalistic (empirical evidence aside, as there haven't exactly been a lot of functioning anarchistic societies) so I'm surprised I haven't at least seen something similar.
