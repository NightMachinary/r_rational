The original definition of "anarchism" was left-anarchism, and there are good philosophical reasons why. That is, if you're willing to use force to create and defend private property (as in "anarcho"-capitalism), then you're really just [[http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/04/yasha-levine-recovered-economic-history-everyone-but-an-idiot-knows-that-the-lower-classes-must-be-kept-poor-or-they-will-never-be-industrious.html][going against your supposed anarchist principles to endorse primitive accumulation and its products]].

It would be /interesting/ to do this bit of history /differently/ in some fictional world, and perhaps see what the arrangement of factions would be if one side was /actually anarchist/ (perhaps based on Sterner or Kropotkin, or just as Iain Banks fanfic), another side was /actually/ anarcho-capitalist (they decided to encourage economic growth using this newfangled "market" thing they made up), and /another/ side was actually trying to engage in primitive accumulation.
