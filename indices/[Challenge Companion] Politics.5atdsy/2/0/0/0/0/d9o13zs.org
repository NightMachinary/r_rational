I need to read up on the various flavors of anarchy, because it would be a really interesting thing to add to my writing.

My understanding of it has always been "you can't use force of any kind, even to enforce agreements or laws." (Since laws are just agreements writ large, that makes sense.) I've spoken to one or two advocates of the theory, although I suspect they may not have been the most knowledgeable about it, because as soon as I started asking about tragedy of the commons they had no answer.

Could you answer a couple immediate questions for me, and point me to some good resources? ("Read the Wikipedia references; they're a good start" is a fine answer if true.)

In an anarchist society where there is no state or private property, how do you:

- Motivate people to do unpleasant jobs?
- Prevent tragedy of the commons?
- Deny pyromaniacs the right to burn things down?
- Build anything that requires significant capital and/or extends far from people's homes, like a transcontinental railway?
- Defeat the Dunbar number?

EDIT: Note that I'm talking about real-world-style societies made up of real-world-style people, not ones with post-scarcity or "super-rational / super-intelligent people" advantages.
