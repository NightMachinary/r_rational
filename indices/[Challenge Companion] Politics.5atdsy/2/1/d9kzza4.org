Based upon my current worldview and beliefs toward humanity, the only scenario I can imagine a anarchist society functioning is in transhumanist sci-fi. It makes sense in a setting like Eclipse Phase, where infrastructure that carries both resources and information is so efficient and universally accessible that it's easy for people to organize intelligence effectively without government coercion.

Where the interesting political drama comes in for anarchism, at least for me, is the fact that the society admits that every "law" is just an arbitrary decision by the citizens. Even if there is some semblance of law enforcement, criminal trials could be decided by popular vote rather than judges and juries. It's an environment where tribalism can easily take hold, which can make for interesting conflicts.
