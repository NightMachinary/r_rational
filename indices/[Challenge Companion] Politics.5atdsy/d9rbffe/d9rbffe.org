I think there is space to write a compelling story around international politics and The Security Dilemma.

Lots of work has been done on this area in the study of international politics but basically it explains how 2 or more states (led by rational actors) can reduce their overall security (through the increased threat of conflict) by attempting to increase their own security.

For example, the USA is worried about the USSR so it moves some ships a bit closer to Russia and/or builds a missile shield. The USSR sees this as an aggressive move and so responds in kind...boom escalation.

Couple of key things the theory relies on which could become good story elements are:

- All weapons can be used offensively, ie there is no such thing as a 'shield'.
- A lack of perfect communication and understanding of the intentions of other states
- The risk of believing your own propaganda about another state (eg, those 'dirty commies, you cant trust them').
- The fact that if you don't respond to another states actions it can leave you in a position of weakness.

Wish I could write fiction worth a damn, but I think someone else might be able to do something interesting with this central dilemma in politics.
