I'd agree with this. Bean is a genius and no one else figures out what he figures out, and the reader can't follow along. Achilles is "evil" and not sympathetic or understandable besides being evil. I think this is more a supersmart character beating everyone by virtue of the author declaring they are a genius and giving them the answers than anything in-universe. Or any application of rational thought in universe.
