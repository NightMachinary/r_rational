This is a good hook but with the rationalist direction you want to go you are going to need some serious world-building on your vampires. The mechanism of vampires will be a major plot element, especially since your protagonist has been promised to be made into one, so they can't be Stross's parallel evolution without lying to the protagonist, or allready having transform viruses. If you can swallow the plobotonum you might want to look at Ludnum's necroscope series for a weak set of explanations (otherworldly parasite and fungus).
