There's no reason you can't have magic in a rational story. In the words of Agatha Heterodyne, "Any sufficiently analyzed magic is indistinguishable from science." If there vampires that, due to magical processes, have physical changes, that's fine. Just tell us what physical changes happened on a detailed level. I mean, you could go the whole "fungal" route. Maybe blood is an excellent incubator, in fact the /only/ known for the vampire-making fungus - but only when it's at room temperature. So, to make a vampire, you kill someone by depriving a vital organ of oxygen, make sure you didn't actually damage anything irreparably, put them in a freezer, cart them to an ancient ritualized facility with fungal cultures maintained, and bathe them in cold blood seeded with fungal cultures. The fungus reboots all the things that need rebooting, rewires the things that need rewiring, and adjusts the plumbing as necessary, then poof. Vampire.
