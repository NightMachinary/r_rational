Read /Peeps/, by Scot Westerfeld. It's in many ways a similar nonmagical and fairly hard bio-sf take on vampires.

Re origin of the infection: never reveal it. Without an incredibly satisfying explanation, it's better to leave the non plot relevant details alone - at least when there's no plausible way for anyone to know.
