  If other animals can't get vampirism, are other animals affected by the contagion? They eat a rat carrier, does it affect them differently?
#+end_quote

Hm. I hadn't thought about that. It'd probably be something minor, like how /toxoplasmosis gondii/ doesn't affect humans (too) badly.

  What are the human disease vectors?
#+end_quote

Humans get it from inhaling spores (assuming it's a fungus). Usually nothing happens, but in some people there are minor respiratory problems like coughing.

Vampires get it from feeding on humans, and then later on... It depends on how it kills vampires, but almost certainly the spores get out into the air. Right now I'm leaning toward the idea that the contagion has some kind of flammable secretion that it produces, but there are a number of ways that I might take it in the end.

Headcanon, however I go: Right now I think that the contagion started to spread a bit more than a century ago. Vampires naturally don't like bright lights but can still walk around in the daylight, hence the original folklore. Despite being recent history, however, /Nosferatu/'s depiction of vampires dying in sunlight is still accurate because that's when the contagion started up (whether it took awhile to become a pandemic or not). Presumably, F. W. Murnau heard somebody, somewhere, talking about one of the early cases and that's where he got his idea.

Vampires might not even need to actually burn up in the sunlight for this to be true. It might be that the tale was changed in the telling, or that Murnau just liked his idea better.

  I lack science, but can gut flora be found in poop?
#+end_quote

I believe so.

On the other hand, until our protagonist does her research, vampires don't know /why/ they have to eat people. All that they know is that if they don't eat people, they get sick from eating other things.

There may be some really crazy vampires that eat poop just for the hell of it, but I don't think anyone's going to be listening to them (nor, for that matter, am I sure that they'd have the presence of mind to notice a connection to begin with, and that's even if it's possible to eat enough fecal matter to get the necessary amount of gut flora).

  Sidepoint: Im assuming the vamps are smart enough to recognize what compound interest is, and they are all bloody wealthy? If so, what are they doing with all that $$?
#+end_quote

I'm not sure yet. I need to figure out how easy it is for them to navigate society.

What I'm thinking right now is:

(1) A significant number of vampires are actually not very "with it." Vampires are pretty good about reacting to short-term events, strategizing to make sure that nobody finds their hibernation hideaways, and things like that, but their ability to hibernate has also given them a habit of just retreating into leaving, hibernating for a longer-than-normal period, or both, whenever /really/ big problems arise.

It is also possible that there is a cultural stigma against too much long-term planning, because in the past it was really easy

(2) That said, there are vampires who break that mold. They most typically organize into small groups in some fashion in order to pool their respective resources.

(3) The most successful of these communities at present are those which took advantage of the internet and are now situated around the world. Vampires in the northern hemisphere are awake when vampires in the southern hemisphere are asleep, and vice versa, so communities that are spread across the world have fewer periods where nobody was awake and horrible things could happen.

Our protagonist is going to be in contact with at least a few

--------------

It may be possible that one or more vampire groups have already been trying to conduct research on the contagion. Their problem is that yeah, the contagion is bad, but revealing too much to the wrong person might make a much bigger problem.

After millennia of skulking around in the darkness, vampires have a good idea about how conspiracies only need one leak to fall apart.

Our protagonist, of course, is the solution: somebody who has been, to be honest, effectively /brainwashed/ into seeing the world with a vampire's eye. She can be trusted. She is their representative, the one who is going to do the work that they can't do, and operate in the public eye.

(Another problem that vampires have is that they also /look/ inhuman. /Nosferatu/ at least gives the general idea, if it isn't spot on. This is one of the things that makes it hard for them to navigate human society)
