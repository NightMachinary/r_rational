No, you were right. It was Daybreakers, I was just derping. Though Being Human [US version] also has a contagion arc for vampires that you could exploit [it wasn't great, but tv].

If other animals can't get vampirism, are other animals affected by the contagion? They eat a rat carrier, does it affect them differently? What are the human disease vectors?

I lack science, but can gut flora be found in poop?

I really like the hibernation bits. It would work well with mythical god-creatures of the night along the equator [Think Aztecs].

Sidepoint: Im assuming the vamps are smart enough to recognize what compound interest is, and they are all bloody wealthy? If so, what are they doing with all that $$?
