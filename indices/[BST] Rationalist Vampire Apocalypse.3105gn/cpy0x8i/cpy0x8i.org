This seems like a really cool idea if done right. There is a movie with a similar premise called Daylight I would recommend as research.

As the protagonist I would wonder if this vampire community really needed blood. I would try to identify what nutrients were needed, find an alternate/develop a synthetic, to prevent future infection. Anyone who has survived continues to survive and the race is saved [if decimated].

Do other animals get the virus? Can vamps survive off ones who cant? Vegan Vamps?

Also, if I could identify the compulsion, I would see if I could beat the behaviors. If it is seek warmth, I would make spaces heaters necessary.
