Yay, elaboration time! (also, I'm not finding any vampire movies called /Daylight/. Are you talking about /Daybreakers/ or do I need more skills points in Google-Fu?)

To answer your questions first: I do not believe that other animals get vampirism. It would be interesting if it could jump the barrier to, say, other primates, but I'm not sure on that just yet. No doubt the protagonist will try it however, so thanks for bringing up that idea.

Vampires can feed off of animals, but must also feed off of humans. They're not sure why until our protagonist Does Science to the problem, but this problem will in fact be solved.

(And then our protagonist might decide to "gift" the rest of the world with vampirism, having eliminated the need for humans at all. It will likely be debatable whether this is good or not)

*Why do vampires need to feed on humans?*

Vampires need your gut flora, actually. They may be lacking in just certain varieties or they may be missing pretty much everything, but they can't complete digestion without stealing your gut flora to do part of the necessary work.

Which is kind of rude because, come on, you're basically being forced to digest yourself, and that's just adding insult to injury, isn't it?

Once our protagonist figures this out, she's definitely going to work on creating cultures of these gut flora or, failing that, setting up a system of donors until she can figure out how to do the first thing.

*How do vampires feed?*

Vampires do not drink your blood. Or rather, they don't just drink your blood, and when they get around to drinking it, your blood isn't really recognizable as such.

To start with, vampire saliva is heavy in opiorphin, which is an antidepressant and anesthetic six times more powerful than morphine. Human saliva also has this, vampirism just goes crazy with how much it has. And this is important, because ideally a vampire's prey will be emotionally deadened and numbed to pain when the feeding begins.

Vampire saliva also contains insane amounts of amylase, lysozyme, and other digestive enzymes. Fun fact: Snake venom is just a modified form of saliva, and what the simplest forms of snake venom do is just digest you from the inside.

Oh, and after it's bitten you, the vampire proceeds to regurgitate additional enzymes from its stomach.

Vampires don't drink your blood. They liquefy your innards and then drink you up. The process just causes keritanocytes to toughen up, though, which is helpful for the vampires because that's what your epidermis is made out of, turning you into a bit of a juice bag.

(Side effect of this: Vampires don't kiss each other, because swapping toxic spit is a bad idea unless you /want/ your partner to die. Since the epidermis isn't digested, however, it's possible that they lick each other for social grooming and other purposes, for its antidepressant properties)

I'm still working on the details but it's probable that the gut flora are allowed to do their work in the juice bag, prior to when the vampire drinks most of its meal, and that they are killed when the vampire finishes the process and the gut flora enter the body. Alternately, they die during the long hibernation periods that vampires go into. Among other possibilities.

I'm using the calorie counts from James Cole's "Prehistoric Cannibalism: An Act of Nutritional Necessity or a Result of Socio-Cultural Conditions" to figure out a person's a calorie count, and then being very conservative and underestimating how many calories a given person will have.

Vampires are also able to eat thin soups and drinks for a short time after feeding without suffering indigestion (or at least too badly-- I'm not set on which one it is yet) but they haven't seen this as a means of getting additional sustenance. Vampires eat soups for pleasure, not nutrition.

*Hibernation*

I'm also being conservative with how much energy vampires are able to save through hibernation (they go much deeper than bears, but I'm using bears anyway to once again play my numbers safe). A vampire that needed roughly 4,000 calories a night (again, playing numbers safe and overestimating them) would still only need to feed on a handful of people every year so long as it was only active for three months or so out of the year.

Vampires adjust their hibernation cycles automatically based on the seasons. Closer to the poles, where the nights get longer, sooner, vampires are awake for a greater part of the year. Closer to the equator, vampires are asleep for a greater part of the year. This also has an effect on their longevity (because the aging process is slowed down by hibernation) so that vampires who are awake for longer periods also have a shorter lifespan. It's a trade-off on par with bad vs good eating habits.

Right now, I'm figuring that the way it works out is that vampire's naturally start getting the desire to go to sleep when the night is coming to a close. Once the waking period gets short enough the urge to hibernate asserts itself. Not sure about how the wakefulness itself gets triggered yet.
