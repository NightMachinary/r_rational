It doesn't sound like these Vamps are up on science enough to selectively breed for anything. Or at least not until the protagonist comes along.

How would the Vamps keep their "animals?" Drugs from the saliva to keep them as addicts would keep them pacified, but otherwise...? The vamps also need to be able to get/grow human food supplies now. Also, these Vamps would become farmer Vamps. I would like to see a vampire in overalls and a sunhat please :D
