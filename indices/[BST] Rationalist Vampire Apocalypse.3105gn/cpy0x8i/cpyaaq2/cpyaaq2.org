Space heaters are definitely a great idea. They will have to be used.

An additional complication is that the contagion causes insomnia and makes hibernation difficult. This is why vampires who know they've got the contagion will still eventually get killed by it. After a point, they just aren't thinking right.

If our protagonist is present, however, then she could restrain said vampire and make arrangements for its feeding. The vampire would be safe from death, but would take an even longer trip on the Crazy Train as a consequence.

The trade-off is worth it, but will also be very sad to the degree that our protagonist has empathy for the vampire.
