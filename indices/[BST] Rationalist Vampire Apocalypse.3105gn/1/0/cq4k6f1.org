First of all, thank you for the warning in re pattern-matching.

I actually do think that our protagonist is going to be trying to integrate with the non-vampire world as she does her work. If going to the CDC turns out to be the best option, then that's what she'll do. Her most important job is not necessarily to run the experiments herself but to be, you might say, the liaison between vampires and humans, so that the latter need never find out that the former are a thing.

The vampires who are aware of our protagonist's mission (and approve of it) don't want to force the CDC or someone else to just deal with the contagion, because in the process the CDC might figure out vampires, which could be very bad.

Even worse, it's likely that an actual knowledge of vampires and their physiology might be /necessary/ to get the job done, much as you'd have a hell of a time doing much with ebola if you had never heard of /H. sapiens/.

With that in mind, they need somebody on the inside, somebody who can observe what's going on as it happens and determine if the situation is reaching a point where the plug needs to be pulled (hopefully without killing everyone, but only because murder is messy).

That she's being trained in the sciences is /almost/ incidental, a filling of requirements so that she can be on the inside at all, and know what needs to be done and who can do it.

  EDIT: Also, if vampires are immortal, they have the capacity to be better scholars than any human alive. Why would they not be? Be wary of pattern matching with your personal vision of and associations with vampires.

The first thing that comes to mind is that not all humans are inclined to be scholars, and it's likely that not all vampires are. I imagine that our protagonist will be conferring with at least a couple of vampires all the same, however.
