I just meant that the daily operation of a research firm likely doesn't make for riveting reading, particularly among readers who came for vampires. If you make that your answer, you'd have to find some way to portray it realistically without spending a ton of time there or it seemingly like hand-waving (i.e. months of operation to even potentially culture the pathogen or be able to grow it. This kind of thing is complicated (I'm no expert, but I know the basics from a class) and takes a lot of time. And that's before even thinking about vaccines/cures. You're going to need to brush up on your pathology and biology if you want to do a good job at this.

Returning to the point, you could have setting up the research firm be quite interesting, what with recruitment and secret management, but after that any action that happens is secondary to the boring stuff that's actually resolving the problem (research). So you can have splinter vampire groups kidnap a star researcher, or the FBI start to take note, but without extreme variation like in Breaking Bad, it'll start to seem formulaic.

What's more, one research firm is good, but a bunch, with shell corporations and everything, set up across the world, is much better. And writing about the person managing that empire is probably similarly uninteresting. (And rationally, why WOULDN'T you be umbrella corp and have dozens of secret labs, security forces, self-destruct mechanisms, etc? Any vampire who's been around a century is rich off the stock market and the master of some craft or skill)

The vampire scholar thing is still an issue. I suppose it's POSSIBLE that none of them are interested in their own physiology, medicine, pathology, epidemiology, bioterrorism, or anything connected to both their own origins and biological sciences, but it seems exceedingly unlikely, unless your population of vampires is very small, perhaps 50-100.

Seriously, none of your vampires are curious about how they work or why they need to feed on humans? None of them have figured out even the gut flora thing? Or even that they don't need to eat an entire human, just their stomach and some random protein mass (speaking of, how do they deal with human stomach acid, feces, undesirable fluids if they drink everything in a slurry)?

It just seems ridiculous that your protagonist would be starting from scratch here, or even exist at all. It requires that instead of using their lifetimes of knowledge and vast wealth to hire researchers or do it their goddamned selves, the vampires went through the trouble of bringing up a single human (no fallbacks), meaning waiting 22+ YEARS, to address an /existential threat./

I think you have a very interesting idea for a story and compelling protagonist, written correctly, but the setup seems to require an extraordinary series of failures of rationality and common sense.
