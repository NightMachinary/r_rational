Thank you. >:]

I'm actually kind of confused by how people can refuse to take criticism that is clearly based in reality.

Like, it's a thing that happens, obviously, but it doesn't make /sense/. Run away and hide and just not respond to biting criticism? Sure, I get tempted to do that sometimes, if I had been an incredibly magnificent idiot.

But flat out denying valid criticism is just... weird. It feels weird just thinking about it, like saying that the sky is polka-dotted when you and I are both standing outside and we both know that none of us has any color-related vision problems and what "polka-dotted" means.
