  I just meant that the daily operation of a research firm likely doesn't make for riveting reading, particularly among readers who came for vampires. If you make that your answer, you'd have to find some way to portray it realistically without spending a ton of time there or it seemingly like hand-waving (i.e. months of operation to even potentially culture the pathogen or be able to grow it. This kind of thing is complicated (I'm no expert, but I know the basics from a class) and takes a lot of time. And that's before even thinking about vaccines/cures. You're going to need to brush up on your pathology and biology if you want to do a good job at this.

Yes. The plot may take a mind of its own and decide to include a great many other things, but I have no illusions about the mass appeal of this story. There's a series of stories by James P. Hogan that is basically a bunch of talking heads doing Science and coming up with ideas and ways to test those ideas and it is probably the most boring thing in the world to most people but... I really, really like them (even though, admittedly, the science is kind of awful in places).

And while there would probably be a certain amount of Traditionally Exciting Things happening, there would probably be a lot more of what many people would consider boring.

(On the other hand, "boring" is not the same as "has stupid characters in it," so there are still some points you bring up with are utterly unforgivable and must be dealt with. Even if I have to give up some other aspects of the story.)

  The vampire scholar thing is still an issue. I suppose it's POSSIBLE that none of them are interested in their own physiology, medicine, pathology, epidemiology, bioterrorism, or anything connected to both their own origins and biological sciences, but it seems exceedingly unlikely, unless your population of vampires is very small, perhaps 50-100.

At the figures that I've worked out, the United States could support around a hundred vampires, but the population is probably not that high.

  I think you have a very interesting idea for a story and compelling protagonist, written correctly, but the setup seems to require an extraordinary series of failures of rationality and common sense.

Yes. And thank you for spending some time on it anyway. >:]

There were some things that I thought that I could leave up in the air temporarily until I figured out other parts of my setting, but it's apparent that I /really/ need to figure out all the details of vampirism first, including how it affects the mind (at present it seems that they prefer small social circles than humans, so that'll flavor how they would go about with their long-term plans), and also exactly how long ago the contagion hit, how quickly it spread, and what vampires have been doing in the meantime.

Thanks again.
