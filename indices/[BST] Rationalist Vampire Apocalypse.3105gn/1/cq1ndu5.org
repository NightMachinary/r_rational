You'll need to make the problem hard to solve, and you'll also need some way that the most rational way to solve the problem ISN'T to found a research firm secretly devoted to this purpose.

Research, especially on vaccines/medications/epidemiology, is not a short or easy affair. It is basically never a one-person affair. Really this type of problem would be best handled by body like the CDC, not an antisocial lone wolf type.

EDIT: Also, if vampires are immortal, they have the capacity to be better scholars than any human alive. Why would they not be? Be wary of pattern matching with your personal vision of and associations with vampires.

Sure, they wouldn't want to do the lab work personally because it would endanger them, but that's what grad students and hirelings are for. The heaviest lifting is intellectual.
