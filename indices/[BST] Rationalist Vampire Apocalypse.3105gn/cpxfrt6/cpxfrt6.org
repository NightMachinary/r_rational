One question jumped out at me for meeting that. what exactly do you mean by magic? this just seems like the best channel you for the disease to have its effect. I'd stick to the usual mechanics (can't cross running water, kill by staking and beheading, can climb walls, turn into wolves and bats, become fundamentally different people after being turned, are addicted to blood and require it to live ect... ) so your audience already knows whats going on.

If you haven't done so yet, you should look at the vampire list (same idea as the overlord list) over on tvtropes
