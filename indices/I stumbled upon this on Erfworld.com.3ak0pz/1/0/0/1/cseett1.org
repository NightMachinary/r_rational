  Instead the world seems to have a will of its own and often nudges things along. This is however a theme that is explored numerous times, a major plot point in itself and something both the main character and others grapple with nd struggle to understand.

This is actually an interesting exception to the rule. When the world /is/ a character, who is plotting, then things happening "because of the plot" it has a different meaning.
