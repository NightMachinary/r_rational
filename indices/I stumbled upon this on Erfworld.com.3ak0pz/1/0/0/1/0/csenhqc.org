Like Homestuck! Any timeline that doesn't match the plan that The Game has set out is labelled a "doomed timeline" and everybody in it is slated for death at the earliest opportunity. Only the one path that follows the plan gets to survive

I only say this because I dreadfully want to have a discussion about Homestuck with the rationalist people, and it keeps not happening.

Edit: hey, look at that off-topic thread, anybody want to go talk about HS over there with me?
