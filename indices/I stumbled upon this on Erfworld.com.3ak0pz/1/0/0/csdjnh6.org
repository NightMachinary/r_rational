Seeing how you replied to my comment as opposed to the top post I assume you're talking about the comic in general? In that case I already mentioned that it isn't completely rational.

But to elaborate, it is about a pretty smart guy being shunted into a deconstructionis world based on tabletop strategy games in which everything seems silly and nonsensical at first sight but in truth has all kinds of rules that the main character tries to figure out and then proceeds to use and abuse. I wouldn't call it quite completely rational though because the main character seems a bit too willing to play along (which is explained with two interconnected reasons though), because the villains aren't quite that rational (at least not the obvious ones) and because a few rare times things seem to be happening a bit deus ex machina. But all in all it sure is more rational than many other webcomics I've read.

How far into the first book did you get before starting to judge its rationality?

Edit:

Looking at the Characteristics of Rational Fiction sidebar I have this to say:

- Things do happen solely because of the plot. But characters don't do things solely because of the plot. Instead the world seems to have a will of its own and often nudges things along. This is however a theme that is explored numerous times, a major plot point in itself and something both the main character and others grapple with nd struggle to understand.

- Haven't found an "evil" faction yet. Only lots of jerkass factions.

- The smart ones do. Sometimes they just use educated guesses. Sometimes those are more or less spot on. Sometimes completely unexpected things happen. High stakes experimentation under time pressure is a thing.

- They seem consistent enough. As to /sane/, the main character and many readers would disagree. It's pretty crazy.

The story even slightly touches on the first two criteria for rational/ist/ fiction every now and then.
