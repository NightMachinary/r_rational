Actually they had an episode recently where one of the pony's pets was going to die(ok "hibernate"). The character's response was to determine that pet was dying because of winter and then attempt to literally prevent winter from ever coming. She ended up blowing up the facility that produces clouds, snowflakes, cold, etc.

When that finally fails and she's sulking one of the other ponies outright says "you're going to be petless." Its not completely rational but in terms of both caring enough to make a significant effort and facing hard truths it does a pretty good job.
