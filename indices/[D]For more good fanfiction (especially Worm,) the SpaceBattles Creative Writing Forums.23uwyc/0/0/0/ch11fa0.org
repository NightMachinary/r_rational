Yes, I do mean the videogame. Overlady essentially borrows elements from the game (the minions, the tower/tower heart) and one particular named character, but knowledge of the game is not essential at all - no knowledge is necessary or assumed. No real knowledge of Zero no Tsuakaima (Familiar of Zero) is really required either, but such knowledge will help a little bit, as the world of Overlady is far more based on ZnT than on Overlord. But knowledge of Overlord is entirely optional.

I actually installed and played the Overlord game because the fic was so awesome, and was bitterly disappointed. The game had nowhere near the humour and subtlety and genius for dialogue and plot that Earthscorpion's fic has, and the actual game elements were boring and not fun. It had a great concept and idea but the execution was nowhere near as good. 4/10, would not recommend. I picked it up at some Steam winter or summer sale, probably for less than $3, and it wasn't a good use of money.
