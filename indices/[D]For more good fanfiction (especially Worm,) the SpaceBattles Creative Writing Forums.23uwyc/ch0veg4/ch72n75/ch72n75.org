  I am not sure why they like the practice of giving Taylor versatile and powerful superpowers that allow for easy solutions to almost every problem - many of the best and most interesting and powerfully written bits of Worm's canon were when Taylor was forced to improvise and use a limited power to great effect, or to work with others, or come up with an amazing and clever plan, and giving her the ability to resolve all sorts of situations instantly and easily doesn't make for a better story at all.

Thus it is written: "If you give Frodo a lightsaber, you have to give Sauron a Death Star."
