My favorite fic hosted there is [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/overlady-attack-of-the-minions-thread-ii.264832/][Overlady]], a mostly comedy fic which is sort of deconstructionist, and is way better than the Zero no Tsukaima or Overlord source material. The writing is amazingly good. It also has a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8753582/1/Overlady][fanfiction.net]] hosted version as well, for people who like reading from servers with >50% uptime. Earthscorpion's other stuff (most easily findable from the author page from the fanfiction.net link) is mostly quite good as well, but Overlady is clearly their best work.

I typically monitor the index threads for interesting fanfiction. They tend to catch a lot of interesting stuff. Also a lot of bad stuff, of course.

There are a huge number of Worm fanfics that aren't really good over there and are sort of interchangeably bad, often for much the same reason. I am not sure why they like the practice of giving Taylor versatile and powerful superpowers that allow for easy solutions to almost every problem - many of the best and most interesting and powerfully written bits of Worm's canon were when Taylor was forced to improvise and use a limited power to great effect, or to work with others, or come up with an amazing and clever plan, and giving her the ability to resolve all sorts of situations instantly and easily doesn't make for a better story at all.

Batman: The Dark Knight Rises wouldn't be a better story if Batman had a superpower allowing him to fly out of the pit the instant Bane left.
