Note that you're talking heating that 1mm³ to 10,000,000 degrees, which is completely excessive. Note also that you can immediately steal that heat back, so you can do this repeatedly.

If you can go as thin as 0.1mm², my idea of using this to cut things (rather than just melt points) would allow you to cut about 40cm by 40cm cross sections at a time out of anything.

(Also, if you're not going to be ‘nice' and murder someone's brain directly to save them the suffering, at least be efficient and burn their spinal cord. Or cut their head off or something.)
