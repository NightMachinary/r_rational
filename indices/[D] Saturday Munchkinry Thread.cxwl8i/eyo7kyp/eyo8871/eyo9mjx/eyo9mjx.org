The heat transfer occurs over five seconds.

You can will heat to transfer from one thing to another as fast as you think about it--several times per second if you think hard and fast. Prepare for mental exhaustion in that case. Once per second is much more 'sustainable'.

You can make it look continuous but the 2% failure rate applies every time you refresh the heat transfer.
