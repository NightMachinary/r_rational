If you can't or don't want to use the sun, you could always move all the heat out of Earth into yourself. I don't expect anyone to last long on the moving boundary of 'not totally f-d' that would result--if nothing else, there would be some killer wind and radiation (In addition to most of the planet freezing and the local area being obliterated by fire.)
