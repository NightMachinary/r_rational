Hmm. I was deliberately trying to define the orb in a way such that it wouldn't kill humans in its radius. The way I'm thinking of it is, the orb is some kind of supercomputer that can track the position of every molecule within 100 meters, and calculate the future trajectories of each molecule as long as (a) it doesn't leave the 100 meter radius, and (b) it isn't moved by any unexpected forces. It then applies the minimal amount of very tiny nudges to some of the molecules such that all molecules of the same type will group up in a few hours. After that it applies more nudges to make sure the grouped up molecules don't dissolve again.

In this sense, a human jumping up and down within the orb's sphere of influence should be able to throw off the trajectories of his internal molecules enough to throw off the orb's calculations, and so hopefully will not be affected to the same extent as Heavy Water would.
