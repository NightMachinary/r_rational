About the only way to make it not kill humans, is to make it notice what a human is and not do its brownian motion manipulation to that human. Many processes require diffusion to occur. Respiration, activation potentials, and the diffusion of signalling chemicals are the three that come to mind. (Respectively, you'd reduce gas exchange at every step with compounding results, your nerves and muscles would fire at different rates with the change being proportional to size and thus not uniform, and any signal cascade is going to be compoundingly weakened based on the number of steps.)

Human beings absolutely need entropy to live, and they are optimized for its functioning in the way it currently functions.

edit: You could make it work on only gases. Maybe humans will feel out of breath in its presence, but we are at least evolved to handle changing gas needs and conditions.
