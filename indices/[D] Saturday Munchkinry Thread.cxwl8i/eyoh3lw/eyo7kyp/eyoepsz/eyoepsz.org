Is there a distance limit? What is the precision of this ability?

Could you concentrate heat from a large source to a small source?

Consider for example, transferring 1 degree Celsius of heat from your entire body to a 1mm^3 volume. Even if the transfer fails, 1 degree of heat to or from your body is nothing, fevers do far worse than that. On the other hand, 1 degree Celsius of heat from a large body (this power works better the bigger you are) concentrated into a tiny volume would probably be enough to burn/melt it.

By using your ability in this manner, you could cause all kinds of destruction without worrying about the 2% failure rate. You can transfer 1 degree Celsius of heat from your entire body to a small patch of a person's heart to kill them, without anyone noticing you did it. Similarly, you can destroy core components of any machine, melt transistors to ruin computer systems, slowly destroy the foundations of buildings by melting tiny holes in the pillars, etc.
