You have the psychic ability to move heat. You can freeze one glass of water by boiling another. You decide how much heat to move, will it to start, then it happens over the next five seconds.

However, whenever you use your power there is a chance that the heat will come from your physical body instead, or be transferred to you instead--something like 2%.

(If you accidentally freeze yourself to the lowest temperature, then only that much heat is moved.)

How can you safely munchkin this power? In what circumstances would you use it unsafely?

If you could only make things cold by moving their heat to the surroundings (and sometimes you), what would you do?

What if you could only make things hot the same way?
