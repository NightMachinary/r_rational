You possess a magical orb the size of a basketball, which can be switched on or off. While on, the orb subtly influences the Brownian motions of all fluids within a 100 meter radius of itself, such that over the course of a few hours, these fluids will be unmixed.

For example, if you shut the magical orb inside a room for a few hours, there will be a large bubble of pure oxygen, tiny bubbles of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases, and the rest of the room will be filled with pure nitrogen.

However, since the magical orb functions by manipulating Brownian motions, it can be overpowered easily. For example, if there's a fan in the room, the air molecules blown about by the fan will easily mix different molecules together faster than the orb can separate them.

Other than slightly delaying the heat death of the universe, is there anything that can be done with this magical orb?
