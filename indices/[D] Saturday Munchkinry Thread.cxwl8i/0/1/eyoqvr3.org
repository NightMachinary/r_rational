I'm assuming dissolved solids and liquids get the same treatment: dust in the air settles out, saltwater becomes water and salt.

In that case, you can cause any group of people within 100 meters to get the equivalent of kidney stones throughout their entire physiology, and die. So much of biology is salts diffusing across membranes, and proteins diffusing through blood and cellular fluids... I'd fully expect the device to kill anything near it, even with natural mixing from blood pumping and such.

Check out the biological effects of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_water#Effect_on_biological_systems][Heavy Water]] to see what I mean. By changing the mass of water (essentially changing its fluid properties) you can straight up kill most anything bigger than a bacteria. The magical orb makes changes on a similar scale.
