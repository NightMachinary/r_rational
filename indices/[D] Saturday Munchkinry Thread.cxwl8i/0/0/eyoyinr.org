Isotopic enrichment. That is a lot of free SWU you got there. Also nuclear waste treatment, since you can clean contaminated fluids. Uhm. This in fact mostly eliminates nuclear waste as a thing, as you can just melt nuclear fuel rods, and the orb will separate out the fission products. I think those two uses dominate every other possibility, economically speaking. It is fast enough you might have spare timeslots for other uses though, so I will note that very high-purity metals can also be produced by just having melting pots within the field of effect.

Note that it /will/ get shipped off to a nuclear facility, because nobody is going to permit this thing to be out in the world. If you have it, you can buy a couple of tonnes of "depleted" uranium and really trivially walk away with bomb grade uranium later that day.. Although if you load too much DU into your melting pots, the room will turn into a reactor (It will assemble a just-barely-critical mass, the mass will heat up, disperse, the orb will re-assemble a critical mass.. )
