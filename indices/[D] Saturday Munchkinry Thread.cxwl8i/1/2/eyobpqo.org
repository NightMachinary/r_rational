There aren't all that many things this seems useful for on first glance because the human body doesn't take well to large changes in heat. However, with a little thought...

You could kill basically anybody by heating/cooling their brain several times, using any heat source. Even if 2% comes from your body, this is much less and much more spread out.

You could perfectly thermoregulate. This is more a comfort thing than otherwise, though.

You could be incredibly helpful in low-temperature experiments, since being able to cool large bodies of objects down to nearly 0K is unprecedented. Starting from a sufficiently low baseline, and acting incrementally, this can be done safely without any real difficulty.

Depending on fidelity, you could cut through pretty much anything. Tens of thousands of degrees might be a lot, but if you only affect very tiny slivers of material, and partition it over a few invocations, the risk isn't all that much. This would let you make clean cuts anywhere, anytime, into anything.

Unsafe options are more powerful, but it's hard to think of something effective. Sure, you can move all the energy of the sun into Earth, but short of preventing a worst-case AI apocalypse, why bother?
