I never have to worry about my burrito being too hot to touch on the outside and frozen on the inside, at the very least.

What also comes to mind is supercooling. The heat could technically be transferred to the moon (" Distance limit: line of sight provided there is air between you and the thing. "), which is so large the heat transfer would be negligible. Of course, the 2% chance means that you should be limiting yourself to fairly small objects, (1/200 of your body mass if I'm doing my math, right.)

Edit: I remembered that a Kelvin degree doesn't match a Fahrenheit degree. 1/400 of your mass would be about the largest you should risk supercooling
