Hey, I'm glad you find ImmerseOrDie to be rational. I'm the guy that started it, and rationality is kinda the reason I did. I figured there had to be a more reliable/repeatable way to get a quick take on which indie fiction was ready for prime time and which ones weren't.

Along those same lines, you might also like [[http://page-fight.com][PageFight!]] which is another project I started, aimed at helping authors figure out which title, tagline, blurb, and cover ideas will work in the market. It does this by pitting them against each other in a reader-driven game environment where different book elements go head-to-head and players have to choose which one they would be more likely to investigate. It turns out to be lots of fun. Readers get a cool discovery tool and authors get valuable A/B testing /before/ they launch their books, rather than having to wait for sales data /after/ launch.
