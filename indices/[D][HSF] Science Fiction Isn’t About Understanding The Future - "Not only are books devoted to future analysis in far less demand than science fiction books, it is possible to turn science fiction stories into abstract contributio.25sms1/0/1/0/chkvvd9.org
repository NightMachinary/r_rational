  My reaction is basically 'well, duh'. It's an article with a blatant stretch in the premise, which robs any conclusion of any power it might otherwise have had. It would, after all, make much more sense to say 'clearly SF readers aren't after "abstract analysis" of the future, so what is so interesting?'... but nope.

100% agreed.

  It can be 'true' in the sense that it reveals something about the reader, the writer, and the context and expectations they live in (though not always what you think it does); but it's not a prediction of the future.

Yeah, science fiction is usually about the present. /Really good/ science-fiction can manage to function as a manifesto for what sort of thing someone in the present thinks about how the future /should/ go.
