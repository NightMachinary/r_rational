  Hanson presumes way too much, merely for the sake of enabling himself to appear intelligent by cynically knocking over a series of blatant strawmen.

Okay, this blog post wasn't very good, that's given. It was short on substance. But it seems a bit like you're letting your personal dislike of him affect your modding. I didn't get that wanting-to-appear-intelligent vibe at all. I actually thought he was making not so much factual statements, but just merely announcing his opinions about sci-fi stories and sharing different ways to think about sci-fi. I mean, he probably intended to make factual statements, but I took them to be just his opinions. That way I don't have to pull my hair.

I posted it because the "turning science fiction stories into abstract contributions" and focusing more on settings are interesting ideas that could have sparked good discussion.

What if he's arrogant and cynical? That doesn't mean he can't have useful ideas.
