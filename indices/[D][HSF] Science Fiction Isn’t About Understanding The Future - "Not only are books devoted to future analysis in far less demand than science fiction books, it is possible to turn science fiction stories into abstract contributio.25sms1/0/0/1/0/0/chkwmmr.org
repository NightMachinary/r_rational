  I posted it because the "turning science fiction stories into abstract contributions" is an interesting idea.

It is, but... well, basically, I can't help but agree with what [[/u/PeridexisErrant]] said about the particular blog entry. Probably, "trying to appear smart" /is/ my personal dislike talking.

However, that doesn't excuse Hanson for asking wrong questions, coming to informationally /empty/ answers, and then claiming to have found something.

The right way to do this would have been to ask, "Is science fiction about understanding the future?" and then continue by asking the very first question that would occur: "Does anyone /speak or act as if/ science-fiction is about understanding the future?" To which the plain answer is, well, /no/.

Well, actually, I tell a lie: Margaret Atwood seems to sincerely believe that her speculative fiction reflects reasonably probable futures. But most other scifi authors basically don't believe that in the first place.
