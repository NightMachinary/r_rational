  The right way to do this would have been to ask, "Is science fiction about understanding the future?" and then continue by asking the very first question that would occur: "Does anyone speak or act as if science-fiction is about understanding the future?" To which the plain answer is, well, no.

He wrote that because he'd personally like to see more that kind of fiction. Yeah, almost all science fiction is like that, but that doesn't mean that science fiction could never be about understanding the future, that it /shouldn't/ never be about understanding the future. I mean, there isn't much rationalist fiction. That doesn't mean that it /should/ be like this - that there are no people who would like to read rationalist fiction despite the status quo - like the existence of this sub implies.

I share Hanson's opinion and would like to see more sci-fi that's focused on settings and plausibility of those settings.
