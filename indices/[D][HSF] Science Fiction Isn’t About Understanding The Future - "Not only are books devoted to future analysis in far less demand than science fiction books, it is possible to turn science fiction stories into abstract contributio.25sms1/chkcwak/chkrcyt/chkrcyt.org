My reaction is basically 'well, duh'. It's an article with a blatant stretch in the premise, which robs any conclusion of any power it might otherwise have had. It would, after all, make much more sense to say 'clearly SF readers aren't after "abstract analysis" of the future, so what /is/ so interesting?'... but nope.

I read science fiction because it (hopefully) consists of good story/characters/setting, and when great explores something out of the ordinary - for example /The Dispossessed/ could only have been published as SF, or /Surface Detail/ which to get the appropriate impact cant afford dry analysis.

It can be 'true' in the sense that it reveals something about the reader, the writer, and the context and expectations they live in (though not always what you think it does); but it's not a prediction of the future.
