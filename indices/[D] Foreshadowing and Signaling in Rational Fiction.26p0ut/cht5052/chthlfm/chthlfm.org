One possibility is having an ending that is both predictable and tragic but that the audience hope doesn't happen. They won't expect it because they think a plot twist will happen to save the day because otherwise it would be too predictable and this belief is reinforced by the desire for the plot twist to happen. Then they will be surprised that there wasn't a twist in the end.
