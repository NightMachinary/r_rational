  Stories are structured in a certain way because that way works, but also because humans enjoy pattern-matching. A subversion of expectations can really backfire for an author because the audience likes to have their expectations fulfilled. Actually, more than that, I think that the audience likes to think "well, of course that's obvious in retrospect".

Counterpoint: subverting tropes can make for good drama in itself. Not in a "I'm so cool and subversive!" way, but in the way that you build up the readers' expectations and desires, and then /dash them upon a rock/ and do something else. It helps if your characters have a rational reason to do something else.

Sometimes the right resolution to a plot point is to /piss the readers off/, but in an /intelligent/ way.
