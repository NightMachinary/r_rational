  I think the best answer is to make multiple solutions to the end of the story. If the characters are really driven into conflict by their values, and no one is just "good" or just "evil", and they're more or less evenly matched, then it shouldn't be a foregone conclusion that one side is going to win, even if we see all the maneuvering that's happening.

Visual novels (or choose-your-own-adventures) can do this since they can have many endings.
