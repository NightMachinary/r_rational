  But what about the kinds of meta-contextual information widely-read readers bring with them into every story they read, their awareness of various tropes and plot-devices and ongoing speculations on all of their combinations?

I am an aspiring Fantasy writer, so I find these discussions very interesting. In my world, there is no 'genre savyness' as such, but the most important and well studied part of the world's history is a decades long war between ten villains with industrial scale laboratories and armies who did little /except/ trying to find new ways of getting at each other. So... at least as far as 'evil' and battle related tropes go, my main characters are familiar with them because they have read accounts of that war. They don't have anything like rationalist training going for them yet, but hey, we have to let the masterminds get a bit of a head start first, no?

  readers can reach the same solution as the characters by using the information provided earlier in the story.

My work is nowhere near being published yet, but I have written 90%< of the first draft of the first book. This is something I try very hard to make sure I do right. It helps that I have two main characters I switch between, who have very different personalities, and often learn and pay attention to different things. So because they do not sit down and compare notes, there are several things that the reader could work out earlier than the characters do, and some the characters never work out at all, but which would give the reader more insight into what must have happened behind the scenes, if they do work it out. The hardest part about this for me is making sure I have explained how magic works clearly enough that the reader has a fair chance to realize that what seems to be happening is impossible, and somebody has to be lying.
