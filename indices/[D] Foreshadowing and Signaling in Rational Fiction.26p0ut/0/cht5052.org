Optimizing drama is an interesting problem.

Stories are structured in a certain way because that way /works/, but also because humans enjoy pattern-matching. A subversion of expectations can really backfire for an author because the audience /likes/ to have their expectations fulfilled. Actually, more than that, I think that the audience likes to think "well, of course that's obvious in retrospect".

I think the best answer is to make multiple solutions to the end of the story. If the characters are really driven into conflict by their values, and no one is just "good" or just "evil", and they're more or less evenly matched, then it shouldn't be a foregone conclusion that one side is going to win, even if we see all the maneuvering that's happening. I'm trying to think of a story that I thought did this successfully ... /Death Note/ maybe? The characters are driven into conflict by their values, and the viewer for a long time really doesn't know who is going to come out on top. I'd also say the movie /Hard Candy/. Possibly also the television series /Hannibal/.

I'm currently writing a bit of Superman fanfic, and I'm at least trying to ensure that the conclusion is not foregone, so this topic is of interest to me. Even going into the final chapter, I think there needs to be more than one narratively satisfying possible ending.
