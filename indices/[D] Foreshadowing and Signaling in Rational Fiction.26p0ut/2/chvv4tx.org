Tension feeds on uncertainty. If I, the reader, am certain, there is little or no tension, regardless of whether a mountain of fire is about to rain down on the protagonists, or whether they are shouting or crying. Sometimes you can maintain tension by making the reader wonder /how/ the mountain will be deflected, rather than wondering /if/ the mountain will be deflected. But for the most part, the more true (not theoretical) uncertainty you can maintain in the reader, the more they'll be driven to keep reading.

Example of this being done correctly: Worm.

Example of this being done /weirdly:/ HPMOR.

Example of this not being done at all: Traditional comic book.
