I think to actually do it right, you have to be obsessive about linguistics to an extent that most people aren't (myself included).

One of the things that I think about a fair amount is mouth shape, and how that affects which sounds a person can make, and how that then influences what the languages look like. If you describe someone (or a whole species) as having pointy teeth, then you should be thinking about how they make sounds like the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_dental_fricative][voiceless dental fricative]] or the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_dental_fricative][voiced dental fricative]]. It seems to me like the real use of "Common", beyond just being a trade language, is being able to settle on a single language that every species is actually capable of speaking, or which at least a majority can speak, without all that much trouble.

The real problem for prose is that I think accents and dialects are really hard to get across to the reader unless you're willing to dip into partial or full phonetics, which I've always found really annoying to read, and even more annoying to write, plus it usually makes the person speaking sound less intelligent, which isn't always (or usually) what you're trying to convey. There are other aspects, like word choice, cadence, etc. that you can use, and some of that ties into dialect (or idiolect) but the actual /sounds/ are hard to get across in prose.

(Thus far, there are three created languages for /Worth the Candle/, but I cheated and used [[https://www.vulgarlang.com/index.html][Vulgar]] to generate them, mostly because all I wanted were languages that was guaranteed to look more or less right to the reader and follow consistent rules, though I won't guarantee that the sample sentences are fully faithful to the specifications for the languages.

And obviously as far as English/Anglish goes, there's a fair amount of fuckery going on in the background. Anglish is English, but with a different etymological and linguistic background, some missing idioms, and some changed meanings to certain phrases, plus some additions that are literally /from/ Earth English by way of the dream-skewered.)
