For what little it's worth, I imagine June and Amaryllis speaking standard Midwestern American English, Grak speaking formal textbook Midwestern American English, and Fenn speaking in a faint high-class British accent. I voiced Fallatehr & co in extremely precise Oxbridge English, which is how I imagine all elves sound.

For some reason, Bone Magus Bormann spoke with a middling Russian accent in my head.
