I think it's less important how the character sounds, and more important that the character's accent reflect the stereotypes the reader is supposed to have about each character. For example, the main character talks in midwest standard/newscaster to indicate they're an average everyman with down to earth values. A love interest has a french accent to indicate that they're sultry, refined and a little promiscuous. Someone using RP is likely from a posh upbringing.

I also extend that to wordplay. Obviously, having characters make puns or jokes that only work in english doesn't make sense if the work is supposed to be an exact translation, but the idea behind them is to convey that this is the kind of character who jokes around about [x] topic, and has [y] character trait associated with how they talk.
