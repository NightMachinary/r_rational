A question that occurs to me when reading Sci-Fi and Fantasy, most recently [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen][u/cthulhuraejepsen]]'s Worth the Candle, is what do these people sound like?

This is especially an interesting question with shows like Stargate, where everyone mysteriously speaks English, which raises some problems:

- What are their accents? Star Wars has an interesting take on this where the Empire, and more generally Core World people often have British accents, while Rebellion and Outer Region people have American accents. (and Twi'lek speak French and/or have French accents). But it's

- Do these people have alternate languages? In "standard" fantasy, there's usually a "main" language called "Common" or "Imperial" or "the human language" or whatever; the implication being that people in that world don't speak English, they speak Common and it's translated in English (or Japanese or whatever language the book is written/translated in). In the fantasy world, there's no English, so there's also no Spanish or Japanese or Russian; instead, there's Common, Elvish, Dwarvish, etc.

- Assuming this isn't just translation convention and the characters are actually speaking English, how does the main character sound? The question is often glossed over, which can be a little strange for infiltration-type scenarios where the main character is, eg disguised as an Imperial guardsman, which should logically be about as successful as a spy trying to infiltrate the White House while speaking with a thick Russian accent.

I think Stargate was probably one of the shows that struggled the most with this problem. All the humans on every planet speak English, even though they were taken away from Earth before English was even a language. Not only that, but they mostly speak English with a perfect American accent.

This is especially funny in Stargate Atlantis, which features an international expeditions, which means there's more diversity in the languages and accents of /the Earth characters/ than from the aliens they meet.
