I once read a My Little Pony fanfic where the protagonists defeated death and built a colony of immortals on the moon. A lot of it was pretty much a debate between those who would withhold immortality from the masses and those who believe that death is bad. It got pretty angsty and I don't know whether I would recommend it.
