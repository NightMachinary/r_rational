Now that you've pointed it out, I can probably recall a few more specifically American things there. Here's probably what happens in such cases: if I recognize the pun (did they say Manehattan? I know, that's where the Spiderpony lives!) it doesn't register as something too specific (when they added Greek mythology to the mix I didn't feel like the show was becoming Greece-targeted; same here). If I don't recognize it (I'll have to actually google right now what Appleoosa stands for) - it passes as just another part of that whimsical fairytale setting. So they have the Crystal Empire, Ponyville and also Appleoosa - fine by me!

Also bear in mind that targeting shows for regional audiences usually involves translation - and some of the more subtle puns and references can easily get lost. If I weren't a fan of watching shows in English, I would probably even miss Applejack's obvious Southern accent.
