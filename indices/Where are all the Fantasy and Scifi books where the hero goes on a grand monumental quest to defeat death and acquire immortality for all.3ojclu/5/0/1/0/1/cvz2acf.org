I'd like examples, since i never watched the show, i'm afraid. I've read enough fanfic and fan novelizations, both of canon and AU that i have a pretty good idea of all the stops on the original train, but i've never been on the original route myself, just the historical reenactment.

that was probably an overextended metaphor.
