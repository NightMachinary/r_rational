Nope, definitely not the spam filter; you can test whether someone has been shadowbanned by going to their user page. (If you are that person, you have to log out first or use incognito mode.) One of the crap things about it is that even if you're a mod you don't get inbox replies from whoever has been shadowbanned, so the only way to know that they've tried to reply to you is by going into the thread in question.

(Shadowbanning is such a chickenshit method of moderation. [[/u/spez]] has [[https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctss0fo?context=3][said it's not appropriate for anything beyond spam]] and that [[https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3euqwf/reddit_autoshadow_banning/ctj42qc?context=3][they're working on better tools]] but that was all two months ago and they're still shadowbanning people, so I dunno.)

I think there's some way for a mod to whitelist a person on a subreddit via Automoderator but I need to dig for it when I have some free time.
