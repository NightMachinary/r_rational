[[/u/Transfuturist]], it appears that you have been *shadowbanned*. I've manually approved this comment, but you'll want to [[https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23reddit.com][message the admins]] to try to get it reversed. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/help/wiki/faq#wiki_i.27ve_been_banned._why.3F_how_do_i_get_unbanned.3F][See this FAQ]]. Subreddit mods (like me) have no control over shadowbans and can't do anything about them.
