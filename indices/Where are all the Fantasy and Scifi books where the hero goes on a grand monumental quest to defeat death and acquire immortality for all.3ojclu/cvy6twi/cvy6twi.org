The book I've read that comes closest to what I described is The Transhumanist Wager by Zoltan Istvan. It was while reading it that I realized that the basic idea is compelling enough to make a book readable and even good even in which the protagonist has certain ideas that wouldn't be very out of place in Nazi Germany and the author has an unfortunate love of straw men. Still, despite this it's a good read.

HPMOR comes pretty close, and while Tom mostly solves the problem for Harry, at least Harry always keeps the end goal of "defeat death" firmly in mind, and if Tom hadn't solved the problem one gets the sense that Harry would have died trying for a solution. Unfortunately, the author spends so much time showing off his intelligence and ability to get out of any corner that he could write himself into that parts of it are hard to stomach. He could have remedied this problem if he had remembered that intelligence is not the exclusive province of geniuses, and under sufficient pressure ordinary people occasionally have those flashes of brilliance that make war so dangerous, but instead after a while it feels like the only actual characters /in/ HPMOR are Harry, Hermione, and Voldy.

Vernor Vinge's /Marooned in Realtime/ can be seen as having this if you tilt your head and squint real hard, as well having absolutely exceptional writing, and addressing the issues of what kind of damage spending thousands of years living might do to a mind, and what minds would look like with various levels of augmentation. If you want to see well written immortals look no further than /Marooned in Realtime/.

I have trouble understanding those who call the idea of a lone hero solving immortality "childish" or something similar. Is it more childish than the lone hero becoming a god? Defeating some universal force of evil? Becoming ruler of a country and somehow doing a good job? Acquiring superpowers and putting on a costume and fighting crime? Coming up with some kind of weird and unrealistic political system and having it work and create a utopia? Having a harem of love slaves? What does it say about society that all of these ideas are "realistic" enough to appear again and again to the point of tedium, but defeating death is "childish"?
