People have ruled nations well- never alone, but as the Highest overseer. People haven't become gods, but in a setting where magic is powerful enough to do that, defeating death is theoretically possible, (in fact, if gods rule afterlives, you've defeated it, even if the original world will die, so long as no one dies in the afterlife. now go work on claiming hell, so there's no eternities of torture~). Defeating death without Alternate universe powers (Stuff that doesn't exist here,) rings false, especially if you work alone. You can have a grand epic to defeat death, but defeating death for everyone would need to be a tale longer than the oddessey or in a setting where it is demonstratably viable. (harry potter, for instance, is a 3 out of 10, probably, on the 'death mortality rate'. City of Angles could be a 5, with proper manipulation of echoes, while D&D is a 4 as-is, but it'd be higher if the tech level was better.) Creating utopia is impossible to be done believably, but it can be done.

Harry is perhaps more distractable than he should be, but defeating death as a whole will take a lot of trouble in harry potter, and far more the weaker magic becomes.

If you want to write a death-defeating fanfic, there are good characters for that. Now that I look for it, You could read byukaren from touhou's backstory that way- the she sought immortality for herself and for others, and currently seeks equality for those with prolonged lives. On the other hand, there are a lot of not-good facets of this, but After her brother died, she left to seek immortality for herself- and others, perhaps, with the right interpretation. Just make her keep her quest quiet- in character, i think- and her endgame everyone is immortal.
