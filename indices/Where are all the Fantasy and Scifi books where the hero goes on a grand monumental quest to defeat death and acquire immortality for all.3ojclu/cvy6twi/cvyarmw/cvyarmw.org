  I have trouble understanding those who call the idea of a lone hero solving immortality "childish" or something similar. Is it more childish than the lone hero becoming a god? Defeating some universal force of evil? Becoming ruler of a country and somehow doing a good job? Acquiring superpowers and putting on a costume and fighting crime? Coming up with some kind of weird and unrealistic political system and having it work and create a utopia? Having a harem of love slaves? What does it say about society that all of these ideas are "realistic" enough to appear again and again to the point of tedium, but defeating death is "childish"?

Society /does/ call a lot of those things childish. You don't have to look very far to see someone calling superheroes a childish power fantasy. Or that mildly famous John Rogers quote, "There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old's life: /The Lord of the Rings/ and /Atlas Shrugged/. One is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes, leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled adulthood, unable to deal with the real world. The other, of course, involves orcs." And I have no idea where you get the idea that people are respectful of the idea of a harem of love slaves.

So I don't think the reason that "defeat of death" is so rare is that people perceive it as childish; there are lots of perceived-childish things that show up time and time again. You need some other explanation.

Personally, I think it comes down to emotion. There are plenty of stories where the hero goes to the underworld to retrieve his dead love, because that's more emotionally resonant than saving everyone from death forever. We're animals; we care more about people in our inner circle than we do about some random stranger on the other side of the planet. So if a story's purpose is to make you feel things, that story is going to work a lot better if the death in question is one we have a strong connection to. And you /do/ see /those/ stories.
