What I mean about the love slaves and superheros and whatever else is that however childish these ideas are they show up again and again and are respected enough to get published in good books.

People understand that seeking immortality is a powerful motivation. That's why villains can use it to justify damn near any atrocity. Why not add a measure of altruism by making it for /everyone/ and then have a hero committing those acts and making those sacrifices (with plucky sidekicks going "Don't let it end like this," gasp die, and the hero killing more and more people in his quest as a result)? Why does this never happen in all the morass of fantasy and scifi books struggling to stand out from the crowd?
