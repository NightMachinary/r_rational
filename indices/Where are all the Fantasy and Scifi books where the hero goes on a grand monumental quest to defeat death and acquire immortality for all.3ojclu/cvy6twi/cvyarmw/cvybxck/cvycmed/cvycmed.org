  What I mean about the love slaves and superheros and whatever else is that however childish these ideas are they show up again and again and are respected enough to get published in good books.

Exactly. So the reason that you don't see "defeat death" show up must not be related to it being childish. Trying to defeat death is childish, but that's not the reason that you don't see it in fiction. It's not showing up for /other reasons/. The question is what those other reasons are.

People understand /personal/ immortality as a compelling goal. They don't intuitively connect with /global/ immortality. People understand not wanting to die. They understand not wanting their friends to die. They can intuitively extend that to not /ever/ wanting to die, even if they disagree with that. You start running into problems when you try extending that to /everyone/, because the human brain isn't equipped with the emotional tools to conceptualize that. We can use logic, sure, but that's not the same as feeling it on a gut level.

Storytelling is about hedon production. You don't get hedon production by saving a bunch of people you don't know and never interact with, you get it from saving something /personal/ and /close/. The problem with death is that it's /large/ and /distant/, so (for most people) doesn't trigger anything instinctual. And if I'm writing a fantasy epic, why would I choose something that's not going to resonate with anyone, or that I'm going to have to work ten times as hard at in order to make it work?
