I'm actually working on brainstorming a story with something like this for the premise. I'm also looking for a co-author so if this is something that might appeal to you, send me a PM.

The idea is roughly this: its 200-300 years in the future, humanity has spread to every planet in the solar system and launched a series of generation ships into deep space to seed the galaxy with humanity.

But while things are awesome (everyone lives to an average age of 120, universal access to your world's internet through implantable cybernetics and free public terminals) things aren't that amazing. Earth is slowly melting down from the cumulative stress of supporting 40 billion people. The biosphere is just slowly coming apart at the seams, the sea levels are rising, desertification is rampant, and severe weather is common. The terraforming attempts on Mars and Venus are bogged down and expected to take hundreds of years more to get any progress, and most of humanity's food is processed algae bricks farmed in giant orbital habitats. A good percentage of the population has dove headfirst into VR and never come up for air. Technology to indefinitely extend the human lifespan exists, technology to scan and back up a human mind to a server exists, and technology to copy, download, and merge human minds exists. But all of this is unavailable to the average member of society. A group of 4 giant corporations have clamped down hard on this technology, protecting it behind patents, trade agreements, and copyrights.

Enter our first character, an AI researcher who has spent the last twenty years slowly grinding away at the problem of AGI. While incredibly powerful, lifelike, and interactive Narrow AIs are common and everyday, serving every purpose from customer service to frontline soldiers, a general purpose, human level, sentient AI has been a pipe dream for hundreds of years. Working from the small mobile colony on Mercury he lives at, this researcher is starting to think it might just be impossible to create an AGI. That is, until he gets an encrypted email from a satellite node orbiting at Jupiter's L2 point.

Enter our second character. A twenty-something hotshot hacker working out of her own (stolen) ship and on the run from the corporate authorities has managed to crack the encryption on a corporate satellite in the asteroid belt, and extracted the technique to upload and digitize a consciousness. She realizes the technology isn't anything but off the shelf components used in a new way, and creates a digital copy of herself. She's being hunted down by faster, newer ships and knows she doesn't have much time. So she transfers the digital copy of herself through fifteen different routers, eventually bouncing the signal back and forth across the solar system. She's hunted down and killed, but her digital copy ends up in the email of our first character.

Now, he's just been handed the keys to the kingdom as it were. Not only is there a sentient, digital consciousness living on his home computer which holds the keys to mind uploading, but by studying the base code of the uploaded hacker, he's able to make some crucial insights into how to put an AGI together, and assembles a new consciousness from scratch using this method. The digital girl, the AI researcher, and the AGI are thus thrown into a pitched battle against the corporations hunting them down. Their goal: cure death for /everyone/ once and for all.

There's obviously much more to it that I've worked out, but :spoilers: and so on. I'd really really like to create something publishable, so if this seems interesting to you, send me a PM and lets collaborate.
