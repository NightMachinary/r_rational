I mean, it sounds like you want a generic fantasy macguffin quest where instead of living happily ever after the surviving heroes live happily forever after.

Which is cool, but death is a unique problem in that while feasability is one thing, many of the potential problems comes from desirability, and a lot of the stories I've read that feature defeating death cover that aspect more.

Although it's ponies, [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/95424/mortal][Mortal]] came to mind, and counts as fantasy as far as I can tell because Magic, Monarchs, Mythical creatures. Also ponies adjacent is [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal][Friendship is Optimal]], a sci-fi this time. The heroes fighting against death are RD and CelestAI respectively, and they both roughly follow your description of overcoming challenges and losing people on their way to defeating death.
