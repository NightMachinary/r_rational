Immortals. Because, well, writing a setting where death isn't a thing is fairly straightforward, but we have no good examples of what long stretches of time will do to human minds. Even extrapolation is unlikely to be very helpful, because while some problems can be predicted, the solutions that will be attempted and what their effects, both intended and unintended will be.. not so much. The easy cheat is, of course, to set the story in the time period right after the defeat of death, because that way you dont have to write 3000 year olds. - Noone will have aged much past a normal lifespan. Of course, you still have to write 90 year olds with the health of a 29 year old. Which.. No bloody clue what the typical reaction to that would be.
