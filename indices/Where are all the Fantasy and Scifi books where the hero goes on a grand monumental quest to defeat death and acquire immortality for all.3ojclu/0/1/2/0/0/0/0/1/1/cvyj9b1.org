Yes, they can. I can see that. But not the story he's asking for. If I were doing it, it would be the other way around- a series of mages (magic being one of the most knowledge-based powers) trying to gradually defeat death. the hero in book 1 founds the order and makes some progress, book 2 focuses on the apprentice and book 1's hero either dies by book three or the end of book two, and so on, a chain of not fast enough and could-have-liveds that each cut off another part of death, but fail to destroy it and saved themselves.

(It would be a good short-story, but an epic would be hard, and the type he's describing is too easy. 1 generation to beat death, and banish a demon that's pursued us for generations just feels too easy.)
