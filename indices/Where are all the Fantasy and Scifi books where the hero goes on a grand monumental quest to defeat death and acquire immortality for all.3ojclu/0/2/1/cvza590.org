  First of all, aging is a series of collective processes that accumulate over time. Degeneration of joint tissues, irreversible damage to fine structures (kidneys, brain, heart, etc), shortening of telomeres, UV/radiation damage to DNA... I could go on, but the point here is that we label ALL of these things as a part of the Syndrome of Aging. They will require independent novel solutions to "cure aging," not to mention the diseases like strokes, dementia, and cancer.

Strokes, dementia and cancer are more like consequences of aging, not a /part/ of aging. Young people very rarely get cancer. And there is no real biological reason that old people's bodies couldn't fight cancer just as well as young ones. It's just that health decline is programmed into our DNA. From an evolutionary perspective it makes sense it makes sense to have short generations and to kill off the old so they don't use as much resources. (See also this: [[http://joshmitteldorf.scienceblog.com/2014/04/07/no-the-body-doesnt-just-wear-out-as-we-get-older/]] )

So, to put it a bit provocative, if we solve aging, we have also solved cancer.
