Because killing is easier, and finding a cure for death isn't more improbable, it's just harder to write /well/. There's no one enemy, facing you, mortal and vulnerable. There's nothing directly facing you, it's not a person. In any quest to defeat death, the main thing opposing you is other people, because death doesn't seek you out faster or more because you oppose it. In our world, it's taking thousands of scientists to defeat cancers, and they haven't succeeded yet. it's a lot easier to write the story of taking the secret of immortality from the gods and trying to get it to everyone, than writing the story of finding the secret of immortality. The stories that people like to read are generally the least effective methods of fighting death there is, and the most likely methods here are boring, to most people.

Because just giving a character the secret from science is the easiest method, and it feels like a deus ex machina, unless he's significantly more powerful than anyone alive today, or like a final feather in his cap, and the protagonist really didn't work for the immortality itself- he earned power, but not immortality.
