  Um, is the entire real general public really like that?

No. The real general public just haven't been given a coherent notion that there is a /clear, understood path/ towards a world without dying. They don't actually like it, they tolerify it.

If you show them a fictional setting in which there was never any death in the first place, like the Garden of Eden, they instantly label that state of being as more desirable than our real one.
