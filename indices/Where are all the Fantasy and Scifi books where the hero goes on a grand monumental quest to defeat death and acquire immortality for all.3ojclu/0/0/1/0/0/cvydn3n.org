  The enemy is that the general public doesn't see their own and everyone else's imminent death from disease or old age as a problem worth doing anything about. I cannot imagine a worse enemy. And it's a real enemy, not something created whole cloth from the author's imagination.

1. Most authors are members of the general public. That means most authors don't see their own and everyone else's death from disease or old age as a problem worth doing anything about. Why would such an author want to write about something they don't particularly care about?
2. Most authors are trying to make money. If they're not trying to make money, they're trying to gain acclaim (or at least have people read their book). If most people don't see their own and everyone else's death from disease or old age as a problem, why would the author write about that? It's not going to sell. People aren't going to read it.

So your hypothetical author has to be within the subset of people who really care about death, /and/ he has to be writing for ideological (rather than profit or status) reasons. You probably want a competently written book, which cuts your possible authors down even further. And then there's the question of getting it published, which seems like it would be difficult since (as you said) the general public doesn't care about the central conflict.
