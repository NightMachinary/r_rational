Because suddenly you have a single protagonist versus the world, even if he's trying to kill death, that's not the main conflict anymore. It leaves me, already, wondering, 'wasn't there a better way to avoid this?'

I would say that might make sense. it's just that defeating death is hard, and neither has it been done, nor has it had an inferior prototype, so we have no idea how hard death is to destroy. Most authors think it's too hard, that it's like throwing in world peace or something into the setting. it's just not easy to do.

I'm of the opinion that that is the moral of gilglamesh, no matter what others might think. Not death can't be cheated, there were three ways right there, but that it's really hard, or maybe even, note capitalization, No One can defeat death.
