Make the cost of acquiring the knowledge or artifacts that the hero needs to progress in his quest high enough and you can justify everyone in the setting banding together to kill him. The enemy is that the general public doesn't see their own and everyone else's imminent death from disease or old age as a problem worth doing anything about. I cannot imagine a worse enemy. And it's a real enemy, not something created whole cloth from the author's imagination. It's an enemy that says something about the real world. Why don't more authors use it?
