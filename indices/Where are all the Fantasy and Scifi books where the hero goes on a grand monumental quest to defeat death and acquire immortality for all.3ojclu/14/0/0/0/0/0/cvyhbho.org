  But that's exactly the plot of the standard defeat the dark one plot line.

No, it's not. Harry Potter didn't sacrifice to save a mass of unrelated people from certain death, he did it to save his friends and family. Luke Skywalker didn't do it for a mass of unrelated people, he did it for his friends. Frodo and Sam do it for the Shire and the Fellowship. The classic "defeat the dark one" plot is almost never about nameless, faceless masses, it's about people the hero has met during his journey, or his companions, or his hometown, or the woman he loves. These are people personally known to the reader and the protagonist; they are familiar and therefore compelling.

I think the other thing you're missing is imminence. That matters quite a bit. There's a reason that if a hero has to stop a bomb from going off it will usually come down to the wire. How many times have you seen a main character stop a disaster that was forty years away?

You seem to be saying that it /doesn't matter/ whether the threat is far away, or that it doesn't matter whether the protagonist has personal stakes, but both those things aren't true. You'd know they weren't true even if you had only studied human psychology and not how to write fiction.
