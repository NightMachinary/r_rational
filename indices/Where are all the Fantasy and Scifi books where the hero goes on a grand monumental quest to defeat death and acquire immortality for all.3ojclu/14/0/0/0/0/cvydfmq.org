  Storytelling is about hedon production. You don't get hedon production by saving a bunch of people you don't know and never interact with, you get it from saving something personal and close. The problem with death is that it's large and distant, so (for most people) doesn't trigger anything instinctual.

But that's exactly the plot of the standard defeat the dark one plot line. Hero sacrifices to save mass of unrelated people from certain death, unrelated people are personified by plucky sidekicks who die to motivate hero and make you sympathize with unrelated people who will die in the same way and will have people care about them in the same way.

How is defeat the dark one and keep him from killing everyone different from defeat death and keep everyone from eventually dying? They are /exactly/ the same plot. Except that the later plot is more realistic, because death exists in the real world and will kill everyone, and death might be defeatable in the real world.
