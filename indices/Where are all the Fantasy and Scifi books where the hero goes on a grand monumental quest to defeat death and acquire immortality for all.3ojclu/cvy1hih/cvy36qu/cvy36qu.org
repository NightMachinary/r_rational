Um... The story bills itself as this sort of thing in the opening, and indeed has this sort of thing going on in the background, and the protagonist pays lip service to it a fair bit. However, the central focus of the story is on a bunch of different things than this central idea. Harry occasionally says stuff about ending death entirely, but by and large his onscreen actions do not particularly end death, and he makes no progress towards this goal in any particular way on his own other than ending some dementors (which 'ends death' in the same way that, say, donating to malaria bed nets do). Indeed, Harry causes some few deaths, as well. The end of HPMOR sort of implies that maybe eventually Harry will fight death in some nontrivial sense and succeed at some point after the events of the book, but that premise is basically unfulfilled by the actual onscreen events of the story. The hero's journey in HPMOR, such as it is, is first concerned with trying to exploit magic, and, finding it very hard and complex, basically giving up and spending a long time doing intrigue and wizard politics with time travel exploits thrown in, before finally at the very end stumbling to a victory over an evil Wizard almost by accident which, by complete and utter fluke, grants Harry for his victory over the evil wizard a bunch of tools to potentially end death and remake the universe if he manages not to end himself or the world on accident first.

Harry doesn't make any real progress on his end-death plan himself, and only when Tom Riddle basically hands the victory over death to him and takes the time to explain everything about The Philosopher's Stone, before promptly losing permanently through carelessness, does Harry gain tools that might help him to an actual victory over Death (and then the story ends).

I think 'well intentioned guy accidentally stumbles into potential solution for mortality' does not quite fit the OP's request.
