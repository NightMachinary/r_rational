Well, chasing immortality isn't uncommon theme in literature, but nowadays it's mostly attributed to bad guys (Voldemort) and since ancient times it almost never end well. The cause is simple: people are still insecure about death and story about acquiring immortality through science or magic seems rather like an childish wish-fulfillment.

Basically moral of most stories about it is that while trying to beat the death, you lose your life.
