Plus a bit of Skroderider and Tine biology.

I think he wanted to put some barriers in Ravna's way, and fill in some of the Tine backstory, and get started on a new series... but he kind of went overboard and lost his way. There are all these loose ends:

- Amdi's problem with the tightness of his pack and his fear of losing his soul. This was kind of thrown over the side with Ravna going "Oh, well, there's too much extrapolation in the message I'm getting from my spy bots and we're too deep in the Slow Zone to trust the High Beyond software".
- The spy bots were too much like the Localizers of the Queng Ho, really.
- We find out about Ravna's super-superuser power, and she does nothing with it.
- The "Pro Blight" faction really never seemed convincing in the first place.

Ravna could have followed up on the hints from her spy bots, redeployed them to use them more effectively, or gone into the raw data and used her librarian smarts to figure out what was really going on with Amdi. Even if the evocation was wrong, she should be able to use actual natural intelligence and skill (she won a fucking interplanetary scholarship!) to do something with that.

And the whole super-super-user power on the OOB is totally dropped.
