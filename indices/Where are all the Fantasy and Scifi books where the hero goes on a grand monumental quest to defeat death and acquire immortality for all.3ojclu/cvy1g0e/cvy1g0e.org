Actually, I'm pretty sure the protagonist of /Twilight/ goes to great lengths to become immortal, and - having overcome various obstacles along the way - she succeeds and it's awesome.

Her motivations are primarily selfish, though, IIRC. No vampire revolution for anyone else.

I guess Deadpool deliberately set out to become immortal, and did. Some versions depict him as having changed his mind, but he certainly didn't roll over when an alternate-universe him showed up with a gun capable of killing Deadpools. But unfortunately he's largely unaware.

(Hey, why haven't they used whatever process created Deadpool on anyone else? It worked fine, it just made his brain cancer slightly worse but non-terminal.)

Defeating/ending death is a major motivation of the Necromancers in the /Skulduggery Pleasant/ series, and it's treated fairly sympathetically by the protagonist (who flirts with Necromancy for a while.) SP Necromancy is mostly just shadow-manipulation, too, not undead, so it's a fairly ambitious long-term goal.

But the protagonists do not end up going on an epic quest to defeat Death.

... yeah, I genuinely don't think anyone popular has done what you suggest since the Epic of Gilgamesh the King.
