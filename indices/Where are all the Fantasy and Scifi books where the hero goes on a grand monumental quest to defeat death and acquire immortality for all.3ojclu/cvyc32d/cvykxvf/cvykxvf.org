MLP fandom spends a bizarrely large amount of effort thinking about immortality, given that the original subject is a cartoon for six-year-old white girls.

It warms my heart that this just seems to be /what happens/ when you put examples and prototypes of immortal life forms who /aren't fundamentally broken individuals/ in front of people and let their imaginations speculate.
