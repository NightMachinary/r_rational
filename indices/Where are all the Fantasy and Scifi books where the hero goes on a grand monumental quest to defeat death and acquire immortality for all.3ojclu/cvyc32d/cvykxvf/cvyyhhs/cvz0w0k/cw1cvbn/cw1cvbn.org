As someone who never even visited America, let alone being raised there, I barely even saw any national or regional overtones in MLP. If there was anything specifically Middle American that an outsider would miss, that's probably what happened - I missed it and still enjoyed the show. For me, only the Apple family could probably qualify, because they clearly tap into cowboy imagery - imagery that has gone global long before the show. I'm pretty sure it's true for most of the non-American viewers.
