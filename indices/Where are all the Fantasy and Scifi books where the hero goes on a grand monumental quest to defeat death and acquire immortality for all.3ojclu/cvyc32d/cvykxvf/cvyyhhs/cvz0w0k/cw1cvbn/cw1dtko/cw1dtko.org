Huh. That's kinda weird, considering the background cities in Equestria are actually named for analogous cities in the USA. Like, /Manehattan/? It's literally one letter away from Manhattan, an actual place where real people live.

Or "Appleoosa", which I think is actually a pun on a part of the American West.
