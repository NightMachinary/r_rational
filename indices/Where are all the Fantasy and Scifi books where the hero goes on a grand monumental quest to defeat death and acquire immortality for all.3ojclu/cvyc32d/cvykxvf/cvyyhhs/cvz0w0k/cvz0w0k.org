Because to anyone who didn't grow up in Middle America, the show is /very obviously/ Middle American, including from the very first episode, in which little miss academic is sent to /go live in Middle America and learn its folk-ways/ as a solution to saving the world.

Still a really endearing show, but I often wonder how they expect to market it anywhere outside the continental USA. And yet, they've gone and done it, so it works somehow.
