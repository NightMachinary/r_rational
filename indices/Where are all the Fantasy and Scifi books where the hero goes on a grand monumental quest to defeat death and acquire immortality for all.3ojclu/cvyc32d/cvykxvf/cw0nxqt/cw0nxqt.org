  It warms my heart that this just seems to be what happens when you put examples and prototypes of immortal life forms who aren't fundamentally broken individuals in front of people and let their imaginations speculate.

I don't think that's true at all. MLP fandom has a lot of immortality stories because of path dependence--that is, by chance, the fandom happened to spread through groups that were attracted to immortality stories and then as the fandom expanded, people used ideas from existing stories.

On Lost Girl, the fae are functionally immortal (both the good guys and bad guys). I don't think it has much of a fandom at all among our crowd, let alone a fandom that actually is about immortality.

(Especially considering the recent storyline where Lauren basically scientifically found a way to become fae and rejected it. The show never said so explicitly, but it is likely she just gave up immortality for no good reason. Why hasn't anyone written a fanfic around this?)
