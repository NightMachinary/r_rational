Distant tangent: I really wish the G. M. Berrow books were more popular so I could see people's thoughts on Daring Do finding the Eternal Flower that grants immortality; giving it up because "no one should have that kind of power" or something (she writes, in a book she's publishing with detailed instructions on how to find it); then, one book later, happily accepting the task of finding it again and using it in order to join a secret club of immortals (who, again, she apparently believes won't mind her exposing them to the world in a popular book).
