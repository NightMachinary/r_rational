Because everything feels too easy. combining every super-power in the world? Good enough to beat a destroyer of continents or planets, but not enough to give true, permanant immortality to everyone- what're you going to do, punch death to death? use supernatural attacks to punch death to revival?

The simplest trick, is death /already/ can be cured, the cure is known in society, but it has a price. maybe it's a certain number of souls. maybe you become irrevokably evil, and exclusively self-interested. maybe it's limited to revival, costs 1 diamond, $3333, and an order of druids tries to kill you if you revive more than three times.

Then the issue is paying the price for everyone who wants it, which is a lot more dramatic, and also easier to justify. death was always possible to avoid, you're trying to cheat the price, now.
