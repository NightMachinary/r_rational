I actually think it's genuinely difficult to write stopping death well. Immortals are comparatively easy (at least, if you want to write them to the fidelity that people will buy into it). But stopping death ... there's a reason that it's in the background of a lot of scifi instead of at the forefront. And even then, it's most often presented as "we want to extend life" rather than "we want to stop death forever", partly because the former is much more palatable than the latter.
