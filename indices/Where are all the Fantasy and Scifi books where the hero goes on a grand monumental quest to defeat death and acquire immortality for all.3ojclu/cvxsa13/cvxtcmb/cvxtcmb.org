Eh, the story I described is basically The Wheel of Time with "Find Immortality" substituted for "Beat the Dark One." The story can stop the moment the hero finds the cure for aging and getting stabbed through the head and the means for mass producing it. No need to go further.

The story is the journey to get that cure, and the sacrifices justified to get it (including, arguably, mass murder, since, you know, they're all going to die anyway, and this way they actually die to save people, to really save people, permanently.)

And how is "find cure for death" something more improbable than "kill planet/universe eating force of pure evil" which is the plot of, like, thousands of books and book series out there?
