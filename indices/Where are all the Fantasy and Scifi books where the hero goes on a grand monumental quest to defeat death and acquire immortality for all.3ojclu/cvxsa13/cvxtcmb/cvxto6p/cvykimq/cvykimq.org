"Impossible" merely requires us to believe that some counterfactual universe has different laws -- it's conditioning on a "meta-level" counterfactual. "Improbable" requires us to believe that the /real/ laws of reality generate something we're pretty damn sure they don't generate -- an "object-level" counterfactual.

So actually, our mental algorithms are, in a certain way, pretty justified in considering the impossible easier than the improbable. Unfortunately, they also make us think metaphysics is a thing. It's an open question how to build a mind using algorithms tuned "ahead of time" to operate under the same complexity and efficiency constraints real humans face /while also/ biasing themselves heavily towards reductionist, physicalist, scientific-style reasoning.
