I wouldn't. It would throw my suspension of disbelief, not that superman's gamebreaking powers don't do it already. Now, If tony stark, doctor doom, or loki cured it i'd be willing to accept it, but superman has the flying brick powerset already, and now you're giving him highly potent tinker powers as well? I get that superman can do it, but i won't accept them giving him all the abilities in the universe, and they generally do just that.
