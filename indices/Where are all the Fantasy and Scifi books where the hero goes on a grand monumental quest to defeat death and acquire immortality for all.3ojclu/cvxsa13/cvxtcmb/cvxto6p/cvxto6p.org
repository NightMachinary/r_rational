  And how is "find cure for death" something more improbable than "kill planet/universe eating force of pure evil" which is the plot of, like, thousands of books and book series out there?

"You can ask the audience to believe the impossible but not the improbable." It's a matter of willing suspension of disbelief. Suspending disbelief about Superman flying through the air like +a bird+ +a plane+ Superman? Easy. Suspending disbelief about a man curing cancer on his own with thirty minutes in a college laboratory? Hard. Yet one is impossible and the other is merely improbable. Call it a quirk of human psychology.
