It is. but those kind of dramas don't really have heroes and sidekicks, don't have mages and heroic journeys, and destroying death will fall into the background with those elements, i expect, just like he complained about happening in hpmor. I should clarify- you can write it, just not in the genre he seems to be talking about.

It might be possible to write it, so please, prove me wrong. write a heroic epic against death that has sidekicks, where wandering the lands is the most viable anti-death tactic, that roughly follows his description.
