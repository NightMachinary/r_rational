Here's to hoping that aging is epigenetic and we can tweak things such that degenerative processes that Josh describes can be overcome.

  Living things are fundamentally homeostatic. They can repair themselves.

In gerontology, there's a term called "homeostenosis" or a decreasing buffer zone of health where progressively smaller incidents may be all it takes to tip an older person over the edge.

I picked stroke, dementia and cancer as examples of structural damage that often disrupts the homeostenotic older person and tips them over the edge into decline. Even more concretely, 1/4-1/5 of people who fall and break a hip die within a year -- an association between a loss of function even if they have surgery and the downward spiral that can happen.

I'd go a step even further in being provocative and say that if we "solve" aging, we solve cancer, dementia, chronic pain, diabetes, organ failure, etc. This makes it incredibly hard for us as readers to comprehend the scope of the goal of the Transhumanist Hero, and even harder to sort through the obstacles in a rationalist fashion even when you hand wave with "magic" or "nanotechnology"... Hard but admirable.
