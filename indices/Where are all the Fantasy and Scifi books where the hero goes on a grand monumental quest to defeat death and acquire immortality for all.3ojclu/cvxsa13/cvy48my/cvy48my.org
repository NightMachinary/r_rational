OP (and many others with similar sentiments) you've simplified a complex problem with the phrase "cure aging" and/or "defeat death." NotAHeroYet is absolutely correct.

In order to accomplish the end goal of "curing aging", there are a number of assumptions that need to be overcome. First of all, aging is a series of collective processes that accumulate over time. Degeneration of joint tissues, irreversible damage to fine structures (kidneys, brain, heart, etc), shortening of telomeres, UV/radiation damage to DNA... I could go on, but the point here is that we label ALL of these things as a part of the Syndrome of Aging. They will require independent novel solutions to "cure aging," not to mention the diseases like strokes, dementia, and cancer.

Second of all, we can "cure" diseases where life is a problem -- we can halt the progression of infectious diseases or surgically remove rumors and treat with (increasingly more targeted) chemo and radiation therapy. (Note how we are "killing" to cure, in the cases of cancer and infections....) But other areas of medicine aren't necessarily "cured" in the same way. As much as we tout advancements like a knee replacement for the elderly, they aren't like the original -- they aren't self-repairing units, so they wear out after 10-15 years of use (and even if we make them more mechanical or advanced, they will still wear down and need routine replacement like a car part.) Stem-cell research to renew our own organs would be a promising mode of research, which transitions to the next point...

Third: society has difficulties with scientific advancements on the cutting edge due to misunderstanding of basic science, distortion of the truth by select lobbies, and even questionable/unethical historical practices. If we are trying to save everyone from death and violence, that should include public health/evidence based solutions like reduction of gun violence, domestic abuse, basic preventive health services and social support for all... and from here, this blows up into an incredibly large problem that all (good or at least aspiring to be good) governments are trying to tackle.

How are you expecting your single sci-fi/fantasy protagonist to tackle this huge nuanced issue without coming off as laughably naive? HPJEV is quite naive about what it will take to save everyone, but he is also trying to be less wrong -- excepting his choice of tutor, of course. The ambitious project Significant Digits does approach the subject in a refreshingly mature way, exploring the political ramifications of trying to preserve everyone through prodigious use of the Philosopher's stone, though, and I love how the story mixes action and the type of plot-sentiment that the OP wants.
