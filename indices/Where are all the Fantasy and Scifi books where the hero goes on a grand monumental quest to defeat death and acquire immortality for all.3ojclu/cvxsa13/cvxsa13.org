The problem is that defeating death is like defeating cancer or world hunger. No one's done it yet, so it feels insensitive to make a story where defeating death is that easy, or even feels that easy. So there are a hundred stories, epics, even, where heroes seek immortality, for themselves or for all, but few, if any, where they win, and even less where they win for everyone. There are stories where the war with death is over, and its 80% beaten or 90% beaten or 99% beaten, but there's still accidents, and it's still possible to kill people, even if they'll never die from age or disease.

Most people either don't believe death can lose, or they don't believe it can win, and the latter half all believe there's something else, or someone else, to catch them. Even in rational-fic, you need to zoom out, because death isn't going to be defeated by one person, or a hundred, or a thousand, working alone. Death won't stop for one person, no matter how fast they run. It won't stop for any one man, and stories are all about 1 man, or 5 women or 100 humans. they're rarely about real populations, and the scale of death-killing is enormous in any mundane setting, the scale of death-killing in a mildly magic setting is high, the scale of death-killing in a highly magic setting is small enough it might work. (Note: harry injures death with a few other's help, though the weapon itself has been around for centuries. increase the power of the setting, and death gets weaker, decrease it and death gets stronger.)

As such, any story of this type needs to be in a setting where magic (or whatever the setting resource is,) is amazingly powerful, if you want death to die. if not, there needs to be some lesser point to stop at. HPMOR stopped at voldemort. With an amazing cure for age itself, a chance of stopping death forever and a prophecy pointed against him, harry has won for now, and that's where the story stops.

Because stopping death permanantly is just... difficult to write well, and i don't know if i'd try, even in a setting where it's doable. I might save thirty, or fifty, but I don't know if i'd try to universaly destroy death. Claiming "...and then science discovered a cure for death" is anti-climatic, and for all that it's a vicious race against death, from a storytelling perspective, it feels like an anti-climax, like the hero was rewarded immortality for everyone as a reward for defeating enough advirsaries. it doesn't matter that he left for it, it feels like giving him rulership of the world in a mideaval setting or complete control over magic in all forms in D&D.

Everyone agrees, deep down inside: If death can be beaten, she won't go down without a fight.
