That was actually an attempt to extrapolate cultural trends.

Not necessarily the easiest thing to do well.

But at a broad sweep consider this. The timeframe in story is long enough for the people who are tumblr-esque politically correct to be in their fifties or sixties and established in various fields.

I could definitely see it needing to be toned down, but I think that will mostly happen anyway as I get more individuals/different backgrounds into play and interacting.
