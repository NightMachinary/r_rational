Mostly I was just aiming for more tolerance, was not really going for terribly high qoutient of social justice. Then again I was also kind of trying to make my own relatively moderate standing on most issues seem kind of 'old man racist' as a contrast... Like I said Projecting cultural trends into the future is hard.

I'd love to hear your break down of what parts seem like they would have been unsustainable to persist into the future if your up for it. I find there is a lot to gain from civil discussion with one's critics then trying to tease critique from those that are already sold on a position.
