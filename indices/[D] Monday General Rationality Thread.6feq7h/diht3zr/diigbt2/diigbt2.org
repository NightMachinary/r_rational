I think your "about me" page on the blog could be presented better, if you want these posts to be taken by the rational community at large. Would perhaps be better to learn more about the authors and the information there about the authors isn't particulary rational (INTJ scores and "dislikes: Republicans" are a red flag to me). Intended to be helpful -- I had never been to your blog and this was my first impression.
