Just read "Until we Build dath ilan" and in an effort to help you out, I'll be blunt. It reads like hero worship. Reminds me of a conservative blog talking about Reagan. Some people don't like Eliezer (he doesn't bother me, but not everyone agrees). And the continual name-drops and references don't really add to the point of the post, in my opinion. The many references to people in the in-group comes off as bubble-like. The sequences are verbose, and not every rationalist reads/retains them.

So basically my advice, (and feel free to ignore it) is:

1) Be as concise as possible. My number one complaint about the sequences is that they are too got'dang long for the points they make. Your audience is smart, make your point and move on. Extended discussion can happen in the comment section.

2) Good references have one of the following two properties:\\
      a) Is subtle, like "We call those who follow the project virtue of Goodness a singer." (if you didn't have the explainer above, this would be a nice subtle reference).\\
      b) Contains necessary info that can not be easily avoided by making the same point in a different way. For example, it's fine to reference [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number][Dunbar's Number]] when talking about max group sizes because it would be more difficult to explain from first principles than it is to just skim the wikipedia page as a refresher. On the other hand, it's more difficult to explain all the background to dath ilan than it is to say "A process that continually brings us closer to utopia through rational optimization."

Reference are shortcuts for people who immediately recognize them, but detours for people who don't. Too many references can easily overload your audience and cause them to give up.

3) Think hard about who you want your audience to be.

"We take a recursive loop through the meta level" seems like its for a much different crowd than the next paragraph that rhetorically asks "What is rationality good for anyways". The intersection of people who understand that first bit, and who need you to answer the second bit is approximately zero. The standard advice would be aim for the lowest common denominator of people /that would be interested in your blog./ Here, that would probably be closer to "EA people," but not necessarily "LW people."

And let's finish off with a couple nitpicks.

It was pointed out by someone here that "Aspiring rationalist" would inevitably become "aspie rationalist." If you aren't familiar, an "aspie" refers to someone with Aspergers.

Wordpress comments are awful for reasons that you probably already know. Linking to a reddit post is better. Maybe try to revive [[/r/RationalistDiaspora][r/RationalistDiaspora]], or even make your own sub, or something?

Even if Eliezer doesn't capitalize "dath ilan" it should be capitalized in the title, cuz it's a title.

Writing is hard and criticizing is easy, so feel free to ignore me if you feel confident. You probably know what you want to do better than me.
