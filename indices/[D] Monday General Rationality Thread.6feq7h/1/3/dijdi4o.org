I really liked "Until we build dath ilan", and that's what makes me think there's something wrong with your plan. Your post make me feel the same way I did when I first uncovered HPMOR and the sequences, I felt like I had stumbled upon some genius idea that I could use to change myself and the world, but in the years since then...I worry I got something fundamentally wrong about the way humans think.

I am, almost exactly, the spiritualist scientist from [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/gv/outside_the_laboratory/][Outside the Laboratory]] and I still feel shame over that because I know my beliefs have no epistemic basis. That's the problem, though. I'm not questioning my beliefs because they're failing to pay rent, I'm doubting myself because I think it's virtuous to be something other than what I am. I came to [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/i4/belief_in_belief/][Belief in Belief]] in rationality because that was the way I thought about it.

I know my case is hardly typical, but I can't help but think that rationality isn't as unique or powerful as I thought it was. It's still useful, I learned so much about critical thinking from EY, but it's not some special truth that holds the key to changing myself and the world around me. I don't think I can become any more rational than I currently am, and if that's true then I don't think we can make humans that much more rational than they currently are.
