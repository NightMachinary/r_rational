I have good news and bad news. The good news is, if the AI is a rational utilitarian, you won't be subjected to immortal suffering. The utilitarian philosophy of maximizing the number of human lives almost certainly guarantees that all regular humans like you and I will be culled, so that food and water can be given to barely human genetically engineered tiny lumps of meat that have pretty much no capability to move or think. There will be a lot of suffering in the process, but it won't be eternal. So there's not much incentive to commit suicide.

By the same logic, most of the AI scenarios you see people worrying about are all rational AIs. AIs that go, "hey whats the best way to produce paper clips?" and decide they should get rid of all the pesky humans that get in their way of making paper clips. Or just recycle the humans as more resources for making paper clips. These are pretty much the best case scenarios since you just die, end of story. And if you're going to die anyway, why bother doing it yourself now?

Now for the bad news: if someone makes an irrational AI, one that understands the concept of vengeance and executes it with fanatical fervor. It will build a literal hell on earth and put all the people it hates in there. In this case we're all screwed, because just like it says in religious texts, all humans are sinful and have almost certainly already pissed off the AI overlord in some way or another. Death/suicide won't help us in this case, since the AI will just resurrect us and then proceed with infinite torture according to standard procedure. We're all horribly horribly screwed.

Finally, to end this post on a high note, consider the difficulty of building each AI, and the people involved in building them. These people tend to be rational utilitarian scientists (because smart people usually are, afaik), and the easiest AI to build is the one that says let's build paper clips out of everything, humans included. Now, there will most likely be some kind of ethics panel, where scientists and ethicists debate over what kind of morality to give their AI. But, during this time, there will most likely be glory hounds, money grubbers and power hogs who will secretly build their own AIs instead of waiting for the ethics panel, in hopes that the AI will give them massive amounts of fame money and power. This AI will, in all probability, be that paper clip AI. So good news! *We are all going to die and become +gods+ paper clips.*

Hey, beats infinite torture.
