Lately I've noticed that when I'm drunk I tend to be /more/ responsible than when sober (including one memorable occasion when I went clubbing, got drunk and immediately got a cab home to work some more on an important assignment). After some more analysis, I think that when I'm intoxicated I'm more likely to do things I know rationally are good decisions but don't really want to.

This extends to other things, like being more sociable/romantically adventurous/open to new ideas that I don't like/etc. I /think/, based on a combination of how I feel when tipsy and what sorts of good decisions I tend to make, that I'm generally too risk-averse (or perhaps not able to correctly envision unlikely but very bad events) when sober, but knowing that hasn't helped me much. The other possibility I considered was that it ties to how much shame I feel around others, and when I'm more uninhibited I'm less concerned with status issues around updating based on new evidence (on a subconscious level), since I don't feel as challenged when people disagree in aggressive ways.

It's not such a vast gap that I think regularly drinking would help me, (especially after factoring in health costs/risk of addiction), but I was wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar and, if so, what other techniques they found helpful in bringing about a similar state?
