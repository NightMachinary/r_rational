By "rational fiction tropes" do you mean tropes which are central to all rational fiction, or tropes which are common in rational fiction?

Basically the story takes place in a world where authoritarian regimes are taking over everywhere due to technologically assisted public deception, while meanwhile the threat of human extinction from x-risks (such as AI gone wrong) is drawing near. There are heavy transhumanist themes but the reader is kinda eased into it and it isn't obnoxiously in their face. The protagonist of part 1 and part 5 is a rationalist. Aside from that I don't want to spoil the story.
