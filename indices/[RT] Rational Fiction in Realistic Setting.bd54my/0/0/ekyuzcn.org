If you are going to talk about how good something is, maybe you should put a link to it?

Edit: On reread, my comment comes off a lot ruder than I meant to be. What I was trying to say is, is there a reason that you aren't including a link to the story with your recommendation? Such as not being ready to post to the Internet or it's going to be a published story?
