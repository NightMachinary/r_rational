I believe that an intended use-case is something like this:

- Gather up a thousand different user profiles.
- Run them through this program.
- Find correlations between these models and another data set (say, those users favorite movies - you should have both if you scraped from Facebook).
- Use those correlations to build a recommendation engine.

For a single user (or a single book), I doubt it's of much use, but assuming that its results have any validity, it would be useful for grouping similar people.
