It doesn't seem very useful for you unless you understand very clearly (on the level of a trained psychologist) the meaning of each personality trait and how they interact. Knowing how your character is being portrayed is a useful thing to know, but how can you actually take advantage of this? The only thing I can think of is to see whose personality is changing in ways you aren't intending, but you seem to be a good enough writer to understand that it's more fun to let your characters do what they want instead of shoehorning them into contrived situations.
