[[http://i.imgur.com/SgSvKVZ.png][Visualization from my last 474 reddit comments.]] I am quite curious how these numbers were arrived at, since some of it seems off to me - I don't trust a 99% in anything.

*General instructions for doing this yourself*

1. Go to [[http://pastebin.com/j1QxzKiR]] and copy-paste that script into notepad++ then save it as "whatever.py".

2. Download Python 2.x from someplace like [[http://www.python.org/getit/releases/2.7/]] and then install it.

3. Run the python file from the command line (see here: [[http://mail.python.org/pipermail/tutor/2004-July/030634.html]]) and input your username.

4. This will create a file called "username".txt (for example, keltranis.txt or I_RAPE_CATS.txt), but might take some time - just let it run until it's done.

5. Now that your comment history is saved as a .txt file, go into Notepad++ and strip out all of the stuff that is not part of your actual commenting. This is the hard part, because you have to learn a bit of the context stuff. This was of great help: [[http://markantoniou.blogspot.com/2008/06/notepad-how-to-use-regular-expressions.html]]

(I use a somewhat different setup now, but if you have some programming knowledge that should be enough to set you on the right path.)
