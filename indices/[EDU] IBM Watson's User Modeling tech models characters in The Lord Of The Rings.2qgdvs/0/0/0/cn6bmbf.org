Yeah, my own script is a little different from what I posted above - that whole chunk is a copy+paste of a process description I wrote nearly three years ago [[http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2011/09/data-mining-my-reddit-comment-history.html][here]], and the pastebin itself was something that was posted to [[/r/TheoryOfReddit]] but whose origins are now lost to me.

I believe the script still stops itself at 40 requests either way though, since I don't believe that there's a way to get past the 1000 comment mark for a user (though I might be wrong on that).
