I actually spoke to him about his novel and whether or not he felt that recent developments in AR and interactive media bore the world envisaged in Rainbows End--he still holds it to be a fairly accurate potential depiction of the future.

In the same vein, but further, I'd recommend reading The Golden Age (if you can stand Galt-esque speeches).
