Yeah, that one. I got through a decent bit of it, and it was actually decent, though I stopped following it for whatever reason.

Then I read fanfic that just straight up copy its mechanics, like the instant dungeons. Though, nowadays, a lot of fanfics are just generic litrpgs.

I'm not entirely sure what's been up with the trend, but thinking back on it, there's no way The Gamer started the trend. It definitely did make it more prominent to some extent, though.
