Second the On Killing recommendation - the author does overstate his point, pulling data primarily from new recruits and extrapolating it to the mean soldier, but its still eye opening and in Joon's case "new recruit" overstating his abilities. His reactions to these situations are utterly normal, and I enjoyed these moments as a sign of good storytelling.
