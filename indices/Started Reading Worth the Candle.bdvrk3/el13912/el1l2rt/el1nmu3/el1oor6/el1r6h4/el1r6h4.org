Been a long time since I read that book. I vaguely remember the assertion that less than 10% of /any/ fighting force prior to 1970 actively worked to harm the enemy. The other 90% are just mostly supporting (covering fire, spotting, reloading, whatever). I disagree with his numbers, but not his overall conclusion.

The conditioning programs implemented after WW2 definitely had a demonstrable effect, though, so this is less true today.
