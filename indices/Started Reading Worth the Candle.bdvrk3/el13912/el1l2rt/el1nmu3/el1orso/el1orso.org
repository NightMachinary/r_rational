I agree that Joon seems unusually quick to adapt to frequent murder (it was my first thought when reading OP's question). I think the game layer conditioning him is a reasonable thought, given how it alters other aspects of his thinking. I also attributed it to Joon having been a hunter who regularly killed and dressed deer and other mammals, though I'm curious if the data (if it exists) would support that hunters would be less squeamish about killing humans.
