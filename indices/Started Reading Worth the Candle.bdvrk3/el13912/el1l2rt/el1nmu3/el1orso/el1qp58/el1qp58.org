Ah, I need to clarify. I wasn't suggesting that the game layer directly changed his brain function.

I meant that a combination of detachment ("clearly none of this is real"), positive reinforcement (orgasmic level up), and the vaguely positive soft language used (coterie "defeated"!) explained how he got into a gaming mentality of death being cheap. Honestly, I thought it was a really cleverly subtle way of justifying his behavior.
