Pre-revolution was actually the most convincing to me. I remember him trotting out various war histories, pointing to times that two armies did the Napoleonic march-n-shoot from point blank range. The record time for those engagements was something like 8 fucking hours. I don't care how inaccurate a musket is, if you fire 480 times and miss a wall of dudes standing 30 feet away every single time - you aren't really trying to hit them.

I don't think he ever gave me a satisfying answer regarding pre-gun history, though.

EDIT: All these numbers are suspect, btw. This is a memory of a book I read about a decade ago.
