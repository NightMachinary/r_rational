What about pre revolution? Seems like most people would be struggling if they can't kill.

Most of our history seems unlikely to me.

I just can't imagine cavemen being broken up about killing neanderthals. One only has to look at the sack of cities after a seine to see that people didn't seem to have a problem with completely optional evil like rape, theft and murder
