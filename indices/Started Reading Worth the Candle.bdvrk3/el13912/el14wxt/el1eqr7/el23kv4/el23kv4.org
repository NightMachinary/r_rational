Even though it's technically a LitRPG, it doesn't feel any other LitRPG. It's like a real world with numbers reflecting that reality, with a bit of added bonus. Compare that to most LitRPGs, where numbers are the real world, and that "bit of added bonus" turns into OP as fuck.

Worth the Candle is /really/ satisfying.
