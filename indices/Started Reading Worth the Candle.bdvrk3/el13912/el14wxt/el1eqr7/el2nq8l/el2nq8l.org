In WtC, LitRPG is just set dressing to frame an opportunity for the author to flex his worldbuilding muscle.

"/Yeah I guess it's a LitRPG, here's a paper thin excuse for the world to exist as it does and some bullshit numbers so that the character can keep involved with the plot. Whatever. Now, let me tell you about frongal legs, memes and the futures value of teleportation items./"

Note, I'm quoting a fever dream I had once, not the actual author.

Point is Wales takes that opportunity. A lot of authors seem to be content with /just/ a LitRPG. Woo. Numbers.
