In Worth the Candle, it usually seems more like numbers are the statistics measuring what reality is. Compare this to most LitRPGs, where the numbers are literal. They're the way the world works.

In WtC, let's say you tried to look at someone's stat sheet, who isn't Jun. You could do it (ie, via essentialism). But you can't really just change someone's number. Or, if you can, that's the game layer abstracting over a ton of info trying to figure out what that person would be like and what it means for that number to be something different.

The point is that those numbers reflect reality, just condensed. Normal statistics. Jun's just has that process going further.

In other LitRPGs, this is not the case. The game layer /is/ reality. There is no fancy set of calculations or anything, that person's number is literally how reality is.

Think of it like this: in games, we can't model everything as complexly as reality, so we simplify things. WtC treats reality as reality, like any good story might. There's just an interface showing some fancy stats. Other LitRPGs is reality literally being as simple as the game. Yeah, putting it like that, it doesn't make sense, but that's why most LitRPGs are bad! They try to treat reality as normal but at the same time they try to treat it as a strange simplified mess, which only works when you can you're playing an actual game to keep that Suspension of Disbelief. Thus, many LitRPGs end up feeling like Crack fics.

Funnily enough, that manhua manga which inspires so much fanfic actually did it pretty well. Reality wasn't that simple, instead there was a super power making things easier.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/shinobi-the-rpg-act-1-naruto-si.36903/][Shinobi: The RPG]] is an interesting LitRPG fic because it tries its hardest to make it a simplified reality for the SI, but a normal reality for everyone else. It's the only fic I know that plays with this aspect.

In any case, my point was that good LitRPGs are like normal stories where reality makes sense and the game layer is just a superpower, rather than fucking with reality to make it more like a game.

I hope this helped. ðŸ˜Š
