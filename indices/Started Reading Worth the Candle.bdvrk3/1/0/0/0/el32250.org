  A lot of authors seem to be content with just a LitRPG. Woo. Numbers.

Don't dies numbers, it can be really enjoyable when done right - it's like "here's a bunch of numbers and mechanics, find a way to break it and then get the payoff of it /actually happening/ when the character does exactly that next chapter!

This requires the character to do the obvious (or not?) exploitation, which requires a certain amount of intelligence/rationality of course.

Think of LitRPG as the logical extension of formalised magic systems.
