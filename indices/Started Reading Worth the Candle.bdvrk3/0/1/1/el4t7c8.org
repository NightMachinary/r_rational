  I just can't imagine cavemen being broken up about killing neanderthals. One only has to look at the sack of cities after a seine to see that people didn't seem to have a problem with completely optional evil like rape, theft and murder

Tribal warfare casualties were quite low actually. Most deaths were likely wound and infection related rather than 'intentional'. They probably didn't feel bad per say, but killing wasn't exactly their goal either.

​

Looting tended to be expected and commanded. Part of the soldiers pay was expected to come from looting, it wasn't exactly random people stealing and stashing things away, more like organized looting ordered by commanders that was later pooled and distributed accordingly. The leaders kept most of it as you'd expect.

​

Mass rape was probably a loud minority type of occurrence rather than a majority participation event.

Lindybeige has a good video on the subject of soldiers shooting to kill.
