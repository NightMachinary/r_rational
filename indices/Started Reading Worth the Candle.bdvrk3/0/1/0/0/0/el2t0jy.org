  I have a hard time believing self preservation and prisoners dilemma wouldn't overcome any niceness.

The winning strategy in iterated prisoner's dilemma is to [[https://ncase.me/trust/][copycat-with-forgiveness]]. I'm pretty sure that strategy is baked into our genes.

We don't have actual metrics for how those line battles went, but I imagine it was something like this:

1. Everyone's happily shooting at the air, nobody's dying
2. Guy on side A is shot (mostly by mistake)
3. All of a sudden, the people next to him on side A are landing more bullets on side B
4. Side B responds, and they suddenly start landing more hits on side A
5. This wave of increased accuracy continues until either people get cycled out of the line, or the natural inaccuracy of musket fire makes people think we're back to the win-win PD equilibrium.
