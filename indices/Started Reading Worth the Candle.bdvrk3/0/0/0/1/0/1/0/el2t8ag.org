obviously the number fluctuates based on how well-trained the individual unit is - elite heavy cavalry (the kind you'd use for charges) probably had close to 90% involvement, a mass of conscripted peasant light infantry was closer to 0%

and even then, the heavy cav probably had about ten guys who tend to be in the back during charges, and mostly earn their keep by dragging the other dudes out while doing suspiciously little fighting of their own.
