I think you underestimate how negatively the average person responds to murder. You might be interested in reading the book "On Killing." An ex-infantryman-turned-psychologist analyzes behavior surrounding death. Interestingly, it was a significant war problem throughout most of our history - he provides a fairly convincing amount of evidence showing that only a small fraction of any given soldiering force prior to the 1970s were actually firing /at/ their enemy. Most gunfight participants in history spent their time firing /near/ their enemies instead. It was a significant problem for generals on both sides of WW1, for example.

Given that, I don't find it hard to believe that being pulled out of math class and facing death might involve some suboptimal behavior. That being said, I suspect Joon is far more brutal than the average person might be when faced with those circumstances.

Joon gets desensitized over time, if that's your main concern.
