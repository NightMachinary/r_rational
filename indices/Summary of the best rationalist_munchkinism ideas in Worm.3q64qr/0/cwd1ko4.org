From memory, so I can't promise these are all accurate:

Jack Slash has the power to extend cutting edges. He teams up with Hookwolf, who can transform into a swarm of metal blades.

Phir Se, who creates portals through time, temporally duplicates photons to make ridiculously massive explosions.

In order to contain one of those explosions, a cape called Dispatch draws Eidolon (whose powers, given time, become whatever powers he needs) into a bubble where time passes really fast. Eidolon uses that time to get an indestructible forcefield power.

Golem, who can make copies of his body parts out of nearby matter, creates a giant hand to serve as a lightning rod.

Oni Lee, who can teleport and make temporary copies of himself as he does so, carries grenades so that he can make suicide bomber clones.

In order to cut at the legs of a gigantic monster called Behemoth, they have a matter-warper named Annex create a gigantic chain which is then "charged" by Foil. Anything Foil charges can cut through anything. The chain is carried through Behemoth by a couple of giant mutant dogs created by a third cape.

Glaistig Uaine absorbs the powers of dead parahumans and creates shades of their original users. She uses a duplicator shade to create a huge number of her strongest attacking shade, Grey Boy.

Chevalier has the power to take similar objects and merge their traits. He uses it to combine a very very large gun-sword with a small and actually-usable gun-sword to get a truly fearsome weapon.
