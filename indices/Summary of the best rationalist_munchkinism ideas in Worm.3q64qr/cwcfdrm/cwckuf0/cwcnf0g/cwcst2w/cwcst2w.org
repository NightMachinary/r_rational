I quit around the fifth endbringer, i think. He's right that most superhero stories have invincible heros, but there needs to be a threat, even if the reader goes 'like you'd really do that'. Civilians are nice, but they don't matter enough to the reader.

now, if the resurection had a side effect- power loss, or degradation, for instance- it actually makes death more plausible, because now they've got a way to lose without the story dying. In that way, resurection can increase tension.
