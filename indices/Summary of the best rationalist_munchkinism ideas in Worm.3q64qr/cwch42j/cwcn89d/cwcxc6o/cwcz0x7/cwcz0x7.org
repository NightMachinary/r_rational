  I question the ability of flying bugs to mass their lift together like that.

I am talking about their ability to support each other and to retain positive lift when their space is being encroached on by the bugs that are so dubiously adding their own lift. I am aware that simple numeric addition of the amounts of bugs Taylor uses would be enough to lift an additively larger weight, I am saying that physically doing so with a condensed mass of bugs is not feasible.
