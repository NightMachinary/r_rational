That's not how reddit works. Subreddits are defined by data, which reddit runs through its page-generation algorithms. Creators of subreddits have no hand in code, though they can add CSS to change the default theme. The "created by" and "a community for" snippets are taken directly from reddit's database of who made which subreddit when.
