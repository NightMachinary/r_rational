Their [[http://www.reddit.com/user/Abydosfan101][profile]] says they've been a Redditor for 7 hours, so certainly this /specific/ account did not create this sub. (Could be the same person with a different account, of course...)

On a related note, the sidebar says "created by centipeed" and "a community for 5 years". Pretty sure the latter is false so I assume the former is also false and the code was just sloppily copied from some other subreddit, but I don't know that for sure. [[/u/eaturbrainz]], [[/u/PeridexisErrant]], you're listed as this sub's mods; care to comment?
