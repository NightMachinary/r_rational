Sticking to the sub's history, I believe it was created and then abandoned by [[/u/centipeed]] about five years ago. [[/u/eaturbrainz]] took it over via [[/r/redditrequest]] in the gap before the last arc of HPMOR, and invited me a co-mod thanks to the [[/r/errantry]] connection.

[[/u/centipeed]] is still active, and will get a username mention from this. If [[/u/Abydosfan101]] is an alt, maybe this could be confirmed?
