That's more-or-less accurate. [[/u/centipeed]] had meant it to be a place for redditors to rationally discuss things, but it had never gotten any attention, so he didn't mind forking it over when I ([[/u/seraphnb]]) asked him for it about a year ago. Actually, probably a bit more than a year -- however long ago [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1ryed3/harry_potter_and_the_methods_of_rationality/][this post]] was. When I decided to try to kick my lingering reddit addiction by deleting [[/u/seraphnb]], I handed it over to [[/u/eaturbrainz]]; idk when he decided to get you involved, but it was quite a while after I left.

Anyway. This is a lot of irrelevant, and not at all the point of my comment. I'm still waiting for a good explanation of why this submission doesn't belong in this sub.
