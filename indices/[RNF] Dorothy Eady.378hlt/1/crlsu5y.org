This does not belong in this sub because it's not fiction. It's a competent scholar who had delusions of reincarnation, but made sure to develop her delusions into plausibility through research and wit.

While the sub name is "rational", the "fiction" is implied.

I mean, it's cool and all. [[/r/todayilearned]] would probably enjoy it.
