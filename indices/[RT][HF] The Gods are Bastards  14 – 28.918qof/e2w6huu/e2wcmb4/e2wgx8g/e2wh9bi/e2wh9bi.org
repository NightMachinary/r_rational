Eh. This is a fairly interesting part of the story, with some important stuff being revealed regarding how the different gods think, sometimes in spite of their cults, and how godhood works regarding their concepts and restraints from the perception of their followers. I don't have a problem with regular posts during this phase. The more filler chapters, I agree, don't require posts.
