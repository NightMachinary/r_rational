I don't remember seeing any other TGaB posts since the one that got me started on it. I don't think this is an issue.

Plus as [[/u/Mountebank]] points out, PGtE gets posted every time, but we /love/ that one :D

It's good to get a reminder of stories that are updating, there's been some that didn't catch me the first time around, so it's handy to see them again.
