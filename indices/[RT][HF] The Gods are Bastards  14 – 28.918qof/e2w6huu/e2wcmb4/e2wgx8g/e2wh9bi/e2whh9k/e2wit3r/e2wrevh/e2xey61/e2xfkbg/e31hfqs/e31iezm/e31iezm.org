If you want to see my reply to your objections of the characters, you should check my reply to your comment on chapter 27, you aren't reading past the plain text, and you are misinterpreting terms like 'brute force', if you have any new objections than please raise them, but I have read your arguments in your past posts and I /fervently/ disagree with you, not just on whether TGAB is Rational, but on your entire opinion of the series, to the point that I wonder if we are reading the same series.
