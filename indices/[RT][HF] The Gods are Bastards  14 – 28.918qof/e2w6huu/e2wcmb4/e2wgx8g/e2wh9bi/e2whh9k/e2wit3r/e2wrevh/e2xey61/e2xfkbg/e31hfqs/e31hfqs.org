See, I don't really think many of these fit. Like one of the big "genre awareness" things is that "this is a deconstruction, and the age of adventures is over, so you can't get anywhere as a lone wolf" or "Fight smarter, not harder," and while both of these are true irl, they're completely false in fic. The character motivations are similarly wrong; for basically eveyr character, the narrative will repeatedly lie about everything about them. Look back through the text if you don't beleive me; when was the last time trissany picked a fight or tried to solve her problems with brute force, as opposed to the narrative claiming she always does? When was the last time toby was an understanding and kind pacifist monk rather than a judgmental militant?

The third point I don't think is a point at all. That's fiction in general, and not necessarily even a good thing there.

As for the last two, I think I'm goign to tie these together. The author often retcons fundamental laws of magic, exposition, and the like as the plot demands. It's at best consistent if you read post retcon, but even then most peoples actions often just don't make any sense under the new paradigm. Sometimes this is a positive, like when they removed the "your minds influence reality at a subatomic layer because observation," but even these still speak to a magic system that isn't really all that thought out (or explained to the readers."
