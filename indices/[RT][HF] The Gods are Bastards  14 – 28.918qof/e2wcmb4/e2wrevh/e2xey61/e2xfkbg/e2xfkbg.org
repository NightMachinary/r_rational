I can see arguments on both sides as reasonable, when I started it I wouldn't have agreed that it was rational, but the same goes for PGTE, as the series continues and more is revealed it takes more and more qualities of the other rational fiction I see here.

Genre awareness.

Explicable and relatable character motivations (at least in hindsight)

Measurable character progression (in both power and personality).

Structured world building.

Well implemented if not entirely understood magic.

The series shows more and more of this as it continues, and what I have seen about this most recent volume (which I haven't read any of yet) it seems to be getting closer and closer.
