I was about to say it'll be a pain finding everyone who leaves, wherever we go in the next age, but then I remembered I already knew pretty much everyone I follow from platforms they had elsewhere---/except/ the porn blogs.

Tumblr had the benefit of being a site without sleazy ads/branding, which was good for friends sharing self-porn and for weird porn to operate without having to feel like an appendage on the vanilla porn machine. I think the only major platform like this now is Twitter, which is a little less optimal as it puts more focus on ThreadMode than DocumentMode so the experience is more about conversation than content.

I'm hoping it'll nudge people more towards self-hosting or the fediverse, so we're not relying so much on single points of failure at the platform level.
