Has anyone seen any good articles/discussion about the ethics of supporting "free" content creators?

My plan has always been that once I get into my chosen career I will donate $1 a month to creators that I've basically chosen as valuable to myself and not currently well supported. If someone is already making hundreds of thousands I don't mind freeloading, as opposed to someone entertaining hundreds or thousands as a hobby I would love to be part of the group that could support them doing it full time if they choose. Unfortunately this arbitrary system doesn't really mesh with my attempts at living more in line with the categorical imperative. I also predict this will benefit me, with those creators advertisements for support making me feel happy about helping them/others as opposed to guilty about not doing so.

​

Would anyone else be willing to share their guidelines for who/how they support creators online? Also what are people's opinions on monthly vs per publication patreons?

​

Side note - Another consideration for me is that I use an adblocker and skip in content ads, so non-direct support from me is minimal even if I was going to pretend that the percents of cents they would get from me was fair compensation.
