That I don't know, and I can't seem to find anyone that has written about it. Anecdotally, it seems that most of the higher rated reviews are by women.

[[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/17/business/women-buy-fiction-in-bulk-and-publishers-take-notice.html][This article]] from '97 has it as much as 80% of fiction books are bought by women! More recent articles has it between 1/4 to 1/3, so that seems to match the ratio of nominees pretty well. Also, [[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/25/readers-prefer-authors-own-sex-goodreads-survey][this other article]] says that people tend to strongly prefer reading books written by their own gender.

After digging a bit more, it seems the complaint is specific to literary fiction, which they claim is heavily biased towards male writers, from reviewers to awards. Now I'm wondering if there is a substantive difference in quality at the very top or if there is in fact discrimination going on.
