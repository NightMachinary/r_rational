Gross incompetence on the part of the admins, or possibly from the corporate overlords of the admins. It seems like the problem that sparked this was child pornography on the platform, which had gone unchecked (or underchecked) for a long, long time, until it finally got them kicked off Apple's app store. Their response to that has gone /way/ too far, and even if they undid the rules change now, they've created so much uncertainty and done so much damage that it seems unlikely that they're going to last as a platform. This is especially the case when a lot of the people that got caught in the crossfire weren't even doing "normal" porn, just regular art. Drive away the content creators, and there's not going to be much left, and once people start leaving, network effects can't prop up the platform anymore.

(I never used tumblr for anything but following a select few people who migrated to that platform instead of somewhere with more sensible/pleasing UI, and even then, not so much, just due to the way that back-and-forth comments get mixed in with interesting top-level posts, so it doesn't affect me at all.)
