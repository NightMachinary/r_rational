Was looking at the [[https://www.goodreads.com/choiceawards/best-books-2018?ref_=pe_2701710_378144660&rto=x_gr_e_nf_gca_2018&utm_campaign=winners&utm_content=more_categories&utm_medium=email&utm_source=choice_awards][2018 goodreads awards]] and I noticed that only 5/21 winners were men(and Steven King won in two categories). I took a quick look at the nominees and the ratio is about the same. Of the 21 categories, only 2 of them had more male nominees. Another 2-3 50/50. Most categories had only around 1/4 - 1/3 men. From looking at past years winners and nominees, it's not a new thing either, though it seems a bit worse this year.

I'm honestly quite surprised. From reading the occasional article I had this perception that women faced discrimination and had a harder time getting published or something along those lines. I remember a big hooha about that a few years ago on [[/r/books][r/books]], articles and anecdotes about women who use initials to hide their gender, or women who get rejected by publishers/agents and then re-submit their manuscripts with male names and get accepted.
