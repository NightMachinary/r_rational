Continuity is on a lot of people's minds because a break in continuity ruins the narrative that everything in the film was in control and part of a vision. This is less "immersion breaking" on the "this shouldn't have happened" level and more immersion breaking on the level of "the director couldn't control this kind of small thing, what else did they accidentally let go?" See Monogatari Series S2 for examples of continuity breaks being used for comedic effect, like this [[https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/11392/why-does-kaiki-keep-changing-shirts][one scene]] where the characters shirts, accessories, and locale all change every cut. (one of my favorite scenes of all time, in any film)
