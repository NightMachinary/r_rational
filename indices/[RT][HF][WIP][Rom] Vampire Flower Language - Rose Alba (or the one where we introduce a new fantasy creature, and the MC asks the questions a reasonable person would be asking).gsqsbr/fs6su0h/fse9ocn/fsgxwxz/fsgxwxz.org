Firstly: yay!!! I'm glad it was obvious enough for someone to get it because none of the characters in the story would have any idea how to explain it in-text (including Julias: I think there's a philosophical concept of "can a fish explain what water is", and I don't think Julias is quite 4D to us the way we are 3D to people in Flatland).

Anything that transforms uses the 4th dimension to do so (e.g. vampire fangs, werewolves), but my physics/maths educated husband 100% assures me that most magic can be achieved using 4 dimensional physics (actually I think it's basically string theory?). But a lot of the magic you see (the trunks/etc being bigger on the inside, the infinite vial of water) can be trivially explained with 4D.
