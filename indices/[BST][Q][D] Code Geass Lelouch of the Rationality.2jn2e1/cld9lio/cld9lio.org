I'm not sure whether you've already seen this, but the wiki has some information on Tokyo, like here: [[http://codegeass.wikia.com/wiki/Tokyo_Settlement]]. It uses Tokyo railroad lines to explain the basic geography so it shouldn't be too hard to compare it to a map of real-life Tokyo and it's railroad maps. Beyond that, I doubt that there's very much information on it. The show was not very specific about these things, especially since the alternate history doesn't really make sense. Even the location of Pendragon in Brittania is not certain, though the wiki says it's somewhere in Arizona. I think it would be okay to just look at real-life maps of Tokyo and make stuff up as long as you're consistent. I would be very interested in a rational Code Geass story as long as Lelouch's personality doesn't change much. The show had its flaws, but the characters aside from Suzaku were the main appeal for me.
