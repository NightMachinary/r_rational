Well, Knightmares don't use video, anyways. But you are corrrect in that it doesn't work via video.

I'm not entirely sure what limitations I'm putting in yet, but that sounds like a good idea. I'm also thinking about making it more specific, as in, Lelouch has to be more specific with his commands. Think programming.

There definitely is stuff to do with Britannians having anti-Geass stuff. For instance, Jeremiah had a thing that could cancel Geass powers. It makes no sense that he was the only person who had this.

I'm intending to make Cornelia and Schneizel the true antagonists of the series, rather than Charles. I'm intending to treat Charles as sort of a crazy puppet ruler that is allowed to follow his own ideas, just as long as they don't mess with everything else. Schneizel actually runs everything.
