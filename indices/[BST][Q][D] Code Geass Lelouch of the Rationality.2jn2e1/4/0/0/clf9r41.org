The Knightmare Frames were originally designed by some guy who had access to REALLY REALLY advanced technology, and then slowly given to various world powers in clandestine ways. They're not the optimal way to wage war, at that level of technology; they're comparable to, say, giving medieval knights access to pistols when you could just as easily give them assault rifles and rocket launchers.

Who this mysterious agent may be, and why he wants everybody piloting humanoid frames, is up to the author. Maybe the guy's just a mecha anime fanboy and happens to have the tools to make his dreams reality.
