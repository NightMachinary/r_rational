That's all very interesting, but unfortunately I have come up with a reason for why they use mechs.

I'll quote something I said further up in this thread:

#+begin_quote
  I'm intending to make Cornelia and Schneizel the true antagonists of the series, rather than Charles. I'm intending to treat Charles as sort of a crazy puppet ruler that is allowed to follow his own ideas, just as long as they don't mess with everything else. Schneizel actually runs everything.
#+end_quote

So, my reasoning is "Charles came up with it, and it proved successful so they continued to go with it." I'm intending to make this from Lloyd's perspective, or possibly Suzaku's perspective, for the most part, so the main change I'm going to have there is that Lloyd came up with the idea of /not/ having incredibly ill-balanced, less-effective things.

Lloyd is going to design a much better mech that makes a lot more sense with the technology that they have available, but which is also more complex to steer. Suzaku, being almost superhuman (yes, I will be explaining why Suzaku was superhuman in the canon), will be able to use this mech.
