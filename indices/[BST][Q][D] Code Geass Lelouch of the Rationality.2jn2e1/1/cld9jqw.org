Lelouch's geass is too powerful. The obvious problem is that he can (metaphorically) wish for more wishes, which any reasonably rational person would do instantly. Particularly since (iirc) his power works on entire crowds at once, possibly through recordings or streaming video. The thing is, even if it /doesn't/ it's still way too powerful.
