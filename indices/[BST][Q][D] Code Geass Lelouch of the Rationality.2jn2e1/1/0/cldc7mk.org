Geass obviously doesn't work via video, otherwise it would be able to affect Viletta in 2nd(?) episode while she were inside Knightmare. Also, Geass has maximum range of about 200 m, as Lelouch figured out a bit later.

About limitations - maybe people under constant Geass (unlike short one) could suffer mental breakdown. This could force Lelouch to be more accurate with his power.

Also, this wasn't explored, but Geass was extensively studied by it's Cult, which had ties with Britania. Thus, there could be safety protocols against potential Geass user (of course, their true meaning isn't known to people outside of Royal Family, and even then only to few).

Also, Lelouch's life could be made MUCH more difficult if Kornelia/Schneizel knew about existance of Geass.
