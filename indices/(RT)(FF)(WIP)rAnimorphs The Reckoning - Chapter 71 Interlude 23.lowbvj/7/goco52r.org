Wow. Loved this interlude, in general love how much of this kind of worldbuilding is present in the story. While it's always linked back to the central conflict, I would not complain if you started writing/posting interludes within the world, without tying them to the main characters. Especially if it's easier to write this stuff when the main chapters are taking longer, I'm not complaining.

Specific thoughts:

He learned to amputate limbs, but there's an absence within his mind about what happens to an amputated soldier. This ties nicely to Alloran's memories I think? How the path prevents lingering thoughts on concepts surrounding disability. It's good stuff

Confirmation that the Kelbrid exist here (their space is where the One does his stuff in canon) which makes me wonder if the visser is approaching ascension in that direction. He already seems to have the howler hive mind puzzle solved to a massive extent, and he seems able to control at least thought speaking species with his thoughts. Garrets thought scream feels like foreshadowing here, and in hindsight the fact that thoughtspeech can have physical effects on brain chemistry should've been enough of a clue to see this. This interlude really hammers home the visser is only around earth at all because the gods care about the animorphs.

In terms of andalite society, I didn't realize the path was this coercive but it makes sense. My reading is that they've been the aggressor in each war or skirmish that was described, but their hive mind makes them forget their culpability. They kind of remind me of the OG howlers, just straight up erasing the memories they don't like. This all fits with what I've seen of their behavior, and it's so nice to understand their point of view.

Re: the blue guy, I notice that I am confused that the avatar looks humanoid to an andalite, and therefore I've probably misunderstood how physically real versus repeatedly spontaneously created he is. I like his classic design and I like having him be recognizable whenever he appears, but that one is a puzzle for me to think on.

I'm also reminded of the old line “an alien says a word as it is dying, and it is not understood” and it makes me think that just as one of the players snuck visser that note with a howler on it, there's a player that is leaving notes all over the place for eventual discovery by any sufficiently large egregore

My current hypothesis continues to be that the game is about controlling the ethical alignment of the inevitable next creature to ascend. Thus these notes, when finally all combined within the visser, will cause ... something to happen? Itd be nice for all the people and galaxies if it was some sort of friendly alignment hack, but that feels too close to magic.

The point is: the visser is on a scavenger hunt, and he just found another piece. And holy shit the giant howler body is badass
