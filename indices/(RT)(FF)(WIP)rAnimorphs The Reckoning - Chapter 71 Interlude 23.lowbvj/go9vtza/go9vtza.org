I remembered to live-comment as I read this time!

"Hmm, what was that other nicknamey, hyphenated adjective that was used to describe young Andalites? Ah well, it'll come to me."

#+begin_quote
  Its skin was blue---darker than Artem's own, at the time, but lighter than that of his father.
#+end_quote

"Oh neat, Andalite fur gets darker as they age. That means-" /a flurry of tiny connections being made/ "Cloud-furred! That was the other adjective for young Andalites. And it was because their fur is so - yes! It all makes sense now! I finally understand!"

  He remembered thinking that perhaps they were /not/ eyes---that perhaps they were windows, portals---that by looking through them, he was seeing beyond the creature, beyond the sky, peering somehow all the way out into the vast expanse where day and night held court together.
#+end_quote

Love this. I'm mostly sure the "starry eyes" thing was there in canon, but they were never described as being more than normal eyeballs that happened to /look/ like that. These little reinterpretations or evolutions of the source material are part of what makes this story so brilliant.

#+begin_quote
  And with that, the creature had shaken its shoulders again, and then turned and walked away
#+end_quote

It - wait, what? Was it /not/ the Ellimist? Was it, like, r!Toomin before he ascended? Was it just a rare Pokemon that the Ellimist based his avatar on? Or was it the Ellimist doing some funky shit as usual? Eyes emoji.

#+begin_quote
  The creature had appeared again three revolutions later
#+end_quote

Gotta be the Ellimist then

#+begin_quote
  ...and this time Artem would have followed for sure, were it not for the fact that...
#+end_quote

Hmm. Choosing to appear specifically at times when Artem is unlikely to follow? Maybe so that he can quietly despawn off-camera without having to conspicuously duck behind a tree or rock or something?

#+begin_quote
  At least the battles tended to be quick and easy, the uprisings confidently, almost casually subdued---

  There was a thread of insight there, but it was gossamer, delicate, insubstantial---hard to see clearly, and even harder to grasp.
#+end_quote

"Look how easily We subdue insurrection. Continue thinking like Us, or it'll be you next." Bruh, are the Andalites /manufacturing fake insurrections/ specifically to communicate this point? If that's happening, that is beyond wack.

#+begin_quote
  But two full cycles passed before he had the ear of an officer of sufficient rank, and that officer was uninterested.
#+end_quote

Had his BRAIN, you mean? What, were you STICK-SPEAKING at him? ;)

#+begin_quote
  And always, there was war itself. War like summer storms, and battles like flashes of lightning within those storms---rare and radiant and ephemeral, slices of time so thin they nearly vanished, compared to the vast stretches between them, and yet somehow those moments outweighed and outshone everything else. Somehow those moments were the story, and all the rest mere contrast.

  There was the Secession of the Seven, in which a coalition of colony worlds somehow suborned the commanders of nine whole fleets, declaring themselves independent of the central government. Artem had captained his own support vessel in that battle, with a crew of four under his command, and had taken orders directly from Alloran himself, after the flagship was destroyed and the young prodigy assumed tactical control.
#+end_quote

And then the next paragraph takes place after Alloran's Fall. Maybe this is just the conspiracy kook in me talking, but is it possible this Secession of the Seven happened after Alloran had already been taken? What are the odds Esplin orchestrated the entire thing - and then, bear with me here, then maybe the Andalite military elites KNEW it had all been a plot, but they didn't bother letting the public in on that minor piece of trivia, because the successful quelling of the Secession furthered their "we will crush all rebellion" brand? Helium did say at some point that Esplin threw the Andalites a couple of easy battles after he took Alloran but before he was found out, and nobody questioned them....

#+begin_quote
  He was even---though it was hard to express, and not something he spoke of openly---he was even proud of his own experience with sedition, for all that it had come to naught.
#+end_quote

Gross gross ew ew I'm allergic to propaganda get it away

#+begin_quote
  And guard them they did---but not from the Naharans. From the /homeworld/, which---shockingly---interpreted news of Calomir's independently negotiated trade agreement with Nahara as an act of rebellion, and sent an armada to seize power from the local governors.
#+end_quote

Yo wtf. The Andalite government is the WORST. Uhhhhh unless this was all Esplin's doing, too?

#+begin_quote
  Alloran had understood---Alloran, whose reforms would eventually tear the weed of rebellion out by its root, Alloran who saw that the root was /insularity/, the once-continuous /eib/ shattered into fragments by the vast distances between worlds.
#+end_quote

So he made them a trillion times MORE insular by confining them all to the mind-meld of the homeworld and shutting out even the slightest chance of a divergent thought. It /is/ Esplin, it has to be. All Esplin, manipulating entire species like little figures on a big warroom table. Jesus.

#+begin_quote
  His only punishment, as it were, was to disband them, distributing them evenly across the twenty remaining fleets, planting each of Gafinilan's veterans in loyalist soil.
#+end_quote

Distribute the branches of independent thought and place them each under the weight of Verified Psychic Patriots. Separate them to snap them like toothpicks, because bundled together, they'd be strong enough to hold.

#+begin_quote
  He rose to tree-stretch, looking up toward the stars with all four eyes---not to the glow of the Great Path, but to the orphans, the outliers---the billions of tiny sparks that stood separate from the stream.
#+end_quote

Wait, is there a literal glowing Path in the sky over the Andalite system? Like a Milky Way thing?

  a flash of blue too narrow to be an Andalite, seen from the corner of his eye as it vanished behind a boulder
#+end_quote

Conspicuously! Its least favorite way to despawn off-camera! I'm telling you!

#+begin_quote
  ‹You have shown so very little interest in thought-speak,› the figure intoned, drawing closer in the starlight. ‹Perhaps because your physiology keeps it contained, stops it spilling over to the rest of your brain, the way it does in other species.›
#+end_quote

I had to jump back to this after finishing the chapter to try and parse it. The Visser took over Artem's mind manually, physically, with a little probe with a "Yeerk" in it - does this mean he's bootstrapping /thought-speak/ to take over (non-Andalite) bodies? That's pretty busted, if so. It's interesting that the /eib/ would keep thought-speak contained like that.

Gorgeous chapter. It's one thing to picture the products of the Visser's machinations on a grand scale, a universe-level scale, but it's a whole different thing to zoom in on it so close and watch how it's guided every step of one person's life. Watching the Visser manipulate Artem is a tragedy; watching the Visser manipulate the galaxy is a statistic.

All the way up to the final, visceral impact the physical Visser himself has on actual Artem in meatspace.

What in the world is he going to learn when he translates the creature's stick-speak five seconds after taking over Artem's head? Was it planted there by the gods /specifically/ in preparation for this moment?

Can't wait for more.
