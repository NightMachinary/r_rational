Eh, Tobias points out in an earlier chapter that by the Visser's nature, if he has a quantum virus (or any powerful tech), he also has designed contingencies for its use against him. Similarly, Visser's first response to the howler hive mind is to design attacks based on hive mind vulnerabilities, and his second response to design countermoves against those attacks being used on his hive mind. Hell, he even designed his new body's skin to resist dracon beams like the one he uses!

So I'd be mildly surprised if he's defeated by a weapon he utilizes.
