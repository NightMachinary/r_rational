It's possible that this line of speculation is silly because God nudges, but... what exactly made the Andalites become intelligent at all, in the first place? In order for intelligence to be selected for, there needs to be an individual fitness advantage. But it seems like the Andalites, unified by thoughtspeak and generally incapable of innovation or independent thought, wouldn't have had large individual fitness advantages to higher intelligence in their ancestral environment (at least, beyond the point where they could support thought speak or where they could be preyed upon reliably by their world's Lion- or wolf-equivalent). Any ideas an intelligent individual came up with would quickly disseminate to the rest of the group, and I don't see the Ancestral Andalites forming separate coalition-of-coalitions and thus needing to become good at politics.

Well, after thinking about it for 5 minutes, there probably would have been selection pressure to be able to generate convincing, self-benefiting memes. “Giving me all the resources is the obvious path” and the like. So insofar as this ability is correlated with improvements in general intelligence, general intelligence will be selected for. In other words, instead of being selected for being likeable or powerful or whatever, ancestral Andalites developed intelligence by selection for the best memelords.

As for mathematical brilliancy, I'm leaning toward God-magic.
