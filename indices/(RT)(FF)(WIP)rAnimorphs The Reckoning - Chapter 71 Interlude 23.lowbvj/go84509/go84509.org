What is going on with the Andalite colonies? Is mental drift due to 'insularity' really enough to explain all those uprisings / attacks by the homeworld on colony worlds? Seems like a colony would be /very/ irrational to rebel given the inevitable consequences.

The Andalites in this fic are such a well done example of the "allied superior species that still lets the humans be the protagonists" trope - see elves and Vulcans. They are so impressive, but at the same time deeply broken in a way that makes it understandable why they aren't even farther ahead by now.
