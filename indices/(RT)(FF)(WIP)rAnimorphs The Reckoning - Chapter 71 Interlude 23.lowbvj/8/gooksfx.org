Great chapter as always.

I might be confused about something, but in chapter 50, Perd√£o says to Helium, as an explanation for why Andalites never invented computers for cryptographic purposes:

#+begin_quote
  But your species was at peace with itself. The eib had unified you.
#+end_quote

While this chapter presents the Andalite civilization as constantly at war with itself until Alloran intervened to unify the eib of various factions of Andalites.

Wouldn't cryptography have come in handy during the constant Andalite civil wars? Or were thought speak communications secure against other Andalites, and not just against external enemies?
