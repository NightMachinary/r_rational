Maybe I am confusing different canons here, but does thought-speak bypass language-barriers?

This section from the previous Marco-chapter (44) would seem to imply no:

#+begin_quote
  And I was now an hour into trying to be the spirit guide for a random group of exactly eight Chinese citizens, only one of whom even spoke enough English to understand my thought-speak
#+end_quote

but at the same time I vaguely recall this not being the case. It has been a while since my previous re-read and I might be mixing it up with the original series so perhaps not. Maybe if the thought-speak involves images rather than words.
