In canon, thought-speak bypasses language barriers, but I couldn't think of a rational reason why this would be so.

In r!Animorphs, thought-speak is still a little magical/under-rationalized. But the gist is:

- Andalites don't use words; they transmit images and impressions and they all share a common "language" there
- Andalites can learn to shape their thought-speak into human words /if/ they know what human words to make, and if they explicitly practice transmitting to human brains. Their implanted translator helps with this; Ax noted suspiciously that his human translator seemed to know more about human languages than it ought, faster than he would have expected, possibly due to Elfangor's previous experiences on Earth or alt-Earth.
- When in morph, the artificial thought-speak mechanism just transmits like to like, so a human generating human-appropriate thoughts has an easy time sending those thoughts to other humans.
- In China, Marco would morph a native Chinese speaker to speak Chinese out loud, or thought-speak in English if he didn't currently have access to a brain that knew the local language.
