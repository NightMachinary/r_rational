A possible version of the history of the universe:

Howlers approach ascension through developing hive mind tech, a player makes a move causing the tech to also destroy individuality, leaving them a dumb god rather than a full player

Pemalites build chee and other tech like goodship , chee approach ascension, a player causes the howlers to arrive just a little too fast (chemical in engine? From early interlude) and the resulting extermination specifically destroys the One Who Is Remembered, preventing ascension, leaving the chee as an enslaved god

Andalites are given computer like minds to prevent ascension, serrow encounters an incredibly complex computer and nearly ascends, some move involving yeerks stops it

Yeerks are poised to take andalite tech and ships, have all of seerow's research, and instead a players move causes visser three to fear/hate the sharing, blocking yeerk ascension

In this chapter, the visser has clearly grown exponentially in influence and range, so what move is going to stop him? He certainly assumes one is coming, and has tried to prepare for it almost obsessively. Was it the collapse of alloran and esplin, that will eventually prove fatal?
