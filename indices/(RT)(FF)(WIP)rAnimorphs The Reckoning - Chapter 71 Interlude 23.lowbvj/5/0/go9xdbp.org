  I had to jump back to this after finishing the chapter to try and parse it. The Visser took over Artem's mind manually, physically, with a little probe with a "Yeerk" in it - does this mean he's bootstrapping thought-speak to take over (non-Andalite) bodies? That's pretty busted, if so. It's interesting that the eib would keep thought-speak contained like that.

He can seize control of someone's muscles using thought-speak---immobilizing them long enough to use the same process he used on the ark pods to spawn a control Yeerk inside their head.

And since every Andalite has earplugs, he's taken to drilling directly into the front of the skull to install the necessary machinery to clone the control Yeerk.

  Watching the Visser manipulate Artem is a tragedy; watching the Visser manipulate the galaxy is a statistic.

Alloran, Esplin. Esplin, Alloran. The actions of Alloran were not the actions of "The Visser" as we know him, but The Visser as we know him is the Steven Universe /fusion/ of Esplin and Alloran.

My personal headcanon here is that Alloran's early experience with the murder of Mertil something like blackpilled him on Andalite society as a whole. He started treating all Andalites as something like dangerous children, to be herded and controlled and channeled, and /never/ to be trusted or to be vulnerable in front of.

For their literal own good (because the alternative was endless pointless war), Alloran reforged Andalite society back into a single unit. But it was "for their own good" like a not-particularly-attentive parent. He wasn't trying to self-actualize his fellow Andalites, because of a combination of seeing their self-actualization as either impossible, or abhorrent-if-successful. He was just trying to get the carnage to stop, and had an attitude that sort of went like "who gives a shit about their beliefs and values, /they don't even give a shit about them themselves,/ it's all lies and signaling, nothing is being lost if I crack down on memetic drift and at least they'll stop curb-stomping each other for literally no reason."

It's no surprise that this mentality a) allowed him to far outstrip his colleagues in strategic and tactical competence, and b) made him unusually resonant with Esplin, who if you'll recall /came into existence knowing that his parents wanted to tear him apart,/ and had three days to figure out how to make that not happen.
