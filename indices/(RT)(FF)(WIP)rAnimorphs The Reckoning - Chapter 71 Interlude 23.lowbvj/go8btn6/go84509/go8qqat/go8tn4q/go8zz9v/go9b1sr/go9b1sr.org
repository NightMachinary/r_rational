Yeah. Adding on to this (the below is spoiler tagged just for people who prefer thinking it through themselves rather than hearing the, uh, author's headcanon):

The key insight imo is that Andalites are /prey animals./

They have the tail blade, and eventually developed intelligence sufficient to outstrip their-planet's-version-of-lions, but think about how deer and squirrels and so forth behave.

Deep within the Andalite psychology is a skittish, paranoid xenophobia that comes from having been preyed upon in the ancestral environment. There was a feedback loop reinforcing "hear noise" ---> "assume ill intent, and defend against it."

Add to that their birdlike flocking---the way they rely on one another for signals about what's safe and what's not safe, the way they cluster together and all move in the same direction---and you get a recipe for very quick "turns."

A bunch of Andalites that separate away from the group fall out of the group consciousness, and quickly become "the other." Given the nascent Andalite tendency to narrativize ambiguous observations as threats, it's super easy to see that they would see weirdness in another Andalite group as threatening and dangerous.

And since groupthink can spread like wildfire, it doesn't take all that many Andalites believing that those-guys-over-there are plotting to kill us all for that to just /become/ the predominant narrative. Everybody believes it because everybody knows it; someone should do something about it.

And so the poor colonists, bewildered, are suddenly smashed with the Fist of God, and even worse---once their territory is occupied and they're surrounded by people who believed they were rebelling, /they themselves/ will tend to buy into the narrative. They won't be fooled about their own individual actions, but they will largely conclude "huh, guess some of my fellow colonists must have been up to some sneaky shit, 'cos /these invading troopers/ sound more and more reasonable and correct the more I listen to them."

This doesn't rule out the occasional /actual/ rebellion, such as the Secession of the Seven, but also actual rebellion is often fueled by the same dynamic! Somebody starts thinking "gosh, the homeworld sure is crushing a lot of colonies for no good reason these days," and that meme becomes locally viral, and "y'know, we should probably like /actually/ get away from this capricious fickle monster that might kill us at any second for no reason at all, like if we're already under threat of being "quashed" maybe we should go ahead and rebel anyway..."
