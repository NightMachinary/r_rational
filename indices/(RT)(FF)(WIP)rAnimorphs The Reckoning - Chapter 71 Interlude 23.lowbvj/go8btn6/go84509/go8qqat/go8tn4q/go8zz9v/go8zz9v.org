While the colony may have started out with very explicit instructions and a clear understanding of what was acceptable to do, if they were separated long enough that the colony would begin to develop its own groupthink as they were exposed to different environments and incentives. Essentially they would just forget the original rules. Imagine if the American Colonies started taxing their own trade routes in 1760 because they needed more money, or doing something else in their interests that undermined England, except their groupthink was so powerful that they /literally convinced themselves that what they were doing was for England./
