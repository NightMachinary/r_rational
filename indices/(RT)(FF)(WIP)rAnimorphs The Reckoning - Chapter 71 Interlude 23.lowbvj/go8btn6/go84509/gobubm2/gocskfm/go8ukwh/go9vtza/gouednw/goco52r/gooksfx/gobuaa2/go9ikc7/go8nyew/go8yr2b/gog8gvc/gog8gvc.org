In the original, wasn't Crayak extragalactic in origin? Though, as I recall, this was in the Ellimist's oversimplified version of their backstories, and I don't recall it being referenced in /Ellimist Chronicles/. It stuck out to me for stating that, at least at that time, there was an entity more powerful than the two of them, but later information suggests this might have stopped being the case after their ascensions to reallity-warper. Also made that Gainax epilogue in the last book seem related somehow.
