That chapter was really good. The description of "The Abomination" extinguishing world after world reminds me of that part in The Expanse where we get the backstory of the Ring Builders and their extermination. I honestly don't really see how the Visser gets defeated at this point barring outright divine intervention if he's ALREADY conquering the Andalites while still contending with Earth. Unless this takes place in the future...

Is there intergalactic travel in this fic, or does everything take place within the Milky Way?
