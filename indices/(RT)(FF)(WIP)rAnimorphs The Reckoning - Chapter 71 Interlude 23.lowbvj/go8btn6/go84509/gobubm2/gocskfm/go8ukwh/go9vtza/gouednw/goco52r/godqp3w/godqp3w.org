  Re: the blue guy, I notice that I am confused that the avatar looks humanoid to an andalite, and therefore I've probably misunderstood how physically real versus repeatedly spontaneously created he is. I like his classic design and I like having him be recognizable whenever he appears, but that one is a puzzle for me to think on.

Since the avatar is (presumably) being used to send a message to the Visser, and Artem is (presumably) being infested after the Big Leeran Group Mind Hug from a couple updates ago, it may be that the avatar was given the same appearance it would use with the Animorphs so that the Visser (who would have those memories at this point) would immediately recognize it.
