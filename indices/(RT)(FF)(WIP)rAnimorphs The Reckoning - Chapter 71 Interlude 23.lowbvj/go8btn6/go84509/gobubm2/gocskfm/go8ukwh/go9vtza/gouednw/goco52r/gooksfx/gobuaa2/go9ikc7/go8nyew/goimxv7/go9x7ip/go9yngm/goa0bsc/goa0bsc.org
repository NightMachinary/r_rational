Yeah that works. Just that I don't feel anyone has anything to atone for. The Yeerk presented it like that, the Andalites refusing to help them into space. Or the aliens that destroyed the bird world? Rachel blowing their cover? The revenge connotation confused me a bit. Also the animorphs get to grow with their challenge. It's not a measure of their pre-crysis character so much. So not really a moral reckoning for all of humanity, outcome determined by random sample of five teenagers.

A lot of stuff gets wrecked and everyone ends up an emotional wreck, though :)
