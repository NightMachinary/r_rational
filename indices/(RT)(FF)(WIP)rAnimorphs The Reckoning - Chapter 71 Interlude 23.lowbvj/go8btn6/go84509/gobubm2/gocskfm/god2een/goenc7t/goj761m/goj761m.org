For the howlers in particular, given their bio-optimization for killing other species, it's possible their origin story could be more like "out of control lab creation" or "military weapon that wiped out their own creators" or something like that? (which all could still be consistent with interference and subtle orchestration by the powers that be) Or if not, then presumably they'd likely need to have further self-modified at various points to get to where they are.
