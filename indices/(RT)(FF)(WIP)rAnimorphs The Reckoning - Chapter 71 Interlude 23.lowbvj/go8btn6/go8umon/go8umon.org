Seems right to me - presumably the Visser will assimilate the memory of the events we've just observed and have a moment of "Oh, the Ellimist was saying the following few sentences in English over and over again!"

Seems like this is maybe a way of making a very subtle move in the Ellimist vs. Crayak game - send a message by communicating it to some totally random guy long before it needed, anticipating that he will get assimilated by the one you're actually trying to communicate with at the right moment.
