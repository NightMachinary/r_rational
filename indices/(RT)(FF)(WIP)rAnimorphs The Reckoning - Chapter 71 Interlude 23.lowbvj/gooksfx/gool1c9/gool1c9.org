That being said, I do find it ironic that in trying to create peace for the Andalites, that Alloran ended completely destroying their ability to innovate.

It seems clear that Alloran was such an effective commander because he distrusted the eib due to his childhood experiences (as revealed in the Jake chapter). Was Elfangor effective because he distrusted the eib as well, due to some formative experience? Or was it primarily due to the time travel/implanted memories nonsense?
