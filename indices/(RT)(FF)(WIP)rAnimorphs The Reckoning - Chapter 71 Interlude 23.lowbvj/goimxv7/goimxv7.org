Yet another fascinating and fantastic look at Andalite culture. Each alien species this story explores is done such great justice, its always worth another chapter, to me, to read one.

If Ellimist is trying to use a "real" infohazard that would probably be cheating, especially now that he's connected all his minds simultaniously. wouldn't be surprised if there's some species out there who /has/ thought speak and thought-about-thought-speak enough to create one, but this is probably just a regular message... That makes me think it's some kind of offer or deal that he wanted to time for after V3 decides to go with the flow.
