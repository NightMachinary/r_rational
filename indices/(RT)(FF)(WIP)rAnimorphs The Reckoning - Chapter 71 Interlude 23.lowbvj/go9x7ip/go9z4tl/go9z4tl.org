So i guess the reckoning is like the endgame between the Eliminist and Crayak. Where they bash all their toys against each other after all the prior setup. Reckoning is like counting the score, but it's sequated with the events that cause the score. Or.... the reckoning of the actions taken in the early game causing the score. A very meta title.
