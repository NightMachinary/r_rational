It's intended to be wordplay.

"A reckoning" in the sense of, like, a reckoning is coming, there will be a day when all of this comes crashing down, atonement, apocalypse.

and "reckoning" in the sense of weighing, calculating, evaluating, measuring.

Trying to be ambiguous between these. It's more rational (more reckoning involved) and darker/scarier (more of a reckoning).
