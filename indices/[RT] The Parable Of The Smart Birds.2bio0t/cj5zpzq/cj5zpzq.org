I'll have to say this is the first time I've seen the word [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable][Parable]] used to describe what is actually a Fable. Usually it's the opposite mistake. From wikipedia:

#+begin_quote
  It differs from a fable in that fables employ animals, plants, inanimate objects, or forces of nature as characters, whereas parables have human characters.
