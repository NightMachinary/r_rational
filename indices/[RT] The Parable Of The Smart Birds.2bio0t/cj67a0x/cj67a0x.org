I fail to see the rationalism in this fable. It seems to be just another example of the fallacy of tradition, written to denegrate people who dare challenge tradition. You could just as easily label the 3 classes happy birds, sad birds, and lazy birds, and use the fable to "teach" that trying to cure depression with change, or improving efficiency is bad for you.
