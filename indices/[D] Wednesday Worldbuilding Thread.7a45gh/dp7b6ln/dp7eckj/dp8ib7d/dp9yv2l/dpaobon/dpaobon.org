This does make sense. When people have their needs taken care of they often create work for themselves to stave off boredom, though I have trouble seeing the benefits of restricting local teleportation and telepathy when that means people can physically restrain others and couldn't call for help.

My original motive with this idea is to rationalize visually surreal adventures like anime from Studio Trigger. Space is a malleable construct and the right code can do anything so things get weird fast. Criminals use illegal code to break the rules and the police can warp reality to stop them.

The problem is that there seem to be logical safety features for users that altruistic admins would include that make it difficult to create narrative tension in traditional ways. I dislike the trope of characters having their fantastic abilities taken away, so I need to explain why people wouldn't have them to begin with.

I could put this idea into Eclipse Phase, which has interesting potential conflicts in a setting where everyone's brain is always connected to the internet, but it treats simulations as if they're just like reality with customizable physics without going into detail about how specific rules can work or why they are put into place.
