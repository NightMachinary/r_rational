This is the best suggestion I've heard, but I have trouble buying into the idea of artificial scarcity. I guess having the characters live in an unjust social order makes for good stories, but it's hard not to view this society as one that explicitly believes that an economic underclass should exist or people should be denied access to information when resources are not actually limited. As much as I fear living in Brave New World, this scenario makes me think of a Objectivist-flavored 1984 where people revere “hard work” for its own sake and that's used to rationalize power over others.
