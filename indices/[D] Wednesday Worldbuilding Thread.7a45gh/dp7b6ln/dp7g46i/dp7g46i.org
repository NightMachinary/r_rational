You're wondering why simulations are so limiting compared to what's possible? Basically, a life without limitations fucks with human-level psyches too much. The first sim they made was a glorious paradise with every environment imaginable, complete user control, and a instant communication system that ran off of the registry - everything we thought people would want. But all of these things led to problems.

Sims with instant travel quickly develop two user patterns. The first group of people jump around for the first couple weeks, soaking up experiences they never had before, then they get homesick and go somewhere like home. After that, they don't actually travel again - the potential to go anywhere at any time is more rewarding than actually going. The other group of people /never/ settle down. They jump day to day or even faster, always worried that there's some amazing experience they're not getting, and their stress levels are through the roof.

Both of these patterns cause problems with a human's need for social interactions. Much like how minority groups in meatspace want to be part of their community in contrast to the majority, uploads want to be part of an upload community. Obviously they don't mind interacting with the real world or with AI, but it's not as satisfying long-term. So the nomads are obviously lacking on those long-term relationships - sure they get buddies who are in Point A and also going to Point B, but then one person wants to go to C and someone else wants to go to G and they split and rejoin again, but they can't break their patterns long enough to form long-term companionship /even though/ they can contact each other at any time. There's no physicality.

Meanwhile, the people who settle down form communities just like you see in meatspace. Except they can teleport at any time and contact each other at any time. Stalking and harassment go through the roof and privacy plummets. People start mass-blocking each other or hiding in their personal user spaces like prisoners. They become ghosts, bound to one place and unable to interact with anyone around them. The folks who get the hell out of these collapsing communities either become really miserable nomads or try to settle somewhere that hasn't undergone that same collapse yet - often destabilizing the social circles and /causing/ its collapse.

By this point, huge swathes of the population are miserable (not everyone, of course - never /everyone/). A few of the clever ones try to bring the whole thing crashing down with them, and they typically do it by spawning as much memory-consuming crap as they can. They never succeed, of course, but they can stress out local areas of a simulation.

So these days, sims avoid all that. There might be teleportation options, but they're set locations. Travel inherently takes time and often requires traveling intervening spaces. This cuts down on nomads, who now have incentive to slow down and enjoy things because few people want to spend their whole life on a train or what have you, and cuts down on the inherent reward enough that the settlers actually need to go places to really enjoy the potential of the sim. You also ensure that you can have private spaces in common areas, instead of having to worry about some creep always finding you. Conjuring is usually limited to special places as well, to cut down on griefers and keep the sim a little simpler and cheaper. And communication is designed around meat analogs, like post or phones. This way the users aren't overwhelmed and it's harder to harass each other. Happiness is /way/ higher with all of these adjustments made.
