Try thinking about the physical constraints of the simulation environment. Suppose the environment is a matryoshka brain of some sort. Communication from one side to another could take quite some time (dependent on radius). If uploads experience an accelerated existence relative to meat-forms, the delay could be significant. One might actually have to "travel" to get to interesting places.

Or you might think beyond the simulation environment. Instead of sending meat-people to distant stars, they might send uploads. Someone has to go, right?

You probably aren't welcome on every random server you might find.

You'd have to imagine it, and define it first. Then again, what is an item to a sim? A subroutine that does something?
