How about etiquette?

Let's assume the world is broken up into realms. Each realm has some curators who are responsible for the look-and-feel of the place.

This week, /s/rational is set up like a fantasy pub. There's heavy wood tables, a surly bartender, and NPCs glowering at us from corners. We decide to drop in.

  Teleport Anywhere
#+end_quote

We teleport into /s/rational. When we do, we end up in an "entryway" / "cloakroom." The door has a "parchment" with the sim's rules tacked on it. One of the standard rules is that we're supposed to wear theme-appropriate costumes.

You point out that my Zardoz outfit, while extremely accurate, doesn't quite meet the theme. So, we summon appropriate costumes and go in to look for the normal Wednesday group.

The /s/rational mods are pretty chill, so the code doesn't actually prevent teleportation within the simulation. In practice, teleportation is seen as pretty obnoxious. It's similar to slipping into a friend's house without knocking. You might be welcome, but no one wants someone appearing behind them when they're watching the TV.

Other simulations are stricter. Using teleportation in /s/EarthPorn is like using a bike in the Chicago Marathon. You could probably do it. But anyone who notices is going to be pissed. And you're going to get banned.

  Conjure Items
#+end_quote

You're welcome to conjure anything you want when you're in your personal sandbox. But these private sandboxes look like eclectic piles of junk. We picked /s/rational because we like theme. And so we're not supposed to summon things unless they're thematically appropriate.

Again, some sims are stricter than others. You could summon a Chevrolet Camaro in the middle of someone's Renaissance sim. But it would be about as popular as bringing your own boombox to a jazz bar. You might get away with it for a couple minutes. But everyone's going to be annoyed, and you'll get kicked.

Some curators probably use an AutoMod variant to manage bans. So, being obnoxious in one sim might get you kicked from a bunch of others, too.

  Contact Anything
#+end_quote

This is the easiest one. You can send anyone a message. But they might not see it for a while.

It's extremely rude to check "invisible" messages when you're near people. Doing that conveys that they're so boring that you'd rather play minesweeper than talk to them. And, it makes them suspect that you're not really paying attention in any future interaction.

The easiest thing is to just turn off all messages until I'm ready to read them in bulk.
