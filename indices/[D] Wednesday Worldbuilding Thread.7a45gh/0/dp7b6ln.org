I think the life of uploads in a simulation provides great potential for storytelling, but I have yet to find a justification for why everyone wouldn't have the ability to teleport anywhere, conjure items, and contact anyone the majority of the time. Is there a way to place this restriction on the setting without making it take place in a school or prison of some kind?

EDIT: I finally figured out how to explain it after posting the same question on [[/r/eclipsephase][r/eclipsephase]] as an example of what could happen in the setting: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/eclipsephase/comments/7akt8t/advice_for_simulspace_habitat/dpbl1iqhttps://www.reddit.com/r/eclipsephase/comments/7akt8t/advice_for_simulspace_habitat/dpbl1iq]]
