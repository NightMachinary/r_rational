Latency. Interacting with people not on your local server cluster means delays, which will matter a lot more if you are in a virtuality. Imagine all your reflexes and responses having different timings to them depending who you are talking to in a gathering? Easy to ignore if you are text chatting, not so easy to ignore for full-fidelity sex or "Medieval Melee Tourney Reenactment society 4000"\\
This applies in spades if the clockrate is high, tough I would not expect it to be if the people inside interact with the non-uploaded much.

Also, information security. If you live in the cloud, malware is not a joke, so it is entirely possible moving from one server to another involves an extremely exaustive review of the code that is you.

Also, dedicated game-worlds within the upload community will as a matter of course have entirely arbitrary restrictions.
