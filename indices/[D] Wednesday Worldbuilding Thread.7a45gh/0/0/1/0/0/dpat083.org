  Anyone who sees nonconsensual control over other people as a desirable state of affairs, aside from as punishment, has a mental illness that prevents then from feeling empathy.

I think you are significantly underestimating the amount of people who evaluate and cherish their privileges (e.g. the amount of wealth, political power, etc) only because they are able to see those privileges in the frame of reference made out of the relevant poverty and suffering of others. I don't know where to look for accurate data for proving either of us wrong on this though.

  I don't get the appeal of the casino restrictions when people can go anywhere else for the same experience without restrictions.

That was the point of the first quoted paragraph in my previous comment: in a utopian society where almost everything is abundant for everyone, the lack of restrictions itself becomes a restriction for those who value it for one reason or another. If you treat the limitation of resources as a resource itself, then this newly-defined kind of resource becomes very scarce in a post-utopian society (especially in one where various human rights are guaranteed), and whoever has demand for it will only become more desperate in “getting” it for themselves.
