I don't get the appeal of the casino restrictions when people can go anywhere else for the same experience without restrictions. I guess it makes sense as a temporary indulgence, but why would anyone want to indulge in “corruption” instead of just being decadent in private? Anyone who sees nonconsensual control over other people as a desirable state of affairs, aside from as punishment, has a mental illness that prevents then from feeling empathy.
