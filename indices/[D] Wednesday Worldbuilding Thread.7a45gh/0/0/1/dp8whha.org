  Born before the Change he and his friends crafted a vision of how the casino experience could be perpetuated in a world where anybody could have anything just for asking.

  Their answer was simplicity itself; their casinos are their worlds and while you are visiting them you can't have anything you want from Prime Intellect. You must buy everything with Bugsies. It is naturally considered a great privilege to live in such an environment for any length of time. There were of course other casinos; you could even have Prime Intellect build you one just for asking, but that didn't mean you could get people to visit.

  Orville Piazza was the biggest, most corpulently unhealthful and all around ugly person I'd ever met. My own people eschew what the elders call "big magic" but most of us slow and eventually stop our ageing. Some of us will get a little older and then regress, a few even back to adolescence. But why would anyone allow themselves to get fat, slovenly, balding, and have badly aligned stained teeth? Much less smoke cigars, when there were much more efficient and pleasant means of self-stimulation?

  "You are shocked at my appearance," he said, and while his voice scolded his eyes twinkled.

  "It's a bit startling. Is there a reason?"

  "My own rules, Galan. Casinos are about decadence and corruption. I have never liked casino hosts with perfect smiles and measured patter. I want a man who will gamble with me. Come, let me show you around."
