Well, I've sucked the joy out of more than a few games by cheating at them. Single player web games especially are generally very easy to cheat at, and in my experience, that robs them of their entertainment value faster than anything else. It's not so much about valuing hard work by itself, it's that hard work brings meaning to acquisition, relationships, and experiences, in a way that just typing in a console command does not (and I say this as someone who has typed in a lot of console commands in my time).

That's not to say that scarcity within the simulation has to be like scarcity in real life. You could, for example, establish a baseline of living (and/or information) that people would get for "free". Things can be "scarce" without being zero-sum, and you could structure rewards such that they're /only/ valuable because they were worked for, meaning that if I gave you a diamond that I trawled through a cave and fought off zombies for, you would just be getting a worthless chunk of carbon, while I still had the bragging rights and lived experience.

My guess is that without any restrictions on the simulation, a fair number of people would do this on their own, because people /like/ the meaning that effort brings to things. People playing videogames will often set restrictions for themselves like "no fast travel" or "no magic" /even in the absence of the game acknowledging that/.
