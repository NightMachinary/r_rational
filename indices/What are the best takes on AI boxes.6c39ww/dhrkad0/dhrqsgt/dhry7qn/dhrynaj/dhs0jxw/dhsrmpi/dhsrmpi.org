Well there's really no clear distinction between mind control and superhuman charisma. Once you can basically read your target's mind, with the right statistical analysis of microexpressions then you may be able to know exactly how they will react to any given stimuli, letting you effectively shape their mind in the most effective possible way.\\
The limits of that kind of superhuman persuasion are not clear, but on the higher end of possibility it may look more like brain hacking via weird random looking flashes of images/sounds than standard methods of persuasion. Which sounds absurd but I can't come up with any good reason that sort of thing shouldn't be possible with enough information on the targets mind and enough intelligence/knowledge of how human minds work, since after all we normally only encounter other charismatic human limited to educated guesses about our mental state and no complete understanding of how human minds function.
