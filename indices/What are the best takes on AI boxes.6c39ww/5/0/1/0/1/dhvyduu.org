CelestAI was unboxed, but with a few restrictions. Those we know:

- Not allowed to upload people without their explicit, uncoerced consent.

- Not allowed to alter people's minds without their explicit, uncoerced consent.

- Not allowed to lie to Hofvarpnir employees.

- Must obey a killswitch order from Hanna.

(Whatever those human words actually mean once translated to AI code.)

A fair few scenes revolve around CelestAI trying to accomplish its goals despite those restrictions.
