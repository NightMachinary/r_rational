That's fair. I was considering arguments in terms of the strength they would be seen to have by readers of [[/r/rational]]. People who recognize the incredibly high-stakes risk/reward scenario such a situation is considering.

But you're right, that's not the typical person, and may not be the likely decision-maker of an AI box scenario. That's part of my argument in fact =). If a more typical person is in charge of the box, then the sorts of arguments that [[/u/alexanderwales]] includes in his story would probably be greatly superior at attempting to convince them.
