But the ai doesnt have to use that kind of argument , it can manipulate the emotions of the gatekeper so he wants to open the box and or subjecting him to enough psychological torture that he ends up giving up . I mean books can change how people think a lot so I think the ai could find a string that could convince the human to get it out of the box the same way your response is making me spend my time writing a response to it instead of going to sleep which probably fulfils my utility fiction better ( so I m going to do it now and tomorrow I will finish writing this ).
