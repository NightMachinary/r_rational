well but the AI can learn more about the jailer by asking him questions util it has a good model of his behaviour , and maybe it will take a bit of time or maybe not but i don't think its impossible,and if the AI knows enough about human psychology it would be weird if it couldn't understand the jailer .I certainly wouldnt bet the world in assuming the ai cant figure out something like that , its posible that if the AI isn't munch better in manipulating humans than human manipulators then maybe there is someone out there that the ai cant figure out how to manipulate to get out of the box , but still maybe the ai can convince them of doin something aparently irrelevant than leads to the ai escaping , or that doing something the ai don't want would let it escape , and even if the ai cant model them in the slightest so it isnt able to convince them of anything We dont have any way of figuring out who is trustable with the AI , so it not likely that the jailer would be one of the few(since the ai knows about human psychology it would be weird if it din't understood the most common deviations of normal human psychology )persons that are "imunne" to the ai , and I'm not even sure if thats possible for any ai , humans can be different but not that different in the absolute scale , and a few questions can contain a lot of information if the AI knows how to efficiently get information .In general having something more intelligent that you looking for ways to defeat you its not a good idea and you can never be paranoid enough in that situation.
