I'm finding it to be fairly well-written (typos aside), with interesting characters and an intriguing post-post-apocalyptic world. Additionally, the main theme of the story seems to be the pursuit of immortality, cast in a pleasantly positive light.

The plot is slow-moving, but compelling nonetheless.
