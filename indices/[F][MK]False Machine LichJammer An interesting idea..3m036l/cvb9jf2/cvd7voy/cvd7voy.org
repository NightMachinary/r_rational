  Corpses would be expensive, you'd need to trade with planetbound civilisations for them (or just attack).

Dang. You're giving me ideas here. Undead space-wizards traveling through the solar system, but the world is regularly raided by liches who are gathering more corpses, either for themselves or to sell to others. You still have accidents out in the void and need to reinforce your crew, after all, but Earth is the only livable planet at this time.
