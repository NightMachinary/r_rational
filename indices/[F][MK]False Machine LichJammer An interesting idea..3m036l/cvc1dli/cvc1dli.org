Reminds me of a writeup I helped with once for an alternate interpretation of the Elemental Plane of Negative Energy. The entire plane is nothingness except for little bubbles of other planes intruding in: the stars are little bubbles of the other planes shining lights in the infinite darkness. Subjective gravity: "[[http://dungeons.wikia.com/wiki/Book_of_Elements_%283.5e_Sourcebook%29/Environments_of_the_Inner_Planes#Negative_Energy_Plane][The directions to Neverland (Third star on the left, and straight on 'til morning) are completely reasonable directions, and represent another planar bubble that is about 2 million kilometers away.]]". Things that die to negative energy turn into undead: space is full of zombies. By those things combined: "[[http://dungeons.wikia.com/wiki/Book_of_Elements_%283.5e_Sourcebook%29/High_Adventure_on_the_Inner_Planes#High_Adventure_in_._._._The_Negative_Energy_Plane.21][However, these places are also constantly under assault by a low level rain of zombies from space.]] That's not a joke, undead beasts literally float around in the void and choose to fall towards points of light. [...] No matter how deeply you've written yourself into a corner, all your problems can be solved, or at least delayed, by an invasion of space zombies."
