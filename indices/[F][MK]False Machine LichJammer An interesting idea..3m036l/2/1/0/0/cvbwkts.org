I was figuring just using a steam rocket. The mass is mostly for propellant. Also ice is about as good as steel in the outer solar system and definitely as good when going interstellar. Essentially create water can with enough time and caster levels make most vessels invincible super massive and also accelerate to arbitrary high speed. Essentially the lowest level clerical lich with a thousand years on its hands can probably punch a hole in the moon.
