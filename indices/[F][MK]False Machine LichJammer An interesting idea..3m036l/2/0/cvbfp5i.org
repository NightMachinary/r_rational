The captains of these ships are liches though. They might be propelling their ships through the void via their own personal magic, whether they consume a fuel to do so or simply cast a spell that rearranges energy to create propulsion. There might be mundane ships captained by lesser undead acting as a lich's vassal fleet, but incapacitating a lichship would ultimately require slaying its master.
