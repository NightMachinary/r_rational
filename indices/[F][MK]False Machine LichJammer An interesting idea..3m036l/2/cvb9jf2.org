In space, it's hard to replenish your crew and raw materials. Any kind of matter-creation magic would be very useful. Dunno if this role-playing engine has anything that qualifies.

If there is nothing, well. Corpses would be expensive, you'd need to trade with planetbound civilisations for them (or just attack). Magic is plentiful and asteroid mining is easy, so I expect golems would be cheaper than skeletons. Maybe there are angels and weird superbeasts roaming the void that you can hunt for raw materials.

How are ships propelled? Solar sails were mentioned, but other options exist. If you destroy an enemy's engine, they'll drift helplessly in orbit until someone comes to rescue or kill them. That might be the best way to incapacitate an attacker and loot their stuff.

Edit: I forgot to mention, I think this is incredibly cool. There's something about a setting which is explicitly our Earth yet near-exclusively populated by undead, angels, and aliens, which makes it familiar yet very far from a generic fantasy setting.
