I suspect the author just thought "oh, you don't need to account for the arc of gravity and you can just aim straight and hit anything by lining it up in your sights!"

Now Ive only read about orbital mechanics from a few fiction books by Neal Stephenson, as well as completing some orientation modules on Kerbal, but I think the gravity wells of space make aiming something MUCH HARDER in space at relative distances compared to the gravity well of earth.
