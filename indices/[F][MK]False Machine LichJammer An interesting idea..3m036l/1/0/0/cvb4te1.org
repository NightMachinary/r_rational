Hmmm, yeah that bit I don't agree with either. honestly rockets or some kind of none-inertia transferring telekinesis would probably be better for ranged.

If by arrows they just mean ballistic shards accelerated at speed by some manner, preferably combined with the acceleration of your lichjammer directly towards your opponent's lichjammer.

Well at those parameters interplanetary speeds kitty litter can be pretty effective. So saying arrows are surprisingly effective is kind of a misnomer.
