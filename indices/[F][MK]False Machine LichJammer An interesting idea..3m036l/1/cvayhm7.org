I have to question as to why the author thinks that massed arrow fire would be at all effective in space over incredible distances against skeletons, there are so many problems with that.

Likewise I dunno about LotFP but I don't see why a Lich can't deal with anything with magic rather than resorting to using ostensibly mêlée fighter types, being undead is handy in space but if you lose the ship when you jump from one to another you are infinitely fucked.
