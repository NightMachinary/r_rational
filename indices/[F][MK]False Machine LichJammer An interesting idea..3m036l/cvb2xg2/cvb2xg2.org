Maybe the initial ships would be wood, but I assume liches would soon enough harness hollowed out asteroids or similar celestial bodies as ships and mobile bases.

Also, at the ridiculous magic power levels mentioned in the post, liches would be operating at dimension shattering levels of power, while melee would struggle to keep up without similar levels of power on their side: the trope of quadratic wizards, linear fighters at full force. More likely, all beings would be intensely magical in terms of abilities and nature down to their core, and would rely on unique counterspelling powers to maintain combat viability against each other.
