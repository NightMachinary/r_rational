  Ruling is tiring but I'm sure that's not all Cat does and even if it is, it's still much better than war.

Cat's not a very peaceful person in the first place, and scrambling for funds for a few months while preparing for a war where she isn't really on either side. Add to that small stressors and reminders like the standoff at the Vales and having to drop everything she was doing once a month to put down heroes, and she had more or less been living with a deadline that was reached in this chapter. Not the best representation for those few months, but a good /conclusion/.

Besides, most of her friends are in the legions preparing for the same war, Masego is scrying himself blind in his room, Thief is wandering around as usual, Archer was said to be sent out on missions like fishing for artifacts in Liesse, and Catherine had essentially exiled Amadeus. Even if she has more actual allies, her contact with them is less regular now.
