  Without those extra chapters to establish a fun and relaxed tone of peace, the war doesn't have the same impact.

Well, it wasn't particularly fun and relaxed for Catherine. Yes, she has actuall allies now, but she has to simultaneously rebuild and remove the ways the Empress can pressure her through. She arguably had it easier running the Ruling Council, despite being less powerful and knowledgeable back then, simply by the amount of things that require her attention and investment.

My point is, it's perfectly fine to timeskip the most of rebuilding and political maneuvering by demonstrating an explained sample of said rebuilding and political maneuvering.
