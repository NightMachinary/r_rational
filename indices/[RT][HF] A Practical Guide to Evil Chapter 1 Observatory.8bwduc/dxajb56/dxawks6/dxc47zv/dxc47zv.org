While the "The Empress has a lot of spare gold if she wants to devaluate" explanation is simpler, I really hope the coin do have some sort of Evil magic tied to them. That would be so awesome.

At the very least, maybe they have some kind of tracker that allows the Empress to know who owns how much of her coin at any moment?
