  But who can't prevent people to simply discriminate older and newer coins?
#+end_quote

Malicia can have the new coins exchanged for old ones at fixed rate in the major cities of Wasteland, and so mint most of them anew quickly enough. Add to that the possibility of loaning money in new coin to the nobles who are buying up grain in Callow, and it'll flood the market quickly enough for the fortunes to shake. Remember, the goal wouldn't be the monetary reform itself, but the effect on Callow's trade.

  Or neighbor rulers to re-mint those coins?
#+end_quote

The only neighbor ruler who has such an opportunity and an inclination to do so is Catherine' and as a formal citizen to the Empire she's technically still subject to its laws, which likely to have gruesome punishments for those who meddle in the imperial currency.

The main issue is that one side has reserves of gold and precious gems for a rainy day, while the other is already minting coin at its maximum capacity to overtake the markets. If Empress starts changing the amount of gold in her coinage now, she can shake everyone else something fierce.
