I was questioning what can a ruler possibly do to her own currency to undermine neighbor's economy. The center of my argument was, you can't change metal content without traders *soon realize it* and adjust price accordingly. 50% to 49% gold/silver content might dupe traders for quite a while, but what that small (?) percentage can possibly do in, say, a year time? During which neighbors can retaliate or naturally adapt.

  Malicia can have the new coins exchanged for old ones at fixed rate in the major cities of Wasteland.

Won't this raise suspicion? Even then, why would people exchange their old coin to the new one if that means they lose wealth? What ruler can do is buying old coinage while issuing new one. Secretly, if they wish to profit from the process. Ruler can enforce fixed nominal exchange, but that should have political ramification, hurting Wasteland economy, and ultimately defeating the initial purpose of undermining neighbor's economy due to information leak. Loan to nobles is possible avenue to hasten the process, nevertheless, situation described on my first paragraph prevail.

Indeed, discrimination is easier response. Traders from Callow or Free Cities can just say, "You can buy my goods at ... (Praesi Gold) or ... if you pay with old coins." I suggested re-mint due to convenience. When considerable amount of time has passed and maintaining that discrimination become a hassle, rulers of Free Cities (not Callow, if Callow still under Praes' rule) can melt their old Praesi Gold to issue their own coinage. Callowan ruler can strategically dump those risky coins to Free Cities to avoid problems.

My thesis: (1) Ruler can devalue their own currency, but people will know and act accordingly to protect their wealth. Damage may be incurred during the process, but damage will be widespread, not localized in just one geographical area. (2) Ruler can devalue their own currency *and* successfully doing so without people knowing due to Creation Law shenanigan, but all that achieved is profit. If everybody don't know, economy isn't affected.
