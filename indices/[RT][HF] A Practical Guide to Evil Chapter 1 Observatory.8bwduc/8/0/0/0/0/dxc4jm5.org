Maybe Imperial coins are an ad-hoc currency, worth more than the metal they're made of, and backed by gold stored directly in the Tower?

The chapter does explain that Black specifically worked to make Callow economically dependent on the Tower, and making them use currency the Tower can easily devaluate might be part of that.
