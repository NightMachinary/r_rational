  I was questioning what can a ruler possibly do to her own currency to undermine neighbor's economy.

You could do this in a modern economy. You print money, reducing the value of your own currency, but the new money goes directly into your economy so you just have inflation. Meanwhile, your money in the neighbor's country decreases in value the same amount without receiving new money to compensate.

But I agree that this doesn't really work in this setting, since money is made of precious metals. You can't effect the value of the gold in one coin vs the gold in another, and most of the tricks you could pull just mean more work for moneychangers. You could do a bit more by exercising your legal authority (banning certain coins, fixing exchange rates, banning re-minting), but that only actually extends as far as you can enforce.
