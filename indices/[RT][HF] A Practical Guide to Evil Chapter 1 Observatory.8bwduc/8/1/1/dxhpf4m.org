Oh I used Merkantilism economic model or something of earlier era to understand the stuff, so I think I'm pretty solid in my approach. But hey, I've spent some time about how can magic make that possible, I came to remember this Malicia sentiment on how she's willing to sacrifice a lot of people to inflict damage to her opponent. Something about willingness to sacrifice three times of 100 thousand casualty of 2nd Liesse.

It would be a shame if author use magic approach, but it's consistent with story so far, so it's more than acceptable, if so he choose.
