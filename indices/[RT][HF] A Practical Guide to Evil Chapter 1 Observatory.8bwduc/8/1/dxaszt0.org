Don't think about it too much, think "magic".

Yes, it wouldn't really work that way as described.

Economic models have some issues even at the best of times because they work with many assumptions that aren't exactly true. Throwing models that work with assumptions that are only reasonably close to reality in modern times at a medieval society is bound to fail.

The believe that money equals goods is one of the foundations why modern economy works, but it's not a lot more than just a believe, an illusion.

If you are starving, an apple is worth more than a mountain of gold. If you are freezing, a few logs of wood to burn are worth more than a handful of diamonds. If you have a hundred thousand people living in your country that are busy farming and building things, more gold will not make them build faster. Money doesn't make apples, money doesn't create buildings. Neither can it create or destroy gold.

As you noticed, there's little that the Empress can do to actually devalue the coins, other than reducing the scarcity that those coins are based on. Would apply equally to coins Callow mints though.

In the end, it doesn't matter that much. It's a story, it uses modern world economics even if it doesn't make that much sense.
