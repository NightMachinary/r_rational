  “So long as nearly half the coinage in Callow is from the Imperial Mint, the Tower can break the realm's coffers at will,” Ratface said.

I actually don't get this part. Do rulers of Guideverse dictate each and every goods' price? Do rulers agree on exchange rate used for trade? I am in understanding of Guidverse use precious metal for currency. People determine price by comparing goods' value against those metal on day to day basis.

To devalue coinage, ruler must reduce precious metal content. But who can't prevent people to simply discriminate older and newer coins? Or neighbor rulers to re-mint those coins? If Guideverse economy is not dissimilar to Mercantilism, availability of currency is more important than which currency in circulation.
