I'm kind of sad we're getting straight into the invasion.

I was hoping to have more chapters of down time: Cat ruling Callow and dealing with all the politics, economics and armies, resolving disputes etc. It would be awesome to see how all the characters are dealing with their new position or take a moment to reflect on where they're going - what they've gained and what they can lose.

This chapter does a good job of sketching out the situation but it's not enough. We have enough to get an idea of how peace time looks like but not enough to /feel/ it. Without those extra chapters to establish a fun and relaxed tone of peace, the war doesn't have the same impact.

I liked the chapter, I just think there should be four more of them along a similar vain. Also, if you're reading this EE, the chapter isn't showing up in the Table of Contents.
