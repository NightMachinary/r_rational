Sitting in a room making royal decrees sure is a lot more relaxing than sending thousands to die and fighting for your life. Ruling is tiring but I'm sure that's not all Cat does and even if it is, it's still much better than war. The problem is that there's not enough time dedicated to peace to make us feel like it.

Imagine if we have four more chapters of Cat doing her own thing. We see her reflect on how far she's come and how resilient her people are. We see her talking to Baroness Kendall about their plans for Callow, making jokes with the Woe about Hakram being a gossip Queen, sparring (and flirting) with Archer. We see the respect she has for the army assembled by Juniper and in turn, we see their respect of her. It's complicated, messy and she's constantly busy but it's also /nice/.

Then, when the message comes and the war starts, it would feel like a punch in the gut. Besides, having more focus on Cat ruling would also show that the previous wars were worth it and could serve as a justification for her position.
