  with Aisha's network of kinsmen in Praes

I like how nonchalant the narration is with Cat having a network of Praesi spies loyal directly to her lieutenant, but I also hope they get explored more.

What kind of people are these spies? Are they just regular Praesi people who just took "spy" as a nine-to-five job, and happen to be on Aisha's payroll? Are they super unreliable and treacherous and prone to be infiltrated by rival factions like Akua's and the Empress's? Or are they ideologues, people who think "Under Aisha's guidance, we're moving away from a shitty culture and working with the likes of Lord Black and Lady Squire to make a better world!"? Or is it more of a feudal thing, where Aisha has noble families vassal/indebted to hers, and spies working for these families, and the relationship is more like "I've worked for Lord X and his family all my life, and so did my father, and his father before him, etc; we keep serving them and they've been good to us in return"?
