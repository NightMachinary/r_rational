The thing with Fadila has little to do with counter-heroic security. Catherine is a Winter Fae of royal rank now, wards and thresholds are hard obstacles for her even when they are designed to let her pass. And considering those specific wards are made to keep out a Winter Fae of formerly-royal rank (namely, Larat), there's only so much that can be done to accomodate Catherine's passage.

Heroes can probably get in easily anyway. I doubt Thief would bother asking for permission and Archer would try to trespass even if explicitly invited to enter.
