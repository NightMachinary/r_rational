I really hope she doesn't betray Catherine. Like, she's been /exceptionally/ spared after working for a notable mass-murderer, while her companions were gruesomely killed. She has nowhere to go, her ex-boss is dead, her homeland is in a bloody civil war, and she currently has a cushy job with responsibilities and relatively low odds of dying horribly.

At that point, she's in a better position than anyone else who worked for Akua (hello Gallowborne 2.0), and she knows that Cat doesn't fuck around with Praesi machinations. If she plots against Cat, I'm going to seriously wonder if the story is trying to say that Praesi have a curse stopping them from wanting self-preservation.
