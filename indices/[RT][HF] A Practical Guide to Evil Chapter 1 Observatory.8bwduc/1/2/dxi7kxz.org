Except that you can't retroactively devalue gold and silver coin. You can start making new debased coin with less gold in it, but that wouldn't reduce the value of the old good coin (and might increase its value).

Instant devaluing of an entire money supply can only happen in fiat money systems. This is, in fact, exactly why fiat money was invented: so that governments could do exactly that.
