  Good. If they were here, they might try to stop me.
#+end_quote

Oh no. Ana, what are you doing?

  Akhara's Gate crackled before me. A strange, twisted artifact that even Grace didn't understand. That killed nineteen of every twenty that tried to shape it with their minds. My life was disposable. With Hira's codes and passwords, Tasia could easily take my place as Tunnel Vision.
#+end_quote

Ana, /no/. Bad Ana. Step away from the suicide gate!

Holy shit, I didn't realize from the earlier text that she was down that bad. Though in retrospect I guess she got hit by a lot at once.

  I pulled a pen and notebook from my bag, ripped out a page, and scribbled a note on it, then dropped it on the floor. Tasia and Hira would find it later. They would be heartbroken, but they would understand.

  I'm sorry. I stepped forward, towards the portal.
#+end_quote

Holy shit. This is... wow.

Side note, this chapter /definitely/ needs a trigger warning.

  He made a calculation. Decided that it was less dangerous to betray his new bosses, steal their submarine, and pawn it off for a fat stack of cash. Stabbing us in the back was more profitable, and less risky than diving head-first into Shenten.
#+end_quote

Yup. Same thing Tattletale discovered.

The main problem with hiring cutthroat mercenaries after killing their former boss is that eventually, they'll decide it's time to betray you too.

  /The crew doesn't have guns./ My stomach sank. The Vice-Captain must have smuggled some on. Or stolen one of Hira's. Which meant he could slaughter the rest of the crew with impunity.

  The gunshots grew closer, louder. I slid down the metal wall, my vision growing more blurry, and the cracks seemed to echo in the distance, like I was watching the world through a dark, foggy tunnel. My lungs pumped, frantic, to no avail.
#+end_quote

See, this is what I meant earlier. Apparently, the crew is loyal enough to Tunnel Vision to rush a guy with a shotgun with nothing but their bare hands and a prayer, and die to the last man saving her.

If they're self-interested mercenaries, shouldn't they have ran away once they realized the captain had a gun?

#+begin_quote
  The man made of Voidsteel bowed to me, and smiled. His mouth opened, and he spoke with a light Nekean accent.

  “Anabelle Gage,” he said, his voice soft. “A pleasure to meet you.”
#+end_quote

Well...

Hum...

Okay. That's new.
