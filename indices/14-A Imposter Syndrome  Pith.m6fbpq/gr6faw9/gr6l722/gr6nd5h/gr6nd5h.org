If there's no one in charge, that's a power vacuum. Someone will rise to fill that void. And Paragon is fighting a war and sending its best overseas. They're going to be stretched thin on the home front, and they don't have the technology for monitoring everyone. Plus, their crackdowns are going to drive more people into extremism. Not to mention there are now a bunch of disenfranchised people of Shenti descent who have no job/stability and hate the Principality for turning on them.
