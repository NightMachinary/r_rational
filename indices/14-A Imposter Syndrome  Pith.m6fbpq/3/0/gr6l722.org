There's no power vacuum. Paragon is the queen bitch in town, and they're cracking down /hard/. Even before Ana dismantled "her" criminal enterprises, all her people were running scared from the Guardians. No one's going to fight a gang war when Paragon is arresting and mindfucking anyone that looks vaguely suspicious, especially when the public is cheering on the rising authoritarianism due to the one-two punch of Commonplace's failure and the looming war with the Shenti.

Don't get me wrong, there will still be crime, but there won't be wealthy mobsters throwing their weight around and warring with their rivals. Oppressive authoritarian regimes tend to have that effect.
