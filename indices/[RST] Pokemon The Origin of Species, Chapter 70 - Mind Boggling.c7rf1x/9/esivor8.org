Alright I'm mixed up a little, what's the psychic ruleset on mind manipulation? Here's my vague understanding:

- Psychics can passively read surface emotions, very strong psychics can read surface thoughts. This does or doesn't require some level of merge?
- They can "merge" with minds to get a much deeper picture, though this is still pretty shallow.
- Red is unique in that he can... copy and retain the emotional state afterwards? Or can anyone do that and he's just particually good at it?
- Psychics can hard block mindreading (shield), though this requires some degree of conscious effort?
- Are shields more or less perfect, or can stronger psychics try to break them?
- Non-psychics can have some degree of imperfect defense, with training.
- They can't project "false" thoughts and feelings, they need to be feeling what they want to put out to some degree. This allows a fair amount of trust between psychics, and if Mewtwo's method could be replicated it'd be a cultural upheaval.
- They can quarantine memories and thought patterns (partitions), and give themselves amnesia by partitioning the memory of them partitioning.

Anything way off there?
