  Psychics can passively read surface emotions, very strong psychics can read surface thoughts. This does or doesn't require some level of merge?
#+end_quote

Never surface thoughts without a merge, but no merge needed for emotions or mood with sufficient skill and ability. How much can be gleaned comes down to psychic's training/practice and innate mind-reading capabilities.

#+begin_quote
  They can "merge" with minds to get a much deeper picture, though this is still pretty shallow.
#+end_quote

It can be very deep, depending on the practitioner, but yes for most psychics it's not like flipping through a book, it's still just current thoughts/emotions with more intricacy and detail.

#+begin_quote
  Red is unique in that he can... copy and retain the emotional state afterwards? Or can anyone do that and he's just particually good at it?
#+end_quote

Yes, he can perfectly mirror the mental state that he's felt through merger, and with practice retain it afterward and switch to it as needed. Some others can do something similar, but not nearly as well.

#+begin_quote
  Psychics can hard block mindreading (shield), though this requires some degree of conscious effort? Are shields more or less perfect, or can stronger psychics try to break them?
#+end_quote

Yep, and there are levels of strength to the shield, though it's less about brute mental strength as much as finesse and creativity in finding ways to get around it or find a weak spot.

#+begin_quote
  Non-psychics can have some degree of imperfect defense, with training.
#+end_quote

Correct, mostly by redirecting their thoughts or focusing on something hard enough that it's all that gets sensed.

#+begin_quote
  They can't project "false" thoughts and feelings, they need to be feeling what they want to put out to some degree. This allows a fair amount of trust between psychics, and if Mewtwo's method could be replicated it'd be a cultural upheaval.
#+end_quote

Correct, this is included with mergers in general, not just projection, which is about explicitly sending emotions/thoughts out.

#+begin_quote
  They can quarantine memories and thought patterns (partitions), and give themselves amnesia by partitioning the memory of them partitioning.
#+end_quote

Correct.
