Ghost types are my fave and I love how you portrayed them. Makes me want to see a Mimikyu in this fic haha. Presumably the cloth would not be hard to look at. But as the ingame dex entry says, looking under it is likely to drive you insane and lead to extreme aphasia.

I really like that you had other characters explain why they dont like Red much because its kinda the same feelings I have. Having it pointed out will hopefully help him overcome that and grow.

I very much hope he can resolve the partition situation soon and be a mix of both. Putting the partition back up all the time seems to be a mistake to me... growing used to it being down and working through your issues slowly until he can get his ambitions back the old fashioned way with depression treatment has got to best route. Red is looking for a hotfix that doesnt work on the human mind and its only going to get worse. Its already negatively affecting his decisions and thought processes so im not sure how he continues to justify putting it off. The folly of a 12 year old I guess.
