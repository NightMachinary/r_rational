It interesting to me to see Red flawed in ways that are neither small, inconsequential character quirks or overwrought, tragic and crippling. He's got his view on the world which is incomplete and he uses as a crutch when examining new ideas, but he's come to rely on it precisely because it's generally better than anything else he's come across.

He doesn't always understand and click with other people (and the psychics seem particularly standoffish) and is cutely forthright in his attempts to bridge that gap. I feel like in a lot of stories we'd be repeatedly told that Red is bad at socializing and communicating, and then he'd try and make friends and say things that immediately bond people to him and we'd ride off into the sunset. It's nice to see him repeatedly try "I feel like you don't like me. Why not?" and actually get rebuffed.
