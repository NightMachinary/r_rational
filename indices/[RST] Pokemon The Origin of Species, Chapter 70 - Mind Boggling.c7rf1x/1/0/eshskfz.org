It is good to see him try and get friends. If you don't try, you won't get anything after all. And good for him to actually try to understand others perspectives instead of trying to "correct" them which would be too adversarial.

However he's really not that socially suave perhaps due to his age. He looks a bit try-hard as expected since he doesn't have that much experience in that regard. He comes of as a value drain to others. He should have made small talk with them more, and then invite them for a coffee or something instead of knocking on their doors and be like "I feel like you don't like me. Why not?". Value can also mean providing good conversation as well, he doesn't necessarily have to be top dog in terms of psychic prowess.

Props to the author for creating such nuance.
