I appreciated the treatment of faith in this chapter. I'll differ from Jason, though, and assert that it's not necessary to believe that things are /unknowable/. For myself, at least, it's more an acceptance that there are things we don't understand, like FTL travel, or in this case the nature of Ghost Pokemon, and maybe we'll figure them out or maybe we won't, trying to work them out is good, but even if we don't succeed, I can be content. Traveling to the stars would be wonderful, but there's no "wormhole drive or bust." The priority, rather, is how we treat each other. Trite perhaps, but true. Better a society powered by the golden rule than by cold fusion.
