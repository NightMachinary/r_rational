I imagine all of this ghost knowledge and epistimology about the mind will be very relevant to Red's journey as a psychic and a researcher, it just is setting groundwork for it without immediate payoff.

I think once you have the whole story, chapters like this will be great build up. It's because we are reading it serially that we get frustrated with the wait. And tbf, you can write for the method, make every chapter be a ride. But I won't fault some one for writing with the final product in mind

(Though this is def why say Worth the Candle releases chapters in chunks)
