I finally get the Sabina Gym training I've been waiting for, along with a surprising dose of how this universe handles Ghosts. Now I'm /much/ more interested in the latter. Excellent update! As much as I enjoy the Endbringer-like Legendary Birds or the various battles and characters, if the entire story was in the vein of this update I'd be equally interested.

I like how he's attempting to make friends, even if in a calculated and systemic matter. Aside from just the social benefits, the different perspectives will be useful in his learning process and training. Reminds me vaguely of Naming lessons in Rothfuss's "Kingkiller Chronicle", but with a teacher who is upfront in her intent and a bit more hands-off, subtly encouraging them to work together. Both seem oriented toward opening up understanding of the subconscious through changes in perspective.

Interesting tidbits, which surprisingly were all about the Ghosts:

- I'm wondering if the Ghosts are similar to the old theory about the Ghastly/Haunter/Gengar line. Namely, that the creature is from another reality (with vastly different natural laws) that slowly extends into ours. Gastly being it peering through and sticking a small amount of its essence through, Haunter being about halfway through, and Gengar is it having pushed all the way into our reality.
- This somewhat makes sense for things like Oricorio and Jellicent and Robinhoot (Decidueye), it's just going in the other direction, a creature from Red's reality using or extending itself and its abilities through the adjacent one that Ghosts are 'native' to. Jellicent uses it offensively in the form of 'draining life energy', as an alternative to using physical poisons like true jellyfish. Decidueye uses it in an offensive manner as well, sliding partially into an alternate dimension to avoid attacks, sneak up on foes, and as a direct method of attack by shooting the 'shadow' of its target. They might not cause the 'surrealism' effect unless they are using their abilities in some way, or simply because they are more than just the Ghost type.. but then Gastly wouldn't be as bad. Unless that's tied to its emotion...
- I wonder if our perceptions of them are backward. If they are from another reality, then the way their minds work might be as alien. In Red's reality, emotions follow from the mind. Structured and orderly minds have emotions that are responses to experience and stimuli. But perhaps the reality of the Ghosts is different, and as opposed to the mind creating the emotion, the mind is *based on* the emotion. The emotion itself is the building blocks of their mind, in which case each Ghost would have a 'prime emotion' that defines its existence. It's entire thought process might seem completely alien simply because everything is based around that concept. This would make it almost impossible to understand Ghosts fully as a whole, as each one would be a different 'kind' of mind based on an emotional state.
- Symbolically, Lampent being Fire type as well is tied to the emotion of hunger. Metaphorically, fire is the /hunger that can never be sated/. Whether Lampent is an incarnation of the emotion of hunger and thus has the Fire type or whether it is hungry because of the Fire type itself is up for debate, assuming any of this is right at all.
