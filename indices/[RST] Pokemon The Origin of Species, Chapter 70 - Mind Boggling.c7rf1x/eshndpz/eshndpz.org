Yep, gotta admit, the scene with Jason was great, and Ghost Pokemon are genuinely fascinating as you've portrayed them. Do seem to be by far the most interesting type of Pokemon. And the fact that Jason isn't strawmanned despite his fundamental opposition to a major aspect of Rationality is another point in your favor, it brings to mind Methods!Dumbledore a little bit.

Though I gotta agree that, despite the great scene that I'm glad I got to see, there wasn't much plot progression. These are all new characters that you're attempting to get us familiar with, and there is quite a lot of them.
