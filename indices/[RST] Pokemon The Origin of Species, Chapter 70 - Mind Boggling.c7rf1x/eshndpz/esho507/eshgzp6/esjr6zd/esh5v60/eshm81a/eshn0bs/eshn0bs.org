Idea: it's actually the other way around.

Originally it evolved as a distinctive pattern naturally, only appearing to a human as a skull and crossbones due to the same reason we see faces everywhere. Then, the humans used the koffing and weezing symbol to mark poisonous substances because it was an instantly recognisable symbol from a poison type, and thus a symbol recognisable by people no matter their language or literacy. Which is very useful for warning symbols.

I should make sure to say that this is just a theory/idea, and the in-universe reason in the fic might be entirely different.
