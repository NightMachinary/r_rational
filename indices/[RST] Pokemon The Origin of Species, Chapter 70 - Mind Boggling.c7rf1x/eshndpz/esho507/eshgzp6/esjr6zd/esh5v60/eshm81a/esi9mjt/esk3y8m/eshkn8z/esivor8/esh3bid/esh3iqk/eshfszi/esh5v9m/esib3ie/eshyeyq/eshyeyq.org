I just checked the map: directly west of saffron is, in order: celadon, viridian, mt silver.

A little time on Google tells me you can see mountains on the horizon about 160 km away (100 miles), a good example being the view of the rockies from Fort Morgan, CO. They don't dominate the sky at this distance, but rather just barely visible.

I don't actuary know tyre distances between any of the places in tohjo though, so this may be hyperbole.
