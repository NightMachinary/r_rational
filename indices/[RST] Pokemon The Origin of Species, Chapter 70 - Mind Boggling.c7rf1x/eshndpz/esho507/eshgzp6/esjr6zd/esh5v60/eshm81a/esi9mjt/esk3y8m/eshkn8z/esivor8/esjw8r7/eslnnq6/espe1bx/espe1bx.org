  Ah, so do Pokemon have trouble breaking human shields or are they just "powerful" enough to brute force it?
#+end_quote

Psychic pokemon are way, way more powerful than humans in virtually every way, but their "finesse" is terrible, so human shields can stand strong against virtually all of them. Ghost pokemon, on the other hand, don't giveafuq.

  Ha, funny Red has that ability when he's... not exactly a social/empathy butterfly.

I definitely see it as a "dissect this state of mind down to its constituent parts and then rebuild it" sort of thing :)

  Though they'd have the memory of creating that secondary partition, correct? So they'd know they've used amnesia and roughly when, and could unpack it by breaking down the secondary partition and then breaking down the newly remembered regular partition. Although that'd be like "Hey let's remember all the shit I wanted to forget at once!" which is probbbbably inadvisable.

Yeah, there are basically two layers to partitions that are needed for it to be amnesia, but there is no "true amnesia" where you permanently lose the memory other than over time through natural memory degradation.

(Memories + Partition X, some idea of what Partition X is about)

(Memories + Partition X (which is of Partition Y), no idea what partition Y is about)

So right now Red has a partition for his emotional reaction to the deaths of Aiko and his dad, but it's only one partition, so he knows what it is and more-or-less what's behind it. If he were to make a second partition enclosing all that, he would actually forget it all until that partition goes down.
