  Yep, and there are levels of strength to the shield, though it's less about brute mental strength as much as finesse and creativity in finding ways to get around it or find a weak spot.

Though they'd have the memory of creating that secondary partition, correct? So they'd know they've used amnesia and roughly when, and /could/ unpack it by breaking down the secondary partition and then breaking down the newly remembered regular partition. Although that'd be like "Hey let's remember all the shit I wanted to forget at once!" which is probbbbably inadvisable.
