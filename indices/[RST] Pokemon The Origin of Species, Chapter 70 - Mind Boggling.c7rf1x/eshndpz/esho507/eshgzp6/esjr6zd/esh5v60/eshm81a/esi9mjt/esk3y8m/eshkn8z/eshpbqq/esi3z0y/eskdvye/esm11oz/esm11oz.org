Honestly, I don't mind slow chapters? While it's not as “I could read a chapter of just this every month for the rest of my life and die satisfied” as the journey/city chapters with the trio traveling together, I'm still happy to be able to spread the story out instead of seeing it try to always be moving forward. Pretty much every chapter brings something fun and interesting to the table, and i feel like it'd lose something if the story tried to focus too much on always advancing the plot instead of just... /being./
