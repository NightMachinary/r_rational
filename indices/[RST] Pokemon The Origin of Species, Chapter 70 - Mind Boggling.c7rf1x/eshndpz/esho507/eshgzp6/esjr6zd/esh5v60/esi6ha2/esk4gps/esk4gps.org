Satori is based on [[https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Satori_Komeiji][Satori Komeji]], and her [[https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Torracat_(Pok%C3%A9mon)][Torracat]] is presumably based on her pet cat [[https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Rin_Kaenbyou][Orin]]. Torracat matches her color scheme, and the fact that she lives in hell and has a habit of stealing corpses makes me think it's a good match.

I'm guessing she also has a [[https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Murkrow_(Pok%C3%A9mon)][Murkrow]] based on [[https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Utsuho_Reiuji][Okuu]].
