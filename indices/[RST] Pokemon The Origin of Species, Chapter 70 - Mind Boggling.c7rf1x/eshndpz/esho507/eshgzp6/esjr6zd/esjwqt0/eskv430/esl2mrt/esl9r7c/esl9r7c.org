You are, of course, correct about the nature of the game universe, but in this one, those are almost certainly mere legends, based on what Aiko says (Chapter 48): "Magic like [bringing back the dead] isn't real. Celebi, if it exists, probably doesn't actually travel in time. Jirachi can't grant wishes."

I expect more of the author than to introduce elements like time travel (I know there's teleportation, but it could be subluminal) and parallel dimensions, and if he did, I'd be disappointed. One of the things I love about the setting is its immersivity, which the game universe doesn't really aim for, and while some mystery is, of course, perfectly fine, those would certainly break it.

In any case, I think you've misunderstood my use of the razor. Your two ideas, alternate realities and alien minds, can be made independent, and if one only wants the latter, as I do, one don't need to conjecture the former.
