That razor's a bit dull.

You /do/ realize the Pok√©mon games are /built upon/ a multiverse model, yes? Each game is a separate universe. And I don't mean each game release, but /each person's individual playthrough of any game/. Within each of those universes are time travelling mon that can change the future, creatures which can both bend and /create/ time and space, creatures both native to /and imprisoned in/ alternate dimensions, mon that can travel between dimensions at will by running through wormholes, and world's linked to the original that follow vastly different natural laws but are still populated with mon. "Ghost essence" being from a slightly offset reality isn't exactly a hard sell, here.

Ultimately, it's not your or my job to decide how /this/ particular reality works--that's the job of the author. But the plausibility of it isn't nearly as far fetched as you would like to believe, and psychic powers may not explain absolutely everything 'weird' in the setting.

Or, you know, maybe they do. Who knows? Certainly not us. /Yet/.
