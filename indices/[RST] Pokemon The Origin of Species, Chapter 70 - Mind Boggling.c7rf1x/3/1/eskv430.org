  If they are from another reality, then the way their minds work might be as alien.

Occam's razor. Their minds being alien is an independent idea, and an excellent one, particularly the fire/hunger connection, but there's no need to introduce realities with different physical laws since poorly-understood psychic powers already exist, and all observed effects could be variants of those.
