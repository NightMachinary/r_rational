"Red, you cant *force* friendship, it has to happen organically" "Hold my max potion" - this chapter.

â€‹

Not many thoughts this time, I did like though that this one *didnt* end in "oh my god this seemingly-unrelated encounter taught me *just what I needed to solve the puzzle*". Rat fics often use that trope, and you should sometimes, but it can get predictable and feel unjustified if everything keeps slotting in nicely for intellectual revelation. Sometimes you learn something that only maybe sortof helps a little bit! It makes the insights, when they are discovered, feel a lot more earned when there is more to the struggle.
