Interesting--so gastly forces aphasia on anyone who looks at it? I think what just happened was that Red was seeing a Gastly as we know it, but was unable to match the shapes of its face with the words "eyes, mouth, fangs, tongue."

The lampent seemed to just be a little jarring to look at, like when you see someone in a pane of glass and you can't figure out if it's a mirror or not. I don't think it had the same dissociative effect that gastly had. So, surrealism is different from pokemon to pokemon--which makes sense, given that its whole thing is "a phenomenon that defies explanation."

Very cool, I love seeing how different kinds of pokemon are realized in this world.
