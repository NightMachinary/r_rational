Not sure what to say about this chapter. It was nice to explore Red's interactions with the other psychics and see how ghost pokemon are defined in this universe. I quite like how Red recognised from Rowan how his partition made the others wary.

On the other hand this chapter felt slow. My understanding of this pokemon universe has increased appreciably but it seems like the plot barely advanced. I wonder if once this is all complete, whether a reader would actually notice anything if they accidentally skipped this chapter.

This doesn't mean that I don't appreciate this added context; a lot of this feeling is probably due to impatience. I really am starting to miss Blue though.
