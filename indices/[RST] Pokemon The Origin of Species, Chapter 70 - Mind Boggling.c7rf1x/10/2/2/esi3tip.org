According to [[https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2018/09/660c7de5bc44-map-showing-where-people-can-see-mt-fuji-released-online.html][this article]], Mt. Fuji can be seen from more than 300km away. Mt. Ranier seems to have similar [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rainier#Geographical_setting][far viewing data on it.]]. So if Mt. Silver is the equivalent of Mt. Fuji, it's not really a stretch.
