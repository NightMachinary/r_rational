Jason noted that ghost Pokemon are dead /Pokemon/, not people, unlike what a lot of in game info suggests. I assume that in any world with things like ghost Pokemon, mythology would be built about about them being dead people, so I wonder what makes him confident they are Pokemon spirits.

Red and Jason both had very Daycare-man like attitudes about not being sure how the ghost pokemon emerge. I can't quite recall from the chapter were we learned about Magnemite origins, but have people actually ever witnessed/documented the spontaneous generation of tech or ghost pokemon? They both kind of talked about it like they knew the answer, but I didn't.

The description of ghost power was really interesting! A great imagining of an esoteric concept. I really like the thinking put into the semi-ghosts. I can't help but imagine the first person to arrive in Alola and there are just these otherwise normal birds you kinda... just... don't want... to look at...
