Obligatory, question is obligatory: I'd like to have this all in one file. I use text to speech where I don't have pod-casts or audio-books while coding to help in the flow state and after >1. year the lack of inflection doesn't matter. Do you mind if I collect a personal copy of the volume? (I will be buying a hardback to put next to my hardback of [[http://www.lulu.com/shop/jennifer-diane-reitz/unicorn-jelly/hardcover/product-1435783.html][Unicorn Jelly]] when it comes out and would at least contribute to the Patreon for an assassination that could be causally linked to an audio-book or fan-cast.) Before you answer, alternately what does your copyright lawyer,or sufficiently dillegent research say?
