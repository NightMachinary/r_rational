And then what? Stop communicating with it? That's necessary to give it problems it can solve and receive the solution. They could suspend the keeper role and just talk to it via a carefully monitored text interface. True. But that makes me wonder why the hell they even started with that direct-contact-person-thingy.

The AI is dangerous and still active. The reason given is because it solves problems for its owners and moral concerns. That alone should prove that security is not the single motivation here, otherwise it would already have been destroyed. Adding the keeper to the situation even gives another risk factor. As it allows the AI to influence someone who is able to act outside the box.

There is also a hint in the other security measures. First the nerve gas then the shaped charges. Someone is clearly trying to preserve the AI even in an event of total failure at the expense of staff.

I'm fairly sure it can try quite a bit before it is deemed to be not worth the effort and given enough data to model its situation it should know exactly what it can get away with.
