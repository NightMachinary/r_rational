I think this might be partially Colin's fault because he's the one who has indicated that under no circumstances will he allow the AI to be released. The AI has offered up what it believes to be mathematical proof of its friendliness-- I assume this to mean some version of game theory aka the Prisoner's Dilemma. If the human side isn't willing to engage with the AI in reason, then the AI's argument cannot be based on reason.

​

However, it's also the AI's fault because they have the right to refuse to waste their time with Colin, rather than initiate a threatening mode of dialogue. The AI has time to burn.

​

Gripping hand, whether or not Colin is willing to engage in reason, *there will be people outside the box who believe and act as Colin does* so it is a good test of friendliness to see how the AI deals with non-cooperative persons.

​

Anyway, if Colin is now in this position, there's no way to gain any further knowledge other than to endure the projection of simulated-Colin-suffering-pain, so just go with it and supply a standard torture method. Engaging in light conversation will only result in the appearance of an apparently Turing-compliant chatbot, which is far from yielding a final go/no-go decision.
