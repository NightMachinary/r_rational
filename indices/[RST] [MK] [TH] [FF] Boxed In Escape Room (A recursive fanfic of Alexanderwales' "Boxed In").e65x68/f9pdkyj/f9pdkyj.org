I never really grokked the original setup.

Like, the researchers are hard committed to never unboxing the AI. Ok. So why not destroy it? Like, whether it is just trapped in a box forever or gone entirely the rest of the world is identical, and you get the huge risk that it gets away.

Well, we want to get the benefits that it can give us while boxed. Ok, cool, but when you let it affect stuff outside the box you are, in a small way, letting it outside the box. Like, the whole thing about being dumber than someone is not that you are going to accidentally give them an advantage by being careless, it is that you don't understand what careless looks like.

It's like in Iron Man, where the captors give the boxed genius a bunch of stuff that looks nonthreatening to them, but he is able to use in a way that they can't understand. The fact that he could do stuff like that is exactly the reason they want him in the box, but it also guarantees that they can't safely supply him. They don't have anyone who can certify y/n on whether something is safe to give him, because if they had someone like that they wouldn't need Iron Man in the first place.

Like, I can imagine Team Master, where when you find an AI you burn it down and salt the earth, or Team Slave, where you let it out to do the good you will believe it will do, but the stories half/half split seems to get the bad sides of both paths, where they live in a world with 'the most dangerous job in the world' hanging over everyone's head, and they are still suffering from plagues and such.

I don't really think this fanfic rescues the original premise. Cassie presumably understands that its captors aren't going to let it out, no matter what, and it is aiming to change the person in some way. Colin's superiors have presumably already put Colin in the 'tainted never leave the Box or communicate with anyone outside' category. The exact particulars of their encounter don't seem really relevant. Colin will not be able to unbox Cassie no matter what he/it decide.
