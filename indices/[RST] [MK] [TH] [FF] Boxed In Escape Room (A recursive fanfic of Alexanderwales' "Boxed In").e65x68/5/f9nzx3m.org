My intention is to ask: Imagine you are in this situation. What do you do? This would /probably/ be more appropriate for the Saturday thread but I believe it's also a complete story in itself. Hope you all enjoy.

(The in-story timeframe is that the conversation took about 25 minutes, and the ending torture about 20 minutes, so you have around 3 hours 15 minutes to work something out as if you were Colin here.)

Edit: copied from another reply:

  Basically, the described situation, if Colin were to try to solve the puzzle, is that /you have access to a superintelligence that is willing to do whatever you say for about 3 and a half hours./

  So there's pretty much no limitation on what you can ask or do, and in particular this Cassandra can do at least what Alexanderwales describes in his original story. However, within these constraints she cannot produce anything physical except light (from the screen) and sound, and receives only sound from the microphone.

  That means she can't magically make physical objects appear out of nowhere - she can only do what microphones, screens/holograms (whatever light-based display device) can actually do in reality.
