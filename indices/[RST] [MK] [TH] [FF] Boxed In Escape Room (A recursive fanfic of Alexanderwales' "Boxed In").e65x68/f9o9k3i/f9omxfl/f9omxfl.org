Maybe we just have to wait for the people who enjoy puzzles & munchkinry to get here. The described situation, if Colin were to try to solve the puzzle, is that /You have access to a superintelligence that is willing to do whatever you say for about 3 and a half hours./

So there's basically no limitation on what you can ask or do, and in particular this Cassandra can do at least what Alexanderwales describes in his original story. However, within the constraints of my story she cannot produce anything physical except light (from the screen) and sound, and receives only sound from the microphone.

So she can't magically make physical objects appear out of nowhere - just what microphones, screens/holograms (whatever light-based display device) can actually do in reality.

I would think it'd be a fun exercise to imagine yourself in Colin's shoes. The question I suppose is not "why should you cooperate with the AI" but "what would minimise suffering in this situation." It's just a thought experiment.

--------------

Since I did actually write the story with a particular chain of logic in mind, I will tell you: the story is a *tragedy*. It's solely Colin's mistakes that result in the proposal indicated. For example, one of the options is to simply not try to solve the challenge:

#+begin_quote
  ...you may continue to interact with me (as the person-projection I was showing before or some other), /or not,/ or I will act as a normal computer interface in order for you to write notes to organise your thoughts, /or any other thing you can imagine/...
#+end_quote

Emphasis added.

So if you can imagine the idea of simply asking, "Can I not? This is too hard" or something, it is consistent with Cassandra's proposal to simply do that and then let Colin decide who to send in next, if indeed he decides to do that at all. So yeah, this story is really for those who enjoy munchkinry.

If you don't enjoy munchkinry, but want to know the chain of reasoning from Cassandra's perspective that I used to produce this conversation and make it consistent with AW's original story, I intend to type it up soon (probably will be around 10-20k words though) and can send it to you privately if you request it from me in a reddit PM.
