I don't really think I want to consent to having this dialogue with you either? (The private conversation you are requesting where you will explain your chain of logic.) It kind of just seems like you had an idea you found clever and wrote a blurb to try and get other people to guess at your idea. But you didn't give us enough context to figure out what you are trying to get us to do. Even in other comments where you explained that this is actually supposed to be a munchkinry puzzle about how to use a superintelligence that doesn't really tie into the story at all. If you wanted to put a post of "How would you best use a superintelligence if you had one at your disposal for 3 hours?" then why not just post that? Why the weird fanfiction on another story? Why the obfuscation? Why the torture veneer?

Also, I noticed you edited your story and now the AI expects the main character to commit to sending another victim if he doesn't play a long. What could possibly motivate him to do that? It's just more reason for him to leave and recommend destroying the AI.
