If you want to know, PM me and I'll answer any questions you might have. I'm not going to explain much more about the story in this thread.

For anyone else reading, the same applies. You can send me a PM if you want clarification and then (if you want, if it's any fun) post your idea in the thread as to what Colin should do. I'll be watching the thread but not posting -- I'll only be replying to PMs :)
