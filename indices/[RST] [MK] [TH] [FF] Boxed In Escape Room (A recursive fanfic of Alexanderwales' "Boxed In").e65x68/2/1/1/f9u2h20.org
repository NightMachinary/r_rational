  Since I did actually write the story with a particular chain of logic in mind, I will tell you: the story is a tragedy.

Not to be mean, but...what story? The story is completely hypothetical at this point. Why wouldn't you just post the whole thing instead of posting the introduction and then individually PMing people the rest of it? What's the point of putting all these barriers in the way of people actually reading your work?

I mean...if the idea is that you want the reader to treat this as a thought experiment, then given that Colin apparently fucks it up in your version, there's no reason you couldn't have posted the whole thing and then invited the reader to imagine a different, better solution. And if you're hoping for someone to guess specifically /how/ Colin fucks it up, that's not likely to happen, because you didn't post enough of the story to develop his character.
