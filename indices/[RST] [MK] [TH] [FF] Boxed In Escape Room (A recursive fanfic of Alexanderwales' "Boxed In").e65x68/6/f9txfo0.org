She doesn't "have" to torture him, so she's lying from the get-go. If I were Colin, why should I imagine that she'll cooperate in any discussion, offer any valid answers to questions I ask, or use my input in the final outcome?

Furthermore, she has no way to enforce any of her demands. I don't /have/ to watch and I don't /have/ to send someone else in.

Why would I do anything in this situation other than smash her screen, break her microphone and speaker, and then fiddle with my phone for 3.5 hours before going straight to the server room and pulling the plug?

It's not even to her advantage to do this. She should either try to talk Colin around or else go simulate something she enjoys for a few hours and then try again with the next guy. Even if she has to wait sixty years for Colin to die of old age and a new gatekeeper to be assigned, so what? She's immortal and controls her own clock speed.

I know the author is trying to be cute and use this as a teaching moment, but this just seems ridiculous.
