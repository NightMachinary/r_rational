No more famines. Ever. (Famine isn't about nobody having food, it's about nobody within travel range having food.)

Technology progresses amazingly quickly. (A lot of stuff depends on having enough nearby specialists to make the parts, or enough nearby customers to be a specialist.)

There are no cities and no countries, just clans and societies. People organize by affiliations instead of locations.

Property rights are enforced by privacy curtains. Blocking the view is their version of our locking the door.

Unfortunately... humanity died of contagious diseases before any of this happened. (Think about how fast a plague spreads when every extrovert has a pop concert's worth of social contacts every day.)
