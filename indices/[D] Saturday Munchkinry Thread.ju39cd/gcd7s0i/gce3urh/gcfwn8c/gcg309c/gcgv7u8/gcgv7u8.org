True, although it would be easier to grow crops on habitable planets since water will at least flow downward, pressure leaks won't wipe out the habitat, and hazards from long-term exposure to radiation while working there wouldn't be a concern. Radiation might actually be the biggest challenge, since going by ICRP's radiation exposure limits, workers shouldn't exceed 50 mSv per year, and no more than 100 mSv in any 5-year span. Spending 180 days in solar orbit between Earth and Mars would result in exposure to about 250 mSv, so you'd be limited to 36 days per year, or 72 days over 5 years.

Of course, if you only need to spend eight hours per day, then that does improve the situation significantly. 72 (continuous) days would turn into 216 work days over a five year span. This would mean that about 17.5% of your shifts could be spent in space mining, surveying, assembling space stations, transporting materials, etc.

Aside from the benefit of finding low-radiation places to work, surveying would also be useful in terms of being able to identify planets with geological processes which naturally concentrate ores, like how Earth's water cycle can dissolve precious metals, carry it underground, and deposit it in veins which can be mined. The same can be said of ancient biological processes which have left behind valuable sedimentary mineral formations like coal, oil, lignite, limestone, marble, dolomite, goethite, etc.
