*Does some googling.* Huh.

​

I would have thought that deep intergalactic space, far far away from all the galaxies, would be the safest place in the universe.

Turns out that is not true, because galaxies are flooding the universe with deadly radiation.

​

On the other hand, isn't radiation actually pretty easy to block? If I recall correctly, you would just need to encase the station in thick walls of lead.

Now, we could never ever do that in real life because lifting that much heavy heavy lead from the Earth into space would take an absurd amount of rocket fuel, but teleportation solves that problem.
