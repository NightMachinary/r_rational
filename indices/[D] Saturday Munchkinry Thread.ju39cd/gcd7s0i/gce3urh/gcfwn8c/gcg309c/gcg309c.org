I mean, if you put aside all the terrible terrible things that evil people would do to destroy civilization and cause the survivors to live hidden in terror, this power is great. You don't even need to find habitable planets, you can just build space stations to live on, and these space stations can be placed pretty much anywhere in the universe. After all, to get materials and power, they can simply have the people teleport to other places to get them.

Build solar panels with large batteries, teleport them next to some star or other, teleport it back and voila, power.

And even non-habitable planets contain plenty of resources. Mars is full of iron and water, that is absolutely not worth transporting off the planet normally, but with teleportation that transport becomes super cheap and quick.

Asteroids are also a great source of ice, which you can use electricity to melt then electrolyze to generate oxygen.
