I'm not convinced that approach would work, but it would also probably be unnecessary regardless. Each person can teleport once per second, so visiting a star and examining its planets from orbit would be trivial with just a compressed air source and an insulating pressure suit.

Given current technology, you could conceivably place a high-res panoramic camera on the astronaut's helmet, take an image of everything nearby, have the astronaut teleport 1,000 miles forward, take another image, and then work out the position of all nearby planets, moons, and large asteroids. A HUD could be integrated into the helmet to show where each of those bodies are, and how far away they are. The astronaut could then travel to each and survey it from orbit. Sufficiently earth-like planets could be examined from their upper atmosphere, and later on their surface if they appear to be within safe bounds for gravity and temperature.

A single astronaut could likely survey a whole system within about five minutes, or just about 100 systems in an 8-hour shift. A space exploration force with 100,000 astronauts could survey 2.46 billion systems per year, which would be fast enough to systematically survey the entire Milky Way within 40 to 160 years.
