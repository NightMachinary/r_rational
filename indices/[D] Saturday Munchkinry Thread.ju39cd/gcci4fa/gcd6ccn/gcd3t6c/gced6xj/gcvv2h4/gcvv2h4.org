There are way more tasks that require you to contemplate 10 000 different possible solutions most of which don't work, basically any NP problem, meanwhile with the 3 hours of thinking you're going to forget almost anything you come up with because you can't write it down, and get to mentally fatigued/bored to be able to actually think about a task without external stimuli.

That said, if you get the one where you can only move you eyes, you /definitely/ need to get a high speed camera, and learn morse code or some other eye-motion-only communication, to take notes.
