  You can travel back in time exactly 5 seconds. This activation has a cooldown, also of exactly 5 seconds. The activation happens instantly, and you're at exactly the position and pose you were 5 seconds ago (think Tracer's ability from Overwatch).

Unlimited thinking time. Just rewind time over and over for as long as you want, giving you infinite time to think of anything you want. Whether that's math homework or novel writing or mystery solving.

  You have the ability to impart 10 million Newtons of force from your palms or your soles. This force is imparted for exactly 1 cm of travel. During this time your hands or legs are indestructible (and as such protected from the impulse), and your body is protected from any immediate environmental effects of your power. You can use this power once every minute. Outside of your power, your body is like that of a normal human being.

This doesn't sound all that different from standard super strength, just you are only able to use it once per minute. Still, that means you can do all kinds of super strength things such as breaking stuff for demolition/recycling or spinning a turbine for electricity (may need a more complicated setup to channel that sudden power burst every minute and to stay within the 1cm distance limitation).

  You can split into 10,000 clones almost instantaneously for 1 minute. The clones only appear in places that will admit their dimensions around you, in a density of about 1 clone per square meter. After one minute, the combined knowledge and thoughts of each clone gets merged inside your brain with no difficulty, just like your own thoughts and knowledge. However, you are still able to forget things your clones thought up/ learned. The clones act as if they have the same mass and inertia as you, and they can interact with most objects. But if they are imparted upon by a force of more than 5N or a work of more than 5J they dissipate into nothingness (air pressure notwithstanding). After one minute, they also dissipate into nothingness. This ability can be used once every hour.

This power is pretty much the above two mixed together. You get 10000 clones worth of thinking time for 1 minute every hour (so not unlimited, sadly). You also get the strength of 10000 clones for that minute.

One thing I must ask though... are the clones weightless? Because if they disappear when faced with a force of >5N, what about their weight? If they weigh the same as you do, the floor they stand on almost certainly imparts >5N on them to support their weight. (Quote wikipedia: The weight of an average adult exerts a force of about 608 N.) So would they just go poof instantly?

If weight does not cause them to poof, then the combined weight of 10000 clones suddenly appearing can be used to do useful work. The simplest application is having them appear on one end of a lever, so their weight pushes up the other end to lift objects. But naturally more complicated mechanical devices can be created, up to and including spinning a turbine for electricity. After all, if you weigh 100 kg, those 10000 clones appearing would instantly apply a downward force of roughly 10,000,000 newtons. So that actually matches the previous 10 million newton power, albeit limited to a downward direction and spread out over a much greater volume.

  Once every day you can speed up time around your brain to experience one second as 10,000 seconds. During this time your body moves as if it's in real time, but your eyes can move around synced up with your mind (at 10,000x faster speed). Blinks still take the same 400 ms, which you will experience as 4000 seconds. However, after this second ends in real time you feel as if you had 3 hours of effective rest.

Probably the weakest of the listed powers. You get much less free thinking time than the first and third powers, though still pretty useful. You don't get any of the force boosts of the second and third powers, unless you somehow use the movement of your eyeballs to apply it. (That would probably hurt quite a lot so let's not even go there!)

Still, 10000 additional seconds of free thinking time, combined with 3 hours of effective rest per day (which I assume means you need 3 hours less sleep), would give you almost 6 hours more time per day. Assuming a healthy sleep cycle of 8 hours a day, a normal person only has 16 hours per day, while you have 22 hours, which means you have 37.5% more time than everyone else. Not particularly overpowering, but still pretty neat.
