With the first power you can quickly become very rich gambling/trading on the stock market.

Start with whatever money you have/can borrow, go gambling in blackjack or a similar game with a quick circle of decision/reward. Make a lot of money, leave a generous tip, buy drinks at the bar for everyone so you have better chances of getting out of there with your winning and not being "persuaded" to keep playing.

Now it's time for the stock market. With only five seconds you need a derivative that moves really fast like options near their end, or a lot of leverage.

To become rich with the second power, that pressure is maybe enough to make diamonds out of carbon? Alternatively go robbing banks by punching through walls and safes.

With the third power you can flood entire buildings with copies of yourself, so industrial espionage if you happen to know exactly when something interesting is going to be shown in plain view or reachable within a minute. Time the important slide in a presentation, or use one clone to restrain a upper level manager while another reads their email when the account has been unlocked. Send money to a cryptocoin account when someone has their home banking app open.

There are two drawbacks: the first is the extreme unreliability. You know that with ten thousands copies you're bound to find some opportunity at any given timw, but you can't predict which. The second is that everyone will know that you were there. Wear a mask at the very minimum.

Also but less usefup: become a one man army. One minute is enough to point 9,999 guns at many different targets from a lot of different vantage points. (you don't want to risk the life of the original you just to fire one more bullet, do you?)

The fourth power is strong in the long run: having three hours more each day is going to have a cumulative positive effect on you career/studies. Impress you boss/professors with the ability to find solutions in a very short time.

Also maybe gain an edge in chess tournaments?
