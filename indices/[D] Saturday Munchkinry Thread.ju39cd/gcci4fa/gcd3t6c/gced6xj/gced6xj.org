I should have clarified better for the clones. they behave as if they have the same mass and inertia as your body, but they're mostly weightless. Any big enough outside force on them disperses them like smoke. However I think the limit is high enough to get them to work with small objects.

One thing I think might make thinking hard, you'd have to divide up a task into 10,000 chunks to take maximum advantage of your one minute, which might take a while to set up. Unless you use one instance of your power to divide up the task, but even then you'd have to check for overlaps between your clones.
