All humans have the ability to teleport instantaneously to any chosen location in the universe. They can do this once per second.

To do so, they have to identify a specific place they want to go. "The surface of planet Venus" works if you have an idea of what Venus is, but fails if you don't know enough identifying factors about it. For example, knowing "it is a place called Venus and it is hot" is not sufficient, but having an impression of its size and location is enough.

"The nearest convenience store" fails as a target, as the person is asking their power to identify a place rather than choosing one themselves. "The current location of former president Barack Obama" similarly fails as a target.

- It turns out this doesn't equate to time travel, for whatever reason.

- Humanity as a race has always had this power, rather than suddenly receiving it.

- The teleportation is seamless: it doesn't cause sudden air displacement or vacuums. It also adjusts people to the velocity of the place they teleport to.

- Teleportation will shift people to the nearest unoccupied space rather than intersect with other solid objects.

- People bring their clothing and up to an armful of whatever they are carrying.

How does society as we know it change?
