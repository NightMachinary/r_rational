  To do so, they have to identify a specific place they want to go. "The surface of planet Venus" works if you have an idea of what Venus is, but fails if you don't know enough identifying factors about it. For example, knowing "it is a place called Venus and it is hot" is not sufficient, but having an impression of its size and location is enough.

maybe we could try brute-forcing all possible places, for example first dream them up or make them up from photos/computer graphics, and then teleport them?

maybe we can create a fake document about second Earth-like planet in the universe, then convince somebody that this planet really exists, and then ask him to tteleport there?

this really should work as long as somewhere in the universe is a place matching description, because there is no way to tell a difference between knowing a place well because you saw real photos etc and knowing a place well because you saw fake photos
