You have a robot which looks like and behaves like a human, such that if someone wasn't given a reason to think otherwise, they would believe the robot was in fact a human. The robot is like the one in the 1980s movie Not Quite Human - physically heavy and strong, and has a power cord to plug into electrical sockets, a few sockets in its back in which you can insert e.g. USBs or other things which typically can be plugged into a laptop, and a qwerty keyboard hidden in a panel in its arm. It is as smart as a normal human and operates on a variant of Linux Debian with appropriate programs to enable it to engage in human-like behavior. You are you, with whatever level of computer knowledge you have or can obtain. You and the robot are the only ones who knows the true nature of the robot. You don't know where it came from or how it was programmed but can safely assume they are out of the picture.
