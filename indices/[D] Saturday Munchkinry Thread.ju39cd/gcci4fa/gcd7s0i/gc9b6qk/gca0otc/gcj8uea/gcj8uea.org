Upgrading a character from my tabletop campaign, and I am having trouble identifying useful areas of growth.

My character is a movie character who walked out of the screen and took a bit of it with him. He has strange movie based powers like Jump Cut(short-range teleport), Episodic Healing(regeneration), Cinematic Score(very limited clairvoyance by interpreting the current background music) and a gun that only hits what it's aiming at( it can miss, but never damages anything but the target) and never needs reloading( but optionally can be reloaded for dramatic effect and for a one use bonus to hit.)

This character is based on Cort, from the Quick and the dead, played by Russle Crowe. He recently power up such that he can switch between several of Russle crowes other characters, and have powers approat to them, as well as a base form representing Russle Crowe as seen in interviews. So here is where I'm at.

What Russel Crowe roles should I select(up to nine total) and what powers should I focus on from each?

Current already selected roles:

Base form Ira (Russel Crowes middle name)

Most of his points are spent on defensive passive abilities and he is paying the cost of the transform power to allow the others to exist. Slight mental control ability from his occasional role as a narrator(forcibly narrating opponents makes them follow that narrative)

James J Braddock (Cinderella man)

1930 heavyweight boxing champ, martial skills with an added ability to increase density for damage reduction and increased weight and strength (as this movie is based on a true story, he just has more weight to him than any other role, yep, most powers have a pun basis)

Cort from the quick and the dead

Slightly nerfed, lost some powers when ira became base form as all other forms are built to a lower point cap. Lost some range on teleport and power to summon a horse from off screen. Otherwise powers as listed above

Maximus from The Gladiator

Can call in a catapult strike from off screen and is very good at disarm, for up to three attacks after disarming someone he is proficient with their weapon, weather it's a sword, bow, Lazer pistol, or enchanted club. Also general martial competence

Those are already in use and cannot be removed but can to some extent be modified. Now I'm trying to pick the other 5 roles. Because of the limited power of nonbase forms, generally I can put one or two useful powers on a role after buying minimus necessary expenses, so each one will be specialized. The goal is to have a rounded overall character at the end. There will be some gaps, for example Russell Crowe never played a magic user ( a doctor who studied Egyptian magic, and a detective following a runaway wife starting a kind of shamanestic internship, but no direct magic users) but there are others on my team to fill them.

Tldr, Choosing from Russell Crowes IMDB history, using 8 characters plus a base form, and up to two powers from each, make an effective character. You may switch between roles instantly and often as you want but don't piss of the dm, damage and exhaustion will endure through role changes, power ups will not. All powers pull from the same source.

Any power selected must have been displayed or strongly implied by the role receiving it, or be derived from Cinematic physics.

I have a few starting points, but this is already too long. I will post them in reply to this comment. The system used is Heros 6th edition, but due to its flexibility and complexity I don't encourage consulting it for ideas. Any power can probably be made in the system, but the point cost do not follow rules I could feasibly explain in this medium.
