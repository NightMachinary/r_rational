...I don't know the first thing about Russel Crowe. But some thoughts on generic cinema powers...

- A thief character might be able to pick locks off-screen
- A "Master Of Disguise" type character can outright replace a minion of the bad guy while off-screen (but never a named Bad Guy, only a minion)
- A detective can make surprisingly accurate "hunches" on the basis of insufficient evidence
- A character may have the power "Dramatic Death Scene" which means that if he's killed, then instead he's disabled (can't move, can talk at length, can do simple actions like firing a pistol) for several hours, as long as he keeps talking (and he can keep going "And one more thing!" as long as he wants). He still dies if he stops talking, but it allows an ally time to obtain a healing potion or similar.
- "Never Found The Body" - if he dies in such a way as to leave no body, he gets to come back a few scenes later (he might dive into a river when hear death to take advantage of this). This might even follow the Dramatic Death Scene above.
