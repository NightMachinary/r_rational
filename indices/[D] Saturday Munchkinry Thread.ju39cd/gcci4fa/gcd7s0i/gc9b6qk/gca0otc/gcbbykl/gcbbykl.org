How powerful is the computer it's running on? If it's about as powerful as consumer-grade hardware, every computer I buy is another copy of its mind I can run in parallel. At the cost of public scrutiny, I can use these to make money via Mechanical Turk or remote jobs. Humans are subject to severe side effects from sensory deprivation, so I might have to hook its senses into VR or cameras/microphones.

I look through the file system. Is its source code readable? If I can log its natural-language surface thoughts, alignment is a much smaller issue.

The endgame, as often, is to safely build AI that is smart enough to brush away the world's problems. The direct approach would be to earn enough money to buy enough hardware that my army of minds, tasked with doing theoretical AI safety research as a human would, would work fast enough to finish before someone else follows in its father's footsteps.

Modifying it in ways that change its motivations or intelligence is ill-advised, but reducing its hardware requirements would be great. How much access to give it to its inner workings would depend on my understanding of how it works. Even read access might be a mistake, if it can become smarter merely by understanding its thought processes enough to steer them better. I've heard humans can lose their desires through meditation.
