Sockets: the sockets are in a spot on the lower back where the robot can reach and plug stuff in if it desires but apparently the designer wasn't too concerned about making them super convenient for whatever reason. Maybe a design flaw but one which can be worked around.

Self improvement: the robot doesn't know enough about programming at this point in time to do so, and is also concerned about breaking itself by accident but in principle it could do so if you give it the password for root access.

Where it came from: you got it while licitly obtaining title to an abandoned storage unit/inherited it from your eccentric distant relative who got it from an abandoned storage unit, and discreet inquiries suggest that whoever abandoned the storage unit abandoned it due to being nonfunctional.
