  abandoned it due to being nonfunctional.

I'm still very concerned about this robot having not-"nonfunctional" copies elsewhere, developed by its progenitor.

This is world-changing technology.

What I'd probably do is:

- continue discreet enquiries
- ask the robot what it wants, because everything after this is conditional on its consent
- partner with some discreet research lab to try to identify the robot's origins and maximum capabilities, as well as determining ways of differentiating robots like this one from humans
- press campaign: Robots walk among us, Bot-san here is one. Here's what they're capable of. /Here's a simple, foolproof, safe way to detect them/ so that there's no bot-hunters going around killing humans by mistake, and /here's why trying to kill them doesn't work/, and also they're probably all government agents whose deaths will fuck over the killer. We haven't discovered their origin. Bot-san's parkour videos are funded via this Patreon account. At the $10,000/month level you can ask Bot-san to run specific courses, terms and conditions may apply.
