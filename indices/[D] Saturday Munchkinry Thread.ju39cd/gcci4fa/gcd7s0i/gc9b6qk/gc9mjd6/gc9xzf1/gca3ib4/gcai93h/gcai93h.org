I think every government having stand users and it being a mad type situation actually sits nicely over our world in a masquerade type setting. Stands being just another weapon system. So the cia has one, and cuba has an unuseually high number so that is why they couldn't assassinate castro. It would fit pillar men being a wmd bwing worked on in ww2.

Not much of a fan of the soul concept, but it does work. Works better with hamon as well. Although, thinking about it. A horror as lovecraftian take would be pretty cool.

However we are given to belive there are aliens on earth. So clarktech level nanotech is on the table. The arrows/metal could be nanotech that links up to a bigger system.

I think some of the later manga goes in that direction but I am not caught up.
