The mechanism being viral would probably mean the size of the cut is unimportant. Since if it hit you hard enough to do big structural changes it would have to go systemic anyway.

I expect that the willpower angle is just some post hoc justification by the survivors that haven't done serious tests. Since, animals are shown to survive. If it was related to mental fortitude basically any animal would pass save for an anxious chiwawa type creature.

It could be the change is very painful and required mental strength to keep from panicking and overloading the system. That would fit with the ability of a animal to chew off its leg. However it would mean if you were asleep you'd probably be fine, and that is shown.
