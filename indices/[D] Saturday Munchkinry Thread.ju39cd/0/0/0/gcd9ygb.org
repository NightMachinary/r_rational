  Also but less usefup: become a one man army. One minute is enough to point 9,999 guns at many different targets from a lot of different vantage points. (you don't want to risk the life of the original you just to fire one more bullet, do you?)

Now that I think about it, are your equipment also cloned? Surely the clones don't spawn naked right? Though duplicating guns may be pushing it, so you would need to buy 9999 guns, and carry them around somehow. And people would be mighty curious when they see you have 9999 guns on you.
