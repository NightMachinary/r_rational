After some major news yes, but it's kind of uncommon best you can do are market openings and hope for an opening gap up or down. Buy something, rewind time if there's a gap down or no gap and try again tomorrow.

That's why I suggested options: the closer they are to their expiration, the quicker they move.

For a bizzarre example, on 20 April 2020, between 2:28 pm and 2:30 pm, oil prices went from 17$ per barrel to negative 40$ per barrel. ([[https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1lhy2h328jhpt/Inside-the-Biggest-Oil-Meltdown-in-History]])

That's weird because the movement ended in negative price territory, but with options and precognition you have theoretically no upper bound on how much you can profit. As long as you find someone willing to take your bet, because at that point it's practically gambling.
