Your clothes are copied, and various paraphernalia on your body. But just like your own body, anything that gets copied gets dissipated with very little force. So at most you'll be able to fire illusory bullets that make a lot of noise but dissipate upon impact with anything.

Are there really stocks that move significantly over a time period of 5 seconds?
