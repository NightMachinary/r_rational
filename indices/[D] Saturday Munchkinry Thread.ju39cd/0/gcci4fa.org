How could you take advantage of extremely strong powers with a really limited range of effect. Any one power from the following list:

- You can travel back in time exactly 5 seconds. This activation has a cooldown, also of exactly 5 seconds. The activation happens instantly, and you're at exactly the position and pose you were 5 seconds ago (think Tracer's ability from Overwatch).

- You have the ability to impart 10 million Newtons of force from your palms or your soles. This force is imparted for exactly 1 cm of travel. During this time your hands or legs are indestructible (and as such protected from the impulse), and your body is protected from any immediate environmental effects of your power. You can use this power once every minute. Outside of your power, your body is like that of a normal human being.

- You can split into 10,000 clones almost instantaneously for 1 minute. The clones only appear in places that will admit their dimensions around you, in a density of about 1 clone per square meter. After one minute, the combined knowledge and thoughts of each clone gets merged inside your brain with no difficulty, just like your own thoughts and knowledge. However, you are still able to forget things your clones thought up/ learned. The clones act as if they have the same mass and inertia as you, and they can interact with most objects. But if they are imparted upon by a force of more than 5N or a work of more than 5J they dissipate into nothingness (air pressure notwithstanding). After one minute, they also dissipate into nothingness. This ability can be used once every hour.

- Once every day you can speed up time around your brain to experience one second as 10,000 seconds. During this time your body moves as if it's in real time, but your eyes can move around synced up with your mind (at 10,000x faster speed). Blinks still take the same 400 ms, which you will experience as 4000 seconds. However, after this second ends in real time you feel as if you had 3 hours of effective rest.
