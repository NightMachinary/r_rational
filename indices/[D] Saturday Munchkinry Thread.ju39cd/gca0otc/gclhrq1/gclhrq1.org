Step the first: Impromptu Turing Test (i.e. spend some time chatting with it and see just how human the responses are). I assume it comes out of the test with a result of "indistinguishable from human", which leads me on to Step the second.

Step the second: Find out what the robot wants. It's clearly a sapient life form, so I should not ignore its wishes. Attempt to encourage the robot towards self-improvement and learning enough programming to be able to write small helper programs for itself (but encourage it to be super careful modifying its base code).
