The broad idea of it is “getting cut by this gives you weird but probably strong powers if your will is strong enough, but if it isn't, you die”, right? I think a smaller cut is also more survivable but results in weaker powers. So some uplifting-type guy would definitely try to make as many stand users as possible, doing science to try and (ethically) figure out the lower bound of willpower require to survive it while guarding the arrow from others and recruiting others to their cause. Could be neat, even if JJBA powers tend to be irrational.
