Simulation theory as an explanation is a bit of a cop-out, not a fan. Some sort of “souls are insanely complicated and stands are like a 4d cutout of the users 7d soul” would be interesting.

How common or easy arrows are to get is something that's definitely unclear in canon. It's mostly Joestars or children of Dio who have them, except that for some reason Kira's dad was just able to buy one off Enya. Assuming that most major organizations have stand users kinda breaks the setting into being a lot less Earth-like for sure.
