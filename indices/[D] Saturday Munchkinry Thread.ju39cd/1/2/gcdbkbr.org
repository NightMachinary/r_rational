It is annihilated.

Humanity that is.

Here's the problem: teleportation makes attacking REALLY EASY, while defending is basically impossible.

Any asshole could teleport to a large asteroid, "carry" it in the weightlessness of space, and then teleport back above the earth and throw the asteroid at it as a large meteor. And there is no way to prevent this.

Earth gets bombarded by such meteors over and over until humanity goes extinct.

(If we are really really lucky, no such assholes exist. But I doubt that.)
