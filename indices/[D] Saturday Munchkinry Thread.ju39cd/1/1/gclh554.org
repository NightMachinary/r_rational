We don't have cars. Nor bicycles, motorbikes, horse-drawn carriages, any of that.

We don't have separate languages; people have always intermingled enough to prevent too much language drift. We don't have separate countries and we /definitely/ don't have borders.

We /do/ have leaders, though. On the 'village chief' level at the very least.

Travel is limited by two things. First is how far we can see. (We do, therefore, develop telescopes - and cameras are travel aids). Second is the ability to survive once we get there (teleporting to the Moon is /not/ the best idea, but a far better idea than teleporting to Venus). Some people maintain caches of stuff in hard-to-reach places - several of these caches are on the moon (to retrieve it, prepare to hold your breath a couple of seconds...) - much to the dismay of the average doctor.

The discovery of exoplanets is followed, within a week, by people visiting those planets. Humanity rapidly expands to live anywhere vaguely habitable in the universe, and starts to work on making the other places more habitable.
