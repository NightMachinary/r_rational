My favorite zombie story is "Dead Eyes Open", where the zombies are still just whoever they were, they're just metabolically challenged... and are trying to make do in a world where part of the population is going "New minority group, gotta help them." and part is going "Headshot! Pow!" and most are going "WTF"?
