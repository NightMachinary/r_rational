feedback: your story's 'about' page needs to start with a quick teaser for the story, go into a longer summary (if absolutely necessary), lay out the update schedule, and then lay out a short blurb about you as an author. Key word: short. What's going to sell your story better, a few hundred words of marketing text, or actually reading your story?
