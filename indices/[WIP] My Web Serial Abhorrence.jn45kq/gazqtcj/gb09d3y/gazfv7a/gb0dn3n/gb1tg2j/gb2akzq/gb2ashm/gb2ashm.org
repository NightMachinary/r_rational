To clarify, I'm advocating for less description. Readershave a limited attention span; any attention they spend reading description is attention they don't have to spent reading your story. Print novels have to be paid for, so they have large marketing blurbs because consumers will take a reasonable amount of time to decide. On the internet, for a free work, the only currency worth anything is your prospective readers' attention spans.
