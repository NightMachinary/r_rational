There are two arguments here which are getting mixed up. One is that we shouldn't gatekeep irrational stories. Two is any gatekeeping alienates or discourages authors. I've already made my position clear on the first. As for the second, I haven't been disputing whether someone can see my comment in an aggressive light or be discouraged by it, because I don't care to sanitize the optics of my comment to make it politically correct to every sensitive person who could be discouraged by such a plain request. What I am disputing is the other poster's statement that my baseline position is hostile towards authors in general, which isn't supported by anything I wrote. Looking through the discussion, it's probably because they're focusing on one of my sentences in particular (This subreddit isn't for spamming self promotion just to get more readers) while overlooking the surrounding context. If you ignore everything else I said, then sure I can see how that sentence would be an indiscriminate "piss off".
