Your interpretation is absurd. I have no idea where you're getting that I'm saying authors aren't welcome, are spammers or irrelevant. I made a simple if then statement: if you're going to self promote, at least explain why your story is relevant to the sub. My baseline position is that people shouldn't promote stories that have no relevance to the sub or make low effort posts with just a link and plea for readers. I thought that was obvious.

You paint my attitude of exclusivity as a negative, but that's exactly what the sub is for: filtering for rational stories. I don't see any need to tiptoe around the point. Also, no I didn't insist on rational*ist* discussion or imply the /author/ doesn't belong here, just that they defend their /story's/ appropriateness. I think you're projecting heavily on my words because they weren't couched gently enough for you.
