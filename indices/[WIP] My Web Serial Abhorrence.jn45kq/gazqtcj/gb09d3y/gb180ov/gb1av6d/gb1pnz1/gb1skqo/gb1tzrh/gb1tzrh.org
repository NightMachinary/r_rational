Given the alternative, I'll say /yes/.

I'd much rather have a more welcoming attitude toward authors promoting themselves, even at the risk of having works promoted here that are not rigorously rational in nature. If this hypothetical problem ever rears its head, I will happily re-examine the need for gatekeepers.

Until then, we have a different problem of alienating and sapping creative energy of budding authors who very likely are fans of rationalism. They're here, after all.
