  If you're going to self promote, then at least explain why your story is a rational story. This subreddit isn't for spamming self promotion just to get more readers.

Also,

#+begin_quote
  ... it doesn't make sense to say the sub should welcome all irrelevant or low effort self promotion just to inflate front page thread count.
#+end_quote

Your baseline position in these comments is that authors aren't welcome here, are spammers, and are irrelevant to the subreddit.

If you look elsewhere on this thread, you'll see others asking for the author to provide rational context without the attitude of exclusivity. It's fine to insist on rationalist discussion - just try not to imply an author doesn't belong here until they prove otherwise.

Editing to add: The context of this entire discussion is important and bears some thought. If your comments were made in a Friday thread about anything, they'd simply be taken at face value. The fact is, however, that the comments were replies to an author offering up a work for review by the users here. What you wrote is implicitly about that author and their work.
