Ok, I've gotten that part down.

I see, I was trying to make my writing a little more 'complex' by keeping who they are a mystery until they were revealed, as a way to further emphasise their importance?

But it seems like I went about it completely in the wrong way, and made it annoying instead, I'll edit that part then.

thanks again.
