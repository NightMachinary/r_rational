Do you enjoy that in stories?

Personally, a lot of things done for this sort of reason just feel anoying for me such as; - something in the future and then continuing the story in the past - unclear refferences, not tagging perspective changes, etc - a historical recounting at the start of chapter on its events or for flavour. - any exerpt for world building or flavor not part of the story. - other perspectives over the same event (i dont want to read about an event twice) - lack of timeskips (i like timeskips and summaries of events) I could probably think of more but that's it for now
