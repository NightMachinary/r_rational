The thing with pronouns like "they" is that they have to refer to something. They are substitutes for nouns who are already named or understood in the context they are used.

In that case it would be fine because you already say "a group of 12 boys and 5 girls" so we can identify "them." The problem is that in you story you don't do that. It just feels like you're trying to keep something a mystery that isn't and shouldn't be a mystery in the first place.

For example,

#+begin_quote
  He walked up to me and said, "Give it to me."

  He walked up to me while I was on my phone and said, "Give it to me."
#+end_quote

Without indicating what "it" was it's confusing. But adding the object "it" is referring to clears that up.

In your case, you start out with:

#+begin_quote
  I have an ambivalent relationship with this place, I've lived here my whole life, although it's been hard, I was able to meet /them/. No matter how hard it gets I can't bring myself to completely hate it.

  A large gust of cold wind had woken me from my stupor, and it was getting late, /they/ had probably returned home already. I should get back before I ended up worrying /them/.
#+end_quote

First off is the emphasis using italics. In this case there's no real reason you should use it here. There are ways you can use italics (see [[https://www.ignitedinkwriting.com/ignite-your-ink-blog-for-writers/using-italics/2017][here]]), but this isn't one of them IMO.

Second, "they/them" have never been identified. I would put it a bit differently, like this:

#+begin_quote
  I have an ambivalent relationship with this place, I've lived here my whole life, although it's been hard, I was able to meet *Arielle and Bryan, my two best friends and roommates*. No matter how hard it gets I can't bring myself to completely hate it. (bolding just for highlighting)
#+end_quote

You can tweak it a bit, but the point is to specify who "they" are first. This way, you can use they/them because we know who you are talking about.
