Wow, I was previously relying on Microsoft Word to pick out the typos for me, I didn't realise just how bad it was. Taking everything you've said into account I've gone over and fixed all the writing that's up on the site to the best of my ability and will continue doing that for future content.

for the 'they vs saying who they are' part, is it fine to use 'they' or he and she as a substitute to prevent repetition? from what I can see I only use they after mentioning them once, I didn't want to continuously refer to them by their names in every line, is this the wrong way to go about it?

or I also use 'they' in the context of 'unnamed characters'

for example :

Outside of the entrance of the school, there were several groups of students hanging out, the most notable of them was a group of 12 boys and 5 girls, they were all wearing matching yellow jackets symbolising that they all belonged to the same gang.

I knew them, they were a part of the most powerful gang in the school, CHN12, a group of Chinese school thugs that had ties to the Chinese triad crime syndicate based in New York, these guys were well known for their notoriety.

am I good to use 'they' here?

Thanks very much for pointing out the problems with my writing, if you decide to continue reading and find that there are more problems with my writing please let me know, I'm always trying to improve!
