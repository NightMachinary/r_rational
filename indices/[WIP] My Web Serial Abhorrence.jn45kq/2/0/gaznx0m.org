I can't touch on it too much, as I think the only way I can really get into it is by giving examples of plot that hasn't been released yet.

the best way I can put it is, as a result of his awakening, the mc is thrown into a more dark and complex world scene full of moral ambiguity, he tries to stay rational and level headed on the choices he makes and how he faces the new challenges thrown at him as to not stray from the 'right path'.

I've edited it a bit to something I'm more happy with, previous description wasn't adequate, thanks for pointing it out.
