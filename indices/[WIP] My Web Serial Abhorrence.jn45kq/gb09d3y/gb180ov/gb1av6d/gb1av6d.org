Self promotion is good and fine but it doesn't make sense to say the sub should welcome all irrelevant or low effort self promotion just to inflate front page thread count. I didn't click the link because the post looked like it was fishing for readers, what with the uncapped sentences. But I did now and I think the author should've added the blurb to the OP since it does seem like a good fit.

  Abhorrence is a planned to be long-running web serial which is set in a modern-day world and follows the life of Callum, an intelligent and hardworking 15-year-old orphan growing up with no family, only his two friends Bryan and Arielle, struggling to survive day to day life in a cruel world.

  As a result of his awakening, Callum is thrown into a more dark and complex world scene full of moral ambiguity, he tries to stay rational and level headed on the choices he makes and how he faces the new challenges thrown at him as to not stray from the â€˜right path'.

  The side characters have their own unique personalities, goals, and roles they play beside their relationships to the main character. They are generally unhappy, and there are no winners in the story.

  How will Callum continue living in a world that abhorrently rejects him?
