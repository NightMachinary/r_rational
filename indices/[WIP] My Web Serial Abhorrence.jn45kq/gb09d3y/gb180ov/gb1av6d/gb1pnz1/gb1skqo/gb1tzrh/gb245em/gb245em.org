Then we have a difference in opinion. My preference is for the subreddit to actually serve its purported genre. We already have enough trouble defining rational fiction without throwing a filter to the winds.

Nobody is "alienating or sapping creative energy of budding authors" by telling them not to self promote here if their story doesn't fit the sub. That's dramatic demagoguery. They can self promote in the many other subreddits or talk about their story in the weekly recommendation/open threads or Discord.

Content moderation is an essential part of a subreddit's identity. Though the mods are already quite lenient from what I can tell.
