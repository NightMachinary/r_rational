yeah I agree, I think most the people commenting here are arguing the second point, which if you don't care about then alright, no problem. Offense is taken not given though, and a few people have said that they would take offense to your statement.

As you said they are taking that from that single line, which we are telling you *is* being taken by many people as a "piss off" *in context*. This is purely subjective though, if you don't want to sanitize for others that's completely your choice, I just wanted to say that some people *would* take offense, whether they *should* is irrelevant (or at least not what I am arguing for atm).
