Just a FYI, you have quite a few typos, problems with capitalization being the foremost among them. I can't speak for everyone, but for me it makes the story less appealing.

I've read the first chapter, and here are some thoughts:

- From a storytelling perspective, it's really annoying when you use "/they/" instead of stating who "they" are. It's something I've only seen in manga, and I have to assume it's a cultural thing, because it doesn't really work in English.

- Proofreading is a must. A character changes the spelling of their name several times throughout the chapter.

- When you start dialogue following an action, it's always capitalized (like a new sentence). E.g.

  - He looked at me blankly "what are you talking about?" /vs./ He looked at me blankly. "What are you talking about?"
  - There are more rules, I would suggest reading up on them since it might help clear a few things up. [[https://firstmanuscript.com/format-dialogue/][Here's]] a site that gives some examples.

For some quick and easy corrections, I would suggest just copying your text into Word. I tried it, and it highlighted some grammatical mistakes.
