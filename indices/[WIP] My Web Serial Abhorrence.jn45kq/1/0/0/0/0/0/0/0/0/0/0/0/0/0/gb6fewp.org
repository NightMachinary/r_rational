Except when the argument is about the subjective interpretation of a comment. Then what people feel from that is all that matters.

But I feel this is kinda getting too heated, I (and I would assume the others commenting) don't really think you did anything wrong, as you say your comment is completely valid from a logical stand-point (Although I actually wouldn't mind more low-effort posts on this subreddit but that's neither here nor there).

I just wanted to argue that yes, your comment does feel a bit like a "piss off" in context even if it doesn't literally say that (And the fact that others think the same IS important because this is purely subjective.), and yes, this WOULD discourage many writers. Whether they *should* be discouraged or not or whether they wouldn't survive long anyway is irrelevant.

Constructive criticism without any sugar-coating has the same effect as above, but I still think its a good thing, and I would think most people do too. It doesn't change that its discouraging to many people and if not given carefully can be subjectively taken as a dismissal/condemnation.

My goal isn't for you to change your comment, I just wanted to point out that your subjective experience in this case is not shared by at least the few people I know/have seen which would take this the wrong way.
