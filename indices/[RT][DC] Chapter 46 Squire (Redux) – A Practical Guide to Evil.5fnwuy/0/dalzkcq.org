God damn I love this web serial. I still think that at some point Catherine is going to rip her Seek aspect out of the demon still in Akua's standard, maybe with some neat augment from being part of a demon for so long. We don't know enough Name lore yet, but I wonder if any Named has ever grown into their three aspects and then forcibly taken a fourth at some point.

(Yes her third aspect was cut out by Masego, but when she was in the Name vision I recall the demon saying "Mine," almost as if it was stealing her aspect by corrupting it)
