I've been wondering for weeks if her having "permanently crippled the name of Squire" (Masego) would stick to the name (after someone else got it) or to Catherine (after she gets another).

Who'd have thought the answer would be "neither" and you could simply reboot that thing? Nice job fixing it, villain.
