I think all those stories have RSS feeds. You [[https://ifttt.com/applets/147561p-rss-feed-to-email][apparently]] can set up [[https://ifttt.com/][IFTTT]] (with which I am /not/ acquainted, so take this with a grain of salt) to send you an email whenever an RSS feed updates. Alternatively, you can just use [[https://feedly.com][Feedly]] to follow the RSS feeds directly; it doesn't send out emails, but at least it consolidates all the stories in one place that you can check regularly.
