It's a cartoon about the Crystal Gems, a trio of superheroines / magical girls who fight monsters and have adventures. The eponymous protagonist is the newest member of the Gems, a 10-year-old boy still learning to use his powers.

The focus is generally on slice-of-life and character interaction, though there's no shortage of action-adventure too. Particularly in the early episodes, the Gems generally leave Steven behind while they go off on their missions, and the story is about how strange it is to grow up raised by the Gems (though Steven's Dad is an important secondary character too).

The writers work very far in advance and they leave a lot of clues about future episodes for the attentive viewer (or, more commonly, for the re-watch). This makes the world feel very consistent and well built. It's probably where the nerd appeal comes from too: the show gives out mysteries to be solved.
