It's a cartoon about the "crystal gems". Pulling a lot from the magical girl genre, and things like jem and the holograms. It's written by one of the writers for adventure time.

Without going into spoilers too much, it focuses on a small group of gems that protect earth, and their half gem half human child.

Generally, it just pulls it off really well. It focuses a lot on emotion, and emotional intelligence. It's like MLP if MLP was actually trying to teach empathy and conflict resolution skills.

Generally the characterization is very good.
