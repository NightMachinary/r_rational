The harshness impression I got might come from the way you structured it. Try a Feedback Sandwich next time: specific praise about one aspect of the thing, followed by whatever more-or-less damning flaws you want to point out, followed by an overall thing.

So something like (abbreviated): "IMO: good use of canon references, poor prose, general lack of theory-of-mind, overall premise has merit."
