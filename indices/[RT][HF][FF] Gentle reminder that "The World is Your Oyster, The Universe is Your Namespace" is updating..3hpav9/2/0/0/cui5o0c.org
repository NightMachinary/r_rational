I'm sorry if I came off as harsh.

I think the initial basis of the story has merit, it's just the way it's written it feels more like you're writing stuff that helps you remember how a scene goes in your head, visually.

I'm sure this story could work as a straight up addition to the show, it feels like a script to a set of in-between episodes; and I'm sure they wouldn't be received badly. The problem is that in a medium like writing, it ends up lacking in several respects. When you can't rely on the body language of the animated characters and the tone of their voice you have to compensate with their thought processes, especially for the main characters, and there's very little of that here.

Instead of having the characters think things, there's usually a description of them posing as if to think and then discussing an idea between themselves. This can work in scenes with a quick pacing, but when characters have all the time in the world it breaks immersion and makes a reader wonder if the characters are only multiple stand-ins for a single mind.

Most of the Stevonnie chapters were about people pausing to discuss among themselves the same thing, over and over again, which only compounds the issue, because while the text is somewhat personalized to whatever character is speaking at the time, the basic idea is still interchangeable among them. Characters end up seeming like multiple voices for the exact same thought process (except for Ronaldo, but he's not far from the group, choosing to mention 'hermaphroditic' just to continue the running joke).
