I've watched all of Steven Universe recently, so I decided to give this story a shot. I've really been struggling to read it, honestly, because it feels like there's no substance. Most of the stuff that happens beyond the fountain scene are references to canon. The story relies on references from the canon instead of setting up its own reality. Characters try to learn the rules of the universe (or at least of their loot) without a clear plan, just as curiosities, and while that might be in character for the characters of the show, it's not rational in the least.

The whole story feels like stream-of-mind and written on the spot, so it fails to make me care for it. I find myself groaning more often than not, or shaking my head at how characters could be used interchangeably for most scenes and how they snap from one emotion to the next without any clear tells:

"Pearl leaves by the warp pad for undisclosed reasons, leaving Connie, Clonnies, Steven, and Amethyst alone.

*Connie high-fives Z.*

“You are such a bad ass, Connie,” Amethyst says, giving her a slow clap. “I've never seen anyone get Pearl in the mood for a duel that quickly. But fair warning: she's really good.”

“She taught us everything we know,” Q says. “We know.”

“I better get a video-camera. Maybe even an audience,” Steven says. “This is going to be so cool.”

*“... What have I gotten myself into,” Connie says, sighing. She slumps under the weight of realization.*"
