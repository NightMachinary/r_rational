If the adults are killed, a message is sent. But what if they're imprisoned? Can they send a signal and if so, how can it be blocked?

The Mamas are the best source of information on the outside world, something that is necessary before any plan to escape can be formed. Capturing them and interrogating them for the entire month before escape gives both time to train the kids and reveal to them the situation, as well as some clue as to what should be done once they're outside the walls.
