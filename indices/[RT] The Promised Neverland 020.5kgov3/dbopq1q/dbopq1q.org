The demons spend resources to prevent the adults from leaving the farm that implies it's difficult for them to capture the adults once they have escaped, that is good news for the plan.asking krone questions in a place she chooses, and without checking if she has a recorder somewhere is really dumb and can get them killed, I will be really disappointed If they don't at lest notice that the best way she has to prove they know everything is just to record their conversation whith them and not being cautious when talking is what let krone discover them in the first place. Maybe Ray should tell mama about krone knowing who they are and tell her that he said that he was a double agent to the other kids and krone to keep their trust.
