I don't think I am. six figures is already assuming a massive improvement in labor efficiency over the billions that directly and indirectly support our infrastructure now.

I'm not talking about a short-term survival scenario where you're depending on pre-manufactured precision components from valves to electronic automation modules.

Longer term, like getting to the point that you're growing beyond survival and you don't need planets any more, in a situation where you have /zero/ support from a surrounding ecosystem, you have to have the production lines to manufacture pipes and valves and batteries and switches and the high quality steel you need for pressure vessels and power converters. Even getting electricity is going to be hard. If you want to make high efficiency solar cells you need a whole microelectronic production line and all the production lines to feed into that, so you're probably going to use a big hot panel on one side, a radiator in the shade on the other, and a sterling engine in the middle driving a generator. And you need to be able to build that from scratch. So you need to be refining copper and a bunch of different grades of steel and all the stuff you use to polish the radiator and darken the heat collector and run your working fluid through all that. And you need to be able to make these things on a routine basis.

Let's just look at SevenEves. They're building their survival strategy around these robots with machine learning processor cores. So they need to build a whole microelectronics industry from scratch, and they don't even have tooling to build precision micrometers to start with. They need to have basically all the different types of factories that feed into the microelectronics industry on Earth, from refining rare earths to building the fabs... and even if your fab is small scale, you still need all the parts that go into the production line even if you don't need many of them.

That's even /harder/ than just building a colony that uses humans for automation, and even that requires a serious infrastructure, and /more/ humans than modern factories because humans are cheap and computers are probably vacuum tube based because that requires fewer humans to build.
