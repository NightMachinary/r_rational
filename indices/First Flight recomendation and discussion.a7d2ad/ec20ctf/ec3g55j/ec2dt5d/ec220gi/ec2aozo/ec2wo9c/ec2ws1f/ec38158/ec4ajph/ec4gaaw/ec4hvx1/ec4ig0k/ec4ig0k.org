I somewhat agree. The main thing is I don't know what the actual minimum sets look like because I don't know if you could get centuries out of a stockpile of electronics- space is hard on them and you could bring along a lot - and use lower density electronics as well. And the other side of your argument is that 1700s lathes were known as machines that could make almost everything they had then.

I do agree that 7 people isn't enough but 7000 might be. Not 70k or 7 million. You could possibly have just a small number of materials processing pipelines and make everything from just a single type of aluminum alloy for instance. Sintered with 3d printers and refined with a single kind of cnc machine. Less optimal but it might work, allowing you to reach a closed loop industrial infrastructure with less people and complexity.
