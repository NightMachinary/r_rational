These are good points. Modern equipment heavily uses not only a ton of microelectronics but accurate motor control (needed for any sort of robotics to both mine rocks outside the habitat and to do any sort of sophisticated automation) also needs power control silicon, which are much larger components. (known as mosfets and igbt transistors and there are other methods)

And yeah, you need acres of chip area in the form of gpus and tpus to make anything resembling a smart-ish robot like in seveneves. You apparently cannot succeed in machine learning without thousands of processing cores and gigabytes of memory. (I say apparently because this isn't obvious and is an empirical finding from the last few years)
