I'm looking for the number of people you need once that stockpile of electronics is gone, and you don't have any 3d printers or CNC machines, and you literally have to manufacture your air and water and build pressure-tight greenhouses and pump air around with electrical power that you're not generating by burning anything.

However many people and machines you start with, they have to be able to grow the population and the living space up to that point, while also doing everything else they need to survive, and they've got maybe a hundred years to do it.

Start with 7000 people, get them breeding as fast as possible, say doubling the population in 20 years (which is pretty good, human population on Earth takes about 65 years to double) that gives them a population of 200k after 100 years. That might be viable... if nothing goes wrong, they don't have a major depressurization incident, they've got teachers, and they can build a habitat 30 times the original size of their 7000 person colony fleet to hold all those people.

That's a super-optimistic scenario though.

(TBH I'm not sure that 7000 people could maintain a machine civilization even /on/ Earth, where you don't have to manufacture air from rocks.)
