One thing we can't fully model is this novel takes place several decades in the future. Machine learning driven robots have the potential to hugely increase the density of a manufacturing facility. The reason is a set of waldos don't need to be taught. Anything the host cloud system knows how to make and the materials and specialized tools are present for they can craft. Also machine learning promises to abstract the process of making something from the actual physical waldos you happen to have available. And ubiquitous 3d printer can make jigs and things as well.
