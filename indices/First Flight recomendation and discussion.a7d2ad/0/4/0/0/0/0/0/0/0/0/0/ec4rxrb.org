  Machine learning driven robots have the potential to hugely increase the density of a manufacturing facility.

You can't build new machine learning driven robots, though. You can't build new 3d printers. You can't build new /anything/ that requires microelectronics, because you can't make microelectronics, because you can't make fabs, because you can't make litho masks, and electron guns, and so on... because you have no supply of pure crystalline silicon and dopants and rare earths, unless you build the factories that make these things, and the factories that make the things you need to make the factories that make these things.

You need factories because you need to build these things to scale, because you're trying to grow your population to the point where you CAN make these factories, because it's WAY easier to make humans than microelectronics.
