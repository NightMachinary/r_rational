Quite interesting. I will say that the primary conflict in seveneves was from a politician manipulating vulnerable humans into a plan incompatible with the laws of nature. Sort of how in our real timeline we allow the elderly to develop dementia by the millions instead of doing the obvious thing and flash freeze their brains before they are destroyed. We have convinced ourselves as a society of various bullshit ideas that support all this instead of the only ideas compatible with how physics actually work. (I know there are serious technical challenges with flash freezing but it is likely possible, especially if you use magnetic heating to disrupt ice crystal formation, and assuming you believe that the brain is a physical machine that stores information in physical reality there is no other valid conclusion you can reach as to what you should do about this problem)
