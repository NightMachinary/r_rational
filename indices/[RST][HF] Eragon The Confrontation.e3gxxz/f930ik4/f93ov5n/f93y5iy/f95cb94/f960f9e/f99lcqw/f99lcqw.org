Note: Edited for clarity. The previous explanation was rambling and long-winded and will not be retained.

You have to think about why he would decide to depose the original order of dragon riders. They were, in his time, ruled by the elves - who are practically immortal compared to humans and so could not be conventionally deposed (although humans bred faster.)

A possible motivation I can see for Galbatorix was that he was a human and thought, "Well shit, we have no negotiating power with these pricks. Better do something about that." And so obtaining as much power as possible in the most effective and efficient way possible. He could not afford to care about anything else since it was him alone against the entire preexisting order. So in a sense you could ask, is he really a villain? Obviously he is, because he doesn't care at all about the people he rules and enjoys killing people, and so that's why the story ends on a questioning note but you get the feeling Eragon's side is the one you would /want/ to win, or at least that's the intention.

The start of /Eragon's/ story I had in mind is when he finds Saphira's egg. Suspiciously, it was teleported /conveniently/ within range of him discovering it in The Spine, his favourite playground growing up, which everyone else in the village superstitiously hated, by a conspiracy of elves, dwarves, humans, and Brom, who turned out in canon to be his actual father while he was raised by Garrow. I made the change in the fic that he was raised by both Brom and Garrow in different ways - he was still a farm boy but Brom took care of his academic education too.

To explain the conversation - the vulnerability that Eragon exploited was Galbatorix's implicit trust in Shruikan. Shruikan and Galbatorix both know they are completely loyal to each other, but Shruikan is more powerful than Galbatorix magically and physically because he's a dragon. Implied in canon (and in my text in Eragon's musings) dragons are "born wise," and in canon Saphira does learn to mindspeak incredibly quickly.

As to the vulnerability, note the difference in particular in trust. Eragon does not even trust /his own thought process/, maybe taking seriously the common adage "trust but verify." Almost certainly he would trust Saphira over himself in the same way as Galbatorix does with Shruikan, but I imply that Galbatorix /deliberately/ cut off Eragon's access to her in setting up the confrontation we see. So it was, in the end, a mistake by Galbatorix which led to Eragon's path to the deal that he eventually got to, and the slight common factor that they both began as humans.

At the end then, Galbatorix realises he made a mistake (which he can learn from, thus increasing his power - which is what he cares about most), and therefore since Eragon specifically proposed a deal which took away absolutely nothing from Galbatorix except time (and he is immortal), Galbatorix ought to be happy enough with the current situation to actually take the deal, which he does. If he wasn't, he would be behaving irrationally, and this is intended to be a rationalist fiction.
