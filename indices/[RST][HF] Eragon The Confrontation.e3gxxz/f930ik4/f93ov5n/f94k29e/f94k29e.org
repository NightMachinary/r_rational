I've always thought the ending was fairly well thought out, if not the rest of it --- after all, consider: what kind of man would slaughter his own people in wholesale genocide? And how would you defeat such a man who has had almost a century to accumulate power? The only way I can see is by healing the sickness which caused him to be so depraved in the first place.

His characterization is terrible, of course, in the first place, but I suspect that Pasolini didn't really think his series would ever actually get around to seeing the Big Bad.
