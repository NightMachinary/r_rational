  Galbatorix defeated the entire ancient order of Dragon Riders with only a few allies he himself raised. And then he ruled with what could only be called negligence. What could bring a man to do such a thing? And how does Eragon, ordinary farm boy, fit in with Galbatorix's plans? If Eragon wants to return the days of the Dragon Riders, he must find within himself the power to overcome even evil King Galbatorix, who has had hundreds of years to consolidate his power.

  A rationalist short story illustrating the power of cooperation and training to overcome even those enemies solely motivated by accumulating as much power as possible.
