The pool is imperfect and has presumably misled him before. That's the assumption that Eragon arrives at based on the same confusion you noted, and it's assumed to be true. Galbatorix is willing to discuss possible terms with Eragon under the belief that this will result in a superior future than whatever the pool showed.

I think.
