  I won't deny that I probably count as a /Worm/ fanboy.
#+end_quote

Being a fan is fine. Liking something, telling other people about it... all well and good. The negative connotation of the term is the confrontational aspect: defending the work from any perceived slights or competition. While I am actively analyzing /Worm/ as I read it, looking at the tropes, cliches, and subversions, I am also trying to enjoy it as I go. I'll probably write another top-level response to /Worm/ in one of the weekly threads sometime /soonish/; I'm further in, and people seem to want to talk about it.

  I'm not sure if you would disagree with me on /Mistborn/ being extremely derivative
#+end_quote

So, you were talking about /Mistborn/'s characterization; I didn't address the point, because there isn't really anything to argue. /Mistborn/ is actually rather typical for Sanderson. Complex characters are not his strong suit (which isn't to say they are either good or evil), and he usually plays the Hero's Journey straight. /Mistborn/ demonstrates his strength in worldbuilding; you can see that while the Hero's Journey is typical, the premise has been knocked upside-down. The Hero of Ages came to save the world... and the Lord Ruler won. The setting is the central idea: a land rimmed with active volcanoes, ash falling from the sky, crops that barely grow. An apocalyptic landscape. This particular subversion isn't exactly original (for instance, any dystopia ever) -- take a crappy world, and heroes who want to make it better.

    I thought Martin's writing was trash. That was maybe... 10 years ago? Read A Game of Thrones, and thought it was vile.
  #+end_quote

  I mean his writing might be trash (although you imply it's because he has such focus on sex and nudity...)
#+end_quote

I did not mean to imply Martin's writing was bad because of the sex. I mean that as a criticism for the /television adaptation/. Martin is best known for subverting heroic tropes: just when you start thinking a character is the /real/ hero, he dies. That certainly puts a damper on the Hero's Journey. Now, it's been a while since I read it, and my memory is rather fuzzy, so bear with me. It seemed like he spent too much time building a world that was larger than life, without actually creating anything new. He made promises with the audience that he then broke. He introduced too many characters too fast. The writing was all grimdark without reason. The thematic elements didn't have a point. To be fair, it's quite possible that what really bothered me was the lack of a heroic journey; I was less mature and my tastes unrefined in those days. Regardless, I do know much of the writing itself was weak, and the book left me with a sour feeling.
