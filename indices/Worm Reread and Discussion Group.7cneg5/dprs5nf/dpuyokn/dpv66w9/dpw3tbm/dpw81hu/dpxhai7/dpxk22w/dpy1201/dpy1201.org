I'm not familiar with all the stories you linked, but I'll tell you that what makes /Worm/ unique to me is it actually explains and gives reasoning how a scenario that's found in superhero works of fiction could actually occur. It answers questions like: Why can't people with powers just chill? Why do they have to fight all the time? Why don't the super powerful heroes (Eidolon, Panacea etc) just take over the world? Why are there even Endbringers that exist? Why don't they destroy the world? Why doesn't Scion just kill them? It actually answers those questions (I think some of them have already been answered or hinted at for you) in creative ways. For example, the Endbringers are at this point Diabolus ex Machinas but I am so sure you have no idea as to their actual origins or purpose.

Also, I personally find the powers in Worm extremely creative and how they use it. Night (the cloak, flashbang, smoke grenade) and Oni Lee are the best examples of this early on. Are there other examples of works that utilize creative powers effectively like that?
