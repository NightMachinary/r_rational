That would be telling. As multiple people have pointed out, next Arc is going to show you one notable feature, but in regards to worldbuilding... Well, it's not going to come into play for quite some time yet, so read the following if you don't get hooked upon finishing Arc 8: [[#s][Worm | very vague worldbuilding/plot spoiler]]

If that's not enough: [[#s][Worm | much less vague worldbuilding/plot spoiler]]
