  You might as well complain that all the crackers in a box of Ritz all look the same.

They do all look the same! It's such a rip off. I mean, look, you wouldn't get two socks that were exactly the same, would you? At least animal crackers try to mix it up a bit.

  All but one of those works are predated by Worm by years. And Sky High is a flipping comedy.

  Besides, it's weird to call something just another take on the Incredibles, when by this logic you can call the Incredibles another take on literally any other superhero property because superheroes are the most derivative genre in existence to the point that criticizing superhero works for being derivative is completely pointless.

So, I'm not really criticizing /Worm/ here, which a lot of people seem to have taken my remarks as. But I have seen these tropes a lot. Stories in which superpowers spontaneously appear? Check. Stories in which superheroes are regulated? Yes. Stories of kids just getting powers? Uh huh. In particular, all the works I listed are other deconstructions of the superpower tropes. The earliest such work I'm familiar with is /The Incredibles/. If there is an earlier one, I'd be interested in hearing about it. And I know some of them post-date /Worm/, which isn't fair to /Worm/, but I was aware of them first. The real question in all of this is what does /Worm/ bring to the table that is /unique/?

  Wait, so you side with Emma. Meaning that because Taylor doesn't make optimal decisions she deserves to be bullied and socially ostracized by her peers?

Does she deserve the bullying? No, of course not. But she's not doing anything to stop it, either. If you've ever dealt with bullying, you'll know she's doing exactly the wrong things to make it stop. And from Emma's perspective, she might not even realize that what she's doing is wrong. It's just something that's built up over time, each step feeling like the right thing to do. Taylor on the other hand? She was presented with a straight-up choice, and she decided to become a supervillain.
