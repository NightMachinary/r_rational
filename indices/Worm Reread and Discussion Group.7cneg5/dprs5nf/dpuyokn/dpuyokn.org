  It sure looks derivative. I've seen these tropes somewhere before. This is just another take on The Incredibles, isn't it?
#+end_quote

All but one of those works are predated by Worm by years. And Sky High is a flipping comedy.

Besides, it's weird to call something just another take on the Incredibles, when by this logic you can call the Incredibles another take on literally any other superhero property because superheroes are the most derivative genre in existence to the point that criticizing superhero works for being derivative is completely pointless. You might as well complain that all the crackers in a box of Ritz all look the same.

  I really hate Taylor. I'm taking Emma's side on this one. I mean, how can the girl make such consistently bad decisions all the time? She's just a waste of human flesh.

Wait, so you side with Emma. Meaning that because Taylor doesn't make optimal decisions she deserves to be bullied and socially ostracized by her peers? Da fuq?
