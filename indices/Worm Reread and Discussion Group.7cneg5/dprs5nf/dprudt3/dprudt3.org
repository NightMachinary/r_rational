  Why is it called Worm instead of Parahumans?
#+end_quote

The author, Wildbow, likes 4 letter titles. Worm, Twig, Pact, Ward. The title also makes more sense towards the end but it's mostly a stylistic choice.

  It sure looks derivative. I've seen these tropes somewhere before. This is just another take on The Incredibles, isn't it?
#+end_quote

I'm guessing you haven't read much of the story yet. It starts as a standard teenager-cum-superhero story in the first couple arcs but eventually goes off the rails in a very big way.

  I really hate Taylor. I'm taking Emma's side on this one. I mean, how can the girl make such consistently bad decisions all the time? She's just a waste of human flesh.

Eh, I think a bunch of readers here somewhat empathize (hence the debates about whether Worm is 'rational' or not), but it gets better.

  Why Arcs? Each Arc would be a Chapter in any other book! Why it have to be all hipster?
#+end_quote

Worm is 1.7 million words long. That's 8.5x longer than Moby Dick. Arcs are not chapters; breaking the entire story into arcs makes sense.
