I've actually just started reading Worm for the first time. I tried reading it a while back and couldn't get into it. Doing better this time. Some basic thoughts:

- Why is it called /Worm/ instead of /Parahumans/?

- It sure looks derivative. I've seen these [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/31964/Boku_no_Hero_Academia?q=my%20hero%20acade][tropes]] [[https://www.amazon.com/Steelheart-Reckoners-Brandon-Sanderson/dp/0385743572/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1510606012&sr=8-1&keywords=steelheart+brandon+sanderson&dpID=51JJFBMgonL&preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch][somewhere]] [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405325/?ref_=nv_sr_1][before]]. This is just another take on /[[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317705/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1][The Incredibles]]/, isn't it?

- I really hate Taylor. I'm taking Emma's side on this one. I mean, how can the girl make such consistently bad decisions all the time? She's just a waste of human flesh.

- Tattletale, on the other hand, is awesome! We're getting married. As soon as I figure out how.

- Why Arcs? Each Arc would be a Chapter in any other book! Why it have to be all hipster?
