I was thinking about the modern trend of superhero/superpower deconstruction stories. While superhero stories go back a long ways, I'm not looking at anything by Marvel or DC that plays the tropes straight (actually, I probably should mention /[[https://www.amazon.com/Watchmen-Alan-Moore/dp/1401245250][Watchmen]]/, though it's not really part of this trend). I should add /[[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1001526/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1][Megamind]]/ as a supervillain deconstruction to the list as well. I included /Steelheart/ because it does deconstruct (and subvert) the superpower tropes.
