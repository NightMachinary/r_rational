I'm not bothered by the familiarity of /Worm/'s tropes. I read fanfiction explicitly because I /want/ that familiarity. What baffles me is all the love it gets around here when it isn't really bringing anything new to the table. The tropes may be new to you, but I've seen then again, and again, and again. I know it's not fair to /Worm/ when some of those sources post-date it, but maybe that should be a warning to wildbow to hurry up and find a publisher before /Worm/ becomes unpublishable.
