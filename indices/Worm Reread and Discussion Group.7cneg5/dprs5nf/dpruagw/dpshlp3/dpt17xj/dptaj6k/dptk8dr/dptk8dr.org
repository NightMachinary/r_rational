I think if you're bothered by having read other works which try to deal with the superhero genre in new ways, then fair enough that's just your preferences. Since Worm is definitely about dealing with the superhero genre in new ways.

But personally I don't consider that at all to be a negative point for Worm, because I think it deals with the superhero genre in a really interesting and new way I haven't seen elsewhere. And I think I'd describe it as more of a reconstruction of the superhero genre than a deconstruction, taking many hallmarks of the genre and trying to create a world where those make sense and follow from the world's own internal logic.
