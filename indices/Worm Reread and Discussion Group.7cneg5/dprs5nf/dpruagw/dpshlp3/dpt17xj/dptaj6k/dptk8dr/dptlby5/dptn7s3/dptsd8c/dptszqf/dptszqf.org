Prioritising Oathbringer is, of course, entirely reasonable because it's (hopefully) amazing. I think there's decent odds that you'll like Worm when you return to it though, or at least not dislike it for the reason of following the hero's journey in a dull standard way.

Oh, and Taylor is not the main character of the sequel. It's called Ward for utterly unrelated reasons.
