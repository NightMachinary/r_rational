A character is in a zone of comfort,

-Okay, more or less. I wouldn't call her school life comfort, but it was familiar.

But they want something.

-Definitely.

They enter an unfamiliar situation,

-She does.

Adapt to it,

-More or less. Not so much adapts as escalates faster than any one else.

Get what they wanted,

-Hahahaha! Someone in Worm getting what they want? No, that... that just will not happen.

I can see how you might interpret Worm as following the tropes of the Hero's Journey, but this isn't a story about a hero-like protagonist, this is the story of a girl doing the wrong things for the right reasons. It goes off the rails hard and fast and often.
