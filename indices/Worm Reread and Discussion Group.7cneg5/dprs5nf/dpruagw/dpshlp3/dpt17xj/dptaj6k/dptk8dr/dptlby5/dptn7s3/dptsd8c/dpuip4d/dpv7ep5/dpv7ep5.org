It matches pretty well, so far. Understand of course, that the Hero's Journey is broad enough to encompass most stories, and I fully expect /Worm/ to follow the pattern: I just hope for more than that.

[[http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit][Dan Harmon's basic outline:]]

- A character is in a zone of comfort,

- But they want something.

- They enter an unfamiliar situation,

- Adapt to it,

- Get what they wanted,

- Pay a heavy price for it,

- Then return to their familiar situation,

- Having changed.

Since I'm only at Arc 8, I can't say where exactly to line up the pieces. They may very well line up multiple times. For Taylor, her school situation was a familiar routine, from which she admitted she was finding excuses to deviate from. Living with the Undersiders may also qualify as a zone of comfort, from which she doesn't want to deviate. Chapter 6.09, she resists leaving, then in 7.12, she finally makes that decision. And... since that's where I'm at, I can't really say more on that.
