To be fair, /Worm/ is starting to grow on me. As of this writing, I'm on Interlude 7. It still hasn't gone anywhere, but... well, I'm still reading.

/[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39988.Matilda][Matilda]]/ and /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10210.Jane_Eyre?from_search=true][Jane Eyre]]/ are obvious inspirations. Granted, /Harry Potter/ is a watershed in its own right, but arguing that it's /not/ derivative is like saying /Star Wars/ wasn't derivative. Of course it was, but, like /Harry Potter/, it was so flawlessly executed that it also became a new source of inspiration for future generations. I hesitate to say the same of /Worm/.
