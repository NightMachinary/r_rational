How is it another take on The Incredibles? The only thing they have in common is superheroes, and maybe both being subversions, but even that's stretching it.

Worm predates MHA if I remember correctly... Yeah 2011-2013, as opposed to MHA starting in 2014. Also, it isn't centered around a superhero high school, which differentiates it from both MHA and Sky High. That's not even getting into the tonal differences between them all. I haven't heard of Steelheart Reckoners, so I can't really comment on any similarities.

As for why its called Worm... there are a variety of reasons for that that are spoilers, but if you're at Tattletale I can at least tell you this much. A Worm is a contemptible person, a weakling. To "worm" is to maneuver yourself into a position of power. Also, worms are something she can control.

No idea why its arcs though.
