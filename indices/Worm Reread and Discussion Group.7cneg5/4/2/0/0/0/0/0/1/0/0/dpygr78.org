Fair enough, I haven't read /Reckoners/ (which came out after /Worm/ right?). I have read /Mistborn/ (and /Wheel of Time/ if that counts at all, and I will say that I think Wildbow is a better writer and far superior at character development based on my limited experience with Sanderson thus far. /Mistborn/ is fairly simple bad vs evil, whereas pretty much all the characters are, to an almost frustrating degree, shades of gray in /Worm/. For example, I think it's funny you love Tattletale so much when a lot of people passionately hate her and find her a smug, unnecessarily manipulative bitch (but maybe it's because you're still so early on in the story).

Also, overall I find Steven Erikson and especially George RR Martin (who actually arguably overdoes it) far better and more focused on deconstructing fantasy tropes.

I will say I do feel that Sanderson and Wilbow give me a sort of similar feel with their writing. One of the main things, and this is a personal one, is that both of them seem to have zero issues with writing extremely graphic, gut wrenching violence but they completely refuse to even get PG-13 with sexual content. Off the top of my head I can't think of any other authors who do that. Sanderson obviously does it because of his religious leanings, and I have my own, private theories towards why Wildbow does it, but it's really just a personal issue I've come to accept since I'm a very sexual person myself and I consider sex extremely important and wish people were more comfortable about it, especially in America.

But again, I would be really interested in your thoughts when you finally find out what the Endbringers actually are and their motivation.
