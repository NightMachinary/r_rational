  I'm getting really annoyed that people feel the need to point out that Worm was "written" first.
#+end_quote

Cause it's honestly bizarre to me you're using new works as an example of how /Worm/ is unoriginal, it'd be like saying Kurosawa's /Hidden Fortress/ is unoriginal because /Star Wars/ exists. Yes /Worm/ isn't published but I'm confused about your fixation on that especially considering you stated you have a strong interest in fanfiction.

  If I said that Worm was derivative, there'd be a point there (I said it a derivative of The Incredibles, which I stand by
#+end_quote

I don't really see that other than in the broadest stroke, but perhaps that's because you're so early on in the story. For example, you think the government regulates the superheroes in /Worm/? With the arguable exception of a few other countries, it's absolutely the other way around. There's so many differences in /The Incredibles/ - The kids didn't just get their powers and aren't the focus of the story, there's no focus on how or why characters have super powers, the super powers are relatively cliche and not used that creatively, and most importantly superheroes actually are able to just live peacefully, which if you'll keep reading, will find out is literally impossible in /Worm/.

  You realize you're coming off as a fanboy now, right? Before you were defending Worm as an example of characters using their abilities in creative ways, but now it's that the characters are complex shades of gray
#+end_quote

First off, I won't deny that I probably count as a /Worm/ fanboy. I'm not a fanatic and I think people do overhype it up, and honestly it's not as super original as some people paint it as, but I think you also have some bias against the work considering and that you're actively looking for cliches and tropes rather than trying to enjoy the work. I made those comments on /Mistborn/ just to explain why I find /Worm/ a superior work in general, but also because I was surprised you cite Sanderson as an example of someone who's deconstructing fantasy tropes on a level above Wildbow. You actually never addressed my point, as I'm not sure if you would disagree with me on /Mistborn/ being extremely derivative (Downtrodden orphan secretly posses incredible power and is destined to save the world - and discovers said power with the help of an older mentor who is also very powerful; said mentor sacrifices himself in the fight against a great and ancient evil but ultimately the protagonist succeeds with the help of a seemingly minor item/character that was only hinted at in the past - am I talking about /Lord of the Rings/, /Harry Potter/, /Star Wars/, or /Mistborn/? Now do that for /Worm/ and /The Incredibles/ - even up to this point) or if you think it's not representative of his other works which are more deconstructing.

#+begin_quote
  Maybe because I'm a smug, manipulative, condescending jerk myself. I can relate.
#+end_quote

Sorry to hear that, but that wasn't really my point - rather I was trying to show that Wildbow's characters often have wildly subjective interpretations from readers. Who actually roots for the Lord Ruler or Ruin in /Mistborn/ (actually maybe you do). Who doesn't like Vin, Sazed, and Elend?

  I thought Martin's writing was trash. That was maybe... 10 years ago? Read A Game of Thrones, and thought it was vile.
#+end_quote

I mean his writing might be trash (although you imply it's because he has such focus on sex and nudity which I personally find a bit bizarre but to each their own) but that really didn't have anything to do with my point that Martin deconstructs the fantasy cliches far more than Sanderson did in /Mistborn/.
