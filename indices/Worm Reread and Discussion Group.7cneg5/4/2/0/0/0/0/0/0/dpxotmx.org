Well, you did want the story to go off the rails. Doesn't [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocksFallEveryoneDies][dropping a rock on the city]] counts?

Regarding Scion, I don't think his appearance could be called a Deus ex Machina, since waiting for him was explicitly mentioned as a frequent Endbringer fight strategy. It wasn't unexpected, for the characters or for the readers.

  Scion, the Endbringers, and the Source of Powers. Those are the three big questions, right? I stand by my initial assessment: this is all very familiar territory.

Granted, I suppose it would all be, ah, "derivative", if you're using such a broad and acausal definition of this term. But if you liked the content about the Source in Miss Militia's interlude despite this, or if you liked, say, related sections of /The Reckoners/, you'll most likely like /Worm/'s take on the topic very much.

That said, the concepts wouldn't be completely unfamiliar, and your opinion on Taylor probably isn't going to change, if it hasn't already. That given, decide for yourself.

... Or you could list what you like/dislike about the story and I could say whether there's more/less of it further ahead.
