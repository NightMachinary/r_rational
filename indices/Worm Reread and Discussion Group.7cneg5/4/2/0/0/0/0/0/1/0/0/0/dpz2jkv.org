  Reckoners (which came out after Worm right?)
#+end_quote

It was actually published first. /Because/ Worm /hasn't been published./ I'm getting really annoyed that people feel the need to point out that /Worm/ was "written" first. If I said that /Worm/ was derivative, there'd be a point there (I said it a derivative of /The Incredibles/, which I stand by).

#+begin_quote
  and /Wheel of Time/ if that counts at all
#+end_quote

It does not, that was Robert Jordan. Sanderson took his job to mean he needed to mimic the existing style, so it's not really fair to attribute it to him as an example of how he writes.

#+begin_quote
  Mistborn is fairly simple bad vs evil, whereas pretty much all the characters are, to an almost frustrating degree, shades of gray in Worm.
#+end_quote

You realize you're coming off as a fanboy now, right? Before you were defending /Worm/ as an example of characters using their abilities in creative ways, but now it's that the characters are complex shades of gray. If you'd like, I can counter with authors that [[https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=charles%20dickens][do that better]]...? Regardless, a work does not need to be defended against other works. In this context, they're just different examples. It's not like we're handing out writing awards.

  I think it's funny you love Tattletale so much when a lot of people passionately hate her and find her a smug, unnecessarily manipulative bitch
#+end_quote

Maybe because I'm a smug, manipulative, condescending jerk myself. I can relate.

#+begin_quote
  overall I find Steven Erikson and especially George RR Martin (who actually arguably overdoes it) far better
#+end_quote

I tried reading Steven Erikson... I'll probably try again in a few years. I thought Martin's writing was trash. That was maybe... 10 years ago? Read /A Game of Thrones/, and thought it was vile. Was surprised when HBO thought it was worth making a show of. More on that later.

#+begin_quote
  zero issues with writing extremely graphic, gut wrenching violence but they completely refuse to even get PG-13 with sexual content
#+end_quote

So... violence and sex are different things. The fact that both will earn a movie a PG-13 (or R) rating is irrelevant. When writing a /romance/ story, sex is kinda relevant. Neither of these writers is doing that. When writing /action/ stories, violence is rather relevant. Both of these authors are doing that. Asking for sex in an action story... just why?

#+begin_quote
  I consider sex extremely important and wish people were more comfortable about it, especially in America.
#+end_quote

... you've lived a very sheltered life, yes? The 70's are thattaway --->

I'll tackle this from the perspective of movies, having seen quite a few. Sex is kinda central to /[[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061722/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1][The Graduate]]/, but showing it would add nothing to the show. The fact that it happened and how it changes the characters is what's important. Turning the movie into a skin-flick would do nothing. Or how about /[[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054215/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1][Psycho]]/, with its famous shower scene? No nudity, because it wasn't needed; the scene couldn't be more famous if it did show more skin (it would probably be less well known, in my opinion).

Let me arbitrarily divide an audience into two: those intimately familiar with sex, and those who are not. For those who are, writing about and showing depictions of sex is unnecessary. They can fill in the blanks on their own. "Sex goes here" is sufficient. For the other audience, depictions of sex is actively harmful. It skews their expectations, warps their sense of what is normal, and may even make them feel inadequate.

So when HBO picked up /Game of Thrones/ and decided to focus on sex and nudity, I just have to shake my head. It's shameless pandering to the basest desires of their fans.
