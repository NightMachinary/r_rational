  Are there other examples of works that utilize creative powers effectively like that?

Anything by Sanderson, really. He is in fact doing all of these things you talk about, constantly deconstructing (and reconstructing) fantasy settings. I imagine that's one of the reasons he's linked on this sub's wiki.

  For example, the Endbringers are at this point Diabolus ex Machinas but I am so sure you have no idea as to their actual origins or purpose.

Well, more like they're an invocation of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChandlersLaw][Chandler's Law]]; the plot wasn't going anywhere useful, so /wham/. Coil's interlude suggests this may not exactly be the case, but I don't have enough information yet.
