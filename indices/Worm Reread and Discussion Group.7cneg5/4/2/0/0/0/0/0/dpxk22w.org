I finished Arc 8. Combined with the fact the next "Arc" is an extended interlude, this feels like the end of the first volume. I can almost see a flashing neon sign saying "End of Part 1".

The [[http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=407513&type=card][Endbringer]] looks like a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina][Diabolus ex Machina]], (followed by a Deus ex Machina when Scion arrives). As for Taylor's decision at the end (whatever it is), it looks like she's just planning to do the Hero Thing of taking a crappy world and trying to make it better. I don't expect that to go particularly well, but I do expect that she'll learn a great deal about how the world works in the process of trying.

The most interesting part, as far as worldbuilding goes, was Miss Militia's interlude, and her recollection of her trigger event. I get that powers come from somewhere, and while not all of these stories explore that, this isn't exactly new ground. In fact, most superhero stories (when played straight) include an origin story. I would be surprised if /Worm/ deviates from the established pattern and didn't explore where powers come from.

So, Scion, the Endbringers, and the Source of Powers. Those are the three big questions, right? I stand by my initial assessment: this is all very familiar territory.
