To be fair, The Incredibles does attempt to explore superheroes in the context of society instead of ignoring it. When Mr. Incredible causes massive amounts of property damage in the first scene, he (rightfully) gets prosecuted for that. When other super heroes get caught abusing their powers, the public backlash is enough to eventually force the government to ban usage of powers. It even goes so far as to invent some jobs as a result of the powers, such as Edna's super costume profession.

Now, the Incredibles isn't comprehensive or even rational, but it's pretty interesting for a kid's movie.
