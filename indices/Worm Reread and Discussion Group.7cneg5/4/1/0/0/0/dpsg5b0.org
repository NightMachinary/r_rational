That's... a bit unfair. While there are some things that do feel like bullshit handwaves to justify the superhero conceit (passengers, contessa, simurgh) there is also a lot of world building that examined some of the consequences of superheroes. Things such as the existence of rogues using powers for entertainment (Canary), scientists examining powers and their implications (arc 9ish) and the massive efforts the PRT puts towards pr (merchandising, limiting collateral damage, etc).
