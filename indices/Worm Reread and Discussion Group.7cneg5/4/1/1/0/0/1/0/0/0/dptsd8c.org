As I've said elsewhere, I'm at Interlude 7, at the moment. [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34002132-oathbringer?from_search=true][That might not change for a bit.]] If it's just going to do the [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/588138.The_Hero_With_a_Thousand_Faces][hero's journey]] thing, I'll probably get bored. I'm hoping it gets all twisty and loops around on itself -- goes off the rails, so to speak. The fact that the sequel is called /Ward/... isn't exactly a positive sign.
