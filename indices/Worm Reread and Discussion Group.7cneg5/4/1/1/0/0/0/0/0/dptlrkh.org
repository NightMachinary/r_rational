Well let's talk after you finish it. I feel like your points are valid, and you're just looking at it from a different perspective.

This is a subreddit that mostly likes Worm for various reasons, so I feel like your points come off as bashing to some. While I'm sure that isn't the case, you /are/ operating from a limited perspective, insofar that you don't have all the info about the setting etc.

Sidenote, what you are reading is really a draft, and Wildbows first work. His writing, pacing etc all improved from then, which might or might not be relevant to you.
