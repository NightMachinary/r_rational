I might get flak for this, but for me, Worm isn't about it's setting, but about Taylor wading through. The way she is shapes the story and that is a big plus for me.

While I agree there is a lot of works that play with established hero tropes, I feel like calling Worm derivative is unfair in the same sense like calling Harry Potter derivative because stories about kids using magic exist
