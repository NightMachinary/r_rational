If I recall correctly, it did work the way you feared in [[/r/parahumans][r/parahumans]]' IRC: a user's name without any tags would ping the user there. That's where this meme came from, so there's that.

Also, if you want to live dangerously and scare [[/r/parahumans][r/parahumans]]' frequenters, you could write his username this way: =\/u/Wildbow=. It would look so: /u/Wildbow --- and make it seem like you /should/ have pinged him, but didn't.

Alternatively, for maximum evil, do it this way:

=[u/Wildbow](https://www.reddit.com/user/wildbow/)=

Looks so: [[https://www.reddit.com/user/wildbow/][u/Wildbow]]. Is an actual hyperlink to Wildbow's page. /Doesn't/ ping him.

Mwahaha.
