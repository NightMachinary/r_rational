It's another superpower deconstruction story. In this particular subversion, supervillains begin appearing, but no superheroes. An entirely different take on the genre, but still feels similar enough to be worth mentioning. I'm sure there are many other (better) examples that I'm not familiar with. And yes, I'm aware that it (also) post-dates /Worm/.
