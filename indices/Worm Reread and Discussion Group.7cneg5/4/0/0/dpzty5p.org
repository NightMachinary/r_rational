  The author, Wildbow, likes 4 letter titles. Worm, Twig, Pact, Ward. The title also makes more sense towards the end but it's mostly a stylistic choice.

That's a really bad reason. But okay.

  I'm guessing you haven't read much of the story yet. It starts as a standard teenager-cum-superhero story in the first couple arcs but eventually goes off the rails in a very big way.
#+end_quote

I'm in Arc 10, and it hasn't really gone off the rails in any significant manner; at least, not as far as the Hero's Journey goes. (I feel like I've been using that term a lot in this thread when talking about /Worm/. Is that even the right paradigm in which to be thinking about Taylor?)

#+begin_quote
  Eh, I think a bunch of readers here somewhat empathize (hence the debates about whether Worm is 'rational' or not), but it gets better.
#+end_quote

I dislike it when the protagonist carries the idiot-ball. And that's been Taylor since Chapter 1. I gather this sub has similar feelings about hero's who make bad choices simply because the plot demands it.

#+begin_quote
  Worm is 1.7 million words long. That's 8.5x longer than Moby Dick. Arcs are not chapters; breaking the entire story into arcs makes sense.
#+end_quote

I... am coming around on this. The length of each chapter has been getting longer, and they are starting to include scene-breaks. They're feeling more like real chapters. The early Arcs really did seem like little more than elongated chapters.
