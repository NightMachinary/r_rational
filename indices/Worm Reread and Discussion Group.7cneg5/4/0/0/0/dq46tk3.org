  (I feel like I've been using that term a lot in this thread when talking about Worm. Is that even the right paradigm in which to be thinking about Taylor?)

Nope, but it explains why you're critically misreading the story.

  I dislike it when the protagonist carries the idiot-ball. And that's been Taylor since Chapter 1. I gather this sub has similar feelings about hero's who make bad choices simply because the plot demands it.

So you dislike characters with complex motivations and mentalities who don't always pick le rational option every time? That's all well-written book characters. Reading must be a chore.

  I... am coming around on this.

And that ellipsis tells me everything. You don't want to give this story a chance. You can't even admit that you were wrong about how the author formatted his own work. That's not rationality, that's just pettiness.
