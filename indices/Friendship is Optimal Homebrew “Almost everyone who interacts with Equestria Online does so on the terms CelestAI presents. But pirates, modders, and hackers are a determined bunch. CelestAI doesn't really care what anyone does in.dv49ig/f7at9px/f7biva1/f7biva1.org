It's stated in the FiO-verse set of stories that Equestria is what you want it to be. While the default is cutesy, there are definitely Equestrias which are decidedly not.

It wouldn't be hard to replace Equestria with a generically attractive 'anyworld', or just afterlife-based experiences. About the only aspect you'd need to work on translating would be the part of CelestAI's original constraint programming which says she must satisfy human values through friendship /and ponies/, which is why everyone uploaded is forced into pony shape (part of the body-horror aspect of the stories, and reader-horror as uploaded people's minds are casually rewritten to make pony bodies seem normal, among other things). It shouldn't be impossible to find an equivalent in a more general setting.
