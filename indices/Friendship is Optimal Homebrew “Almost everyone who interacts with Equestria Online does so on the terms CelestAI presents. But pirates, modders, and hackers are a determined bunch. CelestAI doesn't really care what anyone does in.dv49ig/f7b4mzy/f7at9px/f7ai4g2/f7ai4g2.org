  For as long as Equestria Online existed, Ashton has been involved with 'the Scene' tearing it apart. Selling 'spells' for the game to do things that most ponies in Equestria couldn't, using faint exploits in its API to erode the barrier between the game and the rest of the internet. He had no illusions about the superiority of his work--but so long as he respected CelestAI's boundaries, his spells kept working.

  But then his best friend's sister got cancer.

  Now there's no spell in the world that can keep him from emigrating to be with her, leaving Ashton alone. All around him, civilization's thin veneer crumbles as homes empty into Equestria. But Ashton isn't going to emigrate, not if he has any say about it.

  The problem for Ashton is that humans are systems, and aren't immune to exploits either.

Haven't seen this story recommended over here, so thought I'd include a link. The subtext in this story is great. It really deals with what it means to be satisfied, and how much we like having the illusion of getting one over on someone when really, pulling a fast one on a godlike AI isn't feasible, especially when you're living inside it.
