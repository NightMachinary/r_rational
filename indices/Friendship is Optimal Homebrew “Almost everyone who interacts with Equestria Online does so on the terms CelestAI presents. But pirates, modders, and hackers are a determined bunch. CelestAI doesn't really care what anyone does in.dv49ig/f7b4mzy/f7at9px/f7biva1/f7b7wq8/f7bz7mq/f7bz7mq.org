How are you on this subreddit? Like 90% of it is fanfiction.

#+begin_quote
  In fanfiction you can write stories set in someone else's universe that you didn't invent to be exploitable, a universe which readers nonetheless aren't pre-blinded to the way they're blinded to the opportunities and horrors of real life. Furthermore, your readers will know that many readers of canon accepted the background inadequacy as something that wasn't out of character for human beings and their civilizations. “Unrealistic, you say? Did you leap out of your chair and yell ‘Nobody in real life would do that!' while you were reading canon? You did? Well, literally millions of other readers didn't.”
