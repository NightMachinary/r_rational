I admit that it's way fun to steeple my fingers, pretend to be Gendo Ikari or Tzeentch, and then, years later, stand in the shower and realize that the broad strokes have gone JUST AS PLANNED, AHAHAHAHAHAAAAAA!!!!!

For instance, this year I've actually finished grad school, got a fairly cool real job, and started volunteering in the lab where I want to do my PhD.

But oftentimes the real pride is when details work out better than you did plan or could have planned, and yet did so because of something you did.
