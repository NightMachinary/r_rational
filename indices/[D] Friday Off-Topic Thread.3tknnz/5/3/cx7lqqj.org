I usually find that planning something beyond a certain optimal period is less effective.

The optimal period depends on the specific context, but generally its within the 6-12 months, where the further plans should have less invested into them as they are more likely to be changed or even cancelled.

Anything beyond 12 months is almost always purely theoretical planning.
