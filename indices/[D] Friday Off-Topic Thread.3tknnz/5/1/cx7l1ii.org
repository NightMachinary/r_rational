When it comes to things like reservations, the problem I have is that I don't know where I'll be in a year. Maybe my preferences change and I don't want to go to that expensive theater come next year. Maybe I'll be in a foreign country, unable to go. Maybe my wife will be giving birth that day. I don't like to "lock in" my decisions so far ahead of time, because there's too many things that can change over that span of time. However, if I can cancel the plans without penalty, then I'd have no problem making the reservation.
