Does anyone else here also like making plans that can extend years in length?

It doesn't have to be to extensive, just something at the minimum of making reservations at that expensive theater for next year, pledging a Kickstarter project that won't pay out for years, saving money over the course of years to pay for a new car, or anything where you know that you won't see any sort of payout for a long time.

Because I hypothesize that people who are more rational will have a greater amount of self-control for delayed gratification, and one super quick and crude way IMHO to estimate self-control is to see if people here are more likely to make very long-term plans.
