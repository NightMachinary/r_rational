I won't be at the New York Secular Solstice this year, because a friend of mine is making a Solstice in Washington. He says he wants less Unitarian Universalist-style pseudohumanism and more straight-up transhumanism.

And he's letting me suggest things for readings and songs.

Leonard Cohen's /Who by Fire/ is very plausibly going in there.

I promise to appear there in my True Form. If you think my True Form is a Kamina cosplay, that's your problem.
