  I'd be interested in hearing how those can be reconciled. I consider transhumanism to be a natural extension of humanism.

I see them as completely orthogonal. Transhumanism is the belief that humanity can (and should) be improved - transhumanists are pretty diverse in their views of just to what end humanity needs to be improved, and even there, for example, I'd wager our views differ radically. Humanism, on the other hand, is a pointless nihilist circlejerk at best, and careless hedonist individualism at worst.
