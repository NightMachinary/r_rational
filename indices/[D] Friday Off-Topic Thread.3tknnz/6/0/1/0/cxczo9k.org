Fracturing a large base of political adherents into a radical minority and a moderate majority harms adherence. The sectarian sociopolitical force is subtracted from the majority's, weakening the push, and the minority is placed at odds with the moderates, even though their cause may be made more attainable by paying lip service to the more moderate stance.

I'm betting you've seen tumblr. SJWism, whatever that might be defined as, tends to be a radical sect of liberalism that has polarized according to a political center that is not nearly the internet's average, let alone their nations'. They remove themselves from discussion with conservatism and even liberalism that they consider conservative for the sake of purity. They attempt efforts that are oblivious of their nations' and the internet's true political center, and they don't support more moderate efforts because compromise with conservatism pollutes their ideological purity.

Sectarianism is, in other words, disregard for consequentialism in order to preserve ideological purity. Those who do so have been taught to value their own righteousness over actual progress (whichever direction it may be in). A body politic is only shifted gradually.

  I mostly approve of transhumanism. I absolutely detest most modern and postmodern formulations of humanism.

I'd be interested in hearing how those can be reconciled. I consider transhumanism to be a natural extension of humanism.
