It's a "systems administration is time consuming" thing. I don't mind paying for a server, but setting up a bunch of services is potentially a big time sink. I know there are other people who want self-hosted alternatives, so it makes sense to share the responsibility for them.

Think of it as communal housing, but for personal servers. You need to trust the other tenants at least a bit.

As for everyone involved having root, I'm imagining this would be a handful of people who more or less trust each other. Their real names would obviously be known.

I already give root out to contractors occasionally, because it's the only reasonable way to handle stuff if you're not doing everything yourself. This isn't really that different.

Shared unix environments are fine, especially with frequent backups and public key authentication.
