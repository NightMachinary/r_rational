(Mostly) Copy/pasted from a similar comment from last week:

  Some of the podcasts I listen to (that make sense to recommend here):

  - Hello Internet: "Two-guys talking" podcast about a variety of topics. Alternates between interesting discussions and somewhat silly jokes/callbacks. One of the hosts (Grey) is a transhumanist and sometimes says things that make it seem like he has to have read some of Less Wrong.

  - Cortex, Reconcilable Differences (Two podcasts): Similar in genre to Hello Internet, but a bit less silly. Cortex has Grey from Hello Internet.

  - ATP: Like the above but with a tech news (esp. Apple) focus. Can be boring if you aren't interested in that, but is often fun anyway.

  - Rationally Speaking: Julia Galef (CFAR President) has conversations with people about their ideas.

  - Econtalk: Conversations between Russ Roberts and various economists/people in related fields. Not fun to listen to if you dislike libertarian ideas.

  - Worm Audiobook and HPMOR Podcast (Two podcasts): Enjoy great stories while doing other things!

  - Dear Hank and John: Kind of embarrassing to admit, but I like this, even though I stopped watching Vlogbrothers videos a long time ago.

  - The Weeds: Conversations between journalists about policy issues, rather than politics. Just put out a good episode about Basic Income Guarantees.

  - StartUp: Short episodes about the business of being a Start Up. Very well produced.

  - About Race: Occasionally frustrating exercise in overcoming anti-SJW sentiments through exposure therapy / conversations between mostly reasonable sounding people about why race is still a big deal and we should care a lot.

  - Waking Up with Sam Harris: Smarter and less crazy than you'd think if you've moved away from "New Atheism". Haven't listened to many episodes, but I've enjoyed those I have.

  General Podcast Tips:

  - Think of something you like. Now google that thing + "podcast" or just search for that term in itunes or your podcast app.

  - Slowly increase your listening speed. I listen at 3X speed, and it's great.
