[[http://theleagueofnerds.co.uk/][The league of Nerds]] (The podcast for the modern nerd!) is one of my favorite podcasts. It's a fun and reasonably varied podcast about science, pseudo-science, anti-science and conspiracies. The two hosts produce it purely for fun as a hobby.

[[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00snr0w/episodes/downloads][The Infinite Monkey Cage]], a bbc 4 radio show also available as a podcast. Hosted by Robin Ince and Brain Cox, tends to invite over a mix of comedians and scientists to talk about sciency stuff.

If you're into (pc) gamiing I'd recommend the [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFE010B0EEA9E5F06][Co-optional podcast]] (We do occaionally talk about video games!). Where if they're not talking about random nonense, they talk about the games they've been playing, gaming related news of the past week and upcoming new releases. They can be silly as hell, which I find quite amusing.
