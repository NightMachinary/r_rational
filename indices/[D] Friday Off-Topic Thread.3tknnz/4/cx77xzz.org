Speaking of japanesegameshows, has anyone seen Takeshi's Castle? It's what MXC was based off of, to give it some context.

Watching it in the original japanese with subs is pretty fun. They're all like "Try your best!". It's very endearing. I find MXC pretty unpleasant, but Takeshi's Castle is alright.
