Do you bother to save copies of fanfiction that you read? Which have you saved?

--------------

Currently, I have exactly one hundred and fifty .epub files of fanfiction ([[http://pastebin.com/hZ7uaQnr][an up-to-date list]]--numbers won't match, since some books are multi-volume and some files are collections). I haven't read quite /all/ of them, but I've probably read more than ninety-five percent of them. I don't save every story that's in my FanFiction and FIMFiction lists of "favorites" (summing to 277 and 197 stories, respectively), however.
