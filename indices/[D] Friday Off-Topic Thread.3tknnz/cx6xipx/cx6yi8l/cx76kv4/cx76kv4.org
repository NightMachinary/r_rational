Well, that's a lot! Do you really hold so many stories in high estimation? Or do you just download everything that you like in the slightest, with little discrimination?

For the /Friendship Is Magic/ stories, why do you download them as .html rather than .epub? (I vaguely remember seeing some complaints several months ago about error-laden .epub files from FIMFiction.net, but I've never experienced any problems.)

For the "other fanfiction", on what canons are they based?
