FiM has comparatively more abundant per capita high-quality fanfic (from the perspective of someone with societally-conformist male preferences), as, opposed to the FF.net crowd, the fimfiction crowd tends to be slightly older and rather male-er.

For example, I have slightly less than 170 pony fics currently tracked (although most have stopped updating) and have read dozens of oneshots, while I also have about 170 non-pony fics being tracked (it's a little weird how that worked out).

It does help that fimfiction is superior in most ways to ff.net, and is better for non-smut fics than AO3.

edit: I misunderstood your post as asking why there were a lot of FiM fics in particular, but I'll just post this anyways.
