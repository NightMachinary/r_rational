I downloaded them all before I got the Kindle, and I read them locally on the computer. I didn't want to then find and format all of the links so Calibre could download them, so I just changed the extension, and it turned out Kindle processed the HTML fine. And Kindle doesn't read epubs.

I download almost everything that interests me (and has a non-terrible description) before reading, and delete it if it sucks. After reading, I usually only download stuff I really like. It just occurred to me that I may have a local copy of [[#s][]]'s deleted fic, so I'm going to try to find that.

Naruto (the one I'm focused on right now), Worm, HP, Kill la Kill, and Meguca (which is suffering).
