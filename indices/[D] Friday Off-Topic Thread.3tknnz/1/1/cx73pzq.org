When I was younger, I had limited computer internet access, and I didn't have a cellphone. Plus, back then, smartphones weren't a thing. They didn't start rising in prominence until the early 2010's where I grew up. So I use to manually copy and paste FF.net fics into a notepad file (fuck those authors that had like 100+ chapter fics :( ), parse them with a program called jsplit into 4 KB chunks and read them on my 1st gen ipod Nano. The notes program didn't let you read past 4 KB back then, hence the need for splitting. I say that to say, I USED to be a determined little bastard about saving my favorite fanfics, for later perusal.

Now, I mostly don't bother, as the only reason I'd have to save them is if I lacked an internet connection, as I figure I'll remember or re-stumble across any fanfiction that's worth a re-read. And since I have data on my phone (and prefer to read on it anyway) and wifi at both home and work, there's little reason for me to save them. I do, however, have a number of novels on my kindle app that I've downloaded, such as the Name of the Wind series of books, the Martian, the Tao of Badass, etc.
