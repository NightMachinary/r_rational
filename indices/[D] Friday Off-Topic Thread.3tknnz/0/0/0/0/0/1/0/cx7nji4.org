That is precisely what the concept of injection in Permutation City is about. Functionally it is no different, just another form of universe "transfer." There's the question of when the measure of the observer in that universe having a falsified parent is greater than the measure of the observer in that universe genuinely descended to that universe. Then there's the idea of descending through upload, but actually ascending because the upload was an interface that the parent universe was reading from. This shit is an undirected web of substrates.

I referred later, however, to an information-theoretical sort of falsification, where interference from the parent affects the child, violating the physics of the child universe. To use an analogy, the zero geodesic of the child universe in its configuration space is modified, possibly to a set of zero geodesics that are very low probability.

I'm unsure as to whether this would ever result in a reasonable confirmation of a parent universe; once interference ceases, the child resumes a zero geodesic through configuration space, with a past that 'never actually happened,' yet is evidenced by configuration that does not seem consistent or even possible, e.g. intelligent minds that are all disconfirmed in one or more beliefs. A fictional example could be Flash Forward, where (non-canon) a simulation of Earth is fed a Navikov-consistent vision of the future state of that simulation (which doesn't have to be computed to convergence; the parent can simply accelerate the universe's configuration trajectory wholesale). Or perhaps a monolith replaces Times Square and has always been there, or a large quantity of people think Nelson Mandela died earlier than he actually did.

My own intuition on this was fooled upon encountering the Berenstein/Berenstain controversy. The last two are real-life examples (ridiculous for it), and my System 2 prevailed, but System 1 was virtually convinced. With /some/ physical configuration, it will eventually become more plausible that the observer was entirely formed from Hawking radiation than wrong about the 'false' memory and right about everything else. What evidence would be required to convince a rational observer of a parent universe?
