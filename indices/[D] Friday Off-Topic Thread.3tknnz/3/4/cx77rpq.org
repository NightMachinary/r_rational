Here's a few I haven't seen other people mentioned:

- /Death, Sex & Money/ is fantastic podcast about the things people love to think about but never talk about.

- /Radiolab/ does long-form reporting on fascinating stories.

- /In Our Time/ is a show sponsored by the BBC (I think) about a huge range of scientific, historical and philosophical topics.
