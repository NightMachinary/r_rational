Any conceivable mathematical structure containing computation power equal or greater to that which is required to compute our universe's physics (Turing or hyper-Turing) must be considered a possible simulator. The only prior you /might/ be able to induce over that is Solomonoff's or a hyper-Turing equivalent. The only evidence we have is anthropic.

In Tegmark-IV metaphysics, all possible simulators are actual, and without outside interference, indistinguishable. I don't believe this is a trap for inaction or an unresolvable utility function, but it is interesting to think about.

The simulation argument you're referring to is a (at least partially) wishful resolution to an anthropic problem. Why was the observer (the solipsistic 'I') sampled at the early stages of human history? One option is the Doomsday Argument; that it is not the early stages of humanity and the sample is typical of the distribution. An alternative is that the atypicality has been selected for/is illusory and that the observer sampled is actually at a typical point in a greater obscured distribution.

This might even be probable, but Tegmark would imply a simulator above that universe just as it would imply above this universe. The anthropic probabilities might change in the transition, but again, I'm not even sure what prior you would apply to Tegmark-type frameworks, if any are even applicable.

The info virus has me. I never should have read The Finale of the Ultimate Meta Mega Crossover for the twentieth time.

EDIT: I believe the point of TFUMMC may have been that there is no such thing as a 'real' universe, a 'bottom-level' in the Tegmark-IV multiverse. In a finite hierarchy of simulations, a bottom level is unprovable, only falsifiable by observing a parent universe through ascension (and this is relative to the observer). Since the outside context is entirely independent of the inside, you cannot know if you are in a bottom-level universe or not. We can only infer our status based on the measure assigned to Tegmark-IV universes.

Additionally, the only way out of a simulation is by a process akin to uploading, i.e. the remains of the observer in the child universe upon ascension is a don't-care variable. There is potential for continuous transition, which would involve the parent universe affecting the child and revealing itself as parent. But again, that's dependent on the parent universe entirely, and can't be relied upon to determine the child's status in a hierarchy.

EDIT: Also, consider the possibility of a [[https://intelligence.org/2013/10/25/bas-steunebrink-on-sleight/][simulational bungalow,]] concept derived from the collapse of an infinite reflective tower to a finite 'reflective bungalow'. Instead of ascension into the physics of the parent universe, the parent simulator forms another universe for the child elements to ascend into. That means that even within Tegmark-'real' finite simulational towers there lie infinite simulational towers.

EDIT: The brain could even be considered a simulator running a mental universe (it is a mathematical structure after all). It is akin to our universe being a bubble of subphysics in the superphysics of the theoretical Eternal Inflation, or one brane in a vast number. Ascension of a mind into a parent involving different physics would necessitate a translation process, another form of upload, where the causal relations of the mind are best translated from the physical encoding of the child universe to the physical encoding of the parent. This is almost entirely masturbatory, though.
