Rescue simulations are the only rational formulation of a heaven for the would-be dead. I love the concept in fiction. There were a few Friendship is Optimal fics that used this, one of them Balthasar999's incredibly excellent [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/211153/friendship-is-optimal-somnium][Somnium.]] This concept (when referring to post-death reconstructive simulations in the probably/mostly-same universe) is also referred to as logical/digital immortality, which I discussed [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/mu2/digital_immortality_map_how_to_collect_enough/csi5?context=1#csi5][last time I was on LessWrong.]]

For some reason the idea of getting your random sampling on the historical individual's specification wrong was referred to as 'acausal trade,' as there are universes with alternate Everett histories to the historical individual's observed history that nevertheless awake the 'correct' version, and there is a chain of misplaced mind specifications that eventually travels up to the Everett history that that individual would find correct.

This 'acausal trade' is not even necessary, as when you have true random sampling (using our own universe's random number generator) there will be one future Everett branch that undeniably contains the 'real' individual in question. Never mind the fact that the resurrected individual will not care or notice anything different about themselves.

It is most certainly a form of simulation ascension. :D

I'm not sure that discretization is necessary for hypercomputation, which could certainly enter the picture when talking about parent simulators. But yes, any level of discretization may be possible. Picture tenths of a Planck length. Picture Planckths of a Planck length. We don't know if our form of quantum physics even uses real numbers, there's no way to tell yet.
