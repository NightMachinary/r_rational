  I'm not sure that discretization is necessary for hypercomputation, which could certainly enter the picture when talking about parent simulators.

I was raising that mostly to bring up the idea that what matters is not the measure of the simulations that contain a mathematically-identical world, but rather the measure of the versions of you that you could be given your current observations. Like you said, weirdness in the human brain with simulations arising generative models.
