On the one hand, I'm pretty sure I'm confused now.

On the other hand, if you can't /causally/ interact with the "other versions" of you, in what sense do they exist? Sure, blah blah measure blah blah conceivable, but without causal interaction, you never /have specific reason/ to expect to be an accurate simulation of yourself with greater probability than you expect your arm to morph into a banana (which could also happen in a simulation). And without causal interaction, it's not like you can control what happens to you anyway, soooooo...

These all feels to me like an artifact of our brains mistaking generative arrows for causal arrows, when in fact only a very few generative arrows are causal arrows, and most generative models are extreme compressions that abstract away much of the real causal mechanism.

This makes me wish I know enough about current statistical work on causality to write an algorithm that can tell the difference.
