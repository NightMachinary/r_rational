TFUMMC got me too. I find it difficult to think any other way now. To make the conclusion here a bit more directly accessible:

For every version of you that exists in a hypothetical "base universe", there exists a copy in a simulated universe that is absolutely identical. This is not impossible, even due to entropic decay and conservation and complexity, because the universe simulating ours could have physics that support real computers! There exists a copy of you, with /identical/ mind-state, in a simulated universe that is not identical because it is discretized but still /indistinguishable/ because it is discretized on a sufficiently small scale as to be undetectable and the simulation has a higher-level model of you!

This is what [[/u/Transfuturist]] means when he says you have to infer "based on the measure assigned to Tegmark-IV universes". Your only option is to make decisions by averaging over every possible version of you based on how "likely" each version is, which is called "measure" in the math.

TFUMMC also raises the interesting idea of "rescue simulations", which I find to be extraordinarily weird but intriguing from the perspective of my own personal consciousness and potential immortality. There are innumerable versions of me that were arbitrarily uploaded from a version of me a fraction of a second ago, and another innumerable set that will be arbitrarily and randomly uploaded from a version of me from ten seconds from now. The only question is, again, /measure/.
