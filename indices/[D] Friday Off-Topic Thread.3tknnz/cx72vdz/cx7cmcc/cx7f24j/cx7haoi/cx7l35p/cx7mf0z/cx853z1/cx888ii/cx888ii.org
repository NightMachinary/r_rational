Well, start with this question: You have some observations; how do you know which universe your observations come from? You don't. What you do have, though, is in some sense a huge set - way up the arithmetic hierarchy - that is the set of universes that agree with your observations. And then you can ask questions to that set like "what proportion of these universes contain event X?". And that's how probability works in that situation. The set of universes where events conspire to cause your arm to morph into a banana is /smaller/ than the set of universe where they don't, because morphing your arm into a banana is a much smaller "target" for a simulation to hit, in an information-theoretic sense.

Eh, generative models are basically a neat way to do a numerical approximation of Naive Bayes. They don't work unless you have a model that reflects reality in some way. The key is that your neat trick lets you then use it to make decisions without having to compute the inverse, which can in many cases be really super hard.
