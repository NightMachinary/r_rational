Uhhhh, a generative model is just any model of the prior-times-likelihood rather than model of the posterior directly (discriminative). I can go find more references for you when I'm off mobile.

Also, the problem with saying my arm is unlikely to turn into a banana because it's information-theoretically harder is that Tegmark 4 includes universes and multiverses which are only computable with an uncountable infinity of Turing Oracles and in which /information theory doesn't work the same way it does here/. There's no such thing as a well-founded simplicity prior over Tegmark 4, to my knowledge.
