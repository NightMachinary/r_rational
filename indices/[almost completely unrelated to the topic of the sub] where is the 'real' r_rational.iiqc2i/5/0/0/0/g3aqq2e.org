  all the policies Trump pushes that put migrants in cages

This is exactly an example of what that post is criticizing:

#+begin_quote
  Many people have tried to tell me this post “didn't age well”, but I think they're just continuing to make the same mistakes this post warns against. For example, this post warns against thinking of Trump's opposition to immigration as some sort of shocking new development when it's similar to other immigration opposition from other presidents of both parties. I predicted that Trump would not deport more people than Obama. Given all of the evidence of ICE atrocities, I've gotten a lot of people writing me to complain about how wrong I obviously was, but this is on track to be correct -- Obama deported more people in 2010 than Trump did in 2017, and ICE was pretty atrocious during his administration too. *If it doesn't seem that way, that's because my original thesis is still correct -- Trump is acting within the (worst parts of the) US mainstream, but the media is spinning it as an unprecedented atrocity.* (bolding mine)

Those cages were constructed and used under the Obama administration, and many of the pictures used in news stories about them were actually taken prior to Trump taking office. It's a really good example of taking something that's a fairly normal bit of awfulness that Trump also engaged in, and pretending that it's a feature of Trump instead of our mainstream.

  By the logic Scott uses, as long as someone says they aren't racist, you aren't allowed to call them racist.

He also addresses this:

  This is just a tiny representative sample, but the rest is very similar. Trump has gone from campaign stop to campaign stop talking about how much he likes and respects minorities and wants to fight for them.

  And if you believe he's lying, fine. Yet I notice that people accusing Trump of racism use the word “openly” like a tic. He's never just “racist” or “white supremacist”. He's always “openly racist” and “openly white supremacist”. Trump is openly racist, openly racist, openly racist, openly racist, openly racist, openly racist, openly racist. Trump is running on pure white supremacy, has thrown off the last pretense that his campaign is not about bigotry, has the slogan Make American Openly White Supremacist Again, is an openly white supremacist nominee, etc, etc, etc. And I've seen a few dozen articles like this where people say that “the bright side of a Trump victory is that finally America admitted its racism out in the open so nobody can pretend it's not there anymore.” (All of those 'openly racist's are links in the original post to different people saying exactly that.)

It's more fair to say the Scott's point is that as long as someone says they aren't racist, you aren't allowed to call them *openly* racist.
