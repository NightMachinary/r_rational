If you're looking for more general principles of thinking and acting rationally, rather than any specific question you'd like answered, I'd recommend the Sequences [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Sequences][on the same website]] (Or its compilation in [[https://intelligence.org/rationality-ai-zombies/][book form]], which can be downloaded on a pay-what-you-want-basis).
