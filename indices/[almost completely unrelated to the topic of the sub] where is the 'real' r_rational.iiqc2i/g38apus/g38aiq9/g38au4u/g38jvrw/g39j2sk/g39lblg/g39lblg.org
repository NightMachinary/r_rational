In general I think there isn't a single subreddit which you can rely for advice about all sorts of topics. I would recommend a subreddit that flairs and verifies experts in specific topics, like for science, [[/r/askscience]]. Lesswrong often attempts to substitute an expert knowledge base and years of studying with basic reasoning and bayesian statistics, and that approach is shallow at best and give deeply misleading answers at worse. If you just want to have fun talking about a topic with people that like thinking, that's one thing, but if you are looking for genuinely right answers, that's another.

I've seen two recommendations for [[/r/slatestarcodex][r/slatestarcodex]]... but I've gradually been turned off from it, as the way it allows people to express any view so long as they obey rules about charitably and citing sources has allowed the alt-right to use it as a starting point in a pipeline. It may have gotten better since the culture war open threads were discontinued, but the spin-off subreddit, themotte, aimed at continuing the sort of discussion the culture war threads had has gotten even worse with full-on mask-off 14 words (rephrased into thousands of words with multiple citations to obey the rules). themotte also claims to allow any discussion and be neutral, but the moderation is much stricter with mainstream leftist positions and soft on hardcore White Nationalists positions.

As for the blog slatestarcodex itself... Scott Alexander claims to charitably search through multiple sources and to be a left-leaning centrist... but there is a systematic pattern where he fails to grok basic leftist principles and his attempts at reading leftist material fails in a way that misses the point, while right-wing material gets a much more charitable reading. I am not sure if he is naive, or Dunning-Krugering himself, or unaware of his own biases, or if he is outright hiding his power level, but it is something to keep in mind when reading from his blog. The overall effect is that the Overton window of slatestarcodex is dragged to the right even as Scott Alexander insists that he is center left.

For a clear example of this, Scott wrote a piece (prior to the 2016 election I think?) about how Donald Trump isn't really any more racist or worse than the average Republican and the people who are warning about his racism and fascism are "crying wolf". The whole piece is weird for partially acknowledging how racist Republicans are but for the most part serving to try to say Trump isn't that bad. So it acknowledged Trump was bad but overall tried to normalize Trump, so it was heavily liked by Trump supporters even if Scott managed to avoid being "pro-Trump" per se. It was a weird angle to come from and it really made me question what motivates Scott to write a given post (and thus suspicions about him hiding his power level). And Scott has commented on some of his older posts before but never to my knowledge recanted on that post so yeah...
