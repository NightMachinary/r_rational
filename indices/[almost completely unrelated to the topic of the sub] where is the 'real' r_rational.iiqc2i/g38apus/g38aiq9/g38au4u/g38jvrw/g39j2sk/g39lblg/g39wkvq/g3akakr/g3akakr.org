I don't think Scott is himself alt-right, just that I would assign a significant non-zero probability to that possibility.

Even taking this as what he says... Scott is asking people to downplay Trump in order to avoid causing anxiety for people that get stressed about world issues. That seems like a a really weird take. Also, Scott's take on racism in that post is just as stupid as I remember. By the logic Scott uses, as long as someone says they aren't racist, you aren't allowed to call them racist.

I think the real aim of Scott is revealed in your paraphrase:

#+begin_quote
  People like me --- a left-leaning Jewish atheist in the Bay Area --- don't really have much to fear from them.
#+end_quote

Scott is in a privileged position in which all the policies Trump pushes that put migrants in cages and hurt various disadvantaged groups aren't actually a perceived risk to himself by Scott, but being labeled a racist is perceived as a risk by Scott. Thus Scott spends thousands of words to normalize Trump and to get people to stop using the word racist. It's not alt-right, but it is some [[/r/enlightenedcentrism]] and alt-righters find it useful because it gives them more room to mask themselves (hence the culture war thread gradually getting colonized by altrighters until Scott shut it down and they spun off into themotte).

This pattern is continued in other posts. The anti-reactionary faq tries really hard to steelman reactionaries. And Scott doesn't agree with neoreactionaries, but by taking their ideas seriously, he drags the Overton window of his blog and the commenters he attracts rightward. Conversely, Scott fails at his attempts to steelman leftists ideas...

To get back to u/[[https://www.reddit.com/user/wooohooohooo/][wooohooohooo]]'s question. If they do chose to make slatestarcodex the place they hang out on reddit, they should avoid going go themotte and keep an eye open on what other subreddits people who post in SSC also frequent. To give an example sometimes a person is just interested in IQ as a measure of intelligence... and sometimes they have an agenda to push to argue that IQ is a valid measure of intelligence in order to argue that African people are less intelligent.
