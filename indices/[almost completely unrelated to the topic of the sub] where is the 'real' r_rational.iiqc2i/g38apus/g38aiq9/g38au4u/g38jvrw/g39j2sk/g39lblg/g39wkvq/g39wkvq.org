Scott Alexander is about as alt-right as Richard Dawkins is religious.

#+begin_quote
  For a clear example of this, Scott wrote a piece (prior to the 2016 election I think?) about how Donald Trump isn't really any more racist or worse than the average Republican and the people who are warning about his racism and fascism are "crying wolf".

"You Are Still Crying Wolf" is from after the election. You might be curious to note some of the comments that he's added to the top of it since then. [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/11/16/you-are-still-crying-wolf/][Here's the link.]]

What's more, a whole bunch of that essay is basically saying "Actual alt-right and white-supremacists are few in number and almost insignificantly politically weak. People like me --- a left-leaning Jewish atheist in the Bay Area, so nominally a political, racial, religious, and sectional foe of these people --- don't really have much to fear from them. Please stop scaring my patients; they have enough anxiety already."

(I thought at the time that he was wrong about Trump, but right about the KKK. I think this is basically correct today.)
