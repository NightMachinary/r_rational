I'll recommend the Licanius trilogy as one of the best time travel stories I've ever read. It's not a “rational” story like some of these suggestions but it's a modern fantasy story with a closed loop time travel situation.

If you give it a spin with a time travel focus, I'll note that the degree to which time travel is important increases with each book in the series (in the first it's only noticeable in like 3 places, but later books give you more appreciation for how it all rolls up)
