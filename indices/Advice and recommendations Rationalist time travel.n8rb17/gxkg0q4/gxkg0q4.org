There's some time loop story that's been posted here before that I can't remember the name of. It's all in a Google Doc, the names of countries are all like Empire, Republic and State, very literal. The protagonists name was Dave. Hopefully someone else remembers the name.

The plot is after a certain point, whenever he dies he's able to completely control the flow of time from an out of body perspective between the beginning and his death, allowing him to reinsert himself into his body at any point. This creates a flexible time loop where he can retry a specific scenario many times and make iterative improvements. The world is always blown up at the end of roughly 24 hours, killing him instantly. This is what he tries to stop and investigate.
