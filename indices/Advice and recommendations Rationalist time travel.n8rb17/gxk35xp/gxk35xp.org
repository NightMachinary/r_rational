Recursion was a mindbending fuckery. Its mechanics involves all parties remembering both timelines only after the date of travel. Heard its getting a netflix adaptation.

The Destiny's Crucible series is another great read that deals with Time Travel adjacent themes. An engineer is displaced into a pre-renaissance world with nothing but his body. Deals with worldbuilding themes.
