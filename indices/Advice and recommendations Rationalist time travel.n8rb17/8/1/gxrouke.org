I don't think RI touched on determinism at all. RI subscribed to fatalism, not determinism. In the real world with a single timeline, they're near functionally the same. But with RI and time travel, it was definitely fatalism. The clearest example was Red Lotus Demon Venerable's attempts to save his wife. He did different things, but it was her fate to die and so she always did.
