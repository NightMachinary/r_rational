I think "tedium" is highly subjective. 4 me at least tedious tasks wich can be performed without paticipation of "higher" cognitive functions (like conveting code from one programming languadge to another, or laying bricks, or digging etc) could be strangely plesurable and not tiring at all, as opposed to task wich require low-intencity use of higher cognitive functions, like learning langudage. I totally can imagine that "flowing" though the predetermend sequence of perfect combat actions could be fun, akin to performing kata.
