Well, the reason I don't buy bitcoin today isn't because I don't really care about being rich in the future due to hyperbolic discounting.

I'm very confident my future self will be grateful if I exercise today, however, that still doesn't motivate me enough to get off the sofa. I'm not so confident my future self will be happy I put my savings into crypto.
