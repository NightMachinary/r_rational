I really like this. thank you. It makes me think of [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/geNZ6ZpfFce5intER/akrasia-hyperbolic-discounting-and-picoeconomics][hyperbolic discounting]] and a thought experiment. If you could go back to your past body, what would you do? And then you ask yourself why you don't do some of those things now in your current body. I.E. 'I would ignore school get an underwater welding certificate and just spend a few weeks reading all the books in my backlog that I say I'll get to tomorrow'. So, why not quit your job now, get the certificate and stop adding stories and books to the backlog.

Even for loopers hyperbolic discounting means they would want to eat good food and mess around more than they would want to do something that is (subjectively) a few months or even a few hours away.
