IMO, time is meaningless if I loop (without set max loop limit).

I'm not aging, I'm not losing opportunity cost to do something else.

It does depend on what I'm looping for. If it's something that enables me, (ie, I achieve it, options open), then it is certainly worth to do so.

Just looking flashy for flashy sake? Then yes. there is no point.
