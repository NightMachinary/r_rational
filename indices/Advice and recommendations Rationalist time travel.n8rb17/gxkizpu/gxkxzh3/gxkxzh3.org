  One of the things that irks me about time loop stories is how much is just assumed to be possible with sufficient skill or attempts, without taking into account the human costs. Resets aren't free, they cost time and effort.

There is no cost beside memory space and possible memory degradation/trauma. Mechanics of new memory merging into t_0 brain usually not shown explicitly, but it's often implied that brain is not damaged in any way. Loop is usually supported by some magic/soul or other supenatural means, so memory extension or trauma healing is not out of order. Effectively zero cost is implied, especially in comparison to the cost/energy of the loop itself.

  While it's super cool to show someone using their knowledge of the future and ability to practice forever to completely nail some trick.

It doesn't have to be perfect, just enough to work /most/ of times. Because of loop.

#+begin_quote
  most people stuck in a time loop are going to be much more conservative than most of these stories show.
#+end_quote

Strongly disagree. Courage/recklessness /is/ trainable. There is a lot of people taking insane risks without loops. With loop long enough any person will be like that.
