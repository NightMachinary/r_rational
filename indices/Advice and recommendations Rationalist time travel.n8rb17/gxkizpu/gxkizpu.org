1. As mentioned elsewhere in this thread, the movie "Next" focuses on someone who can see a short bit into the future, and is loosely based on the short story "The Golden Man". To me, those are iconic in terms of seeing into the future, along with Dr. Manhattan, who you've already mentioned.
2. One of the things that irks me about time loop stories is how much is just assumed to be possible with sufficient skill or attempts, without taking into account the human costs. Resets /aren't free/, they cost time and effort. While it's super cool to show someone using their knowledge of the future and ability to practice forever to completely nail some trick. The way I think about it is basically thinking about Olympic level athletes and how often /they/ can nail their hardest tricks or routines. There are always going to be risks and payoffs, and most people stuck in a time loop are going to be /much/ more conservative than most of these stories show. I also tend to think of it in terms of speedrunning, and how important tricks need consistent setups, and if there's risk involved, even top level speedrunners will sometimes "waste" a second or two making sure everything is going to actually work. A lot of the flashy stuff you see in time loop stories /kills the protagonist/ if done incorrectly, and worse, costs several hours, sometimes /days/ of setup. This gripe, if taken seriously, would lead to a deconstruction of the subgenre, but I'm not sure it should be taken seriously, because it knocks down a cool thing and has nothing neat to replace it with. People /like/ the flashy stuff, even if it often leaves me thinking "okay, how much time did it take to master that, and how much risk goes into attempting it every time". A lot of stories will treat it like there are checkpoints, even when there aren't supposed to be.
3. Nope, got nothing for you.
4. Beware of the ability to go recursive, i.e. to relay information back more than you want by using your ability to look to the future in the future you're looking at. Aside from that, probably best to think about what's easy to get for your protagonist and what's hard to get, at least in terms of information, the most valuable resource. Stories rely on tension and conflict, so some things probably become trivially easy, and others probably not so much. People /like/ seeing the trivially easy stuff, as spectacle, but usually only in small doses. Think about the flashiest stuff the power allows, and be sure to sprinkle it in at appropriate moments, mostly for fun.
