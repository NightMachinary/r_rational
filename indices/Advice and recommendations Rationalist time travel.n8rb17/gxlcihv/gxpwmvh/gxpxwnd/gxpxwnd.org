Cool! Remember to answer RHI comment when you've written some chapters! I'll gladly read them! Extra suggestion. Time looper Vs precog. Try to define right away the advantages and disadvantages each has over the other. The reader doesn't need to know (right away) about the antagonist's strengths and weaknesses, but for the protagonist that's going to be a must probably!
