Webcomic, not book.

The thing is, the time traveller went back to that point because, in the /time traveller's history/, he had never appeared at that point in time. Time travel in the Magellan universe follows a "it splits the timeline" model - so the future that the precog saw was the future /without/ the time traveler's involvement. (And a different character began to suspect time travel after a different precog's visions started becoming inaccurate due to the time traveller's actions). Had the time traveller arrived anywhere else and then journeyed to meet the precog, however, then the precog would have see it because the precog would be seeing the future of that /particular/ post-split timeline.
