1) Examples of good (time travel/time loops/prescient characters) in movies or stories?

Time Travel like it is done in DC Legends of Tomorrow and The Flash is a prime example of how NOT to do time travel. There's no consistency, there's no way it works like that. If you kill the Greatgreatgreatfather of someone, they never existed, not disappear in a lightshow screaming. Everything they've done is moot. Just saying.

On RoyalRoad there's this new novel about someone that can basically reset time, mostly like Mother of Learning, but there's no one month time limit and he's the one actually time looping out of his own volition. It's called The Perfect Run and it's hilarious. Don't know how much can it help you, but it might give you best insights into what you want to write maybe?

2) Aspects of (time travel/time loops/prescient characters) that you particularly love or particularly hate?

Good aspects of time travel? Consistent time traveling, like in HP (canon), where everything that will happen in the time traveling situation, has already happened. Hard to pull it off, I think. You need to know everything that will happen in advance, basically writing the whole story all at the same time, and not "making things as I go". Which is admittedly a good way to write anyway!

Precognition characters are kind of easy if it's one ONE. With TWO or MORE, it gets complicated. It's like Edward vs Alice in Twilight playing chess. It's one or two moves, and both know who's won the game. Everything will play in their minds, and writing about a character thinking that his enemy knows what he's thinking of doing and he'd do that because his enemy would have done something else is difficult to make interesting. Not impossible, but difficult. It's usually good at the END of the story, because then you can make a character say "I knew you would do that based on the idea I'd do this! So I did this and that instead, I won!" Like in the last chapters of Death Note. A whole story about two precogs though? Tough!

Time looping is the easiest to do. The whole universe gets basically reset, so there's no unconsistencies to speak of. It's basically one character (or more, in some cases) getting future knowledge. It's almost indistinguishable from precognition. Only, with precognition, some of the dangers of time looping are avoided (such as soul and mind magic in Mother of Learning, or ability canceling and brain hijacking in The Perfect Run). In return for those dangers, you get a greater degree of control over what you want to know, simulate what would happen if you did some things (try out all the "what if" scenarios). Plus you have actual time to process this information, as opposed to having visions of the future. Even if you did have a revelation in an instant about what would happen if and if and if, it'd take time to process all of it. Plus you get some major boosts in learning things. Actually studying and practicing things is way better than having a vision. Probably. Also. Time looping and precognitions would work on the same basis, sending back NOT matter, but information. So if one is possible, the other will also be. Precognition guy vs Time Looper guy is actually viable as consistent, and a cool idea now that I think about it :D

​

3) Resources for understanding how to present and manipulate time in a way that is at least adjacent to current science?

Science (current) stand of Time Travel: It's Impossible. You need negative energy in a system to move it through time. That's not saying that once you get this negative energy, time travel is possible. It's like saying "this stick is -3 cm long" or "this thing is -3 kelvin" or "this thing is traveling twice the speed of light" or "this has negative mass". It just cannot be done. Nothing in the universe, as far as we know, can do any of the above. It's possible to make something go Apparently faster than light, but not in reality.

That said, time is bound with space. They're actually the same thing, Spacetime. If there's a magic or tech that can heavily influence one, it can influence the other. They're not two separate concepts in reality, only in our minds. Think about gravity as the effect mass has on spacetime, it "sinks" on itself (this is a lie actually, but it helps visualise gravity better than whatever I could say). So, the more it sinks,the slower time is around the area.

​

Now some bullshit science. Nothing I say is completely true or even partially maybe

​

Time stops effectively inside black holes, probably. No one knows, because current knowledge of physics gives strange and contraddictory results if you apply them in a black hole. If you'd go even more "down" than a black hole, could you rewind time?

​

Traveling fast enough increases mass (actual mass, because matter and energy are the same, speed is energy, thus speed is matter). This is an oversemplification, but not far from the truth. If you can travel faster than the speed of light. you'd likewise travel back in time, like in the black hole, maybe.

​

If you do the inverse of what gravity does, so go "up" in the spacetime fabric, time inside the area should be /faster/ than the outside (so the inverse of a black hole). Hyperbolic Time Chamber from dragon ball! Or, to stay in rational fiction, Black Rooms of Mother of Learning. It checks out, because the more the room is separated from reality, the easier it is to "elevate" the place in spacetime. Hope I made it somewhat clear, but I don't think so :P English is not my language :D

​

There's a theory that, if time travel was possible, the universe itself would be in a quantum state, between the "first" time everything happened, and the "second". Both universes are real, but only the second continues, or maybe both do. So if I go back in time to remove a pebble on the street avoiding my past self from having an accident, it happens like this:

Universe one

1) I have an accident

2) I travel back in time to remove the pebble that causes it (what a brazen use of time travel!!)

3) Universe ends (maybe).

Universe two

-1) Future me arrives

0) Future me removes pebble, disappears because there's no reason for him to have gone back in time anymore, or maybe continues to go on in this universe, or maybe he goes to his alternate reality where things did happen. Who knows

1) I have no accident

2) I don't meet the nice nurse in Hospital with whom I'd have had a good life and many children, pity.

3) I don't go back in time, and the universe continues like normal

End of story.

Basically things would pop in and out of existence at seemingly random occasions, doing strange things, like removing pebbles, throwing buckets of water at seemingly random spots, and the like. Not the universe we live in, and not the universe I'd like to live in either! But hey, it's just a theory. A Timetravel theory!

Btw, this theory solves the grandfather paradox nicely. Kill your grandfather, and you have a looping universe that goes between the two states (grandfather killed/not killed, you being born/not born, you traveling back in time/not traveling back in time). A quantum state of the universe!

​

4) Any other miscellaneous input that would help me develop the concept?

no, sorry!
