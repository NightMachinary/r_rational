Primer is phenomenal. thank you.

I have the same feelings about Mr. Manhattan. I never completely get what his experience is, and I get annoyed every time they use tachyons to make him a regular character again. Seems like they pulled out something that strained their writing abilities and had to handwave him out of not breaking the story's structure.
