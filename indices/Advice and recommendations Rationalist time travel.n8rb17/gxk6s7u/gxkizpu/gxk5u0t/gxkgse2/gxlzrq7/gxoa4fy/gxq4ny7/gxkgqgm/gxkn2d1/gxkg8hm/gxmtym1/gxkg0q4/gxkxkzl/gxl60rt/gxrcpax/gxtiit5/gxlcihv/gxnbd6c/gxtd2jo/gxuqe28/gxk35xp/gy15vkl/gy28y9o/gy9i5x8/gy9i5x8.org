The movie and novella <!"Paycheck"!> involves time travel (or I guess seeing the future). The spoiler is because the fact it's time travel is itself a spoiler, because the main character can't remember what happened. Worth looking at, although it doesn't involve time travel as much as, say. Next / The Golden Man.

Pathfinder by Orson Scott Card (and especially its sequels) involves some pretty wacky time travel hijinks, and iirc uses 2 or 3 different time travel models depending on which method they employ to travel.

travel. Saying that any of these are the greatest time travel stories (though i enjoyed them), but they are more research material at least. As long as you have a consistent time travel model and your plot isn't just "time travel is cool", I'll probably like it.
