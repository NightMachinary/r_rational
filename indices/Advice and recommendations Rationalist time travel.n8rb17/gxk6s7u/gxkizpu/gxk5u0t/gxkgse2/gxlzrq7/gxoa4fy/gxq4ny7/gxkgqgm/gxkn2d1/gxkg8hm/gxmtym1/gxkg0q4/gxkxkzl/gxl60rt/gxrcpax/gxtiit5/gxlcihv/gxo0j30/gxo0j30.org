On precognition: I saw a star wars alternate-universe fic once that had an interesting take on portraying it. Jedi have precognitive powers; they do this by simulating many alternate futures at once, and the speed and number of simulation they can run at once scales with power. A low-to-medium level force user (the main character) can fit in ~10 up-to-a-minute before becoming exhausted.

The story also features hacked medikits making party drugs, the formation of the jedi heralding the obsolescence of science, VR hyper-porn, a bunch of stuff.
