Fall of Doc Future meets your criteria but probably is not applicable to your project, since the time travel method (which only sends /information/ backwards in time, in most cases) is of a "erases all direct signs of its existence" type. The largest example of it which sends matter backward and therefore /doesn't/ erase itself is discussed [[https://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/111336258816/skybreakers-call-chapter-37][here]] (spoilers for the end of Skybreaker's Call), the first discussion of the general method is [[https://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/35826483577/doc-and-stella-fragile][here]], and the most exhaustive discussion (at least in book one) is [[https://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/54138180725/endgame-ii][here]].
