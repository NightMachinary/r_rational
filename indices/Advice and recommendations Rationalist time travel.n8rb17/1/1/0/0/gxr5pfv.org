I remember an MLP time loop story, which had Twilight Sparkle use a couple loops to convince a person which she wanted to recruit of her time-travel abilities, etc... but then that person asked her to do something for them that would require so much effort and preparation that Twilight just decided "Time to cut my losses, it's NOT worth it to spend 50+ time loops just to recruit this one person".
