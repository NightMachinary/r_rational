One of the primary things that /most/ long-term loopers have to deal with in stories about loopers is tedium. Loops aren't "free", they take the looper's time. The looper has to physically go through the motions of completing a set series of actions that are in no way novel to them.

The problem for me comes from the typical way that time loop stories are told, where someone is shown sucking at something, then sucking at it a bit less, then being competent, then GOD MOD ACTIVACTED. My problem is largely with that last bit, simply because of the tedium involved. If the loops are infinite, and the implication is that the looper has done this so many times that they've begun incorporating flashy tricks into their loop, then sure, maybe I can accept it.

That's usually not the only place it shows up though. GOD MODE ACTIVATED shows up when the protagonist is trying other things, or attempting to accomplish specific goals. Protagonists will walk through a building lazily aiming their gun to get blind headshots, or do a car chase where they miss other cars by millimeters, or ... whatever else. Writers can get caught up in the coolness of GOD MODE without thinking about the psychology of the character and the unpleasantness of dealing with a tedious round of setup. Or there will be a character that has memorized the make and model of every car in the city, along with their license plate, which sure, you could eventually do if you had infinite time, but you would have to make that a priority over other, more pleasurable stuff, and so unless it's explained within the text, it's hard for me to understand how/why this was done by the protagonist instead of the other things they could have been doing. Writers just shortcut to GOD MODE, because it's entertaining, without considering what a psychologically realistic person would actually do.

Sure, /eventually/ you might get to the point where it's all the same to you, and you've trained yourself not to mind tedium, but if you're going to get to that point, why do the 'flashy' stuff at all? Why pursue looking cool or scoring lots of points in an imaginary system the looper's made for himself? If the looper can change his mind sufficiently that there's no tedium in setup, what do they get out of 'achievements'?
