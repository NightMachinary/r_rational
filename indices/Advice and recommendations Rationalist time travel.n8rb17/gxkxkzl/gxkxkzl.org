Primer is really confusing, but has entirely consistent time travel rules and intelligent characters. If you don't mind having to watch it more than once and either take notes or read someone else's it's an interesting watch.

One aspect of Dr. Manhattan I don't like is that the way he behaves doesn't fit the way he claims he thinks. He changes his mind at one point, but how can you change your mind if time doesn't apply to you? He also talks about that he can see through the illusion of free will, which is fine if it's just an existential crisis, but people act like that is an explanation for why he does what he does. But regardless of if people can see through it, it's just as much an illusion for everyone else, and he should be able to make decisions to the same extent they do. He certainly is capable of explaining concepts to people, and that's not fundamentally different from saving lives.
