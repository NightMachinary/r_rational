Though it shares almost nothing in common with it, the movie was a very loose adaptation of a short story by Philip K. Dick's "The Golden Man", which is in the public domain and [[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Golden_Man][can be read here]]. (I don't particularly recommend the story, as it's kind of a mess, but it's short and might be worth a read even if it's unfocused. Definitely covers some of the "consciousness stretches out over a period of time" stuff that OP seems to be looking for.)
