/Primer/ is an amazing indi movie and one of my favorite time travel stories with a pretty complex timeline.

Greg Egan has written some good stuff, the entire /Orthogonal/ trilogy features a very fascinating take on time travel. Basically the laws of physics in this world are different from ours so that time is another direction of space with nothing special signifying it apart from the fact that particles locally have the largest component of their movement in that direction. So there is no constant speed of light and you can travel at infinite speed /and even faster than that/ using nothing but an ordinary rocket. The second book, /Arrows of Time/ is the most about the implications on causality. Quite a lot of fascinating ideas here.
