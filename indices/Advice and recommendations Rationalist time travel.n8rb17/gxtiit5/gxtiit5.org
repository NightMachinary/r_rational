Talking about time loops, this is currently my favorite:

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/im-sorry-can-you-repeat-that-worm-quest-oc.554997/][I'm sorry, can you repeat that?]]

It's worm fanfic about a guy with a timeloop power. He can't go actually insane, but has gotten very, /very/ bored. It's played as a quest, where "do weeklong setup to repeat last time's scenario" and "sit there and wait to see what happens when you do nothing" are expensive actions that cost the players, paying sanity/restlessness which later has to be paid down with silly blowoff only-because-I'm-gonna-loop-it shenanigans.

These two are iconic and excellent time travel sci fi:

It's the gold standard of time travel anime and worth a reccomendation in it's own right. You can't write this type of time travel story without having a complete plan, from the start, as to what will happen when. It's the kind of story where precisely what happens during the first episode is extremely relevant later on. I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say that the tone changes at a certain point and that I only reccomend the complete series. Also, it's ranked #3 on MAL with a combined score over 9/10, because it is just that good. Adapted from a VN which is also pretty good.

Easily the best time travel story I've ever read. Explores what it means, emotionally/interpersonally, for your past to change. Has well-extrapolated worldbuilding and a great model of time travel, seasoned with really cool details of a paratime organization's procedures -- like the initiation where you have to kill your own grandfather. Won a Hugo for Best Novella and totally deserves it.
