/By His Bootstraps/ features an interesting take on time travel - it starts out with an ordinary 1940s guy, busy writing a thesis on the impossibility of time travel, when he's interrupted by a time traveller turning up from the future. The time traveller is his own future self; he is recruited to complete "one simple task" by someone living in the far future, known only by title as Diktor. It turns out that the "one simple task" is to go back and recruit his own past self. Feeling like he's been played by Diktor, he uses the time machine (which Diktor admits was made by aliens, who had visited Earth and since left) to go back in time about a decade, looking to prevent Diktor's arrival and take his place. And then, eventually, he realises that Diktor was /also/ him; his decade-older self... that is to say, he hauled himself into the future by his bootstraps.
