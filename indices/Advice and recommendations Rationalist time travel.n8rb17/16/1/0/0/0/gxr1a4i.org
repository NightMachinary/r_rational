Didn't read that book, but the precog /would/ see them appearing in front of herself /before/ they get in front of her. Otherwise, not much of a precog, aren't we?

Talking about time rewinding/looping vs precog in this scenario. The precog would see the time looping before the time looper gets near the precog.

And the time travelling guy /would/ find the precog /ready/ for them. On the other hand, the precog needs something better than simply killing time looping characters if they rewind time the moment they die. If it's not the moment they die, but a conscious effort on time looping to activate it, then it's not that much of a problem. But then a time looper could simply try many different things from a distance and find if something works. Snipers, bombs, whatever magic that world allows... And the precog would see it coming and avoid it. That's the appeal of a time looping vs precog. One of the two needs to make a silly mistake, or one of the two needs to find a weakness in the other's way of "seeing the future" and tamper it/circumvent they're knowledge.
