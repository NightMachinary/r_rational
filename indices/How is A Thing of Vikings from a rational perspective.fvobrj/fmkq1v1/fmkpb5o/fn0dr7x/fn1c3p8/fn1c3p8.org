I started reading when I saw this post and am up to chapter 32.

I think while somewhat rational, its major point is taking something not really in the real world and having the real world react to it and it to them.

I do have to give warning there are some furstarting realtionship beats that I think could of been easily solved/avoding the whole realtionship drama.
