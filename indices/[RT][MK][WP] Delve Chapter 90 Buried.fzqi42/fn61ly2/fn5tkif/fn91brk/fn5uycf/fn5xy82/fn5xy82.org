I wonder if someone will get Fall to help solve that. Assuming the unlock requirement is "have Spring, Summer, and Winter unlocked", then one of the new guards could get that + Extend Aura.

Unfortunately, it would take at least 5-6 days to level the skill to level 2 (not counting the boosted rate from metamagic), never mind getting it to level 10.
