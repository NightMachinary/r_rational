I've enjoyed the story progressing the plot and all, but I'm glad that we're finally back to the core of the Delve story: Rain sitting down, doing math, and grinding stats. (kidding, I actually like this part)

It seems weird that Rain's trying to math out and get strong to move some boulders. Getting caught in a cave in is a regular story trope that happens, and I don't think I've ever seen "grind stats" so you can move the rocks. It feels like he could leverage... well anything else.

Like, wouldn't just trying to dig out the rocks all day, give you the stat that helps most for moving the rocks. Or doing anything with infinite water and freezing/heating that. Or arguably Purify has that /conceptual thing/ where it can dissolve nonstandard targets so it could consider the rocks as really big dirt.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that if this were any story but Delve, I feel like "sitting down and grinding stats" would be the wrong answer.
