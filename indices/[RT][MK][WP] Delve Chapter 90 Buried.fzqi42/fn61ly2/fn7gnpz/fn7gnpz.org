Yeah, idk. Rain is supposedly worried about the ceiling collapsing. He has a lot of experience as an engineer on projects where the ceiling collapses (his hobo hut), so I trust his judgement here.

I thought maybe he could try pinging people on the surface by rapidly alternating by two friendly max range auras (e.g. purify/essence well), but

I think the room he's in is actually deeper than the room where the fight took place, so idk if his range reaches the true surface.
