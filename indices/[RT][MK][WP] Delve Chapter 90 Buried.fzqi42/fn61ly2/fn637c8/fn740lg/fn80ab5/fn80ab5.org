True. But bodies aren't poison, corruption, or contamination, so there's already interpretation being done behind the scenes. I can see it happening as an accident of the transitive property, where dead flesh is bad news so it can clear it by default and bodies happen to be composed entirely of dead flesh, and that itself has interesting applications. But by that logic, rubble is both made of dirt and isn't any different from the normal grunge on the walls he delights in scouring away from the adventuring guild and everywhere else.

But that kind of rules lawyering isn't really necessary because we know that the class system is super fucking weird already and what rain is seeing is just a human friendly version of whatever's really happening behind the scenes, and that whatever he sees is just a translation that's magically provided by the system with zero guarantees as to accuracy. Even beyond that, bashing reality with your soul until it breaks is a HUGE part of how the system works. "There is no spoon" and all that jazz. He's demonstrated the ability to alter how purify works before, and this shouldn't be any different.
