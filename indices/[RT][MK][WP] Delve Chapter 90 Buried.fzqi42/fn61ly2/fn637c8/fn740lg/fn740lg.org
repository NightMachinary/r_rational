I don't know how far he could stretch "Purify poison, corruption, and contamination", but I suspect that calling a boulder "contamination" is a step too far.

(This part is related, just bear with me.) The difference between wrought iron (which is very soft, weak, and malleable) and steel (which is hard, strong, and may be malleable or brittle) is the inclusion of carbon and sometimes other impurities. If it wasn't for the mana-absorbing properties of metal, then Rain might be able to turn steel into iron and weaken objects that way.

I'm not familiar enough with geology or the interaction of mana and stone to say if it would work, but removing the impurities from the stones themselves might be worth a try.
