I think I remember a scene where he tried to get Purify to do something by redefining what he thought of as 'clean'. I guess in this case he could do something like that for pee, redefining cleaning pee to be making it into water, rather than making it disappear.

It's a moot point now he has water though. Still, the extend to which Purify can be modified to your liking may lead to some interesting munchkinning.
