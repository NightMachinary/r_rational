Oooh, so Mlem knows about Majistraal artifacts. I'm betting Rain has a nice talk with him at some point.

Still no resolution for the fight between Lavarro and Westbridge. That's going to be the major plot changer. If he dies, it's up to Rain to turn the barrier off since no one else will be able to get in. We still don't know Westbridge's motives, but I'm leaning towards him just wanting to toughen up Velika rather than betraying her to the empire or something. And that would mean his silence in response to her yelling might actually mean he's dead.
