The nested yeerks idea is actually really interesting, but only if we can figure out how Visser 3's morphing works. If his Yeerk body is pushed into z-space along with his host's while morphing, then nesting is possible. It seems like this would actually be necessary for him to control his host while in morph, because he has to stay in contact with the Andalite brain.

It's one of those things that you would never, ever try if you value your life, but it's an interesting thought experiment.
