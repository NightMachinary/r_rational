I like this interpretation of Tobias.

I worry that the Yeerks are too strong. There seem to be two ways that this can play out in a non extinction event. 1. The Animorphs turn into rationalist munchkins and save everything. 2. The Elimist gives them a bunch of deus ex machinas until they win. I don't particularly like either of those options. Here's hoping there's a more detailed plan to success in the mind of the author.
