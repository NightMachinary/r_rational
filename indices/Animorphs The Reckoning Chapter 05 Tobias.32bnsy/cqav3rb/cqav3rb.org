A solution for at least mildly cooperative Yeerks:

1. Give Yeerk ability to morph.

2. Allow Yeerk to aquire one human.

3. Yeerk morphs human.

4. Wait (at least) two hours.

Now you have a Yeerk who doesn't need a host. Interference / resonance might wear off given enough time as a nothlit. I think this was involved in canon.

--------------

Potential risky move: acquire a Yeerk and investigate the pool.

--------------

Hilarious move: Nest all of the Animorphs in one body by morphing a Yeerk, controlling the next one in line, then morphing a Yeerk again. I seriously doubt this would be useful and it would still have the same time limit.

--------------

Andilites vs Yeerks: why not just ram enemy planets with a ship traveling near the speed of light? That should do it.

--------------

Elimist: be very very careful that you're not robbing characters on either side of agency. Omnipotents have a tendency to do that.
