Yeah, that sucks. I found these characters and sent them to the author; they're indistinguishable from <> in FFN's document system, but I guess they use a different font for stories than the docx for some reason. This really sucks; I'm not a fan at all of the (()) notation. Guess it's back to the drawing board.
