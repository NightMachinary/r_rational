The morphing technology is pretty elaborate, it seems implausible that they would allow something to morph itself. The technology creates a "base state" when you first get it, which is just your own body. When you acquire an animal, it not only stores the animal's DNA as a new state, but also the transition required to reach that new state. Therefore, if you acquire DNA that matches the base state, the transition required is null, so no morphing takes place.
