This is a masterpiece of crack fic. I love that you only rewrote the scenes that matter to the jokes you wanted to make. I was laughing every minute or so! The beginning of chapter four was so silly, I loved it. Also the part where Quirrel told everyone that Harry is a fascist. He's a fascist that wants his subjects to be happy and healthy, which means that he's a fascist but his brand of fascism isn't bad, in principle (separating the morals from the word definition is something people often struggle with).

I don't know why you named this after Rick and Morty. I haven't seen much of the show, but neither of these characters seemed at all like Rick or Morty.
