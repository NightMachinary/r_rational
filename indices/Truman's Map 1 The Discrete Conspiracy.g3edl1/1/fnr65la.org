After the first chapter, my emotional state is 'neutral but curious'. So far, there hasn't been anything that made me wince (a good sign), and it also hasn't yet started on the 'meat' of the story (the learning and application), rather than the part before and looking-back-on-the-part-before after. That's the main part I predict I would either enjoy and commit to reading more or not enjoy and be less inclined to keep reading.
