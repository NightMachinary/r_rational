Incandescence and his Orthogonal trilogy are even harder. :) (He pretty much wrote an entire physics textbook for the Riemannian universe. (Orthogonal's premise is a universe with positive definite metric, ie, a universe that's almost the same as ours with the primary difference being that time and space are fully symmetric with each other. As far as Incandescence... well, a general relativity textbook could be counted as a spoiler (or a reader's guide) for Incandescence. :))
