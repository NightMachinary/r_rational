Because it repeatedly creates solipsistic universes.

Some vague spoilers below... I'm not really giving away any plot points, but themes are presented flatly rather than being introduced through a story, which does change the experience. People who haven't read it yet should consider not continuing.

I've never read Egan's opinions on this book so I could be way off, but going just on the text, I think he was writing a horror novel intentionally. It starts out with a character gradually realizing he is essentially [[#s][]] . And it just gets worse from there.

On more than one occasion a character finds themselves in a world where nothing is real except their own consciousness, and even that's up for debate. More than one character self-mutilates his mind to where they become unrecognizable entities. This sort of self-mutilation seems to be pretty common, at least to some of them, as it's stated fairly matter-of-factly.

He is doubting the veracity of his own perceptions because he knows he can't be trusted with write-access to his own brain. It spirals downward from there. The desperate, hopeless isolation is palpable. The inevitable decent into insanity and self-destruction is overwhelming.
