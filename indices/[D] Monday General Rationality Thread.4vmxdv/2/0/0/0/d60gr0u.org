Ah, then your best strategy is to /pretend/ to stop upvoting people, hoping that our hypothetical mysterious downvoter also stops participating in your duel. However, you will continue to upvote nonetheless, while loudly protesting that you do not upvote, thereby tricking him quite handily. He will think you've come to some kind of detente, when in fact you have caused him to start pushing "cooperate" while your finger remains firmly on the "defect" button in this twisted game of prisoner's dilemma!
