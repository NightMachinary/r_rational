  So knowing that Reddit's bayesian averaging system makes this a losing proposition for me, I give up.

Does it? I think that if they downvoted your OP, it would make a difference, but downvoting each person in the thread at once shouldn't make any real difference.

It might send newer posts to the bottom (because new posts that are downvoted are punished heavily, while older ones are punished less heavily), but I think that's about it.
