I think it's pretty falsifiable. Imagine an experiment where you take people with, say, a liberal viewpoint, and assigning (randomly) a third of them to post exclusively to, say, [[/r/liberal]], a third to post to [[/r/conservative]], and a third to post to some sort of control (what a "control" would be would take some thinking.) Then we could poll them periodically on their desire to use reddit, while also averaging the posts per day of the three groups. The rub would be that we'd tell half of each group is that the point of the experiment would be to test posting response to karm.

Then we can compare:

- propensity to post more or less often based on karma
- enjoyment of using reddit (as defined by polling)
- z-tests for significance between the groups who were and were not told about the purpose of the test.

My theory would predict fewer posts/less enjoyment for people not recieving positive reinforcement in the form of upvotes, and that the z-tests would fail to show a significant difference.

I mean, I guess it's hard to falsify from a /practical/ standpoint, if that was your meaning, but we could probably run a straw poll or something.
