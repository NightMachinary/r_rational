Real next-level cynicism about the US legal system actually should address the problems not of people who get trials, but people who don't. As it stands, whether or not you like the exact setup of the jury system, it's largely irrelevant; only 5% of criminal cases go to trial [[https://www.bja.gov/Publications/PleaBargainingResearchSummary.pdf][(link)]]. The remaining 95% end in a guilty plea / plea bargain, which is when the defendant admits guilt and waives rights to a trial by jury in return for more lenient sentencing.

There are a variety of reasons that this happens. Some of these reasons are:

- The state often only brings cases it's reasonably sure it can win to trial. The defendant, recognizing that a guilty verdict is inevitable, pleas out. Unlike the other reasons on this list, this one isn't really a problem. It's just the defendant making a reasonable decision based on the information available.
- Many defendants lack the education or the knowledgeability to recognize that they have a good chance in court, and plead guilty as a result.
- Many defendants are cowed by the possibility of spending decades in prison, and plead guilty in hopes of getting a reduced sentence that has no chance of lasting that long.
- Many defendants lack good legal representation. Many are too poor to afford private attorneys, and pro bono work doesn't cover the gap. Public defenders are overworked. Many have less than half an hour to spend on each case.
- The state can't afford to give trials to all the criminals it arrests /regardless/. As it is now, even accounting generously for efficiencies of scale, giving trials to 100% of defendants instead of 5% would require 10x more infrastructure, judges, bailiffs, prosecutors, public defenders, and so on.

Effectively, the vast majority of criminals do not get a trial. Some of this is for normal reasons, like the state having caught the right criminal and having a watertight case. Some is for really bad reasons, though. Many who do not get trials would probably have better outcomes if they did have trials, but through a combination of poor circumstance, fear, and lack of education, are coerced into guilty pleas. This kind of problem applies equally to the innocent and the guilty. Happening to be innocent of a crime (or only guilty of a lesser crime) doesn't make you less impoverished, terrified, and poorly represented.
