You may be interested it the blog of David D Friedman, who recently compared the US legal system to trial by ordeal .... in the sense that the system (ordeal) only works because people believe in it. US trials take so long that pleas are something like 98% of results ... I've never been empanelled in all the times I've been summoned .... the defendants see the jury March into the room and the guilty ones plead.

Prosecutors often theaten to.punish defendants who demand a trial by asking for 10x or more time than those who plead out. And such offers are not admissible.

Tl,dr the irrationality of jurors may be a flaw, but it's a very minor flaw in the system. I recommend friedmanns blog and Legal Systems Far Different From our Own manuscript for much interesting reading on the topic of legal system design.
