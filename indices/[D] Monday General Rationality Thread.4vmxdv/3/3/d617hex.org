The idea behind non-expert juries is that the prosecution's case must be so airtight that they can convince people who have no expertise in an area that you are right. This is a good idea in theory until you get to the various psychological effects which make us prone to believing any random bullshit said by a person in a labcoat.

That said, I don't think there's a better way to do this until we have some sort of incorruptible AI god. And once we have that, most of the problems that lead to crime in the first place are also solved as a matter of course.
