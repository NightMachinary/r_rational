Well, I'd leave.

Living on a boat really relies on a reliable weather service. There's a decent chance it would survive being in a hurricane, if it was moored well away from anything. It could just flop around in the water. That /probably/ wouldn't be enough to kill it.

But it's much preferable to just move away from the storm. And in that regard, a live-aboard has an advantage.

Really it does require a flexible schedule.
