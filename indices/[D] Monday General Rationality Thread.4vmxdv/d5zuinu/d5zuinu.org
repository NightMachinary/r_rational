So, as of about last week I'm commited to living on a boat. Or at least owning one.

I purchased [[https://docs.google.com/folderview?id=0B_SibNDpnu01R3ZDWDdHT2ZtM0U&usp=gmail][a boat]] for $CAD 400.

A paid $CAD 1000 to get it moved to my grandparents house, out in the middle of nowhere.

At the end of the month, when me lease expires, I'm moving to my grandparents house for however long it takes to get the boat livable.

It should theoretically be able to sail today, but there's a drainage hole in the bottom, so it doesn't fill with rain. Also, I don't know how to sail.

I think that living on a boat is going to become a lot more practical in a little while, thanks to the oneweb satelight constelation. I'd like to have the skills so that I can know what I'm talking about.

Since my previous attempt at taking over a small bit of the world (a 3D file repo, eventually providing services similar to 3Dhubs) failed, I figure it's a good opportunity to get ahead of the curve.

Are there any big social changes you expect, thanks to the oneweb satelite constelation? What industries would it be good to invest in now, under the presumption that oneweb is going to significanty improve them?
