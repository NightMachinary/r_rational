Have you looked into any communities of people making similar decisions and living such lifestyles? I imagine they'd have a wealth of knowledge and experience to draw from and help with a dozen things you wouldn't even consider until you go through with it yourself.

I don't know enough about the tech industry to tell what good investments would be with a coming global (free?) internet, but it would certainly open the markets to a lot of developing nations, so basic communication apps like whatsapp or kik or snapchat or viber. New localized versions of these might appear instead though, so it would still be a risky bet.
