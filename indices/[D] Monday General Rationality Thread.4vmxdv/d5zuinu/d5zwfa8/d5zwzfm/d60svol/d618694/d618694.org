It... doesn't look that high to me. I keep hearing this said, but I can't figure out where that cost comes from.

A new coat of anti-fouling paint every 3-5years, some fiberglass patches. Occasionally some replacement hardware....

The high-maintence thing looks like a myth to me. But then again, my boat is cored with a slightly better material then most, so a small hole in the outer fiberglass isn't going to spread rot throughout the inside.

Now that could be considered high, if you weren't expecting it. Or you weren't doing the labour yourself. Or you weren't comparing it to rent.

But the maintenance costs seem like they're not even going to even approach 3 grand a year, by my estimates.
