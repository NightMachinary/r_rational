The big one? Probably difficult housing prices.

I'm not seeing my being able to actually buy a house in the next ~5-ish years. If I moved somewhere with more tech employment and worked 40 hours a week I might be able to do it. Or if I had more persistence, and was willing to work a job with minimal professional development for the next 20 years...

But realistically? No house.

But, I can moor a boat somewhere near downtown pretty much anywhere for a reasonable price. It's something that I own in pretty much every way I can. It's not relying on my neighbors not bringing housing costs down. I don't have to pay an unpredictable amount in taxes to the government.

I'm not putting 40% of my income towards housing...

Since I do a lot of remote work, it seems like it will work pretty well for me.

Us as a society investing heavily in green technology is nice, since a lot of that technology works great at very small scale. It's made this a lot more practical then it was even a few years ago.
