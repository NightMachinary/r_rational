I definitely recommend doing some crewing and sailing classes if you want to get a jump start, sailing is something that requires real skill and experience. Things can quickly get out of hand and you can't just say "im done" and be safely back in port. Its one of my most favorite things to do, but part of that is because of how serious a thing it is.
