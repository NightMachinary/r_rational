I don't think people are worried about conservation of detail, so much as they're concerned that [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnspokenPlanGuarantee][everything going according to plan isn't particularly suspenseful]](warning, TV tropes).

As a general rule, plans which are stated will go wrong in critical ways or at crucial moments, so that the protagonists must react quickly and improve... while plans which are left unspoken work flawlessly, and reader enjoyment is in witnessing their brilliance as they happen.

Stories of the latter type are often purposefully elaborate and confusing, with twisty resolutions and layers of deception in order to create dramatic tension... and I can imagine how that would frustrate your mental models.
