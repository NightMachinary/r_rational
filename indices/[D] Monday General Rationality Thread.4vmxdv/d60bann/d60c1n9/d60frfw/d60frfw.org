#+begin_quote
  It might send newer posts to the bottom
#+end_quote

And that discourages posting within a certain while of the original posting, as that gives the original posters an overall smaller chance of getting to the top of the thread because whomever does the downvoting is more likely to do it to a newer thread (no sense leaving a thread un-downvoted once they spot it.)

Or maybe I'm just post-justifying my desire to optimize my own laziness.
