I think it's the same reason that people [[http://www.livescience.com/8117-happiness-making-money-guy.html][are happier when they have a higher salary than their peer group]]. It's much, much harder to accumulate karma in [[/r/rational]] than it is in [[/r/funny]], but I don't want to hang around in [[/r/funny]] because it's a cesspool. I want my posts and comments to [[/r/rational]] to do well /by the standards of [[/r/rational]]./

(Based on my post karma by subreddit, the one time I ever submitted anything to [[/r/politics]] was worth twice as many internet points as submitting everything I've published in the past three years to [[/r/rational]].)
