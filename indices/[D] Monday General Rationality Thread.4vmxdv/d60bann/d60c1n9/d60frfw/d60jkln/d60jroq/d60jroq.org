Reddit, like all social media sites, is a type of game. In this case, we try to maximize the little point numbers on top of our comments. It's not the only way to have fun, but why not?

Obviously we get some detrimental effects because of it (see: circlejerking) but there are plenty of other alternatives anyways.
