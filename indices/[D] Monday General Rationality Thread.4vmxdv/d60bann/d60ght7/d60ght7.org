I wouldn't worry about it too much! [[/r/rational][r/rational]] is a small sub so things stay on the front page of this sub for quite some time, even if they get downvotes. Going back 5 days on this sub, sorting by "hot," it seems like almost everything is in chronological order by day, with only a couple of popular exception (unsong, the pokemon fic, etc). I usually upvote people who respond to things I write if I think it adds content. I try to do upvotes on basically every submission in this sub that I think is on-topic, too.

Looking back, the only submissions I've /not/ upvoted in the 50 most recent, sorted by hot, are the SENPAI Protocol, the Comeback Kid double post (though I upvoted the original), and that's it.

So yeah, even if people commenting on your stuff get downvoted, you're still pretty visible. Going 50 items back on this sub only goes back 2 weeks; it takes quite some time to get bumped off the front page.
