A while ago, I mentioned that I upvoted every (relevant or otherwise) comment on the threads I posted to encourage discussion, but it looks like someone decided that was gaming the system and now automatically downvotes the people who post to my threads (or threads related to me).

So knowing that Reddit's bayesian averaging system makes this a losing proposition for me, I give up. You've won, mysterious downvoter!

Note that I'm not complaining here, it's just interesting to see how reddit's voting system influences behavior.
