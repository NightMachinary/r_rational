I think FMA is pretty internally consistent as far as settings go... Alchemy ultimately has to obey limits similar to the normal limits entropy and thermodynamics puts on chemistry. There seems to be some extra limitations regarding the information involved (i.e. trying to resurrect the dead lacks the necessary information and is thus an attempt at violating equivalent exchange). My headcanon for Truth is that it was some sort of reflection of the character confronting it. As in naturally, Truth isn't something intelligent, rather it is an abstract phenomena, but the attempt at violating equivalent exchange by raising the dead causes them to interact with it in a way that seems like intelligence.

As for making characters rational... Father is already pretty rational, with a thought out plan and logical steps to reach it he just underestimated humans. Also note Father makes a good metaphor for AI in a box. Ed and Al could have been smarter and tested their resurrection scheme animals first, and maybe they would have lost less for trying to violate equivalent exchange. But after that, they were pretty smart about pursuing their goals. Likewise with Roy and his goals... actually in general FMA is pretty rational in term of character goals and motivations and decisions.

Also, I think there is a rule that brainstorming is supposed to go in a weekly thread unless you have written at least one chapter of a rational work. This rule is in place so that people don't clutter up the hot/new page with various brainstorming that never gets written. IDK if mods will delete this post or if it is just a warning the first time, but please post to a relevant weekly thread otherwise. (I think this topic might be good for a Wednesday world-building for example.)
