I don't think we've been shown anyone using a transmutation circle someone else wrote. Mustang uses a circle designed by his master, but he presumably had to understand it on some level before being able to use it, and he wrote the patterns on his gloves himself.

Given that 'enlightened' alchemists can perform without circles, I think it's a fair guess that alchemy mostly depends on your mind, and the circles are just a visual help.
