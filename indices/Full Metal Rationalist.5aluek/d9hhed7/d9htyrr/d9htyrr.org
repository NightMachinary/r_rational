Eh, don't really agree that FMA is internally consistent. Sure our characters individually appear like rational actors - 'sides the villains - but that all unravels the instant you question society at large. It really should look more like a post-scarcity world, than an early 20th century one.

Additionally there isn't a convenient excuse like in Worm, which lets us ignore all of this either. If you try to blame the big bad then you need to ask why Xing looks like this too.
