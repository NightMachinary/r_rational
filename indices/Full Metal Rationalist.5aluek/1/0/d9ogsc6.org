Resurrecting animals works, possibly because the necessary information is supplied by the alchemist's mind. For a few chapters, Edward is very disturbed by the notion that resurrecting humans works in the same way as resurrecting animals, and that Al is a construct of his mind, rather than the same mind his brother had prior to being affixed to a suit of armour. He only gets over this when presented with the evidence that Winry and Al have shared experiences that Edward wasn't a part of.

The experimental setup where you train animals to do things the alchemist isn't aware of and then check if the animal can do those things after being resurrected is kind of non-obvious. In the manga, Edward didn't consider it until he met another soul attached to armour who suggested it to him. Also it's implied there's a pretty high cost to resurrecting animals, so though it's known to be possible, it's probably not the sort of thing you'd check on a whim.
