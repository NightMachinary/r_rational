Language wasn't clear, sorry. Meant to say that it should be /more/ like a post-scarcity world, not that it was one yet. As per the why...

Transmutation circles have been shown to be highly robust; non-Elric alchemists use the same circles in a wide variety of situations to cause complex effects. e.g. [[http://fma.wikia.com/wiki/Basque_Grand][The Iron Blood Alchemist]] can create complicated projectile weaponry in uncontrolled enviroments.

Alchemists have been shown using transmutation circles they did not design. e.g. [[http://fma.wikia.com/wiki/Roy_Mustang][The Flame Alchemist]].

Children of very young ages have been shown performing alchemy. e.g. [[http://fma.wikia.com/wiki/Edward_Elric][The Fullmetal Alchemist]].

So now we're ready to munchkin the hell out of this (as any real world nation would):

1. Teach your population how to activate transmutation circles.
2. Develop useful transmutation circles for the masses. e.g. create luxary goods, food, houses, etc.
3. ????
4. Profit!!!!

In the reality of FMA the existence of non-Elric alchemists breaks the setting. To see why just ask yourself: why are there no civilians using mass produced transmutation circles to cast magic missle at each other?

*Edit:* I do concede another possibility. i.e. The world blew up the instant someone decided to make antimatter.
