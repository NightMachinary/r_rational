I've had an idea on how to make the magic (Alchemy) of FMA somewhat more structured, and I guess I'll put it here in the hopes that it can get passed around and maybe used by someone.

First, some observations: (Spoilers!)

° Al's body, while separated from his 'soul', is still intelligent

° Al's armor-bound soul is able to perform alchemy

° Ed was able to give up his ability to perform alchemy without affecting anything else about himself

° A 'homunculus' was able to be created without any body

° People's lives have value and can harvested to apparently break the law of conservation

° Different alchemy circles have different functions

Alright, so what I've come up with to explain all this is that the people of the FMA universe possess something, maybe it's like a symbiotic entity or maybe its just like an extradimensional brain, that is capable of calculating/manipulating quantum randomness, basically as a form of probability manipulation.

I know I'm just pushing the 'it's magic' explanation down one level because there's no way I could explain how this 'quantum manipulation' actually happens or what this 'extradimensional' thing is, but this is one of the things I liked most about HPMOR, that the magic was given just a little more structure that distinguishes between the things that will or will not happen. Anyway, so people have this thing with which they can influence quantum probabilities such as, say, getting the brownian motion of the oxygen atoms in the air to organize them instead of randomize them. Furthermore this thing can (somehow) be stolen and amassed, allowing for greater feats of probability manipulation, such as extreme cases of quantum tunneling. This would sort of explain the inexhaustibility of a philosopher's stone because it's not that you're using the mass energy of people's souls, but rather using more computational power to perform more difficult feats (and maybe the only halfway done stone from the beginning broke because it was overtaxed?). Also, perhaps alchemy circles are like equations or circuits that make certain computations easier or channel the manipulation in a certain way, either as mnemonics or through direct manipulation of the calculation.

I'm not exactly sure how the Truth or consciousness would work exactly. Maybe a body is fine without this thing (like Al's body on the other side, or Ed after he gives up alchemy), maybe you die without it (like the people harvested to make the stones), maybe the thing can be conscious on its own (like homunculi), or maybe there's a third thing just for consciousness (like what a soul is conventionally). And maybe the Truth is an actual physical place where the quantum manipulation thing resides, or maybe it's just a visualization of what the thing is doing.

Also a couple quirks of this theory. Everybody would be able to use alchemy, because supposedly any human is as good as another when it comes to making a philosopher's stone so you can't just have certain people possess this thing. Philosopher's stones (and alchemists in general) wouldn't be capable of any brute force energy/mass generation (no simply conjuring a black hole or such) just more complex or improbable things.
