oo. I actually really like that. interesting topic, does definitely rub current culture backwards, and it fits with the theme of the story.

I would expect the push for this legislation would come less from a sense of fairness or punishing entitlements, though, as from socialization of care for the disadvantaged. that's much easier to sell, but still sounds quite awful to our ears.
