That's a fair point, though I think some of the impact is lost if the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance][Deliberate Values Dissonance]] isn't horrifying. As awkward as the rape example is, it does help the reader understand how aliens could find us horrifying for things we consider normal.

The Babyeaters offend our self-righteous morality, then the Superhappies show up and we offend them for completely different reasons and there's aspects of the human society that offend the reader. I still think the story is brilliantly written.

I should page [[/r/scruiser][r/scruiser]] since he was working on a TWC-inspired story about similar values conflicts with aliens and I really liked what I saw. His story was all about an alliance of aliens making contact with us trying to figure out how it's possible for us to join their community despite everyone's reservations.
