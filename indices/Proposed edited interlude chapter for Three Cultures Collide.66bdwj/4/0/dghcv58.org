I guess the question then becomes whether that revulsion is necessary to the point of the story, or if it can work without it.

or, if there is another revulsion that would make the reader distance from the characters, but not so much to pull them out of the story.

Edit:

I actually wanted to note one other thing. While this approach doesn't create revulsion at the future society, it can produce latent guilt at our current society, which I think for this purpose is just as good. It's the same thing the characters experience as they judge and then are judged in turn.
