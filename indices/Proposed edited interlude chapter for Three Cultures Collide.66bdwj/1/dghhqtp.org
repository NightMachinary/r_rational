You have three issues, one good point, and I have one suggestion -

- You present the entire chapter, instead of just the altered bit plus context. Can you edit your post down to that? It will be much, MUCH more accessible.

- You remove the section where Akon attempts to explain his culture's reasoning behind the thing. The confessor never tries to explain to Akon the old view; it's only Akon who tries to explain their view.

The third thing is complicated. Let's look at the original:

#+begin_quote
  "...Do you know there was a time when nonconsensual sex was illegal?"

  "I can't imagine how boring your sex lives must have been up until then - flirting with a woman, teasing her, leading her on, knowing the whole time that you were perfectly safe because she couldn't take matters into her own hands if you went a little too far"
#+end_quote

"> ...When our children legalized rape, we thought that the Future had gone wrong."

First thing to notice is the use of a clear but unusual term, and the use of two separate terms (nonconsensual and rape). When you read "nonconsensual sex", you go, "huh - I think I recognize what that's saying, but something's different. Why?". You use the same term for the old attitude as the new attitude, implying the attitudes about them are the same. 'Abortion' is also a very conversational term, "nonconsensual sex" sounds more like legalese than "rape", implying a degree of specificity to the phrase not present in the conversational term. "Fetal termination" might make a good "future" term.

Next thing to notice is that /what/ the future legalized isn't clear. It's implied, and vaguely at that. What does it mean to take matters into her own hands? What does it mean to go a little too far? What does it mean to be safe?

It sounds like the issue could be that one person is leading the other person on, but it's not clear. There's one other line to pay attention to at this point:

#+begin_quote
  "someone seriously believes that sex is overvalued relative to orange juice".
#+end_quote

This is interesting. This means sex is traded on the commodity market. This means sex is commodified; to me, this implies that in this culture, I can owe someone sex, and they can trade that debt to someone else - without my approval. I can owe someone sex whom I don't want to have sex with - a very reasonable thing to call "legalized nonconsensual sex".

But there's still a lot of vagueness in Akon's statement. Is the issue that leading someone on is akin to negotiating a deal in bad faith - something imaginably abhorrent in a culture built on markets? The normal dating process can be seen as an implied contract of stuff and experiences for sex* - "leading on" is then breaking that implied contract. It's easy to then imagine that "take matters into hand" translates to legal / economic recourse, which result in a commodity of sex with you that you didn't agree to.

- If you experience dating as this in the modern world, seek help, you can be doing it less wrong.

Alternatively, the issue could have remained the same as it is today: One party takes it too far. This is a simpler interpretation of people's actions, but it makes the "take matters into hand" much less clear, and it's never explained - and honestly, I don't have any real idea here.

--------------

So those are your issues. That said, I think you picked a good replacement topic. Nonconsensual sex becomes something different if sex isn't as big a deal; abortion becomes something different if birth and child rearing isn't a big deal - there's that mention Akon has of the "children's world". If people don't raise their own kids and pregnancy/birth is super duper safe, what does it matter if you get pregnant? Or maybe it's common for people to conceive, and then gestate using technology - artificial wombs and all that.

My suggestion is to play with market-style relationships between the parents (particularly mother) and child. Maybe the child owes the mother something for gestation; maybe the parents owe the child something for creation. Either way, you can replace rape with slavery, and nonconsensual sex with.... forced pregnancy?

As a last note, I'd say that this story's strength is the questions it raises, not the answers it gives. Try to do the same: Raise many, many questions with any replacement you propose.
