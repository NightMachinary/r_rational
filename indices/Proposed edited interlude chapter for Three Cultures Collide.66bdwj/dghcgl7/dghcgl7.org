I like this idea since...well, rape. On top of the difficulty of getting people in the mindset to consider even a hypothetical alternative view on sexual consent, it also lacks proper explanation of the meta-context. It's the one part of the story that took me out of it and I had to look up what the author was trying to do.

That said, I don't think abortion is the best replacement specifically because I don't feel revulsion at the idea that my side of the debate lost, especially given the absence of the same negative consequence that are present today. Without those consequences, I could accept a fetus being defined as a human being.
