  I should page [[/r/scruiser][r/scruiser]] since he was working on a TWC-inspired story about similar values conflicts with aliens and I really liked what

I haven't made anymore progress on that story past the initial brainstorming and a page or two of text... I got caught up in making a CYOA series that has consumed most of the time I spend on creative projects. I might revisit once I finish the main part of my CYOA series (I am 9 releases in, 3 more planned for the main series).

  His story was all about an alliance of aliens making contact with us trying to figure out how it's possible for us to join their community despite everyone's reservations.

I went for more bizarre values than horrifying/revolting values. [[#s][Spoiler for a story I eventually plan to write]]

In terms of TWC... EY could have gone for something that would show how altered these humans are while not hitting all the controversy buttons that rape does (seriously, many people already pattern match the rationalist community to the neoreactionaries and thus by extension potentially the red pill/MRA community, so avoiding anything that might be misconstrued as rape apologist should be a priority). I think just indicating that extreme recreational violence (like a soccer match where breaking each other's legs is an acceptable strategy) is acceptable thanks to their medical technology and their altered psychology would be enough to achieve the same narrative goal.
