  The recent re-opening of the discussion around EY's "Three Cultures Collide" and the ongoing controversy around the legalized rape bit inspired me to take a shot at revising the chapter in question, substituting another social ethical question that serves the same purpose of distancing their culture from the reader's, while being more apropos to the topic of the story.

... I guess, but one of the strengths of Yudkowsky's example is that literally everyone agrees that rape should be illegal forever. There's an ongoing abortion debate, so picking it actually serves to distance their culture less from half the audience. If the idea of a society where abortion is illegal seems that alien and far-off to you, you should talk to some more people outside your bubble my friend.
