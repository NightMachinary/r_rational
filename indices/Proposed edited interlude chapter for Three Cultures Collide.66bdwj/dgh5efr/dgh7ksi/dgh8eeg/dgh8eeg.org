this I agree is true. the political nature of the topic and how I've treated will be polarizing -- it actually should offend both camps, as both "progressives" and "religious cults" are called out as wrong.

EY didn't do a great job of distancing himself from those critiques, unfortunately. He talked a lot about how many people want to engage in rape from either side, and a lot of his responses were somewhat baffling.

I have no opinion on what would or would not have happened had he written it differently. This conversation came up in a recent thread that indicated there were quite a few people that had decided not to share the fit that otherwise might have. that is a measurable failing of the original work that could be rectified.

of course, the problematic passage could just be cut, instead of replaced.
