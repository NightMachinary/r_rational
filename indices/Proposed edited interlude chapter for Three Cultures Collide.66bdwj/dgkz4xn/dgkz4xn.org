I think an interesting replacement topic for rape is /the right to raise your children/. It makes total sense to the modern human that that should be a right- indeed, it's outrageous that some politician would even consider banning it. But in a more post-scarcity-like society, culture may dictate that giving newly created sentient minds favors that are dependent on the status of their biological gene-donors makes zero sense, and the human tendency to favor our own young more than others' is only an irrational animalistic instinct, so much so that banning favoritism like that helps children fairly partake of the free benefits society gives them when they're too young to be functional.
