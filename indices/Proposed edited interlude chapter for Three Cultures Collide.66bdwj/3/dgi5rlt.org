Personally speaking, I would have chosen "mass surveillance" as the moral issue of choice. With full surveillance/sousveillance then everyone feels safe and crime doesn't happen, but it would seriously tick off our desire for privacy. Ideally, the human culture should be understandable, but still alien.
