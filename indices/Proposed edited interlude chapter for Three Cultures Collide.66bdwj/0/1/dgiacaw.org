  I guess, but one of the strengths of Yudkowsky's example is that literally everyone agrees that rape should be illegal forever.

...agreed, but just like abortion, there are wildly varying views on what should constitute "rape" in the legal sense and what the context should be. For example, is it just the non-consensual sex act itself? Is it that, applied to a woman you don't own? Is it a crime against the institution of law itself, or against her owner? What is its severity? It's not universally agreed-upon by any means, and varies wildly between different cultures and population groups.
