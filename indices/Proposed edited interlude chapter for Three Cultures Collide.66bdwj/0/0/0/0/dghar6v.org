Should this offend both camps?

Progressive don't defend a "human right" to kill infants. Instead, they're defending a woman's right to stop being pregnant.

It happens that abortion is the only practical way to do that. But when you write:

  Incubation technology was poor at the time, and expensive. Most children were still born “naturally” then, carried by the mother to full term. To forbid abortion was to deny the mother agency over her own body, to violate the sanctity of her very person

You're implying that the society has solved those technical limitations. And women in this society can still exercise full autonomy over their bodies.

I don't see how the future society is creating situations that we, as modern readers, should consider repugnant.
