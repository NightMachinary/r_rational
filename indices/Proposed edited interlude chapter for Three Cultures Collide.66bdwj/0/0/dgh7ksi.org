Yeah, not to mention the original point of the [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/gw/politics_is_the_mindkiller/][Politics is the Mind Killer]] post was merely to suggest not using political examples in your writing because humans do particularly badly at reasoning in politically charged contexts due to in part how extra super tribalistic it is. The original post even recommends for example discussing something from the time of Louis XVI over something from today if you can so help it (and especially if it doesn't damage the core point of whatever you're saying), and making the values drift example a contemporarily politically divisive topic is essentially falling into the same pitfall, and choosing something basically universally reviled (e.g. rape) is the Louis XVI option.

Considering that Three Worlds Collide was in part an illustrative fic to help communicate the concepts of [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Alien_values][alien values]] and some stuff about [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/xy/the_fun_theory_sequence/][fun theory]] I think making the example politically charged would make things only worse than it is. Already you can find people insinuating that EY is actually sympathetic to rape or didn't do enough to suggest that rape is actually bad or disendorse it enough as an writer and this is surely a topic heinous enough that you would think that people would recognize the position as Clearly Not The Author's Actual Opinion, Duh. If it was something currently politically charged god only knows the kind of assumptions and reading into intentions that readers would inevitably have done, and accordingly would have dismissed the story as partisan or whatever in mindkilled stupor.
