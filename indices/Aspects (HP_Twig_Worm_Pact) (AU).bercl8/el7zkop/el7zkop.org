I am not yet sure if this will turn out to be rational, but it has so far avoided being irrational. It is currently in its infancy, but features /several/ competent main characters, which is very rare and promises an interesting experience. They all have different ways of thinking and relating to their problems, as well as emotional reflexes, so watching the contrast between their reactions can be as enjoyable as watching the reactions themselves. We also get interesting takes on what X thinks of Y's thought processes, with some characters showing unexpected depths.
