I got chills when Master-Stranger protocols were invoked. Those protocols are almost rationality in a /can,/ and their presence and execution were phenomenal.

I was really skeptical going into this, but I have to say, it does a great job with the voice of my favorite protagonist, Sylvester; it nails Skitter's cautious mindset and propensity for calculated risk taking (I wanted to clap when she went to Dumbledore); it brings in my favorite existential threats in the form of Pact's demons and Abyss; and the Harry Potter universe... Well, it's kind of the ultimate fanfic canvas at this point because it's so, so established and so much fic has sprung up from the setting.

Oh, and Dumbledore is /great./ Nailed his personality, and he is definitely absolutely /not/ the kind of person who wants to repeat his own mistakes-- Dumbledore makes for a fantastic rational character and he's in top form here.

So I'm calling it here: Voldemort will discover diabolism, because the worst most powerful things from those two canons can't just not glom onto each other in the most inconvenient possible way for the protagonists. Lewis is the top candidate for bringing Voldy on board with Pact's dirty bomb magic.

Which is to say, Wildbow protagonists: they do everything as right as they can with the knowledge they have, and Things Get Worse because reality isn't a game they can just munchkin to win.

I'm just really impressed with this.
