Aspects is really good, mostly on the virtue of fucking /nailing/ character voice. Sylvester and Blake are right on target, Taylor isn't too far off the mark, and Harry is recognizeable, even in fanon form. Any story that has Sylvester operating on full blast is going to be a fun read, and the extra stuff only makes it more interesting. It's a far cry away from his MCU/Worm cross, although that was fun too.

If I have one complaint, it's that all of the protagonists have typical Cannot Spit It Out syndrome WRT having been reincarnated, and it took a while to move past that. Given the circumstances, it's understandable.
