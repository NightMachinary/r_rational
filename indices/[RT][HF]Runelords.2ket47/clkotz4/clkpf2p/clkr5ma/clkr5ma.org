Wow, that is the /worst/-case scenario for a Metabolism dedicate. Yeah, uh, never mind. On second thought, it's almost half as good as a weaker form of cryonics. Pitch it as jumping a couple decades into the future, and you might get nonzero volunteers even if it does cost around a quarter of your lifespan.

Can you, say, give a Metabolism endowment to a special forces person, or a vampire slayer during apocalypse season, and then have them give it /back/ if they survive? You could only do it once per pair of people of course.

Those other three I could imagine just being sold. Again depending on how debilitating it is to give them up. You don't need a lot of people trading, though it'd be nice; just enough that you can usually find a seller/buyer eventually. Though it might be a good idea to restrict it to trades instead of sales, to try to decrease the social inequality.
