Set up a market for Endowments. I would consider trading my endowment of Glamour for an extra of Voice, and there are likely to be more people who would make the opposite trade. Depending on what happens to a dedicate of Metabolism, it could conceivably be a step /up/. If so, sell it to the military for money. If there's a war on, you /know/ they're buying.

Also, if A gives an endowment to B and B gives it to C, it disappears when B dies. What if A dies? If not, there's a way to have more total endowments than population simply by passing them off (through an intermediary) while on your deathbed. Combines nicely with the above because intermediaries who don't mind giving up their own endowments are easier to come by if there's a market.

I never understood why anyone would give up their endowment of Mind, but you can get it from condemned criminals if you don't mind being unethical. Have a truly terrible prison system, and when they'd rather be mindless, you can grant their wish.

I think a Raj Ahten scenario might be inevitable, just because /someone's/ going to stockpile Voice and use it to convince people to give them more endowments.
