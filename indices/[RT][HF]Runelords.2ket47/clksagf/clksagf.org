Sounds like an interesting system to build a story around. I've ordered the first book off Amazon to check it out - I'll report back when I've read it.

Edit: I've read the first book, which was quite good. /The Runelords/ falls into a category of speculative fiction that I'll call "One Big Idea", in that it's mostly centered around this singular magic system and all of the other details flow naturally from that. While the book doesn't restrict itself to only a single type of magic, that first, big grounded one sets the stage for everything else, and the natural conclusions of such a system set the stage for human dramas to play themselves out. The magic gets incorporated into the lives of the characters, as well as their society, in a way that I think fantasy often misses out on. And the primary antagonist of the book is set up very nicely.
