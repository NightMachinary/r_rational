Endowments are broken only on the death of the dedicate or of the endowed--there is no other way to break them, IIRC. The third spoiler-tag above has a workaround for that, though--[[#s][spoiler]]

What happens to the dedicate for all the endowments I can remember:

- Strength: Becomes too feeble to move
- Grace: Becomes paralyzed (as stiff as a board)
- Stamina: Becomes extremely sickly? (My memory is fuzzy.)
- Mind: Falls into a coma (gains some memories of the endowed on the latter's death)
- Voice: Becomes mute
- Glamour: Becomes hideously ugly
- Metabolism: Falls into a super-low-energy "stasis" mode

Runes for more narrow endowments--e.g., skill at dancing, rather than just plain Grace--were rumored to be known in other lands, but never shown in-story. (I may be forgetting one or two endowments--remember, I haven't read this in years...)
