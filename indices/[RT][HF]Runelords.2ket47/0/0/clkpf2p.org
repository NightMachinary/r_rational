A person can give only /one/ endowment in his entire life, so I'm not sure a market would be very active.

IIRC, a dedicate of Metabolism falls into a coma, just like a dedicate of Mind--though his upkeep is much less expensive, since he hardly needs any nourishment! Almost /no one/ is willing to cut his remaining lifespan in half by taking even one endowment of Metabolism, regardless of how useful it is (it basically makes you into the Flash, but without any "Speed Force" or whatever protecting you), much less several--endowments of Strength, Grace, and Endurance are far more common among Runelords' royal guardsmen. I can see how an unemployed peasant might want to give an endowment of Metabolism to lessen the strain on his poor family, though.

An endowment disappears when its original dedicate dies, regardless of how the connections are finagled--you can't re-assign the dedication to an intermediary. In your scenario, if A dies, B notices nothing (he's nothing but a conduit), but C loses the endowment that A had been granting to him.
