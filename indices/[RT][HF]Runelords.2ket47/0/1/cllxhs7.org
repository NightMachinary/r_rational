The all-or-nothing nature of endowments puts a huge wrench in that. You're talking about being utterly hideous in exchange for having a lovely voice, hoping to find another who is willing to be beautiful but mute.

Anyone who discovered a way to give partial endowments, they would create a huge market for them instantly. An exceedingly attractive but poor human might hesitate to become hideous in exchange for money, but becoming only moderately attractive for a reasonable sum is much easier to tolerate. Similarly, if I could donate a quarter of my strength to someone else for a decent price, I'd strongly consider it.
