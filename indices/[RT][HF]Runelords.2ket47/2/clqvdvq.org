That /does/ sound interesting. Although I'm not really sure why the Dedicates don't immediately die, chalk it up to magic?

So, uh ... how do the Mind endowments work? Those seem like the most obvious source of brokenness unless they're handled carefully.

Can you gain enough social-fu through this to essentially mind-control people? Actually, can you blackmail people into becoming Dedicates? Because that whole "Dedicates must be willing" thing seems like a major bottleneck that would be important to expand if at all possible.

Can you gain these "flameweaver" powers by having a Flameweaver Dedicate somewhere? Because if so, that makes Runelords officially the best magic.
