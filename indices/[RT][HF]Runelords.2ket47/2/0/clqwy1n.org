(Bear in mind that it's been quite a few years since I read the books, so my memory is a little fuzzy...)

The more helpless dedicates (Mind, Strength, Grace, Metabolism, Stamina) are cared for by other people, typically. There are whole complexes dedicated to the care of Runelords' dedicates and the housing of their caretakers.

A dedicate of Mind goes into a coma, while the endowed person gains the use of the dedicate's brainpower. If the endowed person dies, the dedicate wakes from his coma, retaining fragments of the endowed's memory; I'm not sure what happens if the dedicate dies. [[#s][spoiler]]

My memory is /extremely/ fuzzy on this point, but I think there /may/ have been something about how endowments of Voice and Glamour would be ineffective during the actual ritual of endowment-transfer. Blackmail and threats of torture work fine, though, IIRC.

Flameweaving is a different sort of magic, derived from a binding oath of service to a deity of fire. I don't remember the specifics, but I don't think the two types of magic mesh well. In any event, there are only a few kinds of endowment runes available (though others are rumored to be known in other lands), and a flameweaving rune is not among them.
