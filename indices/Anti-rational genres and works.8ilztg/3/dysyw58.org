I am not entirely sure what to do with your question. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalization_(psychology][Rationalization]]), as far as I know, is an inherently human thing, and no human is "incapable" of it. From context I presume you meant "inability to explain" instead? Those are not the same, and I'd even call them opposites in some sense.

As far as genres that have characters be unable to explain or unwilling to try to explain a certain facet of their world... Pretty much all of them? From the sidebar:

#+begin_quote
  In Rationalist Fiction, rationalist and scientific methods are used to demystify mysterious phenomena.

Since it is stated as a major distinguishing feature of the genre, it implies that most of the works /outside/ the genre do not possess it. Which is fairly consistent with my experience. It's not like Frodo ever asked any pointed questions to Gandalf regarding his magics.

Finally, regarding this:

#+begin_quote
  a protagonist has to 'surrender' to the idea of a something so much greater than them, they can't rationalize or explain it
#+end_quote

I am not entirely certain why something being greater than you, in whatever sense of the word, would cause you to be unable to make predictive models of it. Nuclear fusion at the hearts of stars is greater in destruction (just from the sheer amount of energy involved) than anything humans have done, but we still can make models about it. Economics involves thousands of humans, AI research is already so complex no single person can "see" what is happening on all levels of it at once (i.e. model what a neural network would do starting from properties of transistors, or even from machine code) and modern medicine is getting so complex we are close to tapping into the images inside someone's brain, but we can still perfectly well make models about them. One the other hand, Force is a fairly trivial future prediction/telekinesis thingie that works incredibly intuitively and results of applying it can be predicted by a ten year old. There isn't much "great" or unintuitive about it in comparison to some of the things humans are actually capable of modeling. Schr√∂dinger Equation would eat Force for breakfast and not even notice it.

Oh, and doctor Strange was just a classic straw man of a "rational" person at the beginning of the movie. There was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5as909/spoilers_doctor_strange_is_the_antirational_movie/][even a post about it]] here when movie came out.
