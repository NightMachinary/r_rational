I read a book about two higher beings going to earth (or awakening two humans not sure anymore) and every human attacks them on sight. I guess it should have some bullshit about the higher beings frequency. But I stopped after some doctors smacked themselves into forcefields to hurt those two. The npc were just acting horrible unbelievable.

Anyhow I felt strong emotions and then rage quit. So not sure if this irrational behaviour was designed that way.

If you want to know the books name, I can look if I can find it.
