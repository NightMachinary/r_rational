Ted Chiang's /Hell is the Absence of God/ is a short story that takes place in a world "in which the scientific method doesn't work" (according to the author). It very effectively uses irrationality to inflict despair upon the main characters and the reader.

Hopefully that is a strong enough warning. Also, I thought it was a good story.
