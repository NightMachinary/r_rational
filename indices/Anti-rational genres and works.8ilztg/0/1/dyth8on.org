Why are the magic systems you listed in your third point anti rational? Yes, they are verifiably not how our world works, but in fiction it could be a simple fact of the world. I don't see why those magics encourage any type of anti rational behavior, even if the real people who believe in them aren't rational.

Those magics may tend to appear more often in works that are not rational, but I don't see why they are necessarily anti rational. You could drop a rational character into a universe with those magic systems, and have that character use them without giving up their rationality.
