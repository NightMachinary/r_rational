I'll say that it applies to anything currently inside your body, and the effect doesn't apply to things you hold.

So if you have something hidden in your stomach the effect applies to that, and stops once it's taken out.

Regarding muscle mass/strength/etc, I'll say that it doesn't increase, ie it stays as it was when the effect is not being used.

Edit: so the square/cube problem would apply.
