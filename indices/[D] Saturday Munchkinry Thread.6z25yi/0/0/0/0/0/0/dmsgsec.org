The problem with trying to munchkin is that if your methods are too normal, someone would have already thought of it. So this really only leaves you with two ways to munchkin:

(1) Design methods that exploit esoteric scientific facts, so people who don't know these facts can't think of these methods.

(2) Design methods that involve such cruelty or self-mutilation that normal people's brains would censor them before they can even think of it.

I'm not a very smart person, so I usually rely on (2). My first thought whenever I'm asked to munchkin a superpower is: Can I chop off my hand to use it better? Surprisingly often, the answer is yes.
