Define "out".

Let's say I implant something in my hand. I then use my mass changing power. Then I chop off my hand. What happens to the mass of the implant? Does it revert? Does the hand still count as part of my "body"?

What if, instead of chopping off my hand, I just leave it dangling by a long string of skin? Or perhaps an intestine for longer range...

Or better yet, what if I get lots of skin grafts? I mean, LOTS of extra skin. I could say, wrap a rocket in my skin, thus making the rocket "inside" my "body", and then decrease its mass so I can launch it into space for much much less fuel.
