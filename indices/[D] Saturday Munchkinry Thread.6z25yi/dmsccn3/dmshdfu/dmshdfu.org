  If you were to loose a limb you could eat enough meat/bones whatever to regrow another limb.

If you chop off your hand and eat it, would you regrow it?

Can you grow more limbs? Like if you eat a spider, do you get to have 8 limbs?

Can you eat a unicellular organism and gain the ability to reproduce via mitosis, thus allowing you to create countless clones of yourself?

Also, since you can copy bacterial abilities, the best way to use this power is to actually get a lab for growing bacteria. Bacteria mutate really fast and get all kinds of amazing abilities, including resistances to all kinds of poisons and temperatures and pressures and starvation conditions. Gain enough bacteria abilities and you'll become nigh indestructible.
