Hmmmm....

Octopus makes a good start. Colour-changing, and, if I consume a mimic octopus, /really good/ control over it.

Bat for echolocation. Maybe flight, though I'm less sure of that one; I might only end up with wings strong enough to lift the weight of a bat.

Wolf for sense of smell. (Well, wolf /nose/, at least).

Mantis shrimp to see colours to an extent that no human can match. (Dubious benefit, really; it's kind of like the complete opposite of colour blindness. I'm going to see clashing colours where other people see a monotone.)

Then I'll start putting some serious study into biology...
