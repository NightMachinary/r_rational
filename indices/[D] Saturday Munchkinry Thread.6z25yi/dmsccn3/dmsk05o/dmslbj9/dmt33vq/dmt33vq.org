I mean I somewhat doubt the complexity matters here. After all you can use this to digest grass by getting their gut bacteria, despite the fact that's utterly impossible without a much larger digestive system than what humans have. This ability just doesn't seem limited by normal biology otherwise most examples you gave wouldn't really work particularly well.\\
Of course you also need to be able to somewhat control which traits you take on as well otherwise this ability would decrease your intelligence massively the first time you used it on an animal so things probably need to be better defined here.
