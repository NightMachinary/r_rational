  Much more likely/reasonable, the device's creator would "preprogram" the definition of dirt into the system,
#+end_quote

Yes, that would be the reasonable thing to do, but this interpretation wouldn't match the description we are given. This device has to /destroy/ *ALL* dirt and grime. ALL. Dirt is context-specific, and thus impossible to pre-program. New contexts and situations arise all the time, with the definition of dirt changing dynamically. If you drop some exotic previously unknown material on the ground, and it becomes dirt, the device has to somehow recognize it as dirt and *destroy* it, while not destroying any exotic previously unknown material that isn't dirt.

Otherwise the device wouldn't be destroying *all* dirt, it would just be destroying *some* common variants of dirt.

  Or, perhaps the power is limited in range (only things within the same room, or say, 30 ft) and/or power (it can only clean X grams of material per hour), which would prevent such extreme abuse - in which case you could still, say, "clean" a target's heart from the other side of a room, which might make you an effective assassin.

Yep, we're told that it takes a few seconds to "clean" a room. So no instant cleaning a planet or a universe. Still means you can utterly destroy anything you want within a few seconds though, as long as its sufficiently small (or close). Actually I'm not sure what metric is being used here. Is it mass that determines the time taken? Or proximity?

  you could "clean"/dispose of extremely harmful substances, such as spent nuclear fuel.
#+end_quote

That's not really a munchkin though, since you're just using the power for it's intended purpose. Cleaning air/water/waste (possibly nuclear).
