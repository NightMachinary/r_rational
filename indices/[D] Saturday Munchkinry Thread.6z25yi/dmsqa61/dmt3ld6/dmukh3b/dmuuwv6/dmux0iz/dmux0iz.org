Hmmm. Valid point. But, as counterpoint, the information about the clean state of the city /exists/. If I go into a room that has not been cleaned in thirty years and I wish to discover the colour of the floor tiles under the dirt, then I can use this power; or I can use hot water and a scrubbing brush.

The power is not, in usual usage, generating /new/ information. I see that it can generate information that the user in particular does not know, but it's not coming from a vacuum - that is then information recorded in the environment around him.
