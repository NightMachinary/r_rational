Boltzmann brains contain only knowledge equivalent to random noise. So yes, it is true that with a sufficient source of randomness I'll eventually be able to find any given piece of code, it's only useful if I can verify it... and it is the verification step that provides the greatest difficulty.

But if you can time travel, then there are other shortcuts to provide information. (There's an interesting attempt to make use of this in Harry Potter and the Methods Of Rationality; which ultimately fails, but the principle holds...)
