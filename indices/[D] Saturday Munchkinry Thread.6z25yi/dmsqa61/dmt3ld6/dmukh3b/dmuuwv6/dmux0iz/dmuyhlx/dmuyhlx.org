  The power is not, in usual usage, generating new information. I see that it can generate information that the user in particular does not know, but it's not coming from a vacuum - that is then information recorded in the environment around him.

Ah but whether something is new information in that sense is far more ambiguous than you would think. For one the power presumably has omniscience since there's no talk of lightspeed limits or any of the other limits you need in order to obtain information without violating thermodynamics. Meaning if one or more varieties of multiverse exist (whether many worlds or eternal inflation or any number of others, which aren't mutually exclusive) then there will most certainly be a universe wherein the source code you're looking for exists.\\
Hell it doesn't stop there either. Since we aren't limited to future light cone limits it could pick a reference frame in which any future event has already happened. Meaning that any information can be drawn upon since boltzmann brains will inevitably come into existence possessing that information.

Plus even besides all the ways in which the information you're looking for could exist in another universe or the far future, there's other questions as to whether the information isn't just implicit. After all erasing the grime from a city is changing the state of it's physical system to create information that hadn't previously existed. More generally any physical change creates information which hadn't previously existed just based on the formal definitions of information. So in a formal framework the difference between deleting physical structures that count as dirt in a way that happens to generate the source code of a GAI and any other application is not that clear.
