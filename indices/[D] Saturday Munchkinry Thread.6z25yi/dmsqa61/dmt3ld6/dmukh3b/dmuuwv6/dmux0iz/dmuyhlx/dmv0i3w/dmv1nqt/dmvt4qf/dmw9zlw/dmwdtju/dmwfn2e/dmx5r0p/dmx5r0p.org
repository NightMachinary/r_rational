  Yeah I'd start by just removing all the lifeforms that aren't already present in basically everybody from everyone's bodies, since people are dying all the time.

Again, small area first. There might be some beneficial bacteria that there's a dozen variants of - and one of which provides the full benefit, and any one of which occurs in no more than one tenth of the population.

  While I would test it first (say on some people who found out secret information) it seems very unlikely anything bad would happen. After all I'm only killing a handful of cells and neurons die all the time, hell I might be able to get away with just deleting the synapses forming the memory without even killing most or any affected neurons.

This depends a lot on exactly how the brain stores memories. Does it really compartmentalise to that extent, or are memories built on top of each other, such that every individual memory touches on almost every neuron in some way?

  The issues I was concerned with really are only an issue with AI wherein rushing it almost certainly kills everyone.

Okay, that is a very, very important point. We do not want to kill everybody.
