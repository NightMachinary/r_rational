Well, that's certainly interesting. Removing most weapons and all pollution seems well within the limits of this power, as is removing given people. (Not sure whether or not the power can read /other/ people's intentions, so it might not be all that straightforward to determine guilt, but this won't stop you from achieving world dominance if you're careful and ruthless enough).

Hmmmm... as to any other nitpicks amongst your further ideas (I'm not suggesting they wouldn't work, just trying to find places where things could go wrong):

  All pathogens simply cease to exist among humans or domesticated animals

Useful, though might I recommend learning the difference between beneficial bacteria (e.g. gut flora) and harmful bacteria first. (Ideally, in fact, learning a lot of biology; I'm sure some otherwise quite deadly bacteria play important parts in decomposition, for example).

It might be best to do this in only a limited area first and then expanding only once it's been seen to work. (Recommendation: A large hospital. For two reasons; first, if something does go wrong, they have the staff to identify the problem, and secondly, no-one's going to think that the elimination of bacteria in a hospital is surprising enough to investigate further).

  People can voluntarily have memories removed if they are causing significant psychological harm.

Slicing bits of neurons out of someone's brain may well leave them a drooling vegetable. Especially if memories are stored in a highly distributed manner... test this first on people who are about to die (condemned criminals at first, I think).

  Civilization can get unlimited easy power

  I could mass produce many chemicals by deleting components of existing chemicals. Better yet I could produce rare elements by deleting protons and neutrons from heavier more common heavier elements,

Oooooh. These two - these two I really like. Brilliant.

  Anyway you get my point, I would be able to create a post scarcity utopia relatively quickly.
#+end_quote

You could certainly change the world, and arguably for the better. (I wouldn't say /certainly/ for the better, given that you'd be in charge of everything and I don't think that 'in charge of everything' is a thing that any single individual can really handle - but you would be including a few clear changes for the better in with the package, like unlimited easy power).

I don't think it would be completely post-scarcity, though the world would certainly have /different/ scarcities while you and your power remain present. (Major scarcity: matter. Your power works only by destroying it, never creating it, so your power has a limit there.)

  From there I have the ability to put massive resources into research and my power would be able to alleviate a significant number of concerns with regards to AI and other techs.
#+end_quote

That would be helpful...

#+begin_quote
  As well as ensured I had monopoly on all tech and didn't have to worry about competition.
#+end_quote

...not so helpful. Wanting to get there before the "other guy" tends to help humans to work harder. (The easy fix for this, of course, is to control two or three different tech companies yourself and play them off against each other...)
