  Given the sheer number of neurons in the brain killing a few of them really isn't likely to cause any issues, like I'm not sure you get /just how many/ neurons there are just involved with memories, ~9,000 neurons die every day anyway so I'm /extremely/ confident there won't be any issues.

And you may well be right. But... I don't know enough neurobiology to know for sure. What if you end up deleting (for example) all the neurons that habitually hold a memory that is fifteen hours old? Then the next time that a memory needs to get moved into that area, there's nowhere for it to go, and there's never a memory moving /out/ of that area... and you end up with someone with only a fifteen-hour memory.

Thing is, there are /loads/ of questions. And I know that I don't know enough to answer them. In fact, it seems likely that experimental data would be required to answer them. (Fictional evidence tends to be horrible. I could write a story about it succeeding, or about it failing in any of a dozen different, superficially plausible ways.)
