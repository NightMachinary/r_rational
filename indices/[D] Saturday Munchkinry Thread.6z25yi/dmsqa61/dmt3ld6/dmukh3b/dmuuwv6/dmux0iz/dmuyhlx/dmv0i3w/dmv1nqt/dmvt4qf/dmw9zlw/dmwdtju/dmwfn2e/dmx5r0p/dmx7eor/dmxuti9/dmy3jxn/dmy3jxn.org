Given the sheer number of neurons in the brain killing a few of them really isn't likely to cause any issues, like I'm not sure you get /just how many/ neurons there are just involved with memories, ~9,000 neurons die every day anyway so I'm /extremely/ confident there won't be any issues.\\
As for memories moving around that isn't really relevant since I'll have the power damage/destroy only the neurons that currently hold the memory. Also that article makes me think I can probably get rid of memories by having the power continually delete certain chemicals within those particular neurons so I'm now back to thinking it's more likely than not that I wouldn't need to destroy neurons.
