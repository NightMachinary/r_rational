...you seem to be operating on a basis of if it didn't specifically say the power /can't/ do that, then assume that it could.

When I look at the original description of the power, I am not seeing any information that it can generate that couldn't be generated with warm water, soap, and a few hours. (More than a few, if we're talking about an entire city). So I see no indication that it's breaking lightspeed limits - drawing info from alternate universes - or anything of that nature.

  After all erasing the grime from a city is changing the state of it's physical system to create information that hadn't previously existed.

By its very nature, the act of cleaning is a deliberate attempt to revert the state of an object to a newly-purchased state, i.e. a past state. While cleaning with soapy water is not perfect - and thus will likely leave a subtly different system - I see no reason to outright assume that this power does not simply recreate a past state.
