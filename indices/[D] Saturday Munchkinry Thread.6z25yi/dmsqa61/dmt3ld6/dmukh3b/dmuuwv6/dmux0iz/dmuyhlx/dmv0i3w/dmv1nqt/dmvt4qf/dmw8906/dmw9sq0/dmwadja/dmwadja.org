Eh it's starting to become clear which interpretation you want to go with is based heavily on preference. Anyway even if you can't put forward a consistent model that works like how you're proposing, I can certainly believe one is possible. So see my other comment for how that would be exploited if you can only rely on information intrinsic in the prexisting material it can look at.

  Now, this is a more interesting application of the ability. From cleaning to potential time travel without requiring omniscience on the way...

That actually does basically allow omniscience if you remember what I said about drawing on information from boltzmann brains in the far future. If you can do time travel then you can draw on any information that will ever exist in the future, which eventually includes anything of finite complexity. Also FTL means in many models of the universe (such as eternal inflation) you can draw upon other universes for information even without time travel.\\
Better yet with time travel you can set up a code phrase, then come up with some elaborate meaning for the power to read into it in the future, so as soon as you get the power all you have to do is say the code phrase. Of course as is always the issue with time travel everything ought to have already been overtaken by a singularity AI retroactively since a short time after the big bang.
