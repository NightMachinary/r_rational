I think a lot of munchkining can be avoided if you just assume some kind of coherent extrapolated volition for concepts; something counts as "dirty" or "clean" if a typical human with sufficient knowledge would consider it to be dirty or clean. There are going to be fuzzy areas even then, but there aren't infinite fuzzy areas, and nobody is going to think "area with dirt removed in patterns corresponding to source code" or even "area with nuclear missiles removed" counts as clean.

This is especially so when the effect is based on magic, since perhaps the main difference between science and magic is that magic assumes that high-level human concepts are fundamental descriptions of the universe. (That's why it's a trope to have spells that can't create food or valuables, for instance.)
