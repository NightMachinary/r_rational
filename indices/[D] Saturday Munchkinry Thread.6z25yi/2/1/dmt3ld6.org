Well nobody's said it yet so I'll state the obvious world domination/optimization answer. I believe I saw something like this online before but that version was much more exploitable because it didn't just get rid of material but could change things in a much less limited way in order to make them "clean".\\
Nonetheless even if you can only remove material doesn't mean you can't still achieve world optimization.

The way you go about it is to rely on the fact the power can clearly use information you don't have access to. So if you have enough of a transhumanist streak then one can likely take a bunch of randomly generated bits and find a way to make yourself view all the bits that wouldn't make up the source code for your perfect FAI as unclean. So just represent your bits as ridges of varying size and the power will delete all the one's that wouldn't be belong in that part of the sequential sequence of the aforementioned seed AI source code.\\
Anyway with enough time using a system like this you should be able to inscribe an entire source code for your seed AI that also happens to be a botnet virus thus allowing it to spread as soon as you get it onto your computer and instantiate itself.

TLDR: With the right setup you can use this ability to generate arbitrary information.
