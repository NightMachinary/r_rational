  By its very nature, the act of cleaning is a deliberate attempt to revert the state of an object to a newly-purchased state, i.e. a past state. While cleaning with soapy water is not perfect - and thus will likely leave a subtly different system - I see no reason to outright assume that this power does not simply recreate a past state.

Except that's not really necessarily true, since taken as a whole in the city cleaning example there would likely have never been a point in the past in which the city was ever not filthy. Reverting things to a previous state just clearly isn't what's going on here.

  ...you seem to be operating on a basis of if it didn't specifically say the power can't do that, then assume that it could.

And I'm operating on what seems to be the strictly simplest interpretation of cannon. Whereas you are assuming a massive among of limitations which aren't even hinted at in the original text in order to force things to conform to you particular intuitions about how the power ought to work.

Also even if you /could/ only revert objects to their previous state it would still be pretty trivial to arrange a setup practically indistinguishable from my original setup in order to extract the previously mentioned AI source code, simply by separating the information medium into a great may individual "pieces". That doesn't really solve the greater problem you seem to have with "information creation", and getting a rigorous definition of what counts as new information (that doesn't rule out many applications you would want to work) here would be quite difficult.
