  Each individual bit can be reverted piecemeal.

That still doesn't work because it's relatively easy to come up with examples wherein the parts of something were never clean. For instance an object that ended up covered in soot as part of it's manufacturing process and was never cleaned before being used as part of the infrastructure in the aforementioned perpetually filthy city.\\
More importantly however the power working this way would conflict with cannon. Since the OP said it worked like a very selective black hole, meaning it can only delete material. However this means that cleaning an object that had heavily rusted would make it smaller according to cannon whereas if you were merely reverting it the mass of iron would remain the same. So certain types of cleaning are going to be impossible because they require moving material around or creating it.\\
Importantly here cleaning an object will /never/ be the same as reverting it's temporal state. Because a few atoms of the material will always have escaped due to processes ranging from sublimation to quantum tunneling.

  Maybe I'm just being dense here, but I'm not seeing how this works. Elaborate? I'm not even seeing how to get one bit of the AI in this way (though if I can get one bit reliably, I can then see how to get all the bits)

It's pretty simple all you have to do is start with say a bunch of 0's then turn them into 1's. Then selectively have the 1's that aren't part of the AI's source code declared unclean and reverted. Actually I think that plan may be somewhat simpler than the original one I devised. The medium you use for the bits isn't super important it just needs to be such that the default state is all 0's before you inscribe anything onto it and the bits need to be represented as physical states (as opposed to magnetic fields).\\
Only being able to revert things to their previous state still doesn't change the fact the power needs to possess knowledge you lack, and in fact given the sheer complexity of nearly any object (assuming the cleaning is truly perfect at the atomic level) it will have more information than you could even fit inside your mind. So coming up with a consistent ruling on the information it has is as I said before difficult.

  You and I have remarkably different ideas of what is meant by "simplest". I'm trying to model the power in such a way as to minimise alterations in the laws of physics necessary to make it work, and secondarily to minimise omniscience of the power.

Given total violation of thermodynamics is a given I'm not sure to what extent trying to assume other laws apply really simplifies things here and given the ability to extract information out of thin air with no expenditure of energy or interaction with the relevant system is a given. So making further assumptions that it just so happens to be limited to only one ill-defined "type" of information doesn't simplify things.\\
Importantly exploiting the thermodynamics violations seems pretty likely to let you somehow extract negative energy via creating areas of lower than vacuum energy. Which if you could make it work would allow FTL and potentially causality violations as well.
