  But if you can time travel, then there are other shortcuts to provide information. (There's an interesting attempt to make use of this in Harry Potter and the Methods Of Rationality; which ultimately fails, but the principle holds...)

I mean given it only fails by what is effectively author fiat I think that sort of thing ought to work. Still verification is an issue since value alignment requires hitting a small target in mind space.

However it's not an insurmountable issue. For instance you could have the power look for places in the future where instead of boltzmann brains you got a boltzmann universe nearly identical to our own that will develop on its own without relying on random chance. Then you extracted information by viewing the future of these universe, basically ripping off their AI tech, and you can determine friendliness by seeing how the GAI acts once out of containment.\\
In addition you might well look for a universe where the AI researchers created neuromorphic AI first and due to pure random chance (cosmic radiation flipping bits or whatever) the created AI happened to be an exact copy of you, except for its knowledge of the power (don't want it trying to manipulate you into instantiating it). Then just look at it after it escapes containment to make sure it acts in a way that indicates it has improved itself without changing its values.

There's also something of a question of whether verification isn't already implicit in the power. After all when it looks for the code for an AI that meets your friendliness standards it may just look at all possible outcomes of codes it could give you and check for the ones that don't lead to unclean outcomes. Or at least if it doesn't automatically do that I think you could get it to with the right conditional statements.

Anyway assuming the power can't affect the period before you received it (otherwise this scenario could never arise to begin with) then you'll probably find yourself in a world controlled by GAI the instant you get the power due to the actions of some other timeline's version of you.
