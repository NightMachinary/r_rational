Still in the spirit of considering the least convenient possible world I will consider a scenario where the power's knowledge and thus cleaning is imperfect and involves interacting with it's future light cone using some form of previously unknown radiation that travels at c. Also assuming the power is dumb enough that you can't use it to generate novel information which would require significant cognitive work for a human to devise. Again this interpretation of canon already has some avenues of exploit I don't know how to patch, and may not be actually be totally consistent with canon but I digress.

In this scenario then I would go the world domination route more directly. Simply deleting much of the world's weaponry and a great many individuals who would only get in my way latter in my plan (as well as people who had committed crimes that would be considered worthy of the death penalty, since I have a perfect method of determining guilt). Also I would remove all the world's pollution returning the atmosphere and oceans to a preindustrial state.\\
At that point I would begin communicating using a variety of means that couldn't be traced back to me carving my messages in the sides of mountains, or any number of other places that ensure they'll be seen. I would force the world to start changing its laws in accordance with my instructions, lest non-cooperative leaders be deleted. Resistance is pretty damned futile when I can have a power that routinely deletes anyone with intentions to rebel. Of course at some point I would put myself in a position of power from the shadows with only a few people knowing I was responsible for all this. However keeping secrecy is pretty easy when you can remove memories (by deleting the handful of neurons holding the memory in someone's brain and any records) or just make people who intend to screw you over not exist.\\
Basically it would be pretty easy to make a utopia by wielding this power. I would say dystopia except it would actually violate less rights than current governments. After all there's no need to do government surveillance when anyone who intends to commit a crime is either destroyed or their information carved into a wall at the police station. Effectively there would be no militaries and the only police force would be a minimal one to pick up criminals. The ability to force total compliance with the law with unlimited force solves a pretty big number of coordination problems as well.\\
Once I've cemented power I can also do more than just restructure society my power has a great many other applications such as:\\
* All pathogens simply cease to exist among humans or domesticated animals, invasive species disappear.

- Cancer is no longer an issue and by killing senescent cells the effects of aging can also likely be diminished (based on some studies that did that).

- People can voluntarily have memories removed if they are causing significant psychological harm.

- Civilization can get unlimited easy power by building power plants and having my power automatically delete electrons within certain structures inside them. The structures don't need to be power plants either I could have pretty much any large machine have a box inside which my power would delete a certain number of electrons in order to get current.

- I could mass produce many chemicals by deleting components of existing chemicals. Better yet I could produce rare elements by deleting protons and neutrons from heavier more common heavier elements, so suddenly lead, radon and a great many other heavy elements spike in value since they can be turned into any lighter element. The applications of having pretty much every element and isotope become as cheap as any element heavier than it will probably have an insane number of applications that I couldn't even imagine.

- I stop any genetic diseases from continuing be deleting sperm/eggs/zygotes that have a particular genetic sequence (though some genes do seem to have an advantage for people with only one copy so I might only delete sperm if the egg already has a copy). Of course just deleting part of a genetic sequence for all of someone's DNA would probably kill the cell, so existing people would have to rely on gene editing which I would dump massive research into.\\
  Plus I can do better than eliminating genetic diseases, for instance my power can be set up so that it selectively deletes sperm/eggs in order to maximize the intelligence, health, etc of resulting offspring. As well as just preventing unwanted pregnancies. Of course all of this is just a stopgap measure until I can implement genetic engineering on a wide scale.

- While I posited the power couldn't generate novel information that doesn't mean it couldn't be used to generate significant amounts of knowledge. Just answering questions using its observational power would be enough to make massive breakthroughs in a wide variety of topics from physics to genetics.

Anyway you get my point, I would be able to create a post scarcity utopia relatively quickly. From there I have the ability to put massive resources into research and my power would be able to alleviate a significant number of concerns with regards to AI and other techs. As well as ensured I had monopoly on all tech and didn't have to worry about competition.
