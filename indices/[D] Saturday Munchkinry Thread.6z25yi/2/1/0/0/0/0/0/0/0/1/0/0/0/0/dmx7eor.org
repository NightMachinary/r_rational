  Again, small area first. There might be some beneficial bacteria that there's a dozen variants of - and one of which provides the full benefit, and any one of which occurs in no more than one tenth of the population.

I wouldn't be going for specific species anyway I would be broader than that, since beneficial bacteria are not likely to be extremely closely related to harmful bacteria. Importantly given all the frozen stool samples from research and the fact that having one's gut flora wiped out is manageable, we can afford to not be overly cautious here.

  This depends a lot on exactly how the brain stores memories. Does it really compartmentalise to that extent, or are memories built on top of each other, such that every individual memory touches on almost every neuron in some way?

I think neuroscience would generally support a significant degree of compartmentalization [[https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/123485-mit-discovers-the-location-of-memories-individual-neurons][based on research that was able to link memories to individual neurons]].
