  That still doesn't work because it's relatively easy to come up with examples wherein the parts of something were never clean.

Hmmmm. Point taken. Reversion to the past is not a suitable cleaning method.

  Since the OP said it worked like a very selective black hole, meaning it can only delete material. However this means that cleaning an object that had heavily rusted would make it smaller according to cannon whereas if you were merely reverting it the mass of iron would remain the same.

Well, you can always have missing bits, as long as the remaining bits are clean. But your point above nixes the temporal reversion idea, anyhow.

  It's pretty simple all you have to do is start with say a bunch of 0's then turn them into 1's. Then selectively have the 1's that aren't part of the AI's source code declared unclean and reverted.

This only works if the power is somehow omniscient; that is, the power somehow knows how the AI works.

In general, cleaning does not require omniscience. Even if the cleaning is perfect on the atomic level. Sure, it needs to handle a /massive/ amount of information, but it's all on a very simple basis - it simply needs to decide, for each atom, whether or not that atom needs to vanish. That is, it needs a rule for deciding what is or is not dirt.

What you're proposing is, in effect, a rule of "it's dirt if it's not part of a suitable AI". And then let the rule - somehow - have to decide what a suitable AI is. So... it's a question that you cannot answer. With ordinary dirt, you could, in principle, with perfect knowledge of the atomic structure of everything, decide which parts are and are not dirt - so the only information that the power really needs, to clean the object, is the atomic structure of the object (which is present right there to be queried) and the state of your brain (to decide what is and is not dirt). But, under your proposed rule, there is nothing in your brainstate which says which bits are or are not to be considered dirt; the power, for the first time, requires external omniscience.

  Importantly exploiting the thermodynamics violations seems pretty likely to let you somehow extract negative energy via creating areas of lower than vacuum energy. Which if you could make it work would allow FTL and potentially causality violations as well.

Now, /this/ is a more interesting application of the ability. From cleaning to potential time travel without requiring omniscience on the way...
