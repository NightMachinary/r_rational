  I think neuroscience would generally support a significant degree of compartmentalization based on research that was able to link memories to individual neurons.

Hmmm. Your article says that a memory can be triggered by poking at the right neuron. That's a long way away from saying that the memory is /only/ held on that neuron. (Also, apparently, memories can [[https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/218730-the-more-we-learn-about-memory-the-weirder-it-gets][move]] after a few months... so it's possible that this will not only delete a recent memory, but also damage the brain's ability to form new memories at all)
