  the more reasonable interpretation
#+end_quote

Eh, what is considered "more reasonable" is fairly subjective though. For example, if you look at this superpower from the perspective of a scientist trying to build such a "cleaning" device, it seems more reasonable to me, that the device would simply read its user's mind for opinions on dirt, rather than read the minds of the *entire human race* for opinions on dirt. The former is far, far easier to build than the latter.
