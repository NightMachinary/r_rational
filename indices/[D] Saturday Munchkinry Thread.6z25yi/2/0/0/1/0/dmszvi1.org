Much more likely/reasonable, the device's creator would "preprogram" the definition of dirt into the system, to prevent someone from using it to commit mass genocide, or just banishing the entire earth ("this entire planet is garbage!"). Even just from a practicality perspective, hardcoding a definition seems much easier than reading the user's thoughts and interpreting their personal definition.

Or, perhaps the power is limited in range (only things within the same room, or say, 30 ft) and/or power (it can only clean X grams of material per hour), which would prevent such extreme abuse - in which case you could still, say, "clean" a target's heart from the other side of a room, which might make you an effective assassin.

If you wanted to actually do something /beneficial/ for humanity, rather than commit murder, you could "clean"/dispose of extremely harmful substances, such as spent nuclear fuel. Even just spending all your energy scrubbing the air/water/etc of pollutants, would be a huge benefit for society.
