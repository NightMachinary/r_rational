I think the main issue here is that we don't have enough technical details on the scope of this power from [[/u/mixbany]].

- What defines dirt/grime? Is it user-defined? Does it carry its own broad pre-defined definition (in which case, in the scenario you described where an exotic new material is spilled, it would /not/ be able to clean that up)?
- We're only given 1-2 /examples/ of its use, but nothing about the /limits/ of its use. How much dirt can it clean per second? What's the range? How often can it be used, and does it need to be recharged?
- When black holes consume matter, the matter doesn't disappear - I'm not a physicist, but from my understanding, a lot is converted to energy, some is released as Hawking radiation, etc. When he says "the material is whisked out of our world", does he mean it's simply teleported away from our planet, to another location within our universe? Or is it completely removed from our universe? Both have heavy connotations for the use of the power.

Because the power is so vaguely defined, we can't really munchkin without making broad assumptions (like, the user can define "dirt/grime", or the range & power are infinite, etc), which make breaking the power extremely easy...
