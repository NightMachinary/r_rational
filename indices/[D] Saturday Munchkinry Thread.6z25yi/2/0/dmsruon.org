I like "cleaning" superpowers, they are super exploitable.

The reason is because "dirt" isn't well-defined. How do you determine what's "dirt and grime" and what's actually supposed to be there? How does it determine that say, a coin or a cushion on the ground isn't dirt, but an empty paper bag or a bread crumb is? How does it determine that a stone on a wooden floor is dirt, while a stone on a stone floor is the floor itself and shouldn't be destroyed? How does it determine that the uranium in your nuclear power plant isn't dirt, but the depleted uranium is?

Now, if your cleaning ability did something like summoning a broom and sweeping the floor, it wouldn't *destroy* /ALL/* dirt and grime. So clearly, you must have some ability to specify what is considered dirt, and what isn't. Perhaps, the ability reads your mind to guess your intentions and acts to fulfill them.

So, take an elevator to the top of a tall building in a crowded city. Look out the window. See the sea of people on the streets, crowding around like /garbage/. /Trash, every one of them./ You can now clean this /human filth/.

With enough mental sophistry, your cleaning ability effectively becomes an extremely precise banishing ability, erasing all parts of the world you dislike while keeping everything you do.
