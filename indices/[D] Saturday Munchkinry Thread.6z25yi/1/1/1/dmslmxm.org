I don't know if that is how it would work. By adding gut bacteria from a cow you are basically allowing the bacteria to live in your stomach. This is different from gaining their powers. Like I said to the starfish dude, these powers probably only work due to their simplicity. Otherwise we would probably have developed regenerative powers ourselves over the years.

The spider part would work with growing exoskeleton limbs out your back but not giving you another pair of human arms. If you were to eat birds to gain wings it would grow on your first set of arms.

Now if you were to eat flying ants and grow an exoskeleton set of wings would you be able to grow them big/strong enough to hold yourself?

same with spider limbs. Could these be strong enough to support your weight? or would they break under pressure?

I could see it being possible to add the spiders eyes inside of your own puples. maybe eat a bullet shrimp to get those really cool eyes.... also maybe eat a bullet shrimp to deck out your pinky finger?
