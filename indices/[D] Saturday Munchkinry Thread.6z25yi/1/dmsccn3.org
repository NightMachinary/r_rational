I dont know if this would be to powerful but the power to ingest any organism and add their "abilities" to your body.

Like if you were to eat a bears nose you could add some or all (depending on how condensed the nerves in a nose can be) to your own nose.

The gut bacteria from a cow to allow you to digest grasses.

The brain of another human to absorb the memories/knowledge.

You would not be able to eat steal and add it your skin or anything like that. If you happen to eat a bug with a heavy iron carapace then you could add that to yourself but it would limit the movement of your own body/disfigure yourself.

You can eat flesh to heal yourself. If you were to loose a limb you could eat enough meat/bones whatever to regrow another limb.

I think the best way to use this power would be to work in a cremation building and eat the brains of the deceased. Maybe this would have the side effect of changing your own personality but I don't know enough about Neurology to understand if that could be a real fear with this ability.
