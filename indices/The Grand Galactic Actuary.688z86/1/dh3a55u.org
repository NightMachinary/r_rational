I disliked this story as I was reading it. I think in hindsight, the reason was that the Insurance Agency was simultaneously depicted as supercompetent and /nice/. It doesn't work that way.

Either they're supercompetent and cut every corner and that's why they rule the galaxy, and when they come to Earth they offer no discounts and it's a true devil's bargain that enslaves the planet.

Or they're nice and they got eaten by space Jackals because that reduced how effective an Insurance Agent they could be. If you chose Insurance Agencies as a trope, you get the good with the bad, and the bad is that they have a lot of ontological inertia as uncaring machines which exist to suck value out of their victims at any price.
