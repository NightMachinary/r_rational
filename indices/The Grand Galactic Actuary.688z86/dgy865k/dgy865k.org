I can't wrap my head around the idea that this humanity would actually try to oppose a galactic power with force - it is clearly in the technological stage where "apes or angels" is the relevant metaphor.

(The humanity of your recent story resisting /The Apathy/, maybe. Besides the lack of an obvious choice, it is conceivable that that humanity would be well along the concave part of the overall technology curve (which I am assuming, here, to be s-shaped), where our versions of computanium and weaponanium are almost as efficient as the aliens versions of the same, and so the result would be basically proportional to the amount of material converted to those materials - a function of the original mass in our respective light cones, set by the universe at the beginning of the game, finite in ratio, and common knowledge... though the ability to pull energy/mass from the vacuum throws some doubt on the validity of that way of thinking.)
