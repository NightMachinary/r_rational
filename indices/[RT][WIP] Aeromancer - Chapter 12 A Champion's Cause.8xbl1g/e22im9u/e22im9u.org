at some point, can you talk about the concept of structured spells vs. moldings? it seems like moldings use up no air, but structure spells do... so is there a difference in how he treats the air in either case? if his moldings get strong enough to carry things then could he carry them indefinitely because his air is not used up? can a sharp molding harm something like an aerial slash?
