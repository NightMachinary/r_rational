The confusion here is likely my fault for failing to comprehensively put what's in my mind on paper, though the questions will let me edit stuff to know how to word it!

In my mind, I see it like mana shaping (similar to Mother of Learning). The difference with my story is that there isn't a physical representation for it (like pen spinning, burning cards, etc).

The mana "shape" affects the mancy to make the shape or whatever, but it wouldn't affect the real world since the molding would be technically a zero-grit thing.

Basically, we can walk through air without resistance rather easily (zero grit) but can feel a light breeze (tier one grit). The moldings cannot be seen nor felt physically, which is why perception is needed. Someone could technically walk through the moldings and not even know they did so.

Another analogy could be like a stick-shift car: moldings would be a permanent first gear ride, whereas spells would be the fifth gear. Use this analogy loosely, but it should give the idea that moldings cannot overpower spells.
