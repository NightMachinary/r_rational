Great request, I'll bring up the topic again when Seti starts learning new stuff at Prestige and some munchkinery happens. For now, just note that moldings have zero effect in the real world like structured spells would. I might edit chapter 8 a little to clarify that part, but nothing that would alter what's needed to know up to this point.
