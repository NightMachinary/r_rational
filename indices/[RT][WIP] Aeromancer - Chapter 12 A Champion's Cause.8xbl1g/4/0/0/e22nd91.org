Looks better, but take my advice with a grain of salt. I think I just dislike the term dragonspawn.

I find it heavily couched in a negative connotation and feels like terminology that only comes up in fantasy writing. Young dragon, initiate dragons... hard to figure out a replacement term used in a modern society that does the concept justice. You might also have some luck mixing it with Italian terms to fit more with the mafia vibe, apprendista, erede, giovane drago or something of that mix.

As you can see I am incredibly biased.
