The story is planned out all the way to the very end and the conclusion of every major plot point. Details include knowing who dies, how characters develop, and major plot twists. Some smaller inbetween stuff is subject to change, but I don't see myself changing anything big.

That's assuming I write that much lol, so I did mark several locations where a story could technically end early and still be somewhat satisfying, despite not finishing all plot points.
