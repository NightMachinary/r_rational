Oof, this is hard to do lol. So quick fun fact: we were supposed to enter Prestige as of Chapter 5 (and be neck-deep with that section of the story as of now). But I wanted to try to make this story as rational as possible, which pushed things back a bit.

I would like for the Prestige-Champion part of the story to end around Chapter 25-30, but we'll see if that'll actually happen.

Overall story word count might be more than where MoL is now. Take that with a grain of salt, as I may decide to cut some mini arcs depending on how the pacing is.
