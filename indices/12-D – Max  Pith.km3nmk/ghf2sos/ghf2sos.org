So in previous comment threads it has been asked who it is that we would want to see "win" here. Well, after this last Interlude it seems clear that the real protagonist has been Maxine Clive all along, and I really want to see where her story is going. Regardless of atrocity and cost, I'm rooting for Clive and Tunnelvision now.
