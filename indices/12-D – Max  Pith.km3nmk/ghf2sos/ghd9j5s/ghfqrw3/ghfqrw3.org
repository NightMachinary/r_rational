  Tunnel Vision clenched her teeth. “I won't be lectured by some half-witted Humdrum.”
#+end_quote

Wow. This was what early Tunnel Vision was like, huh?

Sadly, she didn't improve that much since.

#+begin_quote
  A few minutes later, the woman took the next prisoner in line. Then the next. Faint orange sunlight shone over the top of the makeshift walls, and faded into evening, then pure darkness. And the scientists kept taking prisoners, one by one, like they were all waiting at the doctor's office. And none of them came back.

Human sacrifice?

There's /something/ going on with that black pool, and it's not just a scientific experiment like the surgeries.

Actual sacrifices seem a little too fantasy-ish for this story, but this whole section has a really Lovecraftian feeling, so who knows.

#+begin_quote
  “Most people wouldn't have spit in that scientist's face,” he said. “Most people would have stayed in that pit, watching the guard, waiting for someone to save them. Another thirty seconds down there, and you wouldn't have made it. But here you are.” He stepped to the side, off the path. “The rest is up to you.” “You have four minutes and thirteen seconds to leave this island,” he said.

  “And ruin all the fun?” The man looked offended. “See you later, Maxine Clive.” He strode into the dark cloud, out of sight.

Whatever the deal with this guy is, I'm not sure I like it. The story so far feels mostly organic, the natural result of societal trends and powerful people following their incentives and all that.

Having an Ellimist/Outsider/ROB-type character who just makes the plot progress for idle fun kind of undermines that.

#+begin_quote
  “I'm sorry, Maxine,” said the scientist, with his mouth, but not his eyes. “I'm so sorry.” His voice stayed calm and steady. The other man's hand had almost reached the clicker.
#+end_quote

Man, feels good to see some payback at last.

#+begin_quote
  As usual, management had no idea what they were doing.

  “Fire me, if you want,” said Captain Reddish. “Court-martial me. Put this in my quarterly performance review.”
#+end_quote

Man, this got even Cyberpunk-ier.

(What even is Pith? Biopunk? Gasolinepunk?)

#+begin_quote
  The boss clenched his teeth, furious. Then he put his hand on the captain's shoulder, and his rage melted into a smirk. “Please? Inspire them.”

  Captain Reddish straightened himself and saluted. “Yes, sir!”
#+end_quote

Man, the last moments of that captain must have been horrifying. Complete confusion, all the while knowing he was leading his own soldiers to their deaths.

#+begin_quote
  “We believe that cooperation, not conflict, is the best road forward.”

  Max screamed through her gag, and one of the soldiers punched her in the solar plexus, knocking the wind out of her.
#+end_quote

This story seriously got its corporate tone down. The mix of bland cheeriness with implied or overt violence feels very accurate.

#+begin_quote
  A series of gunshots rang out. The man and woman carrying Max fell next to her, letting go of her. Then, Commander Hibben fell on top of her, splattering a warm liquid over her face.
#+end_quote

What was that line from FMA?

"Half of all officer deaths on the battlefield are attributed to assassinations by subordinates"?

I get the feeling the statistics for Corsair commanders are similar.

#+begin_quote
  Max pointed up. Tunnel Vision followed the direction of her finger, gazing towards the top of the seaside cliff.

  A dozen snipers lay on their stomachs, green circles tattooed on their hands, aiming their rifles down at Tunnel Vision.
#+end_quote

I don't really like that bit.

It feels very close to an anime twist, "I was in control the whole time" and all that, not to how actual soldiers would react. In a world with guns and superpowers and mind-control, experienced snipers wouldn't wait for their boss to give them a signal while she's being thrown off a cliff.

A sniper either takes the shot when they have one, or they die.

#+begin_quote
  Pictogram stared at his feet. “A disgusting, evil policy, made by a government that no longer exists. A leader, the Black Tortoise, who no longer rules the nation. Our fight is righteous, now. We battle against the Principality, against imperialism and cruelty.”
#+end_quote

Interesting.

We get more hints at Shenti politics.

#+begin_quote
  Gage, on the other hand, would be much simpler. They just had to kill her.
#+end_quote

"Meh, we can take her."

#+begin_quote
  Gage opened fire, and Grace dove behind a bookshelf, projecting into Max's clothes to drag her into the same cover.
#+end_quote

/Dammit/, Ana.

--------------

Overall this chapter is a doozy, like much of this story.

I feel so bad for Max. She tried so hard and she got so smart and she played her hand so well, and in the end all it took was for Evil-Superman to go on a rampage and all her efforts went in smoke in a few minutes.
