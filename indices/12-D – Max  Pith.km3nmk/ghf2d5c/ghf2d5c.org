  /Gage/. Why had Max ever thought she could recruit her? The thick-witted idiot would sacrifice herself for the elites at Paragon, again and again, no matter how many times they kicked her.

Damn, even the people in the story are saying it now.

Alright, I know I've said "maybe this will be the thing that changes Ana's mind" about a hundred times by now, but I feel like Paragon's hijacking of Parliament is different. Not just because it's completely beyond the pale (although it is), but because now is a very narratively appropriate time for Ana to realize that Paragon are the bad guys. After all, she just helped them beat Commonplace, something they very well might not have been able to do without her help. What better time to have her realize she's been fighting for the wrong side than after she just secured their victory?

On a related note, I worry that Paragon's mind-controlling of Parliament being made public is going to cause them to go completely mask-off with their authoritarianism. When they've lost even the appearance of legitimacy and restraint, what's stopping them from responding to public unrest with mind-controlling the agitators and brainwashing anyone who speaks out against them?
