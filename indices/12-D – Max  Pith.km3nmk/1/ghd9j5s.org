Frontline infantry!

What's with that huge gap after "The Corsairs punished insubordination" - is it a formatting error, or something else?

Anyways, this was a hell of a chapter. Paragon's hijacked the /entire government/ and nobody's the wiser. There's an entire shadow government/council out there pulling the strings, like they always have.

After all this, I really hope Grace and Max live to the end of their revolution. True, their society turned them into monsters, but what they're fighting it so much worse.
