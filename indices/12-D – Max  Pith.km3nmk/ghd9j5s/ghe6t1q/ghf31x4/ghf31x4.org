Not necessarily. Just because nudging /can/ be defended against, doesn't mean it always will be. That defense is a skill that has to be taught and practiced. Given the degree of control Paragon has, it's quite possible that they only let people become members of parliament if they haven't learned how to defend themselves in that way. Also, Buttercup Lodge used drugs that made people more vulnerable to nudging in order to secure their long term control over the prisoners. I wouldn't be surprised if Paragon used similar techniques here.
