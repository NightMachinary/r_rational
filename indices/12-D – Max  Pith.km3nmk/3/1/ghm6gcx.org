  On a related note, I worry that Paragon's mind-controlling of Parliament being made public is going to cause them to go completely mask-off with their authoritarianism

I'm not sure they made it public yet. Ana's team killed the Radio Man, and Max's narration was ambiguous as to whether they actually managed to transmit it to a broad audience. Also, Kahlin and Verity are still stuck in the building.

I think the green hand survivors are going to try to negotiate with Ana to let them get the message out.
