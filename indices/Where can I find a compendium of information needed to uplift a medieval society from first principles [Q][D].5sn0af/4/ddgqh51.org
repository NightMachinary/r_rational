I mean, I'm pretty sure all of wikipedia can fit onto a phone's hard drive, so it really comes down to personal knowledge and ability to extrapolate practical information from more abstract sources like encyclopedias.

Going from First Principles is different from going the 'screw this I'm going to build guns' route. Teaching people incrementally so they understand /why/ something works the way it does, will eventually result in a faster-developing society, but I'd think it would take longer to bootstrap.
