A few ideas:

- CD3WD was a project to "assisting in third world development" which kind-of aims uplift the third world. Not the same as uplifting a medieval society but could be useful. I'm not sure where to get it these days.
- "preppers" hoard books on how to do things when civilisation collapses, some also include things like the ciriculum and textbooks for each school grade in order to rebuild. Example are [[http://www.ps-survival.com/PS/index.htm][pole-shift]] and [[http://www.survivorlibrary.com/][survivors library]]
- "Great Science Textbooks" (search on pirate bay) and others provide an electronic library.
- Also "CBSE - NCERT Indian School Textbooks" textbooks, which are school textboks used in India (in English). These provide the basics of an education system (search piratebay)
