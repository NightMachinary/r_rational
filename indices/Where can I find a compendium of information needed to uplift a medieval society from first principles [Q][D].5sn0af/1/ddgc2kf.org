I don't know that a complete compendium is feasible. There will always be a finite amount that you can uplift; there's too much in the 20th century alone to put in one book.

Moreover, it would be arrogant for us to assume that the technological development of Western society followed the ideal path. Perhaps we would have been better off developing solar power earlier, and nuclear power later.

/And/, if you've read A Hero's War, then you're aware that attempting to recreate Earth technology too closely in a different world can miss opportunities. Who needs steam power when you have mana?

So, I would instead recommend focusing on cultural shift. Bring enough low-hanging fruit to draw some attention, but what you really want is to encourage the locals to innovate, to experiment. Your biggest enemy may, in fact, be a feudal attitude of building monopolies on everything - which, before the printing press, included knowledge.
