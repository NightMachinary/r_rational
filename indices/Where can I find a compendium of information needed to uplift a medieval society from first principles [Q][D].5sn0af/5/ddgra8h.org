The patent database isn't a bad place to start. I'd immediately grab a copy of that if I was going through a time portal. It isn't enough to rebuild things instantly in a lot of cases, since lots of patents are more of a general overview than a direct set of instructions, but at least you get a description of a huge number of different technologies and some references to how things were done before and to other related patents in the field, ordered by the date they were filed. You just can't beat the patent database on sheer volume of documented technologies in all sorts of fields. Of course some fields will be easier to recover this way than others, and sheer volume of information can also be a downside if you aren't able to sort it efficiently.
