Amazing as always. I really thought, going into this chapter, that my biggest questions at the end would be, "Why are E and C constrained in Their ability to intervene?" and, "What does each god hope to get out of intervening?"

(Elfangor and V1 met the gods directly on earth and came away with restrictions on their memories and behavior; maybe the gods precommitted to not messing with them directly in the future? Maybe that's why the kids had to be teleported a minimum distance away from V1? That could mean Chapman was significant to Their plans as well, which makes the fact that Rachel, who got the Chapmans killed, is "not supposed to be there" suddenly a lot more relevant. Or maybe V1 and Elena meeting the kids was a pure Ellimist goal, and Crayak's goal was for everyone to die in the mist. Maybe C's simulations predicted that that was the most likely outcome, the payoff of millions of years of E putting tree roots in front of fleeing Pemalites and tweaking supernovae so Howler ships fly just a little faster. A thousand tiny nudges later, Crayak's probability models are just the /teensiest/ bit more optimistic than they should be.)
