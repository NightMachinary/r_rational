Some of them are pretty easy to miss if you don't remember the books. Like, that bit about Elena almost killing Visser One by closing one eye is lifted straight up from /Visser/.

Also, it's probably not a coincidence that Marco makes his "ruthlessness is seeing the line from A to B" speech in the same chapter Visser One is introduced in, much like in canon (sort of).
