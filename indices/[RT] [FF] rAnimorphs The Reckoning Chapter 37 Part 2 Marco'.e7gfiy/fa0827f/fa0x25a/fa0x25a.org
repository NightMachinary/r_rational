Chekhov's gun.

I definitely read The Rickoning in every version of the timeline, so it might've seeped into my subconscious. I think you Incepted me, because it feels like it was my own idea. =P

You can steal the quote. =)

#+begin_quote
  when was it established that you could acquire dead bodies?
#+end_quote

Cassie acquired a dead squirrel waaaaay back when she was hiding in the valley, after her parents were taken. She passed that info on to the rest of the group. It's every bit as good as acquiring a living person if you do it /right then/; much like cryonics, it gets rapidly worse over the following minutes, hours, and days.

You need the head, which is why the Marco said to shoot the Arn in the chest. This is because the morphing tech does a molecular scan in addition to grabbing DNA; if you just tried to acquire from a finger what you'd get is the morphing tech's best guess at how the DNA ought to express itself (a kind of fucked-up feral mutant human).

#+begin_quote
  Can't you just demorph and remorph the Arn? Wouldn't the morphing tech fix the degradation every time?
#+end_quote

Yep, you could continually do so, but it means you only get like twenty minutes of control each time, which is annoying. Interestingly, if I've understood the implications correctly, this means that you can get a cloned Quat in like half an hour---the Arn body rots the controlling Yeerk tissue away, and presto.

Wonder what would happen if the morpher then tried to demorph??

#+begin_quote
  Okay, so how are they getting back?
#+end_quote

Jake mentions explicitly negotiating their return trip, but it happened offscreen and we already saw that the avatar is sneaky, if not outright duplicitous. Knowing the exact wording of the agreement would help, but the reader doesn't have that info.

Updates are ... well, "on schedule" is as good a word as any, I have about 40,000 words of content to deliver and expect to make an update in two weeks and at least one more two weeks after that, and also I'm still writing.

But. Uh. Haven't made up my mind what to do about the fact that 37,000 of those 40,000 words are a single chapter that really feels to me like it only works in one chunk.
