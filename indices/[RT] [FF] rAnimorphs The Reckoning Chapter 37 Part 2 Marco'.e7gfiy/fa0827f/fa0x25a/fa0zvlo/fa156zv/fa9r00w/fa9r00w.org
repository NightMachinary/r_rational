We saw right after Ventura that you can emerge directly from the gate, with no construct body or controlling Yeerk tissue. Unless the Ellimist was spending move juice to fake the control tissue?

I wonder if the Chee can do fine enough nanosurgery to remove the gates from a construct body? Let the morpher demorph with nothing to disassemble and the construct walk away?

The Arn could be a way to rapidly harvest E/C memories.
