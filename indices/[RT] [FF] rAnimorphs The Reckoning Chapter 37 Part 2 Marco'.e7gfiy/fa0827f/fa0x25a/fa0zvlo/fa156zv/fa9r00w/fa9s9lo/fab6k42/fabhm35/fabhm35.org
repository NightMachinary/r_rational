What if the E/C change the memory of the hypercomputer after the nanites signal to demorph? The hypercomputer could potentially start rebuilding the body at arbitrary coordinates, even though the process itself is still being micromanaged by the nanites (assuming the coordinates of every particle are encoded in the first stage as (e.g.) center of mass + offset, and not in absolute coordinates).

The nanites themselves can then be teleported in the same way, since they have to change their location anyway since the original body has different shape/size than the morph, so instead, the hypercomputer would move them at the location of the original body.

  You could morph the Arn repeatedly, wait for the control Yeerk to die, and demorph after or during the process.

Oh, right, I didn't realize the visions could be memories.
