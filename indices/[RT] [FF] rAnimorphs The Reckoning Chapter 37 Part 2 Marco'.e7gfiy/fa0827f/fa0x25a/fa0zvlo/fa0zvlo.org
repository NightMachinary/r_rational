  Interestingly, if I've understood the implications correctly, this means that you can get a cloned Quat in like half an hour---the Arn body rots the controlling Yeerk tissue away, and presto.

  Wonder what would happen if the morpher then tried to demorph??

The morpher's pocket dimension hasn't collapsed...or does it collapse when the controlling Yeerk tissue disappears?

Depending on how the pocket dimension is linked to the controlling Yeerk tissue the morpher could be stuck there for 90 more mins, helpless, until they vanish. Not the most pleasant way to go...what kind of sensory input would they have in there?

If Seerow (was it Seerow or another Andalite?) thought about some edge cases maybe it tries to recreate the morpher's body at/near the last known location that the Z-space link was linked to, taking into account things like how the link's anchor was travelling through spacetime. A related edge case could be 'what if the morphed body is vaporized due to a big-ass bomb going off'. But Andalites don't seem to be as creative as they should be, so maybe he didn't.

EDIT: Then again, if the morphing tech is smart enough to try and take a 'best guess at how the DNA ought to express itself' maybe it /can/ recreate a morpher's body if the morph is removed from existence. Or take a best guess at it...
