  Yep, you could continually do so, but it means you only get like twenty minutes of control each time, which is annoying. Interestingly, if I've understood the implications correctly, this means that you can get a cloned Quat in like half an hour---the Arn body rots the controlling Yeerk tissue away, and presto.

Could you extend the time by acquiring a bunch of Quats off of each other, to build up layers of other people's control Yeerks to rot through before yours is effected? Another thing about morphing Arn is that the copies you acquire off of each other will all have up-to-date memories, so if you make a new backup every time you use the Quat morph, it's even more like having a real Quat around than a normal morph.

  Wonder what would happen if the morpher then tried to demorph??

The control tissue is made from the construct body's DNA, right? So when Garret tried to morph Aftran, that control tissue was getting absorbing into the sharing as it was created? If I have that right, the fact that he was able to demorph implies that the nanites work independent of the control Yeerk.
