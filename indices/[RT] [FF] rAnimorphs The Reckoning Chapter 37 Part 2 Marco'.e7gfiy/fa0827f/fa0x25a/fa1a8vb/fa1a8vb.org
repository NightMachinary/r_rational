  Cassie acquired a dead squirrel waaaaay back when she was hiding in the valley, after her parents were taken. She passed that info on to the rest of the group.

Was that onscreen? Maybe it's just been a while, but I don't feel like that was onscreen, or at least not more than a passing mention. I feel like that concept should have had its own entire scene early on, because it seems very important.

  Haven't made up my mind what to do about the fact that 37,000 of those 40,000 words are a single chapter that really feels to me like it only works in one chunk.

Well, two weeks from now is nearly Christmas, so I expect many people will be on break around then. A 37,000 word chapter would be a great Christmas present, and people might actually have the free time to read and digest all of it.
