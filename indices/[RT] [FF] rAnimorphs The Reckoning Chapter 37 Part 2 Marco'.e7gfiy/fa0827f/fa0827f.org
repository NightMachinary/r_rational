Alright! Another awesome chapter! Let's get to it...

#+begin_quote
  After an embarrassingly quick twenty-minute flight, we had passed out of the forest and into a kind of low, desert scrubland
#+end_quote

Looks like everyone elected to morph into bats to fast track things. So I guess we're /not/ addressing the gigantic powerful morph that everyone got at the end of the last chapter. Chekov's gun?

#+begin_quote
  Maybe we could use the other Animorphs as callsigns.

  Garrett-Marco

  Cassie-Marco
#+end_quote

Okay, is this a /deliberate/ reference to Rickoning or did TK17 and I just independently converge on the same idea?

#+begin_quote
  if you're trying to trick somebody into blowing up the world, it's a lot easier to get them to flip the switch if they're already willing.
#+end_quote

This is an amazing quote. May I steal it? It's one of those classic rationalist insight-porn kind of quotes that compresses a lot of ideas related to deontology vs. utilitarianism, and also ideas about strategy and information security.

#+begin_quote
  ‹/Couldn't?›/ Jake snapped, and for a moment the laser lost focus, swelling to fill the room with fire.
#+end_quote

I sense that Jake is getting increasingly war-weary and broken. I hope the Animorphs can figure out some kind of therapy later on. Morphing would be /amazing/ for therapy.

#+begin_quote
  The Marco was lying flat on his back, a look of surprise frozen on his face.

  ‹Acquire him,› I said.  ‹Somebody acquire him.›
#+end_quote

Okay, wait, first of all, when was it established that you could acquire dead bodies? Second of all, if that's possible, it seems weird to me that the idea hasn't explicitly come up before now as a tactic to use - I feel like it could have made a difference somewhere before this, but maybe not. Third, I hope some of the auxiliary animorphs figured this out and are currently acquiring every recently deceased or terminally ill person they can find for the purposes of future resurrection (Alcor is /so/ out of business now). Fourth, I wonder how little of a person's body you need for this to work? Just the head, maybe? Fifth, when exactly did this Marco die? It seems like it's recent. If V3 kept this Marco alive for a while, that would give time for Marco's memories of the TPK to solidify so that the animorphs could actually figure out what happened, assuming that dead bodies can even retain memories (maybe the morphing tech can fix up degraded ones or something).

#+begin_quote
  She tried to kill me once, you know.  Well, more than once, but once she almost /succeeded/.  Such a tiny little hole in my control---the ability to close one eye. 
#+end_quote

Straight out of canon!

#+begin_quote
  What if we distribute the Yeerk?
#+end_quote

So /that's/ why so many Marcos were brought along. Not to die - to be a hivemind for Visser One! Wow, I did /not/ predict that. I thought this chapter was going to end with cloned Howlers wrecking everyone.

#+begin_quote
  Speaking of immune to infection, this guy figures he's probably resistant to being morphed, too.  He predicts I've got about ten minutes in here before the control Yeerk starts to rot away, so maybe we want to hurry this up?
#+end_quote

Can't you just demorph and remorph the Arn? Wouldn't the morphing tech fix the degradation every time?

#+begin_quote
  She's seen the Ellimist.

  There are gaps---places where she wasn't able to see, or where she forgot---time travel, alternate universes---/she's been a Controller for four years./  She knew Elfangor!  Knew him in human morph, on Earth!
#+end_quote

Oh /snap/. More of canon holds up in Reckoning than I realized. And, wait - time travel? Alternate realities? So, what you're saying is, theoretically, they could meet the original series Animorphs? Assuming these are confirmed from her memories and not Marco just spitballing. Well, this just leaves plenty of room for spinoff fanfics of Reckoning.

#+begin_quote
  the Ellimist probably isn't going to send her back with us
#+end_quote

Okay, so how /are/ they getting back? "Hey Ellimist? Yo. We're done? Give us a lift?".

Also, was Helium's only purpose on this mission to confirm to V1 that this wasn't a V3 ploy? I guess they aren't back yet, so maybe there is more to come.

Anyway, yeah! Awesome as usual. Are updates still on schedule for the next few weeks?
