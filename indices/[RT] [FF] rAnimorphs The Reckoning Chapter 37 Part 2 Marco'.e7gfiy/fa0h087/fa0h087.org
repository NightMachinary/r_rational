  I didn't have a great angle, so I spiraled lower, cutting through the updraft, wincing as the temperature rose and rose. It was maybe a hundred and eighty by the time I dropped below the edge of the cliff, and I knew that the bat body would only be able to handle a few minutes before it succumbed to exhaustion and heat stroke.

  Not a sound. Not a whisper. Not a flicker of motion. I glided along the cliff face, peering in through columns and archways, glimpsing caverns and caves and corridors that stretched back into utter darkness. I flew for almost a mile in one direction before turning back.

Few minutes before heat stroke and he's flying a mile in that? How fast is he going again?

The 2^{n} section headers get pretty hard to read with no separators in the numbers. Would it be possible to get 2^{n} notation or maybe Animorph-Marco in the section header?
