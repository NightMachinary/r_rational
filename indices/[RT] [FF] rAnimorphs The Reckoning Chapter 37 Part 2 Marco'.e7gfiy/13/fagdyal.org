Something I didn't note in the beta read is how much I love the Multiple-Marco-Complete-Coordination-Sweep (There are probably cooler names for it that they would come up with). It not only makes sense as a thing that would happen if you had multiple clones of yourself working in tandem, but it's also badass and hella useful.

So... yeah, I'm curious to know what's going to be stopping the animorphs from ALL making a bunch of copies of themselves out of terminal patients now. Maybe not all of them would be able to adapt to it as well as Marco, so maybe if the limiter is amount of terminal patients it would make sense to just keep letting him do it, but it's just such a powerful strategy that it seems like they really have to keep doing it, moving forward.
