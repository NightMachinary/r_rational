I forget if this has already been covered or not (I'm long overdue for a complete re-read), but has the story described how Vissers who aren't Visser Three work? In other words, is "Visser One" an individual Yeerk shard, or is she a whole pool and the Animorphs are only bringing a small part of it home? Or is it a halfway thing where she's a shard that mingles with her native coalescion but has a special status not afforded to the rest of it?
