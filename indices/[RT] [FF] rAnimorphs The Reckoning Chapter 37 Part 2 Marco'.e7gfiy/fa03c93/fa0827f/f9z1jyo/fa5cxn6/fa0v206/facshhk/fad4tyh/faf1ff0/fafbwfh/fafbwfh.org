  Are we supposed to know what mechanism V3 is using to precommit to keeping his promises? He might be in trouble with one of his own failsafes, now that Quat has been killed by a threat alien to the Arn world. Is V3 still bound to keep is promises to Quat morphs, just like the real thing?

The only mechanism seems to be that Esplin sincerely intends to keep the promise (and Quat knew that), so he doesn't have to worry about any punishment for failing to do so.

I think he's bound to the promise forever though, regardless of Quat's status. He thinks Quat is going to die eventually, but in his own thoughts he considers the planet untouchable indefinitely. It seems like he's bound to protect the planet itself rather than Quat or even the Arn as the whole.

I wonder how far that really goes though. Like, if this is closer to an unbreakable vow than a pinkie swear, blackmail might be on the table. Once the Animorphs get back they could call Elena in a Bug fighter and tell her to use the Z-Space engine to +blow up+ very slightly damage the Arn homeworld on their say so, and then tell Esplin they will only call it off if he commits in Leeran hypersight to stop being a jerk. Would that just work?
