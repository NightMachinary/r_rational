One of V1's first hosts in /Visser/ is Allison, a physicist woman for whom V1 kind of gets Lima's syndrome (before getting her pregnant, giving away the children for adoption, and murdering her, because it's that kind of book and V1 is that kind of person).

At some point, V1 gives Allison control over one eye, to see what she'll do with it. Allison somehow hides that she realizes this, and tries to kill herself by closing the eye at a crucial moment while driving, to try and provoke a car accident.
