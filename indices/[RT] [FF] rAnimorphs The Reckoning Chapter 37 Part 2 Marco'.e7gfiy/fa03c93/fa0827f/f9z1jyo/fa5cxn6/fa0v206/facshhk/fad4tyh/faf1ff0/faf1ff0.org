I don't think the kids have any power to "choose" one path over another. Like, both E&C can simulate a million Marcos if they want, so Marco doesn't really have any ability to surprise either of them.

The importance of their choices is that they constrain E&C's moves. Eg Marco's power isn't to say "I'm going to go that case", it's to say "I'm a bishop, and these are the only cases I'm willing to go to."

Or, the way Jake puts it:

  “If we are being jerked around,” he said. “By the Ellimist, or Crayak, or whoever---if you're trying to trick somebody into blowing up the world, it's a lot easier to get them to flip the switch if they're already willing. If they've already made up their mind what would get them to do it. [...] I'm saying it's a lot harder to trick you into blowing up the planet if you're not the kind of person who goes around blowing up planets. If you're---if you're humble. Or scared. If you're not willing to do anything that drastic in the first place, because you've been wrong before.”

So I think whatever negotiation took place between E&C to teleport the Animorphs to that planet, it had to factor in the fact that they were extremely unlikely to do anything /but/ capture Visser One alive, when it came down to it.
