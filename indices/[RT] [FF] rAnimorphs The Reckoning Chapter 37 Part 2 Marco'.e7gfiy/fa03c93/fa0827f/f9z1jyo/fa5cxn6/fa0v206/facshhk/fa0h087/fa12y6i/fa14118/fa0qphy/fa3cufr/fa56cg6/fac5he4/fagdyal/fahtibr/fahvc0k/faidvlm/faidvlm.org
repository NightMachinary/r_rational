Can confirm- haven't read the books except for maybe one or two over a decade ago and don't remember a thing about them, but I was able to follow along almost completely fine.

Having introduced this fanfic to someone with more Animorphs knowledge did give me insight into some of the many in-jokes though. I particularly liked how maple syrup was derived from an actual canon plot point.
