Creating four new Marco-and-V1 Collaborator shards seems like a pretty big win for team Harmony. I wonder what team Unity got or was hoping to get out of this?

From chapter 50:

#+begin_quote
  The whole point is for you to be placed into situations where your decisions are philosophically relevant---situations where you are free to choose, where the /constraints/ on your choices are primarily /your/ constraints---your morals, your values, your tradeoffs.
#+end_quote

So what were the /choices/ the kids made in the last two chapters? What would have been the absolute best outcome for Crayak, and for the Ellimist, if those choices had gone differently?

Are we supposed to know what mechanism V3 is using to precommit to keeping his promises? He might be in trouble with one of his own failsafes, now that Quat has been killed by a threat alien to the Arn world. Is V3 still bound to keep is promises to Quat morphs, just like the real thing?

Oh crap, I just realized: The kids now have access to a morph body/mind that has spent significant time with V3, under Leeran Hypersight *and* has an eidetic memory. That means they have a complete copy of V3's mind up to the point when he made his deal with the Arn.
