What exactly was the point of the 2^{n} naming scheme again? What advantage does it have over memorizing a simple ascending number or the date of transformation?

Like, I guess it works as a method of proving when that Marclone was made, but only if he's never had access to a calculator or a piece of paper in the intervening time which can't be proven. I guess it's sort of an internal self-proof? But why would he need that?
