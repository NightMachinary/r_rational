I've enjoyed what I read so far but I was never fully "hooked". I kept waiting for the moment that would make me feel that the clock had started counting down or that the plots had really kicked into gear. I simply wasn't hit with the degree of urgency or danger I expected (excepting the scene with the playboy prince).

MC's decisions make sense to me, although I don't feel as though I've actually seen her progress. Excluding Chapter 1, I've don't think I've seen her develop and been convinced that she's qualitatively improved. I suspect it's because I feel like I've just been told certain skills have been used (sage and twin minds) rather than seen their impact. Alternatively It could be that I don't really understand the nature of cultivation in this world.

So far I don't really feel connected to any of the side characters. I didn't come away with the impression that much of the dialogue and interaction with them has been at all very meaningful, (exceptions again the playboy prince, the abused girl and the powerful witch).

Another thing that threw me was the lack of realisation from the rest of the party that the other world is real. I'm assuming at this point that we, the audience, are to understand that they, the party, are aware that the world is "real". However, I don't remember seeing or hearing about this realisation and it's consequences directly or indirectly.

In summary the opening couple chapters were well done and I'm curious to see if/when the later ones will cash in on the promise of a real "fight for our lives" against a superior foe.
