Eh. It's not really a problem you could fix, but the pre-isekai part is kind of lacking to me in terms of "how would a sane adult prepare for this given that knowledge, skill, and time". If I understand the setting correctly, being able to tap into the "mana" of Earth isn't some innate gift from being a time looper, but something anyone could do if they knew how. At some point, she is deeply concerned about a potential demonic invasion on Earth. Lastly, it seems that there is some noticeable kinesthetic feedback from learning to tap into mana.

To me, it seems more logical that if you have a tangible and reproducible method of magic meditation that improves your physical and mental faculties, a big portion of that year would be best spent trying to spread that knowledge around. Make a vlog about your fitness progress while touting your unnatural improvement to a specific method of meditation. Especially try to spread that knowledge to your classmates, at least the athletes who would likely give your testimony weight since you've become a star athlete at an unprecedented rate.

Not only would it empower the Heroes more than anything else she could have possibly done on Earth as well as leave Earth in a much better spot in case said invasion did happen, it would give her an immense amount of credibility and authority to her classmates once the isekai happened. Playing off having a prophetic dream (divine inspiration!) could also give immediate social power within the nobility if she could spin it well.

So given that that's the first thing I thought of after reading the premise, it'd be nice to see some reasoning why she decided to only empower herself personally and limited herself otherwise to just making friends with her fellow isekai-ers.
