Good start, I'll keep an eye on it.

I know we are missing context to why she valued certain people over others "striker on my school's football team, joined the chess club, and even snagged a minor part in the school play. Along with that had come juggling my new social links." [Ch.2] Learning who/why she reached out to different group would be valuable, also, how many?

I know that with the amount of information given I definitely would have dodged the re-up, sounds like a horror show.
