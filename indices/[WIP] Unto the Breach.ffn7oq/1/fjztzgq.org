This is good. Some feedback:

1: I'm not sold on what is driving her to save the world yet. She mentions that in her last life that she gave up. Why does she care now? What's different? It's a beautiful world, but I need more than that. It's clear that she could probably ally with the demons and retain a comfortable life, so you need to demonstrate to me why the suffering and sacrifice needed to actually win is worthwhile.

2: No one seems all that upset or surprised about being yanked to another world and then encouraged to swallow a live eel. I don't think this is plot critical or anything, and maybe this drama is happening off screen, or the calm acceptance is a 'god/wizard did it' type situation. But everyone seems weirdly accepting of having their lives totally and instantly transformed without their consent.

3: You're got a slow start. It's not bad, but my preference is to open stories with urgency. The introduction of Dartanian was good because it gives us a concrete enemy. He's a rapist and a monster pretending to be a hero, and now he's here, touching our protagonist, invading her space, threatening her. And there's the lingering question of why he betrayed humanity. Or perhaps he hasn't even been turned yet? Either way, flashbacks involving him or other ways of increasing his presence in the story would add to the urgency and help sell the threat the demons represent.
