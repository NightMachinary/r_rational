Sure, but there's nothing in space that's as easy to hit from the surface of the earth than the surface of the moon.

It may be that there's nothing in space other than the moon or /maybe/ the sun that you could credibly hit with a portal gun. And even the moon would be tricky. The sun would be really tough, with 8 minutes windage, and where would you anchor the other end?

Maybe if you could talk NASA into sending a kilometer-scale balloon to geosynchronous, but how would you talk them into it without a demo? You only have one shot.

Once you've got the portal to the moon you can start assembling a linear accelerator. It's much easier to do that, on the moon. Once you can demonstrate it there won't be much difficulty getting people building one that you can ship through a two meter hole in pieces.
