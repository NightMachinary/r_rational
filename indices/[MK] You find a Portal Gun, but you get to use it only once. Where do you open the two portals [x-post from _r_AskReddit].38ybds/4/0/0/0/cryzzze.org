One option would be to put the portals on movable plates...ideally graphene, titanium, or some other very strong / very light material. Now you can demo the portal. Have NASA put one of the plates in orbit and you're good to go.

One option for propulsion -- have anchor points around the edge of the plate. Have one plate in a vacuum chamber on Earth, one in orbit. Working from the Earth side, put a solar sail through the portal into orbit, with the anchorlines attached to the rim of the space-side plate. Shoot a laser through and voila, propulsion.
