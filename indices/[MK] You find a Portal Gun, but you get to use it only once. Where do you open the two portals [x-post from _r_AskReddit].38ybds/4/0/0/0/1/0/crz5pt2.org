Could do, but I think the solar sail is going to be logistically easier.

- You don't need to worry about shutting it down in order to refuel, (or potentially blowing things up by hot fueling)
- The Earth-side portal room is going to be a vacuum chamber in order to prevent issues from pressure differential. Vacuum is a good environment for lasers
- With a rocket you need to get large tanks / hoses of rocket fuel into the Earth-side portal room, whereas with the laser you just need power cables.

For anything that required high thrust (e.g. to get out of a gravity well) the rocket would definitely be the way to go. For in-space cruising, though, I think you'd want the sail.
