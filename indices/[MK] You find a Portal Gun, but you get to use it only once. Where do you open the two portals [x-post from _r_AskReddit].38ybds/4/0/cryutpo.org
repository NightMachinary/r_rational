Anchoring your space-side portal in a staging post location (some sort of large satellite, possibly a human-habitable space-station or similar) in high Earth Orbit would probably be better:

  "No," Bob said. "If you can get your ship into orbit, you're halfway to anywhere."

  He was very nearly right.

Whereas if your portal is to the surface of Moon or Mars, you're still stuck in a gravity well and aren't travelling at orbital velocity (now if you had an arbitrarily large quantity of portals, things would be different). Because

So for that matter it might be better to put the space-side portal in /Solar/ orbit -- not sure which would require more delta-v to get to an arbitrary location in space from the staging post.
