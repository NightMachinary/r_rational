OK, googling about the various wikis and forums, the games only let you shoot portals onto moving surfaces in one puzzle (Neurotoxin?) and of course the moon shot. It's apparently a developer retcon to avoid having to render moving portals.

Otherwise, yeh, put the portals onto two big solid steel plates and let NASA build a module around one and launch it to the ISS.
