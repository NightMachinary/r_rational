Either

a) Hold onto it until astronomy is advanced enough to figure out if an exo-planet could support life, then aim very, very carefully.

b) as [[/u/_ShadowElemental]] said, a stable celestial body in /very stable/ solar orbit that's unlikely to deorbit if a lot of extra mass is added to it without being massive enough that the gravity well is a problem. Engines to compensate, maybe.

c) Put both ends on moveable plates. Give to NASA or other aerospace organization. You now have a spaceship that needs only enough fuel to get into orbit, can support as many humans as you want without supply problems, and can even manipulate its own mass by passing matter through the portal. The only limit to its acceleration would be c and the amount of earthside fuel we could pump through. They wouldn't need rocket fuel, either. We could literally pass them garbage to throw out the back end.

In fact, said spaceship could be expanded more or less to taste. Although there might be some... weird physics on the boundary once the far side accelerated to relativistic speeds.
