I was going to go for the very obvious 'one portal above the other' for "free energy", but thinking about it you can't really extract all that much.

My other thought was to just shoot it in the direction of space that is most likely to not hit anything for a while in order to get it as far as possible, but then you risk hitting a star and messing up earth. Not sure if anything beats the high Earth orbit proposal.
