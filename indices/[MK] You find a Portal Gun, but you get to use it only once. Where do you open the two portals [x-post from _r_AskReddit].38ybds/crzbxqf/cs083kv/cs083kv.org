It could be that whenever you step through, you emerge (just after) whatever time you were at when you left. So even if one portal has 'subjectively' experienced 10 years and the other has only experienced one hour, stepping through the portal 30 minutes in would still only leave you 30 minutes+ walking time in, assuming the surface is flat. If the portal is vibrating forward and backward, I dread to think of what'd happen to your body at parts of it age at variable rates, but I guess it could still be used for inanimate things. Going through the other side would be the same. I hope I've understood what I've said correctly. Time is fucky.

Also, the gravitational potential thing has been discussed, and people think it might not violate the conservation of energy, because we don't know if it costs energy to go through a ground portal and emerge at a roof portal.
