They've moved relative to one another in canon. You can say that the neurotoxin scene was a conceit of the story, I can say that portals normally broke due to the added technical burden of keeping them open. I'm open to either interpretation, that is, if it were actually used in a story. It just has to be consistent and well-reasoned.

But I retract the objection from relativity.
