I dislike the compassionate argument because...frankly, I don't care, my human brain extends my empathy system infrequently and inconsistently to nonhuman life and never manages to actually attach much value to it besides that happiness it brings to humans.

I do however, take umbrage to his position on the environmental side of things. He says things like "burning down forests for pasture land is a one time cost" which ignores the ongoing cost of having less trees filtering C02.

He also goes off on this completely irrelevant and distracting tangent about how we get lots of stuff from animals that aren't food, which is completely unrelated to the environmental costs associated with the industry. He does this like three freaking times.

He also completely misses the fact that tropic levels exist. Sure if you replaced all the animal feed food with human food, you'd still have to invest resources growing that food, so in that regard, its a bit of a wash. But his argument that you get more /food energy/ out of cows than you put in to make them is both wrong and thermodynamically impossible. The most simplistic take on tropic levels is the abstraction that follows:

"It takes 10 pounds of grain to make 1 pound of cow. It also takes 10 pounds of cow to make 1 pound of human. It takes 10 pounds of human to make 1 pound of giant purple people eater."

But, you could also feed that 10 pounds of grain directly to a human (not that grain specifically, you would need to not for instance [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/05/11/california-water-you-doing/][grow alfalfa in mass quantities in a giant desert]] and instead grow something people could actually eat).

He tries to distract from this fact with the economic implications, saying that you get more economic value out of animals than you put into them, which is a distraction from the argument, but he himself acknowledges that the actual ratio of food out to food in of 4:1 (4 kg non-waste input for every 1 kg usable output). Dairy farming is better about this, much better, and he's right that it's a smart thing to do, but the fact remains that you're supplying cows you plan on eating with 4 times the food you're going to get out of it.

I don't think people should have to stop eating meat entirely, but the fact remains that consuming as much meat as the average American does in their diet is a rather irresponsible use of our planet's limited natural resources.
