I was hoping for a bit of help interpreting a moral argument in an article I read recently. Its an argument for why eating meat is in fact moral and acceptable. The two arguments I'm not sure about are the compassion argument (especially the part about what defines suffering and how animals are incapable of this) and his environmental argument. He cites environmental studies, but unfortunately I lack the skill to examine those studies with a critical enough eye to determine their veracity. Thanks in advance! Also its a pretty short article.
