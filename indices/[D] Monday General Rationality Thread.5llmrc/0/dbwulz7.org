Thing that's bugged me lately - people using the word "evidence" to mean "thing that is pretty much impossible unless the hypothesis is true" rather than "thing that is more likely if the hypothesis is true than if it is false". To uphold the "innocent until proven guilty" standard, our courts of law need to demand the former, but to function epistemologically as humans, we have to settle for the latter.
