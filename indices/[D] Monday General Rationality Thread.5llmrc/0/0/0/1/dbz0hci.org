Thank you. It is something I've been musing on for a while. It is a rough model, but it has helped me to understand some confusing behavior that people exhibit.

I like your point about the irregular spacing of categories. A particular individual might, for example, have categories at 1%, 5%, 25%, 50%, 75% 95%, and 99%. The formula for strength of evidence needed would still work, but =epsilon= would be the size of the next gap to be overcome, rather than the size of all gaps.
