All right, so you got me thinking of length here. According to here: [[http://norvig.com/mayzner.html]], we get an average of 4.79 characters-per-word. I'll round up to 5 chars per word for convenience. If I write a maximum of 10 pgs per chapter, that's ~7,000 words per chapter, with paragraph tabs. With line breaks every paragraph, that brings me to a maximum of ~5.63k wpc. At 8 chapters, that's 45k words, or about 3/4 the length of a novel of 60k words.

I'm starting to think 10 pages per chapter will be a bad distribution. Shorter chapters are easier to review and copyedit, whereas longer chapters can be more difficult, so I will likely readjust the goals now that I see how many words are per chapter. If I may, do you know OoS's average wpc count?

Edit:

Forgot about ff.net's chapter headers. There's 287,226 words and 29 chapters. You have an average of 7,340 words per chapter. So, I'd guess you're probably at ~20 pages per chapter with my system, what with your dialog line breaks and all.
