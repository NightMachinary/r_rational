/Weekly Monday Post/

--------------

I have done nothing this past week on [[/u/ketura]]'s !Pokemon project besides lurk in the discussion on various biomes. If you wanna check it out, come join our [[/r/rational]] Discord!

--------------

School starts again. 14 credits. Chemistry, an English class masquerading as a software engineering class, Linear Algebra course, and Calculus.

My third run of Calculus since beginning Uni, taking a 3-year break, then starting again. Sometimes I hate my chosen profession's (Computer Science) degree path.

Also, I'm packing up my stuff, and over break I have thrown away approximately 10% of the mass from my apartment, and I'm also storing about 30% of apartment-mass at my parents. The heaviest things I own is a pair of adjustable weights that go up to 50 lbs each. I'm a weakling, so about 40 of those lbs will be left at home unless I start gaining serious muscle in my arms.

What does all this translate to? It means a couple of things. First, most of my *permanent* university mass now fits into the trunk of my car without complaint. I have a few things which won't - my nice office chair, and some of the bulk food I got at Costco. The goal was to have enough room to ferry someone to/from my hometown to my college town comfortably. In this process I have eliminated 3 medium boxes, a medium tote box, and 2 large shoeboxes. (each one could fit a pair of winter boots).

I estimate that the reduction in mass will reduce the number of runs I have to make to my car when I move into a new room at my complex by about 50%. I should be done unloading my car in 30 minutes from the time I get my room keys to a completely unpacked room.

That said, now that I have all this free space, I was tempted to take even more crap up with me, but decided against it. There's one thing I left home last semester, (my drawing tablet), which I plan on taking up to college with me.

--------------

I received a N3DS for Christmas, and decided to modify the system with some custom firmware. Until recently, there was no way to hack the N3DS XL with cfw unless you hardmodded or had access to long-removed games from the DSi store. Luckily, there have been new hacks released (soundhax) which allows homebrew software to run, and shortly will be a new slowhax (custom firmware entrypoint) for the N3ds XL of the 11.0-11.2 firmware versions. I look forward to it.

Side note: Sun/Moon is really good.

On the note of Pokemon, my rational!Pokemon story is coming along, slowly. I have defined the length I want to aim for per chapter, and the number of chapters I want the story to encompass. Each chapter should be about 10 pages minimum using default 11 pt, single-spaced font Docs uses, and there should be about 8-15 chapters total. The 15 is if I choose some extended motivations of some of the main cast and an epilog. Eight chapters is if I keep the same character's motivations where they are right about now. The full story length will almost certainly fluctuate as I write it.

The largest problem has to be nailing down the scope. [[/u/DaystarEld]] and [[/u/alexanderwales]] have both discussed at various points on their writing podcast the importance of having a fleshed out world - While I'm planning this out, the idea is that the world feels like it began long, long before the story did, and that the world will continue long after as well, which is why there's a range of 7 chapters right now.

I'm about a month out before the first chapter is drafted, and probably two months from the time it gets released. If you are interested in being an alpha/beta reader, let me know and I'll add you to a list of people to ping when the time comes.
