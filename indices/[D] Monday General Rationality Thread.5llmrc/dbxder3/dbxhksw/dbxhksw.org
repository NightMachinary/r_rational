I'm not sure what 10 pages of 11pt font looks like in terms of word count, but 8 chapters is more of a short story (novella, really), and even 15 chapters isn't particularly long when compared to a lot of online fiction.

In which case, I would re-adjust expectations in terms of world building. You don't need to go into super-deep detail about things if you have a tight, focused story in mind. Just make sure there aren't any obvious irrationality or low-hanging fruit.
