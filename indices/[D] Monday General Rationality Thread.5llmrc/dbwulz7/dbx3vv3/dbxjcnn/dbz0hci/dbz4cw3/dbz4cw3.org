I feel like the smallest ones should be much smaller, down at 1/1000, 1/1,000,000, 1/1,000,000,000, and possibly smaller. People can distinguish between "What if this random two digit number I roll happens to be exactly 99" versus "What if I get hit by lightning" versus "What if aliens attack and destroy my city" At least in terms of orders of magnitude. Anything for which there is some possible evidence that would convince you it's true "like seeing it with your own eyes" is something which you hold a nonzero prior for. Although the prior for "someone is faking this evidence to trick me" is often larger, and rightfully so.
