I second this recommendation. [[https://imgur.com/a/ODeIn][Here's a (admittedly small) preview for the anime's drawing style, characters' designs, etc.]] I also disagree with at least half of criticism points (don't remember the show well enough to have an opinion on the other half). You /may/ not enjoy the show as much as some others if you're not that much into (MMO)RPG games and [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGMechanicsVerse][RPG mechanics verses]] though.
