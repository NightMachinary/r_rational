  the main character's ability to keep track of everything in a battle might be a little too Sherlock Holmes to be rational;
#+end_quote

It's not; it's a well-trained ability of a leader to keep track of everything /important/. Actual raid leaders are often expected to keep track of all positioning and all raid-wide cooldowns, issuing orders for them - something which Shiroe's demonstrated abilities are well within.

  it takes an extremely long time (until mid-second-season, in some cases) to show that the main characters are not one-sided, and most of the secondary characters never get even that;
#+end_quote

Not really? Most of the main characters were shown from different angles right from the start (Susukino adventure).

  the plot turns out to be Because Of Aliens, which is a tableflip-worthy offense;
#+end_quote

As far as I undestand, the aliens were just as surprised by the transmigration as the players.

#+begin_quote
  It's just that the writer isn't quite smart enough to get everything to pull together credibly to people who are used to rational fiction.
#+end_quote

The author /is/ smart enough; Log Horizon follows all the tropes from the sidebar, unless you are /very/ rigorous in interpreting the "Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'" part. Also, read his other series, "Maoyuu Maou Yuusha", which is also rational.

However, it wasn't even his purpose to write a rational fiction. He wrote LH because he wanted to show a functioning and believable MMORPG in fiction (saw it in an interview with him, can't find it now though). Every differentiation from common RT tropes comes from that.
