  I have an irrational dislike for Because Of Aliens because I have seen that trope screwed up too many times to count.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon's_law][Sturgeon's law]] is quite cruel, yes, but remember: [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropesAreTools][tropes are tools]]!

  I suppose I'm just not used to MMO anime, or MMOs, or anime. Which would probably explain most of the things that seem inexplicable from my perspective.

Probably. This is something I actually noticed while reading Log Horizon: it's very different in writing style from common western fiction. I later checked by rereading some of my other favourite light novels, and saw common tropes in them, tropes that are rarely or never used in the West. Log Horizon anime follows it's LN original very closely.

These tropes can make reading easier when you read a lot of LNs in general, but to an unprepared reader they may feel, quoting yourself, as "slowly paced and taking a long time to get to a lot of the interesting parts".

Also, if you don't actually have a lot of MMO experience, quite a lot in the show will be lost for you, additionaly generating the feel of slow-pacedness.
