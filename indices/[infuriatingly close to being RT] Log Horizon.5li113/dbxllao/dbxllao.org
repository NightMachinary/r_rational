The main issue I have with LH as an anime is that it's a bit too-harem-y. The girls want to be with the MC just because, and romantic relationships are about that deep.

The second issue I have with LH has to be that I don't feel like there is any real chance of failure on the part of the MC. Things work out to be okay for some reason.

The third issue I have is that the rules for the loss-of-memory is so vague as to be unquantifiable. There is no measurable way to say how much memory one character loses per death, if any. It may as well be an asspull.

Those are my complaints with the anime. If the LN doesn't have those issues I'd be interested.

On the other hand, there's Overlord (read the LN, don't watch the anime), perhaps my favorite of these kind of stories so far.
