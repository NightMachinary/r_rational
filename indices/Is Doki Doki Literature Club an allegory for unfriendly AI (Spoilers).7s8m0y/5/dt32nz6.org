Probably not. It's a fourth wall breaking satire of dating sims (and some anime tropes in general) and/or horror game. You could make the case that a lot of things are allegories for things they probably weren't allegories for (that is an awful way to phrase a sentence...bleh). I could make a pretty convincing argument that /The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe/ is an allegory for /Star Wars/. Something something confirmation bias and prior probabilities.
