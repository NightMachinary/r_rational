  If I had to pick one single influence that DDLC most likely borrows directly from, it bears most resemblance to the Muv-Luv series

I'd say it more closely resembles Kimi to Kanojo to Kanojo no Koi. It's not a very well-known game, as it never got an official English release, but it follows a similar structure in that it starts as a "romance visual novel" that eventually becomes something a lot creepier and more meta. For a detailed summary, see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/221rkc/synopsis_for_kimi_to_kanojo_to_kanoko_no_koi/cgio7ns/][this post]], but the gist is that [[#s][over the course of several playthroughs]] [[https://i.imgur.com/gXwKQ6D.png][Here's an image of that moment.]] [[#s][Miyuki]]

DDLC is uncannily similar and it wouldn't surprise me to learn that Dan Salvato took direct inspiration from it.
