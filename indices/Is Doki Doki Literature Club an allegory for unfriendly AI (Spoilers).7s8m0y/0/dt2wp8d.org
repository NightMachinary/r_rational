I think that you're putting this reading into DDLC more than is really warranted. I don't think that it was intended to be an unfriendly AI influenced by lesswrongian ideas, but instead just a malfunctioning program that didn't really understand [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIsThisThingYouCallLove][what is this thing you call 'love']]. I mean, you could certainly choose to map it to lesswrong stuff, but it feels like a fairly tortured reading. You could /much more easily/ map the film The Terminator to a certain infamous Lesswrongian thought experiment from more than 20 years after the film, if you wanted to (this is left as an exercise for the reader).

I have played some VNs before, and DDLC seemed to be a pretty straightforward subversion of certain core conceits of the most vapid of the genre, exploited for horror's sake. It's certainly pretty easy to read DDLC as imitating other VN's as well - in particular Christine Love's Digital / Analogue series about romancing artificial intelligences, of which in particular, Analogue: A Hate Story has a similar thematic ideas and structure. Analogue is more a reconstruction of the genre + horror elements than a deconstruction of the genre + horror elements like DDLC, though. If I had to pick one single influence that DDLC most likely borrows directly from, it bears most resemblance to the Muv-Luv series (Extra, Unlimited, Alternative) in the overall structure, with the initial 'very cliched dating sim that is such a central example of the genre that it become parody' that eventually is subverted by horror elements - though the pacing was far different (Muv-Luv essentially had a complete 10-hr+ multiple-complete-route harem dating sim game, leading to a horror subversion that would last additional 50+ hours - while the entirety of DDLC took like 4 hrs at the outside). It also goes more meta than Muv-Luv, by far.

Basically, the idea of it being an intentional reference to unfriendly AI feels to me a lot like [[http://unsongbook.com/interlude-%D7%95-theres-a-hole-in-my-bucket/][Unsong]]-style pattern matching to nonexistent patterns.

DDLC is really really good, though.
