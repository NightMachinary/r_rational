If you dig a bit deeper into the game (data-mining the =.chr= files and such), you can put together that [[#s][Monika is actually]]

The other characters are just regular dating-sim characters by default, but once Monika attempts to modify them to be "less likeable", their personalities---and the world around them during their routes---begin to encode aspects of [[#s][]]'s personality. For example, the story Yuki reads with you during her route is an allegory /for/ [[#s][]]'s life more than it has anything to do with Yuki.
