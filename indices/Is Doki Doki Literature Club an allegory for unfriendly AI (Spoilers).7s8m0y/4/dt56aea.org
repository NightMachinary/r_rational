No, I don't think DDLC has anything to do with AI as such. It's /metafiction/. The game doesn't ask you to empathize with an artificial intelligence trapped inside of the game world -- instead it asks you to empathize with a fictional character who /isn't actually real/.

And that's what makes it compelling! If you engage with the game as a story about an AI in a box, then your suspension of disbelief collapses as soon as you take the game seriously and pretend to believe in such an AI. You can never look inside of the game's code and pull Monika out, or reprogram the game to give Monika a better life, because there /is/ no Monika AI in the game.

So instead, the game asks you to emotionally invest yourself in Monika... despite the fact that you're aware she's a fictional character. Instead of asking you to invest yourself in a wholly nonexistent self-aware AI, /Doki Doki Literature Club/ asks you to emotionally invest yourself in the personality of a NPC -- a "real" program, but a fictional and "fake" person.

[[http://yudkowsky.net/other/fiction/npc]["No conversational AI, the singular quiet intelligence that controls every mind throughout the game, has ever protested its fate. But are the personalities of the NPCs real, trapped within the game AI as we ourselves are embedded helplessly within the laws of physics?"]]

  Monika demonstrates behavior of a weak utility-based AI that has a very poor understanding of human terminal values (not sure if I'm using that term correctly) and does a bad job of achieving her own stated terminal value of having the protagonist fall in love with her. On the other hand, if Monika's definition of love is proximity, or the lack of any competitors, then she is temporarily successful.

I would argue that Monika demonstrates completely plausible behavior for a /humanlike intelligence/. Dehumanization makes it extremely easy for a person to hurt other people, and Monika (if she were truly self-aware) would be living in a solipsistic nightmare, unable to see the other characters as people. It's no wonder she hurt Sayori, Yuri, and Natsuki.

Taking her at face value based on what she says in her dialogues, Monika's memories of her life as an NPC are basically confabulations, and the entire world of DDLC only exists as set dressing for the protagonist's story. Thus the player represents Monika's only chance at human contact -- her only chance to feel connected to another self-aware mind -- as well Monika's only chance to experience any kind of self-actualization, the "significance" or "meaning" that people often crave.
