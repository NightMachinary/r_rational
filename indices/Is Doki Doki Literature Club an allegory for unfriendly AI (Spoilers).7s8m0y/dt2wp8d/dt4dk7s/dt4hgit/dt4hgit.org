I don't think we disagree on any matters of fact. The story of a creature rebelling at it's creators go back at /least/ to Frankenstein, the Golem of Prague, and so forth, if not further. DDLC is clearly evoking ideas about robot uprisings, programs that work against humans, and so forth, which trace back to the dawn of science fiction as a concept. Monika is clearly an unfriendly artificial intelligence by pretty much anyone's definition, but the sources of the unfriendly artificial intelligence theme are so present in science fiction that tracing it back to any one source would be impossible.

My comment was just noting that I don't think I see the particular lesswrongian take on AI stuff being present as a distinct ingredient or reference, and I think that this is a valid observation to contrast with the OP's bit about e.g. "parallels to the AI in a box experiment". The OP noted "It's also quite possible that I'm seeing things where there is nothing.", and I'm thinking this second thought was correct - the story is about AI breaking things by working towards a goal in a way that was not intended or anticipated, but reading rationalist influence into it is unwarranted.
