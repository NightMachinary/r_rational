Much, much worse writing than most fanfiction and internet novels I've read recently. There are dozens of Patreons more deserving of your money rather than spending it on this.

Also, it's very much not rational fiction. It really doesn't fit any of the characteristics of rational fiction any more than the average YA novel does, and the author remarks explicitly at least twice in the first book that magic isn't necessarily logical. Not gonna bother looking up an exact quote right now, but here's one from the second book: "It didn't make logical sense, but so much else about transfiguration didn't make logical sense either".
