The series is not bad as YA stuff goes; main flaw IMO is that the character basically pulls out a new superpower in every book at the last minute in order to solve the plot, and then that power is immediately nerfed so it won't break the plot for the /next/ book. (It's not that there's 100% /no/ foreshadowing of these powers, but it usually comes in the form of the character's random thoughts rather than any actual preparation or external actions/events, save in one book where an essential item is created and experimented with beforehand. In another case, the power is a spell the character learned in a previous book and received no further mention between the previous book and its use at the conclusion of the later book. And so on.)

Secondary flaw: hand-waving the spread of industrial tech and social changes in a medieval society based on the half-remembered non-technical knowledge of a modern teenager. We're talking maybe 4 years to go from illiterate swords & sorcery to steam & guns and a literate popular uprising!

Still, aside from those flaws and the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4liw21/just_read_schooled_in_magic_book_5/d3o6twp][morality issue another comment mentioned]], the series is pretty decent stuff. I'm mostly finding it lacking in comparison to e.g. [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War][A Hero's War]] ( where the main character has an actual engineering degree and /still/ has to abuse the heck out of magic to get an industrial revolution going), or the [[http://paultwister.com][Paul Twister]] novels (where the main character invests in long-term R&D to accomplish even the simplest of technology enhancements.

By comparison, all of the tech development in the SiM series takes place off-stage, with the characters seeing only the results of successful innovations, and some of the conflicts arising therefrom.

All that being said, I'm still going to read the next one. ;-)
