I started reading the first book in the SiM series and got about 3/4 through before giving up. The writing is okish, but it suffers from using common fantasy tropes to build the world. This becomes a major issue becuase the author does not really think about how the world works in some case. A minor point that illustrates this is that they have a analysis spell that allows a magic user to decode other spells. Not a problem, but apparently there is also a potion detect spell that will tell you if it will kill you, with out any analysis need. Another point that is not really important to the plot but really made me stop reading was the fact that the main character does not know the local language and instead has a translation spell cast on her. Thats fine, but it is a major issue when another character makes an english based pun. I believe it was about a hive of bees 'misbehaving'. It is little things like this which really annoyed me.
