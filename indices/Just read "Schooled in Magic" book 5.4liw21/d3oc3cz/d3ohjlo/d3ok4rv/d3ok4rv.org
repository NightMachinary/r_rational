It's not that the ideas won't create change. It's that the amount of time given for both knowledge transfer and adaptation is all out of proportion.

On the transfer side, we aren't shown how e.g. Emily fits creating a new writing system and teaching both arabic numerals /and/ accounting, into her busy schedule -- while she's also studying magic!

It's also not clear that she could realistically have /sold/ any of her ideas the way she did - it's a quick plot device, not a realistic tale of tech transfer. (Quick: can you explain the benefits of double-entry bookkeeping over a medieval system? Would /Emily/ be able to explain, even if she personally had done double-entry bookkeeping?)

Similarly, on the adaptation side, it's not clear to me that you can get such a big cultural upheaval in just 4 years from a single point of entry. Contrast with e.g. the 1632 series (year 2000 /town/ gets sent back to 1631 Germany), where an entire modern town with plenty of skilled engineers, welders, steam hobbyists, complete school and public libraries, power plant and natural resources, take just as long to get their ideas spread.

I'm just saying, the timeline is way too short and doesn't address all the various cultural and economic roadblocks to change that Emily would have to have somehow dealt with in her copious spare time... while she was taking on extra magic training compared to everybody else.

Again, a fine series, but when you compare to other books/series in the "portal fantasy" or alt-history genres, the tech transfer aspect of the plot seems seriously unrealistic by comparison. The 1632 series, Paul Twister, and Hero's War being examples that /feel/ much more realistic in what can be accomplished in upgrading a low-tech society, with or without magic.

But this is actually less a matter of realism per se, than it is a show vs. tell distinction. The SiM series merely /tells/ us that tech transfer happened, whereas the other stories /show/ *how* the tech transfer happens, which immediately makes them /feel/ more real, regardless of which story is closer to "what would really have happened".
