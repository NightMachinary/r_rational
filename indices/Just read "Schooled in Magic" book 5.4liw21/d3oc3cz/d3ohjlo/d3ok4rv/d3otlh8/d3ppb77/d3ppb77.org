  widescale changes in literacy in 4 months?

Wow, really? Huh. It seemed more like multiple years to me, but I just checked and sure enough, the entire timeline of Hero's War is only 16 months. WTF?

So, ironically, SiM's timescale is more realistic but Hero's War still /feels/ more real to me due to showing over telling.

  Would you recommend the 1632 series
#+end_quote

Yes, with some reservations. The complete 1632 series is a mess of branching and overlapping stories by lots of different authors with varying skills and interests, not to mention location, characters, and subject matter.

The original 1632-1633 books are quite good, and most of the "1636" books except maybe the Cardinal Virtues (which is almost pure alt-history). 1636 Kremlin Games is a good standalone novel if you've at least read 1632. I'm not fond of the Galileo/Papal Stakes/Cannon Law thread or really almost any of the 1635 books except maybe Eastern Front, or the Music and Murder story collection.

I guess my short version is that you should skip anything labeled 1634 or 1635, but the first two books and most of the 1636 spin-offs (not to mention the various Ring of Fire and Grantville Gazette story collections) range from good to great.

(The Grantville Gazette in its online form is an extensive collection of "official" 1632 fanfiction, and in fact most of the better 163x books either are assembled from serials or shorts from the Gazette, or take characters and situations that originated in fanfiction and run them forward. Not all 1632 fanfiction is great, but some is as good or better than the original books, and such storylines usually get promoted to canon in their entirety.)

  or Paul Twister?

Yes, definitely. The books are hilarious as well as moving, and have solvable puzzles that you're given the clues for.
