Just finished the third book of the Safehold series and wanted to recommend against it. As you've warned, it's too long and too boring; and the only tech-advances that happen are some ship \ gun redesigns and some industrial upgrades (e.g. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_gin][cotton gin]]). [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safehold][According to wiki,]] the next important tech-upgrade that happens is steam technology and that's only in book 5.
