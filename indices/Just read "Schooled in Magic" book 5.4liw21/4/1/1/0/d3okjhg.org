I would say it's a bit weak on the first two premises of rational fiction. Emily is also not always a level *1* intelligent character (as you often want to scream at her not to do various things or do other things), and fails at being a level 2: to the extent that she solves problems, the brilliance of these solutions tends to be told rather than shown, and even when we have the clues she has, we have no way to know whether any of our ideas would /work/. There are no "aha" solutions where you realize you could have figured it out; at best they are, "oh" solutions, where you go, "ok, I guess that makes sense... or it might if I had any more info about how magic works."

That being said, it /does/ have a consistent and logical world, and Emily is better at being a protagonist than say, canon Harry Potter. An entertaining read in the portal fantasy/summoned hero genre, but not a super-strong example of a ratfic.
