I liked parts of the 1632 series, but still ultimately abandoned the series and haven't read the most recent books. Honestly, a lot of the plot wasn't super interesting to me.

In general, I have read a bunch of "guys from current day or at least higher tech society goes to primitive society and passes on technology" books, other than the already mentioned ones. None of them have been wholly satisfactory. Nevertheless, perhaps one of the following will appeal to you:

S M Stirling: Island in the Sea of Time. Nantucket goes back in time a huge amount; starts tech transfer, main conflict happens because a small faction of people decide to defect and instead of getting along peacefully, want to seize power. Main problems: excessively graphic onscreen rape, conflict feels forced, not huge descriptions of tech transfer.

David Drake: The General Series, Belisarius Series (two very similar but distinct series). Primitive guys get a hypertech computer that enters their brain and wants to advance technology, but only can do so through human intermediaries. Drake does very well with battlefield tactics descriptions, gunpowder weaponry descriptions, etc. Everything is always war-centered in his books. Some racism stuff, and plots are eventually predictable (has the David Eddings problem of writing the same book/plot multiple of times). Weak characterizations on the whole.

David Weber: Safehold books. Small part of humanity fleeing aliens establish colony with no electronics etc, brainwashes populace to hate tech to avoid radio emissions. Then thousands of years later a remnant of humanity's technological age wants to uplift the world because humanity's numbers have recovered. Lots of naval stuff, gunpowder + sail wars, good naval fights and descriptions of wars. However, themes of these books eventually become pretty boring and the books are way too long and full of dull stuff that no-one cares about compared to the actually cool / interesting bits (this is one of those series that could be much improved if an editor went through and cut roughly 50% or more of it). Characters are typical Weber Mary Sues, largely with the same problems as marred Weber's more famous series about Honor Harrington.

Conrad Stargard books by Frankowski: hands down the most detailed tech transfer story in terms of technical detail and believability of technology - Frankowski was an engineer who really believed in showing his work. However, there are extreme problems with LITERALLY EVERYTHING ELSE, and these problems are so extreme I can't really recommend the series at all. Especially the extreme and gratuitous sexism that permeates the entire thing, but also the characterization and Mary Sue-ism of the main character and the writing style; also the battles tend to be extremely poorly done (tend to feel very farcial and not made believable / interesting). Even if you do enjoy this series and manage to find it readable, on no account go beyond book 5, the story declines much further than I would have thought possible.
