I don't think it's really all that unrealistic as you seem to think. The ideas Emily imports form Earth are not early preliminary ideas. They've been developed and changed over centuries of trial and error on Earth, and there's pretty much no way introducing these ideas fully formed into a relatively primitive medieval society would not cause enormous changes. Imagine if you went back in time and introduced ideas from the modern world into the middle ages. Assuming you didn't cause a paradox, you would be providing ideas and technology that took centuries of work for anyone to even come up with, while skipping the centuries of work. Even bringing back just one idea, like basic sanitation would drastically and forever change the world. If you brought back ten such ideas, the changes would likely be even more extreme.

Do the laws of magic/physics in A Hero's War make starting an industrial revolution unusually difficult? Did the protagonist of the story try asking for more help from the locals in kicking off his industrial revolution? Chances are they would start out knowing a lot more about magic then him, since they were probably using it for a long time before he arrived, right? Not to mention they would start out more familiar with their own culture, geography, politics, economies, and current levels of knowledge and tech than the protagonist would.

I haven't read A Hero's War, but it's already been recommended to me and I will probably start reading it soon. From what little I've heard about it it sounds like something I will really enjoy.
