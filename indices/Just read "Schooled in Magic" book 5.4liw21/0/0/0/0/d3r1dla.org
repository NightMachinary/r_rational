A lot of this has to do with the sheer pace that the books are being written. The first edition of Book 1 [[https://chrishanger.wordpress.com/2014/02/][came out at the end of February 2014]]. So Nuttall has put out nine books in the SiM series and at least twice as many again across the other series he writes (Bookworm, Ark Royal, Royal Sorceress, etc) in just over two years. Seriously, go through that blog and there's a new book (often more) every single month.

That's a /ridiculous/ pace to maintain, essentially NaNoWriMo each month without a break. I'm not surprised that some of the lesser details end up slipping.
