  Thats fine, but it is a major issue when another character makes an english based pun.

I noticed that too. I also noticed towards the end the main character turns into a rat and remarks repeatedly about how much better a rat's eyesight is. I guess the author just assumed that animals have better senses all around than humans and didn't think further than that. Lots of little things add up. There's a huge problem with lack of attention to detail.
