  main flaw IMO is that the character basically pulls out a new superpower in every book at the last minute in order to solve the plot, and then that power is immediately nerfed so it won't break the plot for the next book.

This bugged the hell out of me. She's competent enough to defeat the villain taking out everyone else, including the teaching staff...and then at the beginning of the next book, she's weak again.

Personally however, some of the later plots were the deal breakers for me. She goes to another school [[#s][]]

A later book is just the plot to Romeo and Juliet with the serial numbers filed off. The series also has a lot of angst/drama in general, which I personally dislike., and the writing in general isn't good enough to make up for its various flaws.
