strength isn't always one-dimensional. she was able to take out the first necromancer due to pure dumb luck, quick thinking and a little bit of scientific knowledge from earth, using a trick which was too dangerous for her to use again. she wasn't depowered from book 1 to book 2. it's just that the powers she uses often come with a cost, and sometimes they're a good idea to use and sometimes they're not.
