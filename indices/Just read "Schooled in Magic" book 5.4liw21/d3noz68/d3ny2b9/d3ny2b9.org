It's worth a lot more than that. Not all great works of literature can be found at the library, you know. I've looked for rational fiction novels in the Columbus metropolitan library system and I've never been able to find any. The librarians have never even heard of the genre. I've also looked at half price books and they don't have any rational fiction either. It's kind of sad. There are probably hundreds if not thousands of notable authors in other genres, and how many does rational fiction have? Maybe about 10 or so if you exclude all the authors whose works were discontinued partway through?
