not only is it filled with critics, it's filled with people who are seriously misjudging the series. i'm pretty sure that there are other equally rational series that have gotten pretty positive feedback on this subreddit.

let me say this again. The schooled in magic series IS rational. Nothing happens in the series solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there is always a plausible reason. All factions in the story are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil". Yes, even the necromancers. The necromancers are generally driven by their desire to get a lot of power with very little effort, but the process of necromancy involves channeling magic directly through their brains, which drives them insane.

The characters generally solve their problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources. On very rare occasion they might get lucky, but they can't rely on that luck. Other than that, if they are not solving their problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources, then either their problems will just /NOT be solved/, or they'll create bigger problems for themselves in the process.

The rules of the story's world are sane and consistent. While it has magic and therefore probably isn't perfectly reducible to mathematically simple parts like the real world is (I've considered the possibility that they might be in a simulation), it's still consistent enough that the characters can make quite good and reasonable deductions, given how much information, intelligence and common sense that character has.

It's not a fairplay whodunit, but that's mainly because the protagonist doesn't have enough education before she leaves earth. Seriously people, don't read the spacebattles version, read the actual books. The first one is 99 cents on kindle and that's not much to pay, and I'm pretty sure a lot of people on this subreddit will love it if they just read it.
