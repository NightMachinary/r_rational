I've been considering the effect of translation/subtitles on meaning, especially for music and movies. It often seems like translated media is more intelligent or meaningful.

It makes intuitive sense that meaning is lost when translation occurs, but I suspect that additional meaning gets added in--so much so that subtitled things appear to have extra meaning.

Consider:

- Written words generally convey more complex ideas than spoken words.

- Bilingual translators are likely very intelligent, and capable of adding meaning.

- The act of interpretation (particularly of lyrics) requires inferring hidden meaning.

- Translations try to add allusions that make sense for the culture they are being translated into. (Warning, TV Tropes: [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalTranslation][Cultural Translation]])

It seems to me that the act of translating music or video into written subtitles tends to add more meaning than it subtracts. It's like anything with subtitles was ran past a bilingual ghostwriter.

Although, when I think about it... things that are translated might also experience a selection effect. Who would bother translating something that's meaningless?

Or perhaps it just seems more meaningful because trying to extract meaning from it faces the added difficulty of cultural differences. There are aspects to the media that the original culture would take for granted, so perhaps the added complexity of keeping track of that stuff makes whatever it is seem deeper.

I really hope it isn't the case that most foreign stuff seems intelligent because my culture is... less intelligent.
