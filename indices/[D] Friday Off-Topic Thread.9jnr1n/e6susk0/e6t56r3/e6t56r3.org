  White smoke rises in a cloud,

  Light and silver parting the sky's blue.

  I can hear the rustling grasses,

  See the heather of your hillsides.

  The world of my dreams.

  Babbling brooks,

  Flowing crystal through eternal glades -

  Peace and freedom..

  The hour will come when my sins are forgiven

  And I meet the dawn in the midst of your hills.

  Taking up a staff

  I will travel, a wanderer

  Through the land of my dreams

  Where the cries of the eagles

  Spreading their wings

  Over the stone cliffs

  Speak of peace and freedom
