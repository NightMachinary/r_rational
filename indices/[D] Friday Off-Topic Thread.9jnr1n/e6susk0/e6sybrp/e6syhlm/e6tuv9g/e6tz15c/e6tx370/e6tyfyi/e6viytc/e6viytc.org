I just watched a two-part video series that analyzed this effect within the first few episodes of My Hero Academia. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ba-V4L50r7U][Part One]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3yuCmvajYo][Part Two]]. Mild spoilers I suppose; I haven't watched the show myself and didn't have much more spoiled than what I had already gathered through cultural osmosis.

The video author mostly goes over the differences to Deku and other characterization.
