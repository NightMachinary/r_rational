I just read the Asimov novelization of Fantastic Voyage. I had seen the movie a while back, and it always bothered me how they treated atoms of miniaturized matter and unminiaturized interchangeably depending on what the plot demands. Asimov does a pretty great job of rationalizing it. The novel was written after the movie, so he didn't have a lot of control over the plot details, and you can kind of tell he thought the whole conceit was pretty ridiculous, which makes for some rather hilarious reading when he blatantly lampshades how it all really shouldn't work, yet surprisingly does by somehow creating an image of the atoms in hyperspace.
