Invisibility superpowers and similar are often metaphorical, and the most common metaphor is marginalization. It really shouldn't be a surprise that it's a power most often given to women. The last place I recall seeing the power was /The Laundry Files/, where this was made quite explicit.

(/Soon I will be Invincible/ was also pretty blatant about it's commentary, but that was stock invisibility.)
