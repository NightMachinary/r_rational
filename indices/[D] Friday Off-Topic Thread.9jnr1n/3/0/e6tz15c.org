First, I'd recommend /Le Ton beau de Marot/, which is about that kind of thing, by the same guy who wrote /GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach/ (Douglas Hofstadter).

Second ... I think it really depends on the translator and their goals. There's are, obviously, selection effects for which works get translated, so I would expect translated works to on average be better than works without a translation, probably by a considerable margin.

But beyond that, some translations are "bare bones" in that they seem like they've just been run through a translation service, and /those/ generally feel like they subtract meaning. I watch a fair amount of Korean dramas, and sometimes entire /plot points/ require outside explanation, because whatever person did the translation failed to explain the cultural context of what was happening, or the wordplay that the scene hinged on. I've seen translations that /don't explain a Korean homophone which isn't a homophone in English/.

So, I don't know. I feel like translated works are a mixed bag, in that translators and the effort that they'll put into translation are variable. The selection effects for translation should be in the direction of better works being selected, making them comparatively good when put next to the baseline, but meaning isn't always at the forefront of the translators mind. (At a guess, 'I need to finish this translation so I can get paid' motivates a lot of translators who do half-assed work.)
