Anyone has recs for Steven Universe rational fic?

More specifically, I'd be looking for fics that fit the tone of the series, so more "Steven has a chat with Garnet about relationships and the nature of fusion" than "Steven figures out how to leverage Gem physics to win the war against Homeworld".
