Recently, I was very surprised to see in my daily +Goodreads+ Kindle Deals email* a [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25746699][story]] whose protagonist had the (involuntary) power of being forgotten within minutes by anyone who saw her. Is this (dis)ability more common in fiction than I'm aware? This is at least the fourth time I've seen it, after [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/19198][/Background Pony/]] (protagonist Lyra Heartstrings, involuntary), [[http://luminous.elcenia.com/story.shtml][/Radiance/]] (minor character Allirea, voluntary), and [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][/Worm/]] (minor character Imp, voluntary). (Insert accusations of sexism against science-fiction/fantasy authors for constantly giving invisibility powers to women.) See also the tropes [[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/The_Nondescript][The Nondescript]] and [[https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Perception_Filter][Perception Filter]].

*[[https://i.imgur.com/jrAWbbS.png][Goodreads Deals is being discontinued in favor of Kindle Deals.]] Amazon, which owns both Goodreads and Kindle, obviously doesn't like it when Goodreads sends out links for buying books from B&N and Google. However, since e-book prices are set not by sellers but by publishers, it doesn't really matter---I'll just have to manually go to bn.com whenever I'm alerted to a Kindle sale for a book that I want, rather than being able to immediately click on a bn.com link in the email.

Anyway, /The Sudden Appearance of Hope/ is in my opinion significantly more akin to /Background Pony/ than to /Radiance/. It constantly bounces back and forth between the one's pretentiousness** and the other's coolness, but overall it definitely feels more pretentious than cool, especially when you take into account the cultural and political jabs that the protagonist thinks to herself with some regularity. IMO, it definitely doesn't deserve more than three stars.

**IIRC---I haven't read /Background Pony/ in /quite/ a few years. (It's hard to imagine that, at some long-past date, it temporarily was my favorite story, above even [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][/Time Braid/]]. I probably should get around to reading it for a third time.)

(I find it extremely pathetic that the phrase =mens reus=---[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mens_rea][obviously erroneous]] not only to anyone who knows Latin but also to anyone who reads legal opinions---was retained in /multiple/ places by the editor. How hard is it to look up a two-word foreign-language phrase on Google?)
