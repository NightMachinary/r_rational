It's been a few years since I read it. I don't think it went into super deep detail on the actual techniques. There was definitely some mostly along more philosophical lines than practical ones, but don't expect to get a full-on rationalist explanation based on real life cog-science cause the field basically didn't exist yet when the book was written. The twists in the last half of the book ended up being really good though--definitely worth finishing.
