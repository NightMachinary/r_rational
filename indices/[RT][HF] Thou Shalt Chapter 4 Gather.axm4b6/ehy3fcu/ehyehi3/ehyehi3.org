What is it: take a generic Tolkienesque swords-and-sorcery fantasy setting. Remove the conceit that certain races are inherently evil. Give each of a small subset of the people in the world a Task (sort of a cross between a divine compulsion and Aspect from Practical Guide to Evil). The main character is the member of a bellicose culture, who has counter-intuitively been given the Task to "Learn" (and not about war), which has forced him to roam outside his homeland, meeting strange new people in strange new places.

As for the quality: I'd rate it as "first season of a Star Trek series" so far. Lots of potential, but it hasn't quite found its feet yet, and it's really too early to say whether it will turn out to be /The Next Generation/ or /Voyager/.

But there's little enough of it to read so far (four chapters and an interlude), and the technical quality of the writing is good enough, that you might as well just read it and form your own opinion of it.
