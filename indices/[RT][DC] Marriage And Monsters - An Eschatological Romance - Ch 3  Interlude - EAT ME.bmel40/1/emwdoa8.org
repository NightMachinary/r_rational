I do so wish I could converse as the woodland creatures appear to do on demand. T'would be a merry trick for congregations.

Also, nega-Alice is loony as all heck and would make an excellent villain. I wanna try to make her a DnD character somehow.

Also also, Sheriff freaking out in Texan at going 20 mph is hilarious.
