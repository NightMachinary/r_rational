Okay, maybe that bit a few chapters ago where I said I was learning to hate Tariq more and more was overstated.

Interesting moment between Saint and Catherine. I... still don't see things ending anyway but bloody between them, but this feels more like maybe now Saint will end up actually understanding who Catherine really is before the end, and still deciding she needs to be killed because the risk of what she's doing is too high.
