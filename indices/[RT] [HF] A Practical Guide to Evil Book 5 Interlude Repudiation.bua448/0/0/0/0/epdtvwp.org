I thought that hierarch was going to judge the /gods above/ using white knight as a focus.

Remember, the gods below have a seat on the council, they aren't foreign, and they don't force people to do things.

Now think about what Hierarch rants about, isn't it clear he's against the gods above what with them being “foreign oppressors” and everything?
