It's been mentioned multiple times how ridiculous the power requirements for teleportation are. High enough that the mere side effects of teleporting across Calernia could bring down the Tower.

I'm not saying it's /likely/, but I wouldn't put it past Triumphant to have that sort of contingency. (Perhaps one that even went rather wrong as the intent would be to use the corpse as a base to put down a completely undefended (as the Crusade is now under Tower rubble in Ater) Procer. She just got trapped in the corpse instead.
