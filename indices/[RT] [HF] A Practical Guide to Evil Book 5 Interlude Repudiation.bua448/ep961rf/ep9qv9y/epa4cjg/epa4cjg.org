I still prefer the theory that Heirarch's aura will force White to Judge the Gods Below while they're on trial, which functionally means the Choir of Judgement will be passing judgment on them, which puts Above and Below into more direct contention. Or at least that's the plan.

Sparking a full fledged war between the two factions of gods would be the perfect capstone to Tyrant's reign, and completely in line with his character.
