I still find it difficult to pick a side in that particular debate.

Traitorous was cut from the same cloth as Kairos. He was straight up Evil, with /style/. Dude poisoned himself and framed his entire court for it. It may well be impossible to state with any certainty how many times he usurped the throne from himself.

Irritant... doesn't really have any big, splashy victories that spring to mind. Just an endless string of Phase 1's. It's annoying to not be able to recall anything Irritant did besides crafting some quality footwear, but that's exactly perfect for him.
