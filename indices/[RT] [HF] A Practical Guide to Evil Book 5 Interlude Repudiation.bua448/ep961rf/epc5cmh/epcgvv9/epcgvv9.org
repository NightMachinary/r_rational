Irritant doesn't seem to have big splashy victories because we haven't gotten context in story for them yet. Traitorous, even before this latest reveal, was described by Ratface as having successfully.betrayed a villain named /the Betrayer/.

But if we gave Irritant the same in story context he would seem just as great as Traitorous (the Angel falling via betrayal aside). Cat was awesome for beating back the 12 heroes at the Battle of the Camps? Irritant beat back 9 bands of heroes (so anywhere from 27 to 45 heroes) /all at the same time/

  “I can't beat your band of heroes, true, but what if there were another eight bands also out for my blood? Ha! What are you going to do, form a line?”

He is, if anything, the forebearer of the awesome surrender trick that Cat pulled on Pilgrim

  "Ah, but being defeated was always part of my plan! Yet another glorious victory for the Empire.”

From that shoemaker quote we know he had 3 abdications, which means he climbed the Tower /4 separate times./

And on the smaller scale, no matter if the heroes "won" Irritant still managed to win as well, whether it's getting the weapons of troublesome High Lords destroyed, refusing to pay an army and have that army conveniently slaughtered by heros, or using palace destruction to employ Keynesian economics to help the Praes economy.

And style, you want style? This is the man who invented the pyramid scheme /to trick the High Lords into funding a pyramid/

  “No, see, you'll profit as well. All you need is to convince five others of contributing coin and when they do you'll get a part of their own contribution. It'll all work out, I promise.” -- Dread Emperor Irritant, the Oddly Successful, convincing High Lords to invest in the construction of ritual pyramid outside Ater

And he was no less stylish against heros

#+begin_quote
  And so Dread Emperor Irritant addressed the heroes thus: Lo and behold, I fear not your burning Light, for I am already on fire.”

If it weren't for the latest of Traitorous's feats that got revealed, Irritant would easily be number one for me
