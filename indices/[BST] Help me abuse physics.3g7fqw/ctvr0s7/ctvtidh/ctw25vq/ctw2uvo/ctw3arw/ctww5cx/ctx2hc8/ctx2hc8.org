That's how fast I need it to go if I start it from a standstill, accelerate it with my reactionless drive, and then bring it to a stop with regenerative breaking. But there's no need to do that. There is no reason to ever slow it below the break-even point. I can just keep running the reactionless drive and the regenerative breaks at the same time to keep the velocity constant, and as long as I'm moving faster than v=E I'll get more energy than I consume.
