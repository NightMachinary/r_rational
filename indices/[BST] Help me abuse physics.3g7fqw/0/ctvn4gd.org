  I can't actually puzzle out in my head what such a thing would look like.

You can easily generate energy with this. Have a dumbbell with two spheres (lumps; shape is irrelevant) of aetherium oxide. Rotate the dumbbell. After a sphere gets past the bottom and begins to ascend, run the current to reduce its mass. This is easy to lift. As a sphere gets past the top and begins to descend, stop the current and let it return to normal mass. In this manner, the falling sphere is always more massive, so you've produced a torque to rotate the dumbbell. You need only pay for friction and the electric current; the rest can be extracted through a generator.
