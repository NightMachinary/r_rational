  In my universe, I have established in canon that its possible to create an Over-Unity Engine using a special material called aetherium.
#+end_quote

The creation of Over-Unity Engines is energetically favored, and there is a half-life-per-cubic-centimeter rate at which space spontaneously becomes transformed into suns. Once created, they release energy into the regions around them which, while subject to the inverse square law, still provide energy to use to accelerate the process in the surrounding space since it has a higher energy density to use to spontaneously cause the transformation.

Your universe catches on Over-Unity fire and burns down immediately because you made hard vacuum flammable and the kindling point absolute zero. We have thermodynamics for a reason. Don't violate it.
