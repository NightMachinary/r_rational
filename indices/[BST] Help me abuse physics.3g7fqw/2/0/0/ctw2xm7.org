Clockwork Rocket doesn't violate thermodynamics. It eats them from the past with negative infinite temperature. Nowhere in that cosmology does energy come from nothing, but it does sometimes get sucked away from parts that didn't know they were going to contribute and don't know where it went at infinite speed.

No need for billions of years. If you can make a wheel of whatever material he has, then the virtual particles in empty space will happily make one a single particle wide, spin it, come out with more energy than they started with, and not have either particle pair disappear. That's where the fire comes from, unless you change physics in some way. If you want to balance this, make space leaky - energy bleeds off at a steady rate, and perpetual motion machines, naturally occurring and otherwise, are all that saves the universe. Entropic energy isn't merely wasted, it vanishes. You will always have exergy available to perform useful work, but it's getting colder and emptier in here without help from magic.
