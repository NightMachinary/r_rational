Your objection to "a single particle" is still "billions of years and the evolution of systems powerful enough to perform general computation"? No, you don't need general computation or billions of years for virtual particles to bubble out of the quantum foam. They do that nonstop all the time, and how long they stick around and at what rate they occur at is determined by what temperature it is, how much energy it takes to form them, and how much energy they release. If the temperature is higher than the formation energy, that makes it spontaneous. If the temperature is lower than the formation energy, it happens on a half life determined by a ratio between the temperature available and the formation energy. If the release energy is greater than the formation energy, that makes it catalytic.
