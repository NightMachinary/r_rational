  It does take energy. It takes electrical energy to shunt the mass-energy in and out of the zero point fields.

This action is conservation of energy violating, since a small electrical current is doing a lot more work than it has energy for. The second action, where you push a lighter object around, doesn't violate conservation of energy. Light objects move easily, that's normal in physics.

  But, I'll bet you 20 bucks the emdrive actually works.

I'd only accept that bet if you agreed that it has to work (for you to win) via violating conservation of momentum per your statement. "Something to point out though, is that the over-unity function is stealing energy in the form of inertia, much like the equally CofE breaking [[/r/emdrive]]. "

  Regardless though, its 100% possible to derive work from the ZPF field.
#+end_quote

Not really. It's zero point energy. It's already at its lowest energy.

With a very artificial situation you can derive a small amount of energy, by moving metal plates very close together, but it takes far more energy to do that than you gain from the casimir effect.

If your story is going to be advertising perpetual motion machines as a real thing it's not going to be very scientific, and you can make up edge cases as you wish.

  I like MiHsC because it provides a theoretical foundation for a reactionless drive, as providing a solution for the galaxy rotation problem without having to invent dark matter[1] .

Dark matter isn't really a big issue, but sure.

  As for being a 'random blogger' Mike McCulloch[2] has a PhD in Physics from Liverpool. He proposes some really interesting stuff and I highly suggest checking him out.

I don't have a huge need to read fairly fringe science from someone who doesn't seem that good at explaining it. Maybe he's right, but I don't see any particular reason to believe so. He got a PhD in Physical Oceanography, not astronomy. He's not really a great expert and hasn't done much actual official research.
