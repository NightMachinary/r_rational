  Something to point out though, is that the over-unity function is stealing energy in the form of inertia, much like the equally CofE breaking [[/r/emdrive]].

[[https://xkcd.com/955/][Would you like to bet 200 dollars on it being proven later that the EMdrive can create momentum out of nothing and violated conservation of momentum? I have the cash and am certainly willing. Also, it's not stealing inertia, inertia is an ability of an object to resist motion, it's stealing momentum in theory.]]

  Of course not. But all those previous experiments were performed using more traditional materials as well. I'm trying to build a comprehensive 'new physics' that grows out of the implications of this stuff.
#+end_quote

It's not really an issue of traditional materials vs new physics. These are laws of the universe, any material you use is going to follow the same rules.

Of you can just say "It's magic."

  How about this though, when an electrical current is put through aetherium oxide, it reduces its mass, but it doesn't really reduce its mass, it simply 'pockets' the mass, storing it until the next upstroke on the engine.
#+end_quote

That sounds rather magical. It would have the effect you wanted, but either it's going to take energy to move the mass away to the pocket or it's going to make energy out of nothing.

  I don't have a super concrete solution to this yet, but my thoughts regarding both storing massive energy quantities, as well as extracting inertial energy, is that it is done using some application of the Zero Point Field. I rather like MiHsC which is short for Modified Inertia by a Hubble Scale Casimir Effect.

That seems to be a personally invented theory by that blogger, not so much something based on any real science, and even so, it seems to be based around the idea that energy is extracted from various quantum fields somehow.

A theory that a single random blogger proposes is rather far from any sort of scientific backing for a theory, and your ideas for your fictional universe don't seem to be much to do with any actual properties of the existing theory. You could just as easily substitute quantum, nanotechnology, epigenetics, phlogiston or any other buzzword as the reason behind the science. [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/is/fake_causality/]]

That sort of science isn't hugely rational. I'd much prefer you'd just not tell us what happened than use something like ZPF to explain it. People shouldn't be encouraged to think that single real scientific theories can explain anything and everything.
