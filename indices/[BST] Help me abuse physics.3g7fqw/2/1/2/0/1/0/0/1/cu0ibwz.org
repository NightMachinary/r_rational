  It's not really an issue of traditional materials vs new physics. These are laws of the universe, any material you use is going to follow the same rules. Of you can just say "It's magic."

I don't like "its magic" as a solution. Even the magic isn't "its magic" in my story.

  That sounds rather magical. It would have the effect you wanted, but either it's going to take energy to move the mass away to the pocket or it's going to make energy out of nothing.

It does take energy. It takes electrical energy to shunt the mass-energy in and out of the zero point fields. This action in and of itself isn't CofE violating, the CofE violation emerges as a result of using the variance in mass to produce thrust. The CofE conflict emerges as you can get more kinetic energy out of the system then you put in, in the form of electrical energy. That's only a CofE conflict though in the case of a closed system, which it might not be once you take the ZPF into account.

I could of course just say, "well its fiction" but that's not particularly satisfying, and I'm really not sure its needed. I'd actually be willing to make your 200 dollar bet if I wasn't dirt poor. But, I'll bet you 20 bucks the emdrive actually works. UofDresden and Nasa Eagleworks weren't able to dismiss it despite setting out specifically to prove it doesn't work. No one is sure how or why it works yet, everyone has a different theory, but it does seem to be doing /something/.

Regardless though, its 100% possible to derive work from the ZPF field. Its not non-interacting and the Casimir Effect proves that very conclusively. We don't have a way to /use/ the Casimir effect yet, but we didn't have a way to use electromagnetism for a long time either. Unlike dark matter, there is actual experimental evidence for the Casimir Effect. The ZPF is a very real thing and we might yet be able to derive essentially free energy out of it yet. So in my story the energy doesn't come from nowhere, and in the real world Casimir derived-energy doesn't come from no where, its energy being extracted from the local zero point fields.

I like MiHsC because it provides a theoretical foundation for a reactionless drive, as providing a solution for the galaxy rotation problem without having to [[http://physicsfromtheedge.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/evidence-against-dark-matter.html][invent dark matter]]. It also provides a framework for understanding how inertia and acceleration exist. As for being a 'random blogger' [[http://physics.stackexchange.com/users/21161/mike-mcculloch][Mike McCulloch]] has a PhD in Physics from Liverpool. He proposes some really interesting stuff and I highly suggest checking him out.

  That sort of science isn't hugely rational. I'd much prefer you'd just not tell us what happened than use something like ZPF to explain it. People shouldn't be encouraged to think that single real scientific theories can explain anything and everything.

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfConservationOfDetail][Conservation of detail]] is of course always at work, and most of this need never come up in a story that is going to mostly revolve around people, not technology. However, as the author, /I/ want to know the details even if the audience doesn't. It lets me figure out how edge cases would potentially develop and how they'd play out.
