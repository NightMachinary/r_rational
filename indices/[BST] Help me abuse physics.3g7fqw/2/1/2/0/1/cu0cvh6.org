  Not necessarily. Einstein didn't get rid of Newtonian physics, just added additional layers of understanding on top of it.

Einstein's ideas didn't add much knowledge to how things behaved on earth. Newtonian physics accurately predicted how planets, humans, moons and such behaved. It didn't work in high speed environments or high gravity environments, but otherwise newtonian physics was pretty comprehensive.

If you do make new laws then they can't contradict any existing observations. Relativity couldn't modify say the speed a person falls to the earth because we've measured that.

The laws of thermodynamics are very well established. You can't do away with all the maths and experiments proving it.

The obvious possibility to make it work is to have an outside battery.

When you apply a current to this material it draws in extra power from some outside source- a parallel dimension, the corpse of a god, an alien black box. This would suggest several plot elements.

1. If you have enough aetherium in one place can you disrupt other aetherium devices? Can you draw more power than the universe can supply? Perhaps someone could design an emp bomb of some sort that could sink floating fortresses, or design a machine that could block access to other aetherium devices near a location.

2. Is there a limit to how much power the universe can supply? If you do something especially energetic can you leave a dead zone?

3. Can you access the other side? Are there people on the other side?

That's the obvious way to make it run on physics. The effect is limited, so stars aren't going to be exploding (although they could be brighter than expected) and there are mechanically fun ways to attack others.
