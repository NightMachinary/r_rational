Not necessarily. Einstein didn't get rid of Newtonian physics, just added additional layers of understanding on top of it.

What sort of universe could allow the creation of an over-unity engine while otherwise looking like our own? How would thermodynamics need to change to take that into account.

One of the other posters had suggested energy was removed from the system as well as entering it, and if the two rates balanced the situation would look like our world does.

Its all fictional, so just run with it. Given the end conditions, what sort of changes to the initial state are required? How do you avoid setting the vaccuum on fire while still allowing an over-unity engine? What sort of alternative physics would you need to make that work?
