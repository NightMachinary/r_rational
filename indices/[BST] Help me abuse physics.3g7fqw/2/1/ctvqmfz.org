This is a very dull and meaningless sentiment, formed out of a reactionary attitude towards crackpots. We have not observed any systems that output more energy than they take in, but this doesn't imply that such a thing is impossible: only that it doesn't spontaneously generate very often - rather like life, which we've only observed one instance of. The lack of something in nature doesn't imply that it's impossible to build - nor does our difficulty in figuring out how to build it.

Conservation of energy is not a wall for humanity to turn back at, but rather a problem for us to solve, like death.
