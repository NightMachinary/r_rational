The universe has two poles, the over unity pole, and the under nullity pole. One side is too hot for anything to exist, energy just pours out dense radiation and particles, and spreads out according to some inverse square law that provides a range of finite values to the universe but approaches infinity as distance to the pole approaches zero. The under nullity pole constantly sucks away energy it doesn't even have, diminishing its surroundings in a reverse of the same law. Nothing can live near there, they freeze and disintegrate into nothing. If a thing doesn't get enough energy, say because it's in the shadow of something above it, it can't perform work to stay aloft anymore and falls to nullity.
