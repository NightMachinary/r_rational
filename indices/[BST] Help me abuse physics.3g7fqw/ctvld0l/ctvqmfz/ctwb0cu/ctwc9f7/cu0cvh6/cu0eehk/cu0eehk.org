  The laws of thermodynamics are very well established. You can't do away with all the maths and experiments proving it.

Of course not. But all those previous experiments were performed using more traditional materials as well. I'm trying to build a comprehensive 'new physics' that grows out of the implications of this stuff.

Something to point out though, is that the over-unity function is stealing energy in the form of inertia, much like the equally CofE breaking [[/r/emdrive]].

I don't however, want to have a 'true' other world in my universe because I've already got a dream world and it already takes place in a seeming fantasy world.

How about this though, when an electrical current is put through aetherium oxide, it reduces its mass, but it doesn't /really/ reduce its mass, it simply 'pockets' the mass, storing it until the next upstroke on the engine. Now E=mc^{2} says that the amount of mass energy you would have to store to make this work is...rather unreasonable. Given normal materials even if you could easily convert mass/energy and back again, you're left with far too much energy to easily store.

Constructive magic also relies on the motes of magic being able to 'pocket' a small amount of matter to later extrude, and the amount of storable matter exceeds the total volume of the mote. So in both cases we have a 'where is the power going/coming from?' situation.

I don't have a super concrete solution to this yet, but my thoughts regarding both storing massive energy quantities, as well as extracting inertial energy, is that it is done using some application of the Zero Point Field. I rather like [[http://physicsfromtheedge.blogspot.co.uk/2015/08/the-emdrive-energy-paradox.html][MiHsC]] which is short for Modified Inertia by a Hubble Scale Casimir Effect. Its a new-ish physics theory that I quite like, because you can plug in the equations and use it to get accurate figures for things like galaxy rotation without needing to invoke dark matter or dark energy. Its not a proven theory yet, but its gaining inertia (huehue) as the Emdrive continues to fail [[http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2015-4083][at being disproven]].

Obviously it could turn out to be bunk, but its not bunk /yet/ and this is a fictional story anyway.

So if in my universe, its possible to extract/store energy in the zero point field, including inertia energy and mass energy, and then get it back out later. CofE isn't violated once you take into account the ZPF which acts as a 'universal capacitor' allowing the extraction or storage of arbitrarily high amounts of energy. Its not 'another world' in the traditional sense, but it is in the sense of a place you can get energy out of.

The other thought I had regarding all of this (and which may yet get a topic of its own) is this idea that if you pump enough energy into the ZPF at a given location, it induces a negative curvature of spacetime. This locally reduces gravity and increases the rate of the flow of time. The ultimate example of this might be a 'white hole' which is like a black hole except that the space-time curvature is negative instead of positive. Things are pushed away harder and harder until, at the event horizon the rate at which you're pushed away exceeds the speed of light and the amount of time that passes in 1 second from outside this region reaches infinity. More practically speaking, if you can create these 'anti gravity' fields, you can use them to buy yourself time. You could create an internal field that gives you 100 years to solve a problem while on the outside only seconds tick by. The increase in the rate of the flow of time is a product of the negative curvature of space time, just like a positive curvature of spacetime decreases the rate of the flow of time. The temporal effects would make it difficult to use anti-gravity in this sense to provide lift, but the over-unity thruster removes the need to use it in this context. The reason for all of this is that I really wanted to play around with what sorts of secondary effects messing with gravity would have. If you can create anti-gravity, because gravity is the curvature of spacetime, anti-gravity should curve space the wrong way. And yet we never actually see that used in fiction, which is a shame because it might open up all sorts of interesting side effects.
