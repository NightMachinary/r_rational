You need to put this into the context of Noether's theorem. The thing to note here is that energy is not conserved the laws of physics change over time, as the conservation of momentum is broken in the manner in which you have chosen to demonstrate the laws of physics change over distance and over space.

Congratulations you now have a dimension where there is magic. Biology will happily evolve to function using this aetherium. As there is a preferred distance and location general and special relitivity are out of the window. As similarly quantum mechanics is significantly changed, and conservation of information probably does not hold.
