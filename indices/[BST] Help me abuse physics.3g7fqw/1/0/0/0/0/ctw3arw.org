Here's a particular example. I can prove the general case with calculus if you prefer.

Suppose we have a reactionless drive with a mass of 1 kg that runs at 1 MW/N. It's moving at 2,000,000 m/s.

E//k0// = 1/2 mv//0//^{2}

= 1/2(1 kg)(2,000,000 m/s)^{2}

= 2,000,000,000,000 J

After an impulse of one Ns of impulse, which takes, 1 MJ,

v//1// = 2,000,001 m/s

E//k1// = 1/2 mv//1//^{2}

= 1/2(1 kg)(2,000,001 m/s^{2)}

= 2,000,002,000,001 J

âˆ†E//k// = 2,000,001 J

But it only took 1,000,000 to run.
