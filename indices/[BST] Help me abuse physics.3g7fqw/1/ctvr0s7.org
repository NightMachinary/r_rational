Any reactionless drive with an efficiency greater than 300 MW/N can be used as a perpetual motion machine. W/N also works out to m/s. If you have something moving faster than its efficiency, it produces more kinetic energy then it uses energy, and if you add in regenerative breaking you have a perpetual motion machine.

Others have pointed out a more efficient way to do it in your case, but I like to answer the general problem.
