It might work well to make a number of primary sources, stories and pieces of evidence about the world. Any sources made would have to adhere to their existence.

Plus your story actually has to be decent. I maintain a mother of learning wiki, but there aren't that many people on there, and that's good enough that people pay money to support the author.
