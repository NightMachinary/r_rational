I've used wikis in the past for D&D. You can [[http://maguseuropa.wikidot.com/][see one here]]. This wasn't at all in-universe, just a collection of knowledge that the players could peruse at their leisure or ignore entirely. It also served double-duty as a campaign log.

The big problem is that wikis are a lot of work. Every hour that's spent working on the wiki means an hour that you're not working on the actual story. You can't depend on other people to maintain the wiki without having people (lots of them) engaged with the story, but they won't do that if the story isn't being written well and at a steady pace, and even then I think it's something of a crapshoot.

I don't know, I think it's a neat idea but the effort involved makes it seem like it wouldn't be worth it?
