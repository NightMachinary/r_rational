Maintaining a secondary source of canon adds a multiplicative factor to the effort involved in making the story in the first place. And simulating participation of a fragment of a fictional internet involves the observed behavior of every person who adds to that fragment, which itself adds up. Simulating in detail a system that involves more people than yourself can only be done productively with AI.
