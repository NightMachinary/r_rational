Probably the methods that he uses in order to convince people to become vampires. No needles or anesthetics, only teeth, since it's unlikely to be approved by the FDA by the time the story begins.

Although to be fair, brainwashing is reversible and the pain would be temporary, but death...not so much. Also the part where one of the vampires called someone "my child" was just creepy and unwarranted, although maybe creepiness was done on purpose in order to be thematic or something, but considering how many of the other characters would likely take that kind of comment seriously, it probably wasn't a smart thing for him to say.
