I feel like the scene in the trailer with the door-to-door vampires was something of a missed opportunity for a thresholds joke.

I mean, the guy /did/ have a line right afterward asking viewers to 'let them in' but it's like they went right up to the point where it would be overtly funny but didn't quite, uh, cross, it...

Hm.
