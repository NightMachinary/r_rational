I... actually don't agree with that? I mean Aaron clearly has a sense of humor, but /definitely/ is self-aware of how he might not be "sane," strictly speaking:

  It would be a lie to say I stayed sane by keeping my mind sharp. The sort of mental sharpness you need for the kabbalah is almost perpendicular to sanity, more like a very specific and redirectable schizophrenia. I stayed functional by keeping my mind in a very specific state that probably wasn't very long-term healthy.

But he never really says or thinks anything that makes me feel like he doesn't /believe/ in the "this isn't a coincidence because nothing is a coincidence" refrain.
