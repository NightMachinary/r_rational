I think the most consistent interpretation is that he believes it, mostly, but he's also kind of kludgy and bumbling in his interpretation of kabala. He's not actually a master seeing the secrets of the universe, he's mostly an amateur making ad hoc connections wherever he can find them. The narrator is not entirely reliable, in other words, and his interpretations might not jive with the "true" meaning.
