I stopped reading this story after Uriel revealed that North Africans didn't have souls and only checked this out to see what weird humorous things could be done with Trump. The name puns were funny, but I really didn't like the way they spun Narnia into the election by cherry-picking certain parts while ignoring the rest. I get what the author meant to do with Kabbalah being the recursive pattern of reality, but it in no way proves the character's point if he really can spin anything and this time it wasn't even a religious text.
