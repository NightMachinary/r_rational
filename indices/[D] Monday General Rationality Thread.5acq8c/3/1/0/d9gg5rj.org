I agree the hosts don't seem to have changed much in 30 years. In fact they seem identical. I also agree this would be a bigger oversight than the milk can label and similar issues. As you mentioned one possibility is that the William time period is in the past but less than 30 years in the past.

Is there a specific description from the MiB that really doesn't fit? We haven't seem William open any up yet (assuming William is MiB) so we don't know what's inside the hosts in William's time. The MiB said they changed to using flesh to save costs, not improve the experience, which implies the experience was good enough with mechanical hosts. It's also possible MiB is not William and he first came to the park several years before William did.

There is still a lot unknown about the early timeline. They worked on robots for 3 years before the park opened. The robots passed the Turning Test (what exactly does that mean) within 1 year. Arnold died 34-35 years ago, but was this before the park opened, or how long after? Maybe the park was open for 10 years before Arnold died.

Edit: In Ford's flashback we see a robot half-finished lying on a table (I think it's Hector). His face looks pretty realistic, as do the other robots in the flashback, so they don't all move well. This is at least several years before William comes.
