I tend to agree that some of it may be down to more than a coincidence, but I think this theory really breaks down for enough other reasons that I think the only conclusion is neither is quite right. For example the Hosts William seems to be exposed to don't match at all the descriptions the man in black gives for the Hosts of 30 years ago. If anything those statements seem like way more of an oversight that any of the "evidence" for two timeline theory if proved to be an accident.

My running interpretation is that we aren't seeing two timelines or at a minimum the timelines aren't 30 years apart.
