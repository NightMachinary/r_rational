I've been enjoying Westworld, and for the most part also enjoying discussing it on [[/r/westworld]]. My question is for others who watch the show. For those familiar, I believe in the "two time periods" theory, that the scenes with William are happening in the past, mostly likely ~30 years earlier. There are a lot of others on reddit who agree, and apparently more who disagree. I'm not bothered by disagreement. That's fine. This is only one possible theory. Some will be right and some will be wrong. But it seems many of the detractors to this theory are also extremely annoyed by it and by it's persistence in the discussion. Every week they want nothing more than for the show to definitively disprove the idea, and they believe the theory comes from purely baseless speculation and wishful thinking. I disagree. I think there are numerous (~20) clues, "coincidences", and deceiving edits that are done intentionally to give the superficial impression of a single time period while dropping hints that it is two. Any specific clue or coincidence can be easily explained by a production mistake or just actual coincidence, but the shear number of them make it very, very unlikely IMO.

What does rational think? Is there a solid basis for the two time periods theory or is it just confirmation bias?
