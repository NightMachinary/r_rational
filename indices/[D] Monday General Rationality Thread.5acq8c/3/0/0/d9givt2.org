Thanks for the reply. I agree that theories can be ridiculous, and that not all fiction needs to have twists. But I disagree that this is one such theory. It's not all that complicated actually. It just requires one or two tricks and everything else falls into place. One thing it certainly requires, though, as you mentioned, is "extremely deceptive editing." I can think of about 5 instances like the example you have. But I don't see why whether you "like" it, or whether you think it would be bad storytelling means the theory is invalid. I expect the casual watcher would be quite surprised by the revelation, but in a "holy shit" way, not a "that's stupid" way.

Also, they give hints that the editing is not linear and there may be an unreliable narrator situation. She had a gun in the dresser, she looks in a mirror, the gun is gone. She has clearly been some of the places more than once (or is having visions that she was there) like the town where she talked to Lawrence's daughter.

Also, I think someone who denies this theory should provide a valid explanation for the many coincidences. You have to believe that the milk can was a production mistake, and the company uses multiple logos at the same time, and it's coincidence that the only other time they show the William logo is in a flashback to the early years, and different people happen to be recruiting in Sweetwater, and Teddy happens to be gone when William is in Sweetwater, and the bounty hunter they hire happens to be dressed just like Teddy (Ford says Teddy's role is to keep Dolores in her loop - implying there is some history of her going off her loop), and Maeve happens to be out of view but Clementine is outside when William is there, even though the show added a line about Clementine running the brothel before Maeve, and even though we saw Maeve kill two robbers to protect her workers she doesn't even show up after Clementine was threatened, and Dolores is seen alone in the train car at the end of E5 because she is in a trance or something. There are a lot of "and"s there. William being in the past addresses all of these coincidences naturally, including even the storytelling ones. Why did the mention Clementine did the job before? It would have been enough just to say "give the job to Clementine." No viewer would have doubted that Clementine could do the job. Why add "she's done it before" unless it's a hint? The only thing you need to accept is the misleading editing.

There really isn't any other "proof" against the theory that I can think of. With each episode we get more coincidences and production mistakes that the theory answers naturally, while the only new evidence against it is more examples of the same thing - intentionally deceptive editing.
