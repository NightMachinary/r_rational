I just don't think there have really been serious efforts at objectively quantifying attributes of a game due to the massive effort involved. For example, . I'm not talking about "is it a good game?" but rather "is it a bad game?"

The limiting factor, seems to be the ability to quantify aspects of games and then statistically determine which sections of games most people enjoyed or didn't enjoy, then reducing or replacing the sections that are less enjoyable. For example, Sequelitis mentions that OoT has lots of waiting. This is something that can be quantified quite accurately. There are other, more abstract qualities of games [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.1895v1.pdf][that can be quantified as well, such as NP-hardness]].
