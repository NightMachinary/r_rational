If anyone reads this, I'd like to know so I can gauge the worth of making posts a day late.

There was some moderate drama last week on [[/r/n64]] when someone made a post attempting to show that Ocarina of Time was a terrible game. Their opinion was extremely dramatized, and received a lot of attention. Additionally, there was another post that attempted to say that they were being "objective", and their post was also clearly opinion (much more level-headed than the original, but still not 100% correct) it got me thinking anyway.

How would you go about attempting to prove objectively, the qualities of a game? I know that with knowledge of basic proofs and discrete math, one can determine the truth or validity of most people's claims. I'm going to mull this over for a day or so and post developed thoughts on Friday, I think.

For the interested, here are the posts:
