I think it's overly complicated. It reminds me of some other theories for other fictional universes that would give the work a "twist". For a long time there were diehard "Ron = Dumbledore" theorists before the final books of /Harry Potter/ had been written. Given that all that's really available for analysis is the text, and there's nothing that /explicitly/ conflicts with the theory, it's impossible to disprove. Any conflicting evidence complicates the theory, but can't kill it entirely, because to kill it would require explicit disconfirmation.

There are a bunch of examples of not-outright-disconfirmation from the most recent episode which have been rationalized away in one way or another. What I dislike most is that the theory seems to rest on extremely deceptive editing on the part of the creators in order to allow the theory room for existence, which means that anyone who is ignorant of the theory (meaning most watchers) will cause them to be unsatisfied, annoyed, or confused if/when it's revealed. If you wanted to tell the story that the theory posits, this doesn't seem like the way that you would do it. (To give one specific example, [[#s][]]) Of course, there's probably some way to make this fit with the theory, but it will be both a complication and require the creators to deliberately break the grammar of television story-telling (rather than just abusing it).
