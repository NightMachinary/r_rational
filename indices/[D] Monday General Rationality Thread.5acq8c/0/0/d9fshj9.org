I can't comment on the math, but I've heard of a similar game, called the same thing, where person 1 says "Odd are, do [x]" (where x is a thing that person 1 is daring person 2 to do), and person 2 says "1 in [y]", where y is any number, depending on how extreme x is. They then both say a number between 1 and y, and if they say the same number, then player 2 does x. I once saw a 1 in 2,000,000 happen, but that was only because they both guessed 1,000,000.
