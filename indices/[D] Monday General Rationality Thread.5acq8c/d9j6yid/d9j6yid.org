Somebody made a dating website for rationalists and I can't figure out how to use it! The instructions don't match what's actually showing up in the window, and I'm getting kind of frustrated with it. I tried using google chrome as well as Microsoft Edge (Internet Explorer). Had the same problem both times.

Has somebody else been able to get it to work? It doesn't say anything about browser compatibility on the site.

Thanks!
