  this adds plenty of clauses to the "is it a bad game" question.

Well, I guess I misspoke. "Is it a bad game", objectively means "is it playable?" For example, E.T. wasn't a bad game just because it played badly. It's a bad game because it was practically unplayable. Basically, a "bad game" means it's broken, unbeatable despite the fact that /it was not designed to be unbeatable./

That said, "bad game" isn't the largest part of my thought process here. One can objectively quantify things like sprite resolution, base animation FPS, animation length, load times given consistent hardware as well as the number of times a loading screen is encountered.
