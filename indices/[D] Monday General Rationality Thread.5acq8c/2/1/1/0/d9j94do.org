When the design of the game is to force you to focus on a single thing in front of you if you want to fight it, which automatically puts the camera parallel to the ground, it's a pretty obnoxious design decision to permit things to swoop at you from the angles that you can no longer see. And aware of the surrounding terrain != able to track keese above your head /and/ swoopy blade things on the ground at the same time.

Also, when he talked about being aware of your surroundings, he was specifically calling out a well-designed miniboss that had you fighting /just/ the one enemy, without all the BS of swoop-swoop, just you, it, and the room. It was brought up /because/ it was so rare.

Yes, he sells his opinions as "the way things are", but it's pretty valuable and insightful feedback regardless.
