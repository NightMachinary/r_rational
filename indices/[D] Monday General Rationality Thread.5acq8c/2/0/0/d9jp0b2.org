You got me thinking, and I'm utilizing your point here:

  You can list factual qualities of a creative work, like number of distinct colors used in a painting, Flesch-Kincaid reading level of a novel, frames per second of a videogame, etc.

As the basis for my paper. I'm not here to objectively quantify whether or not they mean a game is good or bad, but give a means of identifying the objective qualities of a game. I've divided it into four categories: System Requirements, Technical Operation, Gameplay Attributes, and Story Attributes.

Sys. Requirements refers to the technical specs required (OS, processor, hdd space, etc).

Technical Operation refers to things such as Load screens, load times, User Interface, and Input Method.

Gameplay Attributes refers to the qualities that make up things like RPGs, RTSes. This seems to be the most broad category, so I may divide it into multiple sections.

Storyline Attributes referring to player choice, rationality of the story itself and its characters, how the story is told (audio or text, or environment) etc.

Mind being a beta reader for me before I go public with it? I'm not planning on proposing a rating system or anything, just a means of evaluating a game's attributes objectively.
