Opinions are subjective. They cannot be wrong.

However, with that said:

- It's possible to have inconsistent opinions. For example, if I say that books with a prime number of pages are the greatest works of literature, then go on to say that /Catcher in the Rye/ (with 214 pages) is the greatest work of literature, clearly my opinions are inconsistent (or incompletely expressed).
- It's possible to disagree with popular and/or critical consensus. For example, the Star Trek: Voyager episode "Threshold" might be my favorite episode of the series.
- It's possible to misrepresent the views of others, or lie about them entirely. For example, I might say that /everyone/ loved "Threshold" -- but this isn't actually an opinion, it's a statement of fact (one which is incorrect).
- It's possible to be wrong about factual matters, but hopefully we already knew this. Saying a game runs at 60 fps when it really runs at 30 fps is wrong. But it's not actually an opinion.

You can list factual qualities of a creative work, like number of distinct colors used in a painting, Flesch-Kincaid reading level of a novel, frames per second of a videogame, etc. ... but while these qualities /might/ be predictors of whether the average person would find something good or bad, that's more a measure of subjective evaluation than a measure of objective goodness. In which case you might as well just look at the aggregate of customer reviews on Amazon/Metacritic/Steam, etc..
