I propose a new term, "retrodictable", to refer to events whose causes are clear in hindsight, even if they may not have been clear initially. In other words, a "retrodictable" event is one that you can look back on and say, "I /could/ have seen that one coming, if only I were quicker on the uptake."

Right now, we use the word "predictable" to encompass both this usage (something that you /could/ have predicted in advance, e.g. "Ugh, that was so /predictable/, how did I /miss/ that") and the other, more obvious usage (something that you /actually did/ predict in advance, e.g. "Haha, that was so predictable, it was almost too easy"). Given the prevalence of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias][hindsight bias]], I think it's important to distinguish between cases in which you /did not/ predict the event in advance (even if, looking back, there were obvious indicators that you could have picked up on, potentially) and cases in which you /actually did/ predict it. Hence, "retrodictable", if successfully introduced as a term, would specifically refer to the former case, thereby [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_overload][freeing up]] the word "predictable" to refer purely to the latter.

Examples:

1. The notion of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank][measuring the importance of a website via the proxy measure of how many times that site was linked to by other sites]] is an example of something that is /retrodictable/ but not /predictable/: obviously a good idea in hindsight, despite the fact that it took [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine#History][over a decade]] for said idea to actually be implemented and achieve prominence.
2. My drive to work taking longer than usual due to traffic is an example of something that is both /retrodictable and predictable/. More generally, anything you /actually/ predicted in advance is obviously and trivially retrodictable. (This means that even if "retrodictable" becomes accepted terminology, you'll almost never use it when talking about something you successfully predicted.)
3. Finally, for an example of something that was /neither retrodictable nor predictable/, see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump][this guy]].
