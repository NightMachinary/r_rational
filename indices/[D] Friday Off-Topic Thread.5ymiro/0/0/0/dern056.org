The idea is not to introduce a new concept, but to prevent a single word (in this case "predictable") from referring to two distinct concepts. While it would be nice if people could effortlessly maintain mental distinctions between similar concepts, in practice all of us associate words with particular mental "buckets" or "categories", and associating two different categories to the /same/ word can cause people to commit [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/nw/fallacies_of_compression/][category errors]]. Adding the words "in retrospect" or "in hindsight" does little to change this, unfortunately, and also (from an aesthetic viewpoint) makes about as much sense as saying "the day after yesterday" instead of just "today".
