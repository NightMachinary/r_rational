I think example 3 is flawed. Just because you don't currently understand the causes, even in hindsight, doesn't mean that it couldn't be predicted; we might not have enough understanding yet, but in time it will probably come. Many people did correctly predict the outcome. So as not to remove all meaning from the word "predictable", I'm willing to say that since the vast majority of people incorrectly predicted the outcome with a high level of certainty (betting odds on the night of the election were 4-1 against), that it was in fact unpredictable. Then again, if [[http://www.campusreform.org/?ID=8889][this]] is correct, then perhaps it really was retrodictable.

What you really want as an example is something like the outcome of a die roll. The outcome cannot be predicted from the initial conditions, no matter how much analysis is performed. Or, sufficient analysis would be complex and take too many resources to be performed before the event actually occurs.
