  talk about Japanese game shows with [[/r/rational]] instead of going over to [[/r/JapaneseGameShows]]
#+end_quote

OK, I don't watch any Japanese game shows, but last year I watched the entire catalogue of The Genius, a korean reality/game show (apparently they're called variety shows, as in [[/r/koreanvariety]]). I think it's a show that regulars on [[/r/rational]] would enjoy; people do mini strategy games (of the werewolf/mafia sort of genre, of the nim sort of genre, games requiring alliances, logic games, etc) and there are often ways to break the game by thinking laterally. The contestants are almost universally extremely smart and come up with strategies that leave you in awe.

The first season is on youtube; the other seasons are linked from the [[/r/TheGenius]] subreddit or the tumblr of bumdiddlyumptious (the fan who subs it).

Season 1: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpwIgWPfNvc]] (there's a playlist on youtube)

Note: It's in Korean with subtitles. You get used to it. I'm face blind (for real) and can tell the contestants apart after a few episodes (but I can never remember their occupations; they're Korean celebrities and apparently some of them are more than a little famous). That said, a cheat sheet will no doubt be useful at least at the start: [[http://www.purplerockpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/The-Genius-season-1-cast-cheat-sheet-by-Angie-Caunce.jpg]]

Note 2: Each episode is 1 hour 10 minutes long. It's divided into two segments, a main match and a death match, so there's a natural pausing place at least.

Note 3: There's a death match game that they use a couple of times called tactical yutnori. It is a traditional korean board game and it's... not fun for a westerner to watch. The subber does quick subtitles explaining the rules. Either suffer through it or just skip it. There's a couple of really excellent strategic moves that happen in tactical yutnori but it's probably not worth 30 minutes of your life.
