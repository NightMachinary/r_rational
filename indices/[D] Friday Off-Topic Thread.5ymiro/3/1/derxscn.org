Unless the laws we have to follow are extremely horrific, I would accept alien rule. My reasoning is that every time a similar situation in human history with a more powerful nation interacting with a weaker nation occurred, the smaller culture has almost always been wiped out (intentionally or not) via conquering or assimilation. Better to live on as an independent minority rather than an assimilated one.

While things would be different with aliens instead of humans, it's still unlikely to be easy for us to sustain our culture in the face of technological superiority and rapid societal change. Agreeing to become a vassal would allow us to adapt to transitioning to an interplanetary civilization without having to deal with fighting against a superior foe.

If the aliens make the same deal /and/ we don't have to worry about being conquered at all with the only con is that we lose out on access to the technology, then I would still agree to the same deal as above.

I would only argue for resistance if the gap is largely in space-faring technology and that we could catch up to the aliens in a fairly short time span (maybe two decades?) or if their laws are so horrific that dying would be better.
