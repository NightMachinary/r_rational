I'll take autonomy, please.

This scenario isn't all that different from ones we've seen on earth. A more powerful nation comes along, and starts colonizing distant lands. Colonial governors don't generally impose their will too much on the local populace, while providing various forms of infrastructure and technology... sometimes it's worse for the local populace, sometimes better. Worst case, we end up being killed off like various Native American tribes. Best case, we end up like Hong Kong. Still not a great deal.

Then again, perhaps if we don't take the deal, we end up in an even worse position: perpetually a third world planet in galactic civilization that can't get it's act together, can't unify, and is perpetually asking for handouts. We end up as the Nigerian scammers of the galaxy.

I think I'll risk that. Besides, I'd hate to take a crappy deal just because it was the first to come along and be forced to pass up better ones later on. Satisficing is a real risk.
