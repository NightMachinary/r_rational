The devil is in the details here. We have to follow alien laws, but do alien values match human values? If so, then we've got a sort of benevolent dictator, but if not, it might not matter how much autonomy we ostensibly have if they're imposing their laws on us.

Do they outlaw life-extending technology? Big minus.

Do they have laws which effectively reduce government corruption? Mid-size plus.

Do they have laws which prevent nuclear weapons from being used without alien-tech-level retaliation preventing the devastation? Mid-size plus.

I'd hear them out, though. I'm not dedicated to 'the human species' being fully dominant above all else. The extent that the human race is thriving relates more to the tech level, material wealthiness, and intellectual freedom of the world as a whole. Right now we're doing pretty good with that, what with science and computers and machines, but the title of 'independent' is rather hollow compared to improving that further.
