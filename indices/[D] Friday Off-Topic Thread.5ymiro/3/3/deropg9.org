It really depends on how alien law works, but I don't think there any possible set of laws that would stop all ongoing conflicts. War and violence don't happen in a vacuum; even if you removed all of the guns in Syria, you're still left with a ton of people, some of them with very legitimate grievances (the government killed/oppressed my kin), with strongly incompatible opinions of how their country should be ruled.

Peace-keeping aside, I'd expect most countries to flat out refuse the alien rule. Countries are really touchy about their sovereignty, and no one would seriously consider submitting themselves to an alien empire, especially if the first thing the aliens do is announce that the Earth is now part of the Galactic Federation whether Earthlings like it or not.

I mean, even if their laws seem reasonable, we have no reason to believe they're not just trying to get us to disarm so they can more easily enslave us or whatever.
