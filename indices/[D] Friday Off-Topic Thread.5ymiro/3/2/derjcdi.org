1) is a bit unclear because almost all tech is war-related, but I don't think it matters a lot. It also depends on what the alien laws are. Lastly, is their an actual choice? Or would the aliens assume direct control if we refuse?

I think there will be a clear division in the population itself. After a few weeks of considering the implications, I think most pro-science people and people who don't accord value to silly things like borders would agree. But that group would be very small. Patriots, traditionalists and religious people would never agree to give up their sovereignty and their ways.

Either way, governments cannot just agree to terms like these. But the good choice in my opinion would be to accept.
