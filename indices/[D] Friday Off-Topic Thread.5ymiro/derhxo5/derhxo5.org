So, random question for everyone:

If an alien confederation invaded earth tomorrow, and made the following two offers:

1) Humanity would have free access to all of its non-war related technology, including space travel to terraform and colonize other planets and medicine that could extend lifespans.

2) Earth is now a vassal planet to the alien's civilization, and, while very local matters would most likely be left alone, all countries must give up their sovereignty and all humans must follow alien laws.

Who here would be inclined to accept alien rule, and who here would be inclined to resist it through violence? I understand that the particulars of the two points matters a lot (particularly what laws might be required for 2), but I'm curious how much the core concepts push people to choose one way or another.
