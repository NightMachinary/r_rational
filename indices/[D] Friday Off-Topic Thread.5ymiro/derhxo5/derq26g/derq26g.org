As a personal decision that effects only myself, I instinctively lean towards 1. Even if the alien society isn't much better than our own, I still like the idea of participating in something larger than myself and I have found the process of doing so in our world needlessly difficult thanks to my mental disorders. I'm in a depressed enough state of mind where I automatically envision this choice as an escapist fantasy purely because I'm dissatisfied with my life as it currently is and improving it isn't easy. I'm ready to hand over some autonomy in exchange for increased general happiness, which makes me think I can't be trusted to weigh the pros and cons of such a decision.

However, it's not clear what the pros and cons actually are from a political perspective. You didn't give any specifics about what consequences there would be for alien rule aside from their leaders being able to overrule our leaders. It's hard to have a concrete debate about whether it's better to be a nation or a state when the only known difference is access to technology/trade we don't currently have. I think it comes down to whether you generally value freedom or security over the other, which I go back and forth on depending on the specifics of each. I'm comfortable with Big Brother watching me despite the risk of abuses of power, but I zealously oppose banning human-operated vehicles even though I know it would save lives.
