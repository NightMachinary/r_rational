My understanding of the modern art scene is that much, if not most, of it is a dialogue with other artists. At some point, they stopped trying to talk to you and me and focused on talking with each other, which is why so many art movements are responses to one another.

But art remains high-class, so you still get people going "ooh" and "ah" over stuff that they don't actually understand because they haven't studied art history (or at least the history of that movement and artist).

Imagine that it became popular for American poets to write in Esperanto rather than English. You and I wouldn't get what they're saying, and would wonder why particular pieces of work were so popular when they're unintelligible gibberish, but that's because we aren't fluent in Esperanto.
