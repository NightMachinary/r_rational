So to establish a basis for this argument,

- Andy Warhol is a well-known artist
- Thus, many people have seen his art
- And to have gotten to be so recognized, many people need to have /enjoyed/ his art

So since his art generated positive utility, it has nonzero artistic value.

But that's not quite what you asked me to argue.

For the question of whether Warhol is celebrated disproportionately to the artistic value of the works he created, We kind of need to define what "disproportionately" means in this context. Since you're the person that asked to be convinced, I'll let you come up with your own definition, whether objective, or with reference to other artists.

Though a short draft of an argument would be artists like warhol that can create iconic works (ex. the soup cans, the neon portraints) they wouldn't have been created, were it not for that artist are far rarer than, say, interchangeable pop singers who sing fairly derivative works yet are celebrated at about the same level. Therefore Warhol falls solidly on the right side of the originalness to popularity bell curve, albeit not far to the end like the true visionaries.
