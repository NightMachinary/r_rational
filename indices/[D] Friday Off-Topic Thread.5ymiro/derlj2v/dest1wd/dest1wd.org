I don't think they really refer to two different concepts.

Consider a puzzle that you solve after an hour of effort. The solution is simple and elegant, so you wonder how it eluded you so long. You might say to yourself, "Ugh, that was so easy, how didn't I get it?".

Likewise, if you did get it instantly, you might think to yourself, "Well that was easy."

If you want to separate the two types of retrospective hindsight ("I was right, it was X." and "I was wrong, turns out it was X."), I'd recommend using a modifying word or phrase rather than inventing new words for all possible X.
