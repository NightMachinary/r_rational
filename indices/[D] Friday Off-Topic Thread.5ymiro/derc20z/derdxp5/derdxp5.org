Haha, I was going to make a top-level comment about this cool rap I saw yesterday:

[[https://lostboyevsky.bandcamp.com/track/were-living-in-a-golden-age-but-humanity-might-go-extinct][This awesome rap]] has been making rounds across the rationalist-sphere.

I love it.

Awesome rhymes like "reading Venkatesh Rao in Bangladesh now" and "broadcasting live from a cottage in Bulgaria let's build some eco-cities and eradicate malaria".
