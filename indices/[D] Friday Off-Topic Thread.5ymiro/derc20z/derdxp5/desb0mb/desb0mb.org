I hope that the artist reconstructs this song at some point. Right now, this song is Atlas Shrugged-tier, in that it pushes a message but doesn't perform very well as a song (as examples, I would contrast it with Tim Minchin and Greydon Square, artists whose songs have similar themes but work not just as tracts but as songs in themselves).

(The poor cadence also gives the impression that the artist just did a 3/4 job of slapping names and ideas together, which conveys a sense that the artist does not respect zir audience enough to finish the job and keep working at it. This also diminishes my ability to enjoy the song.)
