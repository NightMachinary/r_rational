Would anyone be willing to argue for, or at least steelman, the artistic value of Warhol? My current opinion is that he's ok, but a bit over celebrated for his early work, coasted off Pop Art, and then did typical weird-but-not-really-good stuff like filming someone sleeping for six hours.

(Caveats: I'm not an expert in art, and although I try to overcompensate for stereotypical STEM anti-art thinking, I can't tell if its affecting me here)
