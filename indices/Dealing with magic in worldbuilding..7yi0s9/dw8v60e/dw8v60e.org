So did you develop it?

Maybe you like this blog: [[https://mythcreants.com/blog/how-to-create-an-eclectic-magic-system/]] It gives a guide to make stuff of fables and fairy tales (like witches, ghosts, wizards or cultivators) and make them somewhat work together rationally.

Answers to your questions (but I made some assumptions since I don't know your magic) laws for magitech can be as easy as in dnd, where you need some days, materials and you need to cast a similar spell every day to make a magic item with an effect.

or you have something magical (like dials in One Piece) and those can absorb for example fire. and then set it free. Or magic crystals that react to electricity/force.

To 2: Hard to answer without knowledge of your magic. Maybe it is the difference between artistic drawing (many styles) and technical drawing (there is a norm, how to do it).
