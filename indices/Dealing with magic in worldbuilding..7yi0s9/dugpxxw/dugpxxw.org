Daystar Eld and Alexander Wales run a great podcast called Rationally Writing [[http://daystareld.com/podcasts/rationally-writing/][here]] that has two episodes on magic systems [[http://www.daystareld.com/podcast/rationally-writing-6/][here]] and [[http://www.daystareld.com/podcast/rationally-writing-7/][here]]. Those should be able to answer most of your questions, if I remember what they covered correctly.
