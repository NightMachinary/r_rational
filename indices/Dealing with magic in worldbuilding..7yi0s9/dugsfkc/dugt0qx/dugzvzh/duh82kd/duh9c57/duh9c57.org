There are ways. Depending on the art, it could innovate in certain ways. Does mahogany work better than canvas for painting magic and does the symbolic interaction work through it better? Or maybe certain colors make it better to manipulate opinions? Does paint made from one material work better than another, and so on. Focus on the art and metaphysics with a question of who'll use it, how, and why.
