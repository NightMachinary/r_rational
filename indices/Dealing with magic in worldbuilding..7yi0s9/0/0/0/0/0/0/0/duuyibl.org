Fun interesting note, if magic is personal and based on your way of thinking/ emotions, then there would possibly be a surge of schools, each with its own traditions/ practices that work best for them. With a feedback loop and sounding chamber would reinforce people who already have similar thoughts to be more and more alike, allowing them to learn greater magics from each other and also be more and more seperated from the normal way of thinking. (Sort of like how political parties are view from the outside, except that conforming to the "stereotype" more and more gives you more power and status)
