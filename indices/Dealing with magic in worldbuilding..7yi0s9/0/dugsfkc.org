It's fine to post soft-magic works here! Your magic system doesn't have to be explicitly detailed, it just has to be consistent. If Bob can throw a fireball on Monday then he should be able to do it again on Tuesday unless you show a reason that he can't.

I'm not sure what you're looking for with your post -- do you want help doing the worldbuilding?
