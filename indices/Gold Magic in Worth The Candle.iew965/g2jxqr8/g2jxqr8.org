Very astute. I like the emotional approach, and it's a good effort. I still think it wouldn't have to be telekinesis. A sort of shield you can move and bash with and stand on would make more sense to me. One that is literally gold. I suspect that the interlocutor for the call is actually a devil, and gold magic and gold mages are how they interact with the living world on a more regular basis than non Anima. I'm probably also wrong, but I also noticed it seemed to be very precisely putting strains on his personal relationships. Blood magic could be the inexorable march of technology. Juniper starts with fire, then spears, but soon it's allowing him to fight more creatively and even come close to flying. At insane upper levels, it allows a person to make a bomb that could take out most of an EZ. Or maybe it's saying that conflict and combat are inherent in how humanity interacts with tools. "It's in our blood."
