  Though I haven't got a clue what the thematic undertone for blood magic is yet. Maybe someone can catch me up in the comments.

I suspect it may just be cool.

Either that or it's some sort beating heart, love, mixing of blood metaphor for closeness, given how often it's used in situations with people that Juniper loves.

I like the take on gold magic though!
