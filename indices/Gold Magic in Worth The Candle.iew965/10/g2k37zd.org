hmmm that is... one way to look at it. Of course it's not known to be /wrong/ per se, but I don't really grok the impulse to push stories this deeply into metaphors when there isn't much or any explicit reference confirming that metaphor over others. Maybe sometimes, maybe even often, an author does have some hidden themes they're exploring for fun as they write a story. But to me, unless the author explicitly shares their intent, trying to fit story elements into deep yet unconfirmed metaphors fails to gain my mental buy-in because there's no way to validate the result. It's a free-association exercise where I can think of completely different metaphors that also "fit" just as well. If others also fit that's demonstrating both a lack of explanatory power and a lack of any certainty in the connection to the reality of the story's universe that would give the explanation emotional weight. Worse, if I then buy into one metaphor over another, I'll have skewed expectations. My skewed expectations then make the story less enjoyable when in all likelihood the author doesn't deliver on whatever random metaphor I took as a promise from their setup.

Maybe others can find emotional impact without that connection to whatever the objective truth is within the world of the story? or maybe they find theories compelling without regard for whether they allow us to predict the world of the story? If so, I struggle to imagine where that comes from since for me systematization is done with intent towards creating usefulness.

So that said, like the other magics I tend to take Gold Magic at face value and stop there, with meta ideas being limited to noting how it matches with the nearly-universal requirements of good stories. Powers often have costs just because it's a way to create challenge for dramatic tension. If the power lacks a drawback then the challenge in the story must come from something the power can't solve. Superman was explicitly referenced when Gold Magic was introduced, and superman, being the paragon of physical prowess, is then most strongly challenged by problems where physical force can't just instantly solve the crisis. Gold Magic provides a clever twist to that mechanic wherein the immune-to-physical-power challenge is inherent to the source of the power itself, rather than the wider plot having responsibility to provide such challenges to avoid trivializing the rest of the story. That's what makes Gold Magic an interestingly modular, working design for a story element regardless of what may have inspired the author to the design.

Could gold magic be a metaphor for an absent bread-winner parent? Sure, but it could just as easily not be. Could it be connected to dragon-hoard magic? Sure, but it could just as easily not be. Because unless I completely missed something, we could make tons of alternative metaphorical ideas. Like the demands making the gold permanently inaccessible as a resource could be a metaphor for the transience of investing wealth into improving the body as it ages, or it could just as easily not be. The requirements not to trust others to handle wealth could be a metaphorical exaggeration demonstrating how a person's respect for other people's property and in return, a person's trust in the character of others, is strained when a person has unsupervised access to the assets of someone who feels much richer. Or just as easily not. The transience of God Magic's power could be a metaphor for the religious trope that sin leads to short term gains but long term loss, or it could just as easily not be. Or a hundred other metaphorical ideas. So to me the only way any of these earn the /right/ to our head cannon's limited storage is if their competitors are excluded by future revelations of the story.

Anyway, I don't intend this to be an attack or judgement against your having the idea, and I hope you don't take it that way. Like, I know from your own story's explicit themes and author's notes that we think very differently. And that's fine; we're allowed. I'm just thinking out loud here to try to get closer to understanding where you get started from because I think there's value in being able to /correctly/ simulate other people's processes.
