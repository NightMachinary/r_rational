Hurm, I think your theory that gold magic represents "capitalism" and the wage slavery it imposes on the many makes perfect sense. It's not even subtle if you think about it. I suppose if the voice in his head ever starts screaming at him to literally impose 100% slavery on people, it'll have more than a small amount of merit.

While not explicitly in the text... it's a fair assumption that Aumann had slaves working hard to increase his personal wealth and power - it would be outrageously out of character if he didn't. The employees that appear onscreen are merely the inner upper crust of his organization - [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs][every pyramid scheme requires a few token examples of affluence]] to give false hope to those on the bottom of the system. And the loyalty of your military is priority #1, as it's the only thing that matters in these power systems.

I see this being rather depressing to explore, as it brings up facts like how [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcCxsLDma2o][the US constitution still allows slavery to this very day]], and how people are Perfectly Fine with this. Due to that, I do expect Joon will be dropping this skill sooner than later.

Or maybe we'll have a 50 page arc on how he really, really wants to cut wages and benefits for the frog people and starts bullying Grak into doing some contract work on the side... maybe start up a theme park in the locus's territory with doe rides and such... yeah, we need to move on to woodworking sooner than later.

Insane robot army made of wood, with value misalignment. That's way more fun.

Edit: I've changed my mind once the theme park idea occurred to me. A "Joon becomes a total asshole" arc will be great if it focuses on him monetizing his friends in stupid ways, and not so much on exploiting his peasants.
