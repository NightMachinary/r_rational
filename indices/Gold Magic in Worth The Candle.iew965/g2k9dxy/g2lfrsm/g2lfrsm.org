  the ability to fly
#+end_quote

Fun parallel: the /Flying Man/ in Earthbound is also a symbol of the absent father. He's a big protector man who you don't know very well, but who is willing to swoop in and protect/die for you. Why is he called the "Flying Man"? Well, besides the literal-layer stuff (he has an eagle head), Ness's father is always away travelling---flying. Ness only talks to him over the phone. And when he does, other than a little always-the-same patter about how he's proud of Ness, the main thing Ness's father does is throw money at him.

I think the fact that Gold Magic's flying ability is "implemented as" tactile telekinesis, is where the dissonance comes in: it's pretty obviously just a reference to /Mistborn's/ allomancy---the "burning" of metals to gain magic abilities. The two most common types of allowance in /Mistborn/ are burning Iron to become magnetically repulsive, and burning Iron to become magnetically attractive. Neither of these is "gold"; but gold /is/ still a metal, so it's kind of intuitive (if DM-Joon had read /Mistborn/, but not /recently/) to say "oh yeah, let's make 'gold' magic---a magic with metals, so like /Mistborn/, right? What-all did that magic system let you do again?" and then remember the Pushing/Pulling stuff before anything else.

  thematic undertone for blood magic
#+end_quote

Ever watched [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/469/Karin][Karin]]? The feat for blood magic is "hypertension", and you can heal people by transfusing blood into them. So assume the protagonist of this show is a prototype healer-build blood mage.

Ever watched [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/18153/Kyoukai_no_Kanata][Kyokai no Kanata]]? The Claret Spear is pretty literally the weapon of the female lead in this show; and the ability to /harm/ people by putting your blood inside them (whether you intend to or not) is one of the central conflicts. So assume the protagonist of /this/ show is a prototype combat-build blood mage.

Then just realize that they're both /high-level/ characters of their respective builds, so you need to invent some lower-tier abilities for the build to have. Maybe base them on monks---qigong meditation is essentially about purifying the blood to give yourself more stamina, right?

In both of the above presumed-sources, blood is thematically about 1. irrevocably connecting people whether they like it or not, with both potentially positive and negative consequences; 2. a symbolic barrier of inherent "incompatibility" between people that must be overcome. Both are good focus-points at the /start/ of a fellowship story---so blood magic is mostly going to see a lot of use in the beginning of a story set in a world where it exists, to explore those themes. Once characters /have/ been irrevocably connected and broken through any inherent incompatibilities, it's kind of irrelevant.
