I think the issue with gold magic as articulated in the chapter is that the source of the power (acquiring gold) has nothing to do with the conferred power (tactile telekinesis). With emotional magic, for example, the conferred powers are thematically related to strong emotions, like moving fast when you feel fear. To get access to other powers like revision magic, you have to revise away a year or do something similarly thematically connected. Tactile telekinesis is a cool thing, and gold acquisition is a cool thing, and you can come up with thematic resonances to other concepts for either. But they aren't themselves thematically connected, which is the issue.
