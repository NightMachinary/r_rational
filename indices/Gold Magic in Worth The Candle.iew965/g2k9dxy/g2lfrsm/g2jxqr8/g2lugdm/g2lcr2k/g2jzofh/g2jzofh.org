Great analysis here on Gold Magic, it really ties it all together well. My thoughts on Blood Magic though:

Blood Magic is about your place in the world and relationship to it. You draw power directly from yourself and your body (your blood) and shape it to affect your interactions with others and the world at large (through the usage of external spells) and as means of using this power/knowledge for altering yourself (through buff-related spells). The transfusion-esque applications (like the bloodline spell) are a recognition of social connections, with your decisions influencing the actions, abilities and capabilities of others.

Narratively, the fact that the first magic Juniper learns, after entering a world directly patched together from his own ideas, is a reflection of the strength of recognising your influence over the world reinforces Juniper's burgeoning understanding of the scope of the story as a whole, and his place in it. Blood Magic becomes less a focus as the story progresses, as his understanding and interactions shift from "being the lever that moves the world" to being an actor on a stage, so to speak, both in terms of how much of his path is laid out in front of him by the DM, and in terms of how many other actors are on this proverbial stage (all the different beings and organisations of power and influence). Whilst Juniper can still exert his influence over events, there are constraints and boundaries imposed by how others will both act and react.

All that said, most of that thinking came from sitting around waiting for my dinner to finish up in the oven for ~15 minutes, so I've focused on fitting things together rather than poking holes in it to properly test this theory. Right now, it seems a little suspiciously tidy for me to wholeheartedly support what I've written out, but my food's waiting so I'll stop here.

(Also something something food for thought)
