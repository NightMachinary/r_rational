Second of all, I acknowledge your food for thought pun.

First of all, I do quite like the thought of blood magic being about centering the self in a world, and being more narrative than in-universe emotional. It's weird that Juniper learns it quickly, and then it's.. not thrown away, exactly, but it's just sort of background noise from then on. And that being narratively linked to how he's not just fighting his way through a hostile world anymore, and more trying to shape a world that's already tamed, is interesting.
