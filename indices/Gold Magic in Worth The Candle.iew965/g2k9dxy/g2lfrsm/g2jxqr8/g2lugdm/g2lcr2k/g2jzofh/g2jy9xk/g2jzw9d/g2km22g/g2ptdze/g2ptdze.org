  To a young kid, it can often be confusing to have one or both of your parents missing for big chunks of every day. ... Even if you're in a single-provider home, where it's probably your dad going off to work and taking business trips, it creates this feeling of cold aloofness that seriously harms your ability to make a connection with that person.

  The call of the gold is, metaphorically, the job. But not just that, it's prioritizing the job over your family, which we see Juniper do almost right away. ... And if you ever ignore the call of the gold?

As the father of a 3 year old, this hits hard. My son definitely doesn't understand why I choose to/have to be gone all day. I love coming home for lunch and spending some time with him before he goes down for his afternoon rest, but he wishes I could stay with him all day. He goes to bed at 8 pm, which leaves only a few short hours of the day for time with Dad.

One piece of advice I'll give to other parents out there that my father gave to me: Most kids will not miss you as much in the morning as they will in the evening. A bleary "Good morning, I love you, got to go!", or shared hustle as you all go through the motions to get ready for the day is only confusing when they want you to stay home and spend time with them. Instead, if at all possible, get to the shop at 6 or 7am so you can be home when school is out/rest is done. That is far better than working 9-5, splitting time with your kids to an hour in the morning and 2 hours, one of which gets taken up by dinner and a half hour of which is putting them to bed, in the evening.
