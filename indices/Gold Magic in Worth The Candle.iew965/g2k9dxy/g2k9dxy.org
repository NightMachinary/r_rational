I love the ideas people have here, so here's my two cents!

A - Ultra Wealth.

and

B - Sunken Costs.

A represents the endless acquisition of wealth. You don't need to have this ludicrous amount of gold. You could probably spend it better then on Gold Magic in most situations, just hire an army or purchase some personal entads with your literal tons of gold. By leaving it unspent, and just as importantly denying others access to it, you warp the world around you and gain direct personal power.

B, on the other hand, is the one I consider most likely, because /in for a penny, in for a pound/ is a literal description of how Gold Magic works. You can't tread water with Gold Magic. You either give up the power you have, or go to ever greater lengths to hold on to it. The longer you maintain your magic, the more your power and wealth grows, the more you have to lose when it ends. The more you listen to the voice telling you to do whatever extreme actions it demands, the more you've already paid for this power and wealth, the greater the sunk cost and the more willing you are to go further next time. Becoming a Gold Mage itself is a sunk cost: You can only do it once. Gold Magic is digging yourself in ever deeper rather then taking the loss.

The path of a successful Gold Mage ends one of two ways: The willing surrender of all that power, or tragedy.

Related, the Skill for Gold Magic doesn't correlate to the raw power of the gold mage. We don't know what the actual skill does, only it involves dealing with gold magic rather then directly being it. Does it represent the ability to resist the voice, to balance on that knifes edge to minimise the increase and needs? Or is it the other way, unlocking new possibilities without actually helping with the escalating costs you pay?

I think a possible reason the powers of Gold Magic don't look as detailed or thematically tied as the others of Aerb is because its a waste to give something more nuanced to Gold magic: The core interest of Gold Magic is the treadmill it puts you on and its inevitable loss.
