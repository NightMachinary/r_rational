I do, actually! I've watched the first season on Netflix, but honestly I've found it fairly rational so far barring the photosynthesis technobabble. Sidonia improves its arsenal over the series with the introduction of Core Penetration Rounds, and even before that had appropriately-scaled weaponry with the Heavy Mass Cannon (despite apparently only having one, which is a bit weird) and the Interplanetary Missile.

EDIT: Even some of the series' tropes are well-justified - for example, the protagonist's mech (referred to as a Guardian in-universe) is a museum piece but out performs modern mechs because they are designed for ease of use rather than performance - he was trained on the now-outdated control system, so he can get more out of it than his peers. Similarly the newer Guardians are optimised for fighting Gauna so they don't have features that his does, like the anti-haugis coating that was unnecessary until the Gauna evolved.
