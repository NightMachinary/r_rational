I like the anime well enough (it's got a cool setting and atmosphere but suffers from a boring-mc-with-harem setup) but it's never struck me as especially rational by sci-fi standards.

edit: also the background conspiracy plot of season 2 feels pretty typical of /non/-rational fiction to me - ie emphasizing coolness and drama and not worrying too much about logic.
