The Immortal Committee is a danger to the captain's ambition of wiping out the gauna altogether in the LEM system.

Also, every second they're alive is every second they could gather information on Nagate Tanikaze, who unlike them, is a natural immortal, and could propagate immortality to his children. That's a threat to the power structure.

That being said, I don't think they did a particularly good job of explaining and showing how the immortal committee is a threat to Sidonia or why they chose to act the way they do.
