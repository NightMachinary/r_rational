I'm seriously contempting helping Tarol for [[http://alexanderwales.com/shadows/][Goblins]] as well, but decided on a wait-and-see to see if he is really back on his feet after last year before helping out. If he keeps his current pace up, then I'll probably support him in a month or two.

I give a dollar or two to all of these awesome creators. Everyone else, I only buy their merch. ;)
