Brianna Wu: her patreon proceeds help fund a person to deal with harassment.

Zoe Quinn: because she amuses me on twitter.

Rebecca Watson: I enjoy the videos she produces.

Kory Bing: a webcomic artist for a comic I read.

Vals NoisyToys: a streamer on Twitch that I watch a lot. She isn't a Twitch partner, so I can't subscribe to her there. (I also subscribe to Hafu and Sheever on Twitch.)
