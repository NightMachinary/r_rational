You are not citing sources, so it looks exactly as if you were making a baseless accusation. You're not even specifying which relationship you're talking about.

Being a woman in public is controversial. Hillary Clinton got badgered about how she could balance being a grandmother with being President during the last election, for instance, an issue that no male candidate has ever had to deal with. So just saying she's a controversial figure tells me nothing.
