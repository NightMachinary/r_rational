I mean it's pretty obvious which relationship it is? There's one thing that made Zoe Quinn really famous.

I'm not going to rehash the entire thing here. [[https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2014/11/17/zoe-quinn-is-an-abuser/][Ozy has a summary]].

Well, it should tell you people who express disapproval of your patreon support are not "just jealous because [Zoe]'s a cyborg and [they] aren't".
