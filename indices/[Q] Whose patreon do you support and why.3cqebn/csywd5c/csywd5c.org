I have a few small-amount patronages (total ~$10/month), and will probably add several more when I have more cash to spare. (Shadows of the Limelight/Alexander Wales and Alicorn come to mind.)

[[http://leftoversoup.com/archive.php?num=539][Leftover Soup]]/[[https://www.patreon.com/tailsteak][Tailsteak]], because it's a silly but very thoughtful comic on subjects near to my heart (random page chosen to be fairly representative).

[[http://stefangagne.com/floatingpoint][Floating Point]]/[[https://www.patreon.com/stefangagne][Stefan "Twoflower" Gagne]]: I loved City of Angles, and have been loving Floating Point so far. Not rationalist, but rational and well-written; uses the 'information and planning beat strength' aspect consistently.

[[http://thealexandrian.net/][The Alexandrian]]/[[https://www.patreon.com/justinalexander][Justin Alexander]]: Interesting thoughts on roleplaying games, Shakespeare, and occasionally politics, Russian theater, and random SF fandoms. This one I supported chiefly because the minimum donation was low, and there seemed like a very good chance that small amounts of funding would have noticeable effects. I'd recommend the blog to anyone where the topics sounds interesting, but wouldn't recommend sending another marginal dollar per post his way to someone with the same level as enjoyment as me.
