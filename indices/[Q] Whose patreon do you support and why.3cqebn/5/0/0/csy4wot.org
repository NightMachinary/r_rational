Nothing quite the same, but there are comics and bloggers that I would consider supporting if they were asking.

I've come close to adding Shamus Young to my list, and might well do if he shifts back towards long-form text posts rather than the videos that I don't actually watch (as he has suggested he might)

It's also possible that there are people I read who /do/ have a Patreon and have just hidden it well. Or there's odd cases like ViHart who has a Patreon /solely/ supporting videos where she counts down from the donation amount alongside a microwave timer, but says that her other projects are already sufficiently supported.

Oh, and thinking further... I may also have a previously unmentioned "under-funded" criterion; I look at the CGP Grey Patreon and he already has nearly $15k per video pledged and that seems like quite a lot so I don't feel too bad for not adding another $1
