Wildbow, because I love his stuff and he writes so very much of it so consistently... almost single-handedly keeps me supplied with reading material, and if he were publishing in the traditional way I'd be buying a book every few months. So it only seems fair to slip him a few dollars on a regular basis.

Haven't yet found anyone else with quite that same combination of prolific, consistent, high quality, and "has a patreon".
