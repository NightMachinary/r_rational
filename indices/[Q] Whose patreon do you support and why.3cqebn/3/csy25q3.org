Where applicable, links are to the first post/chapter/etc to encourage clickthroughs.

[[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]] - good story, supporting in the hopes it encourages quicker/consistent updates.

[[http://leftoversoup.com/first.php][Leftover Soup]] - It's a slice of life webcomic that brings up some interesting points of view. Doesn't meet the criteria for rational fiction, but quite enjoyable.

[[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2014/12/24/taking-root-1-1/][Twig]] - Wildbow's latest serial. Currently, I'm not enjoying it nearly as much as Worm or Pact. I enjoyed the tension overload from Pact and certain arcs of Worm, and I'm hoping later arcs of Twig can ratchet it up a bit. Plus, for me the monster of the week thing isn't as entertaining as the more focused arcs from the other two.

[[http://loadingreadyrun.com/][LoadingReadyRun]] - Canadian sketch comedy at its finest. There may be better sources of news, but they don't have those hats.
