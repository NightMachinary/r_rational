Here's one big question I've had about Patreon:

How much of a cut is taken by Patreon & Paypal? I've heard that Paypal & credit card fees are pretty steep when you only send 1$. I fear that donating $1 per month would compound that, so I've always used lump-sum paypal donations where applicable. Are there any "sellers" who can shed light?
