Thanks, that's quite helpful. The fixed $0.05 is not as bad as I thought.

So, to donate $12 to a single artist through Patreon via paypal puts $10.20 into their account, spread over a year. To donate via a lump paypal donation puts 11.35 into their account. That's fairly reasonable, considering that Patreon is essentially offering an online store service. For comparison, Bandcamp charges 10-15% including transaction fees.
