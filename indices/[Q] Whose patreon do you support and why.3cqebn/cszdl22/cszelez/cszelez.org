Patreon's cut is 5%, with Paypal taking another 5% + $0.05 per transaction. So that dollar a month, if transferred through Paypal would amount to $0.85 for the author. Patreon does bulk processing in order to lower costs, so if you're giving $1 to two artists, the $0.05 fee only occurs once (and each would effectively be getting $0.875 instead).

Stripe has higher transaction fees than Paypal, but takes a lower percent of the total. I think the breakeven point between the two is around $8.
