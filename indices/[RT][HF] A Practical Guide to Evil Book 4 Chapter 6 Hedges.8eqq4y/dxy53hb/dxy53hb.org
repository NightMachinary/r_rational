Hmmm... absolute positioning, the ability to Scry on anyone, and the ability to open up portals?

Is Cat about to introduce /Scry and Die/ tactics to her world? Spot a target, teleport/portal in, assassinate, escape.

I'm wondering if it's possible to find the exact location of a Hero by having multiple people scan simultaneously at areas a set distance apart from each other. If the "Scry block" is a set size and not some nebulous changing area, then it is possible to target them using a bit of simple geometry. Find the radius of the sphere and the center is the Hero.
