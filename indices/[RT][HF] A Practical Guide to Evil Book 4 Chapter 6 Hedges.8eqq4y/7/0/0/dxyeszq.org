What if Masego can open portals through something less "occupied" than Arcadia? I wouldn't want to bet against his ability to perform a rods from god orbital strike or back of the head "bang" through a portal or (the only non warlock based guess) as GeJO mentioned above just peeling some of the crust of the planet off with "absolute positioning" and extrapolating from things we've seen Warlock do.
