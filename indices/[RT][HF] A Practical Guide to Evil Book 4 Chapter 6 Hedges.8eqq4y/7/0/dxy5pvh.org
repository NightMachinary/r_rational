Warlock mentioned making an array for mapping out the zone where Bumbling Conjurer tried to block his scrying, so you don't need a few people for that. Though I wonder, whether Catherine has mages good enough for that, aside from Masego. Tracking a blocked area is how Warlock found the White Knight in Nicae, though the shapes and timing of the blokcing may well be irregular: scrying isn't exactly unknown, just not practiced widely.

Scry and Die isn't instantaneous in the Guideverse, which means the target would have to stay immobile for days or weeks, not to mention heroes being more likely to find a way to get into Arcadia, or just happen to be on the other side of the portal in time.
