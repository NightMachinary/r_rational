I'm never quite sure how I feel about this story. I do like that it's a pretty tough Peggy Sue scenario, but it feels like the story loses the plot from time to time. If the author isn't completely sick of messing with it when they're finished, some pretty sizable re-writing could probably turn it into some decent mil-history fiction.

I just wish that all the women weren't so thirst for Harris's cock.
