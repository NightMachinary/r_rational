Thank you!

Sirius always seemed to me to be on the knife's edge anyway. Remember, it's canon that he almost got Snape eaten by a werewolf.

As for Filius, I tried to convey that Tom doesn't exactly look like a budding dark lord at the moment. He's got some issues, and an older Filius probably would have dealt with those issues differently, but the Filius that we're seeing here is almost fifty years younger than the one that we're introduced to when Harry goes to Hogwarts.
