My suspension of disbelief is a put out by how easily most of these people cede their morals to Tom Riddle, but I can see the effort that was made to justify them (Sirius being a burgeoning fanatic with a recently dead friend's murderer in front of him, Flitwick having tunnel vision of dueling glory, etc.)

Ah, well. In general it was very enjoyable and well put together. I like the pace and points of view the story is being told from so far... glad it was posted here.
