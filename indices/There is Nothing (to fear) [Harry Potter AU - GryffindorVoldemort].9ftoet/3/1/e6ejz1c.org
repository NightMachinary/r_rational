I did write a [Ravenclaw!Tom Riddle fic] a few years ago, but I have to warn you that it isn't up to the caliber of my present work.

You /have/ gotten me thinking on about trying my hand at it again, but that won't be for a long time (there's another story that I want to work on once my GRiddle Fic is complete). For now I'll just say that Riddleclaw is going to have a very interesting study club.
