I like this. Voldemort-in-different-houses is my favorite genre of HP fanfic, though I've only read one other. I forget the name, but it was about a Voldemort that was sorted into Hufflepuff, and so focused far more on self-improvement and leadership then he did on plotting, cunning or blood purity, and ended up having a much easier time gaining power because of it.

A Voldemort in Gryffindor, and once I finish this, all I'll need to do is find a Ravenclaw!Voldemort fic to complete my collection :)
