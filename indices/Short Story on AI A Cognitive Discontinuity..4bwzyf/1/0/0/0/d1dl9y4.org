  But the DNN/CNN fad is mostly due to Alexnet.

Specifically, due to Alexnet significantly outperforming all previous non-NN based approaches to object recognition, which was quickly followed by DNNs and RNNs achieving similar breakthroughs in most other ML fields. At what point is it no longer a "fad"? Most people opposed to deep learning (or neural nets in general) seem to me to be statisticians personally offended that the best performing models don't have as proven and obvious a mathematical grounding as they would like.
