Ahh, that seems a bit at-odds with your zeerust statement because I imagine a future where we understand /why/ RNN's work well to look pretty similar to the situation described. There's still room for an unexplained layer/module and training would still look pretty similar.

That mess up my model of what you were claiming with the multi-information, I think.
