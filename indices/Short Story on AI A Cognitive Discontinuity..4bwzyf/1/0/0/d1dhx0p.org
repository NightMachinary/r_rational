Dang, and I just spent time learning how to use Caffe this past while.

But the DNN/CNN fad is mostly due to Alexnet.

But you're right, I /should/ try implementing multi-information as an objective function for an existing framework, and seeing if I can get good unsupervised learning results that way. I'd been planning to do a marginal likelihood function proportional to multi-info for use with probablistic program learning. And also just measuring the multi-info content of existing CNN/DNN models.
