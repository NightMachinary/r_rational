I suspect that a big chunk of the current NN fad is related to tensorflow. That is, writing NN code is a lot easier then it was like 4 months ago.

But the nice thing about tensorflow is that it can be used /alright/ as a somewhat-generic math lib that runs on GPU.

If you think that the multi-information approach is a lot better you could get a lot of prestige by making it work with tensorflow. Well, alongside a decent demo.
