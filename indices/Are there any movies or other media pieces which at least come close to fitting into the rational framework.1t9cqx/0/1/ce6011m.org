I'd just like to add that Primer is fantastic but very obtuse. I wouldn't recommend watching it with the sort of people that talk through films... you need to concentrate.

After you've seen it two or three times (it takes at least that many to have any idea wtf is going on), try it with the audio commentary from [[http://qntm.org/primer]] ... NB Please don't read the summary on that page before watching the film, you'd be spoiling a real treat.
