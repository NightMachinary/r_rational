*Catch Me If You Can* - The main character uses outside the box thinking and creative problem solving throughout the film. And it's based on a true story.

*Watchmen* (a graphic novel/film) might also be interesting for its depiction of utilitarianism and different moral philosophies. Most of the story doesn't really follow rational characters though. And I don't think Dr. Manhattan was very believable as a superhuman intelligence, especially the "we're all miracles" bit was quite a letdown.
