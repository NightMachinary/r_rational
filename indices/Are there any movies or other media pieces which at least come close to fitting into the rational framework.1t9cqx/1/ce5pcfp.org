*Twelve Angry Men* uses a bunch of "rationalist" techniques as one man tries to convince the rest of the jury the defendant is innocent.

*Mr. Smith Goes to Washington* might fit too.

I want to list a few detective movies, but too often they succumb to stupidity for the sake of drama, so they don't qualify.
