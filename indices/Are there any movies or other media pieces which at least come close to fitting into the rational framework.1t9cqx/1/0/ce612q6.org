  Twelve Angry Men uses a bunch of "rationalist" techniques as one man tries to convince the rest of the jury the defendant is innocent.

If I remember it correctly, at first he wasn't even trying to convince them he's innocent, he was only trying to investigate the case without making any definite conclusions. Only later it became clear that he's most likely innocent.

Anyway, good catch.

edit. In the same vein, *Paths of Glory* might count too.
