I would have found Dr. Manhattan's portrayal more believable if it hadn't already been a long time since he was human. A pushover nebbish physicist who gets autistically fascinated by atoms but thinks people are hugely complex and improbable is... well, relatively common in academia.

People who haven't taken courses in evolution and learning theory often think our existence is wildly improbable, because they don't understand that evolution over 3.5 billion years is actually a fairly powerful optimizer able to hit small targets (like us).
