Our Off-Topic threads aren't exactly overflowing. If we really are the nucleus of the diaspora, that would imply there isn't much demand for that discussion. To provide anecdotal evidence, /I'm/ not interested in having that discussion, which is why I'm /here/ instead of on [[/r/lesswrong][r/lesswrong]]. I can't speak for everyone, but I think we're here because we want to discuss rational fiction, not because we want to be a community hub. The failure of another board does not obligate us to dilute our subject matter.
