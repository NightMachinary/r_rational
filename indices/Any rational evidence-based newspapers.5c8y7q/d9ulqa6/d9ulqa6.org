Dude, that's like expecting Chinese factories to be OSHA-compliant. Use your own judgement. Subscribe to the most despicable propaganda newspapers you can find on either side, as to not underestimate any one view. (This bears repeating: use your own brain, but never trust it.)

I don't recommend starting your own. What you consider rational evidence is probably not what the other side does, [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/gw/politics_is_the_mindkiller/][and politics will make any good intentions irrelevant.]]
