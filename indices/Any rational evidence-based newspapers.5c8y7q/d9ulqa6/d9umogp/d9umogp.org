Not everything that a newspaper reports on is political though. Also, not every news article has to be an opinion piece. This is /news/ we're talking about. There are real situations with real fairly objective truths about them which can be reported on fairly. The truth isn't determined by sides or the number of people who believe that it is true. As long as they back up their claims well and cite their sources and actually prioritize /truth/ over /persuasion/ or /number of viewers/ then a rational-evidence based newspaper should be doable.
