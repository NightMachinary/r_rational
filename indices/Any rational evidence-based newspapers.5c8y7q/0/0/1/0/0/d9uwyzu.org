[[/r/lesswrong][r/lesswrong]] didn't die by sheer random chance, it died because people chose not to post on it. The strength of the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] subreddit is in its narrow focus on a subject people actually want to discuss. If you fill it up with a whole bunch of barely-connected links about things like control groups, audiobooks, new blogs, and FAI, it loses that strength. We come here to read about rational fiction, therefore we are not dead, capisce?
