it's not just the number of people, it's that there are literally NO VIABLE ALTERNATIVES. Less Wrong is dead. The lesswrong subreddit is dead. The reason that more people aren't posting here could very well be because they either A) left before the monday general rationality thread was first started, or B) Mondays are not a convenient time for them to talk on here, or C) they recognized that the moderators don't actually want them to talk about general rationality stuff on this subreddit, and that they only reluctantly started the monday general rationality threads, and so they gave it up as a lost cause.
