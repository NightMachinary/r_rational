it's not a matter of importance, it's a matter of unimportance. recent events have set my priorities straight. If i had to wait until monday, I might have forgotten, and then I would have had to wait an entire two weeks before I could post about this, and it is something that I needed to ask about at some point because it is something I am considering pursuing work in. That, and it didn't occur to me that posting it now would be a problem until /after/ I posted it. Probably part of the reason for that is that this subreddit isn't just a fiction subreddit, despite the moderators' attempts to turn it back into one. The only alternatives to this subreddit that I know of are SlateStarCodex and WaitButWhy. Unfortunately, neither of those are the online hub of the rationalist community, this subreddit is. Denying that only hurts our community, and likely drives people away. The rational fiction subreddit used to be more active. The HPMOR subreddit now has about twice the number of subscribers as this subreddit. But not everyone is an HPMOR fan. SlateStarCodex and WaitButWhy are each communities centered around only a single specific blog writer, Scott Alexander and Tim Urban respectively, and therefore are too limited in their scope to function as an online rationalist community hub, like this subreddit /already is/. If the moderators want to take down this thread they can go ahead and do it. But if they do, I will kindly remind them that there are no sufficient alternatives. If they take it down here, I will have to post it on Slate Star Codex or on Wait But Why, and it will be barely on topic if at all there as well, and in the case of SSC, only being allowed to be posted on certain days of the week. I'm not sure if I even can post this on wait but why or its subreddit, because ive never seen an open thread where people can post about anything on Wait But Why.

The only difference here between Slate Star Codex/Wait But Why and this subreddit, is that other rationalists will be more likely to see what I post here, and they won't be as likely to see it if I posted elsewhere.
