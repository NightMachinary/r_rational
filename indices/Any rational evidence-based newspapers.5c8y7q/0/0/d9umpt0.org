you know that subreddit is dead, right? whether you like it or not, regardless of the reasons for it, the fact is that this subreddit has become the main online hub of the rationalist community. there is no other more appropriate subreddit where I can post about this where it is on-topic and where people are likely to see it and respond to it, and it is ridiculous to prevent rationalists from posting about non-fictional rationality-related things in the main online hub of the rationalist community except on /one day of the week/. If you want this subreddit to be /only/ for rational fiction, either try to revive Less Wrong or create something to replace it and then get rid of the monday general rationality thread.
