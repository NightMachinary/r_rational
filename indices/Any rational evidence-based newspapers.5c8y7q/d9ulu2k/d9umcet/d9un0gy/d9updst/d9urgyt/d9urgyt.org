Because it will be a full-time job to do something like this and I think one would need to have a company behind this paper to get anywhere beyond a tiny audience. But let's say you can find people who fulfill the criteria you desired and not go broke for the first few months. The main issue in my mind isn't starting it, but rather sustaining it.

Newspapers depend on attracting people and keeping them which is why they use sensationalist headlines and so often misreport so much information by tossing out any complicated details or twisting arguments to their side. Many of them depend on writing articles /fast/. Which is why many articles read as if the journalist is only supporting one side of the argument. It's easy to write for the side one supports.

Not only would the rationalist writers have to be careful to remain unbiased and write quickly, they also have to make their articles at least as interesting as the other papers.

Something like this.....it's like trying to build a Friendly AI when everyone else is focused on just getting an AI at all. You need a newspaper at least as good as others (a difficult task in the first place) /plus/ making it rationalist.

It would be a lifetime goal if you want to be able to accomplish it.
