Oh :o\\
I am too (half)! Let me adjust my argument: it only seems easy to you because you're European! And, well, maybe English is a little easier since it's a more of a mix of languages than French, and when languages mix they get simpler.

BUT! Not to the point that it makes a difference to a magitech translator that decoded English in seconds.
