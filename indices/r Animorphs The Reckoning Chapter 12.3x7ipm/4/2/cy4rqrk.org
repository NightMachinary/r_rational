Translation magitech that works in seconds isn't going to get even slightly confused by conjugations!\\
Conjugations are in every language:

To be, I am, you are, he is, they/we/you(plural) are.\\
Freeze, froze, frozen.\\
Swear, swore, sworn.\\
I'm sure a few more sets of conjugations wouldn't change much.

And, the only reason (the existence of) English sentence structure seems easy to understand to you is that you already know English!
