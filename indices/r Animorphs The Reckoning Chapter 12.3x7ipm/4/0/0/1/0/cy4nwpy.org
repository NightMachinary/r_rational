Could the translator work by translating meaning directly from the minds of people Ax talks to, rather than the words themselves? Given that thoughtspeak seems at least vaguely functional, albeit with side effects, it seems vaguely plausible that Andalite technology could allow that. So it would allow him to speak, but not to say read in the language.
