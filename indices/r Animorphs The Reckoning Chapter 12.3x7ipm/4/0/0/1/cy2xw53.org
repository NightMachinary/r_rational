Hmmm. This may be worth a retweak---you've explicitly stated some things that were bothering me beneath the surface.

I should note that work's been crazy, and I had to pull a work-related all-nighter Tuesday when I should have been writing this, so things are somewhat rushed and not as polished as I'd like (I've said this three updates in a row, I think). So I wouldn't mind a general rework anyway, and this could be folded into it.
