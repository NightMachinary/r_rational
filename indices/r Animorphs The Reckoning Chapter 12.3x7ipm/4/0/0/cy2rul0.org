If it works like in canon, and what Ax says suggests it does, then it actually builds the database from listening to their conversations. Like, self-improving Google Translate that can integrate new languages. The thing is, the time-frame suggested is "listen to a few sentences, then you understand the structure so you get what they say", when it should take hours at least for the translator to even have an idea what is an English noun and what is a verb (even though English is a pretty simple language). I mean, look at this comment section. How many different words do you see ? For each of them, Ax would need the humans to say those words several time in different contexts before he could have an idea what their meaning is, which is pretty unlikely since they don't know anything about him and he can't communicate to them.

Hence, magitech.
