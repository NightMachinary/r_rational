The thing is, "think harder" is not exactly a solution to realistic combat problems. Worm and Pact from Wildbow do it a lot, and sometimes the result is a very powerful scene (Echidna versus Skitter, Defiant and Dragon arresting Skitter), but on the whole I feel it cheapens the tension (the whole S9000 arc feels a lot less desperate when you know that, no matter how bad things get, Skitter is just going to pull a last minute trick that solves everything). I'm glad Twigs relies on it less. On the one hand, you still have enemies like Sub Rose defeated with a secret /don't tell the audience/ plan, on the other hand you have situations like the ghost thing where their solution is to shoot the mastermind in the face (sort of).
