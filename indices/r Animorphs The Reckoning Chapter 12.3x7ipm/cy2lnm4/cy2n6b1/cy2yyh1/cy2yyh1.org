Interesting. In comparison, another rationalist author (Velorien) has stated: "My approach to writing [Lighting Up the Dark (a rationalist Naruto fanfiction)] battle scenes is 'here is the challenge; how would Naruto respond to it?' If I can't find an answer that doesn't result in a Total Party Kill, I don't lower the challenge. I just think harder until I come up with something."

I suppose that's mostly a difference in tone between the two underlying stories; Naruto is a typical shonen anime and Velorien's work reflects that, while Animorphs has a recurring theme of "war is hell", which you seem to be keeping. (I guess? I haven't read your story because I prefer lighter stories.)
