Lightsaber; Death Star.

The Animorphs are also leveled up pretty hard. Invincible bodies, explicit subsuperpowers (Jake's intuitive cognitive modeling, for instance), having the cube from the beginning, several additional hacks whose foundation is public but which people haven't tumbled to, yet. What we're primed for is not an easy Yeerk victory; it's a general bloodbath. The kind of chess match where nobody takes pieces at all until the board is so thoroughly mixed that when it finally tips, things don't stop happening until all that's left is three pawns, a bishop, a queen, and two kings.

Plus, don't forget that Andalites are starting out near their canon portrayal, but are quick learners---a SINGLE STRATEGIST revolutionized the whole military, which isn't that crazy from the perspective of one-guy-saw-a-better-way, but IS pretty remarkable from the perspective of everybody-sat-up-and-listened.

Plus don't forget [REDACTED]. That's going to matter a lot, eventually.
