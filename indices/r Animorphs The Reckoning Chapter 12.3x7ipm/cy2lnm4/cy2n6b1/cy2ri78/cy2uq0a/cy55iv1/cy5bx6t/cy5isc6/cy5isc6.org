Oh, believe me, I'm extremely excited to see it. If this is the opening gambit, I think The Reckoning is going to make Game of Thrones look tame. I just can't wait to see the level of mess and carnage that happens when a hyper-lethal battle occurs and even the author /genuinely does not know who will win./

...Oh. "The Reckoning". I think I see why that's the title now. This is going to be the best story ever.
