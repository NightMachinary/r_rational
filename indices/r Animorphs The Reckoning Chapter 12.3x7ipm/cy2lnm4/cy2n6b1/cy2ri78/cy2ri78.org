You gave yourself a pretty big challenge, then. Because starting with the yeerks being competently lead *AND* opening the war like you said they did *AND* having foolproof hologram technology *AND* a orbital-bombing-proof forcefield *AND* biofilters *AND* space jets good enough to blockade a planet with a fleet of four *AND* Earth being Class 5 *AND* the Andalite military being close to their canon portrayal... are you sure you want the protagonists to win ? Because the only thing that could make the situation worse (outside of the yeerks having even more technology) would be Visser being savvy enough to start his invasion in India.

I mean, I guess you're trying to steelman the yeerks, and I'm making a lot of assumptions here, but they look kind of invincible here. Worst case scenario for them : the Andalites discover them and glass the planet while they're on it. Second worst case scenario : the locals discover them early, fight back successfully, start reverse-engineering yeerk tech, the yeerk leave and glass the planet just to be safe. At this point I would say the only thing that can save Earth is either a really good plan involving the Chey (a good step 1 would be "go to the military, and ask them to provide a plan") or my own organisation, provided the YPM has or will have an equivalent in this continuity.
