If you had to put it down at chapter two, you definitely don't want to read (e.g.) chapters 3, 4, 8, or 10. You'll probably be happier dropping it.

I really, really, really want the protagonists to get their feet under them, and win (I have a goal of writing a happy ending), but I've committed to realism/rationalism first, and if I can't find a way to solve a problem, I just let the problem win. Some of the tragedies thus far were "accidental" in this way---I didn't intend for them to happen, as an author, but couldn't think of a believable way to avoid them.
