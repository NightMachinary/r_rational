Base 60 is derived from the same reasoning we use base 60 for time. It's very easy to divide.

Divisors of 7 are 1 and 7.

Divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10.

Divisors of 60 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60.

If the Babylonians didn't know about fractions and decimals (technically sexagidecimals), being able to divide easily is more convenient than having a reduced symbol set.
