Very good. Interesting to see the expansion of the andalites mental capabilities, and the fact that they dont innately work with humans is nice.

Seeing Ax's thought process was a good intro to the character without being too infodumpy.

I didn't realise at first this was happening concurrently with the yeerk pool chapter, but that may just be because its a while since I read them.

[[#s][Speculation:]]

The fact that the ear implants can also remove yeerks from an already infested person is interesting, I dont think there was any way to do so in canon. Seems like a totally sensible invention for the andalites to have, and removes any tiresome waiting periods.
