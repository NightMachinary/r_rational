Yesssss, new chapter!

In canon it was Visser One (not Three) that discovered humanity's potential for infection (class five species), leading to her promotion. Is that an intentional divergence? I guess Ax might not know that.

What are Narahans again? Were they the first species yeerks infected on their homeworld?

How come Elfangor could thought-speak to humans but Ax couldn't?

Interesting that Tobias is the first Animorph Ax meets since they're the closest in canon.

edit: PS: when Animorphs came out there were only about 5 billion humans, not 7.

edit2: Weaponized yeerk-siezures by directly thought-speaking to them?
