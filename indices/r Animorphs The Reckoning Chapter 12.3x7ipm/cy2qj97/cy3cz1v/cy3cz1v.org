While I agree with the general thrust of what you're saying (language is magitech) I disagree with your analysis that English would be easier than french/latin/German.

The structure you identify in the other languages at least exists; in English you have the much less useful scenario where one word may in fact turn out to be 6 different words, depending entirely upon context and the words around it.

So, if you scan a basic book of grammar rules and then scan active conversations, you're likely to learn a lot more than you would with a less structured language like English.

If you don't take the first step, it might be slightly harder to learn the base words, but will still be easier to learn the grammatical rules than in a language like English where they're only loosely followed and always have exceptions.
