Yaaay awesome !!

It seems that Ax is now regretting not paying attention in his "Alien first contact" classes. Truly, the Animorphs multiverse would be a different place if he weren't such a blue-alien-female-centaurizer during his high school years.

Hoorray for base seven. Wait, why not base 14 ?

I like how the first Visser chapter has Alloran going "Who could be stupid enough to completely abandon the advantage of surprise for no benefit at all ?" And then Ax goes and takes out three controllers for not reason. Okay, he knew the surprise was lost anyway, but still. Dangerous.

So, Andalite translation magitech is a thing ? Even in Andalite Chronicles, I thought it was odd, especially if we assume it works with languages harder than English, like French, Deutch or Latin. Like, look at French. You have a straightforward Subjet-Verb-Complement structure at the core, then you add stuff on top. Except you'd need a lot of time to figure that out, because each verb has six forms (for the indicative present tense alone, we're not talking about past or future or conditional here), which are pretty close for some verb families (je mange, tu manges, il mange, nous mangeons, vous mangez, ils mangent) and completely different for others (je suis, tu es, il est, nous sommes, vous Ãªtes, il sont), so you'd need to hear a lot of people using the same verb in different contexts to figure out it's different variations of the same word dependent on its context. Latin is even worse, with no sentence structure and a billion different forms for /nouns/, let alone verbs. and that's not accounting for complicated sentence structures and colloquialisms. So I guess the moral is we're lucky Ax didn't land in France, or less it would have taken him weeks to make his translator work. (okay, probably just a few hours, if he can get the humans to read a dictionary)
