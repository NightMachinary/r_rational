I'm going to sign up for patreon since it seems like a critical mass of fiction and webcomic writers that I like seem to be using it.

However, I searched patreon last night for "rational fiction" and "rational" without results. I know alexanderwales is also on patreon, but I can't remember if there are other community members I should support. Is there a tag I should be searching for, or is it that hard to find people to give money to?
