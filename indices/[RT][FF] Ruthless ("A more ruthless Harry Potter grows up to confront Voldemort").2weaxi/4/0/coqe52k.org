Yeah, Theo really drew the short end of the deal here, first Harry gets the girl and then he gets to make decisions on who bones who, and who gets kids first. On the bright side Harry seems like a person who isn't bothered by the day to day workings of a human life, so at least Theo and Hermione can be a normal-ish couple most of the time.
