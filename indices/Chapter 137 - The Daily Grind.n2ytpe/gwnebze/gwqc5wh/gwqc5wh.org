The +1 Basement gem is a very effective force multiplier, in that it takes the entire suite of green gem effects applied to a building and says "These effects now also apply to /this additional space large enough to house a family/". You can't stack an infinite number of basements onto a fully greened location without running into access issues, but it's still pretty strong.

You do, however, still need a whole curated host of other green gems to meet the rest of Maslow's hierarchy of needs before you start a basement chain. The "+1 Nutrient per meal" gem will probably end up one of those. Put twenty or thirty of those into a space and people can live off of mashed-up cardboard. Then once you've got that suite, you need to copy it out to enough multi-basemented buildings to handle the population of a city. Which becomes a scaling issue---the general stumbling block for the Order in all its current attempts at world-shaking.
