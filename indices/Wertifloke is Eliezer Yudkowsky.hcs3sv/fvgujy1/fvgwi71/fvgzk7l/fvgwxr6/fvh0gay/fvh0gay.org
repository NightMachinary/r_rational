Not only does this border on "common (suspected) knowledge", but it is really unfair to make as strong a claim in your title when in fact we do not /know/ it to be true. If Wertifloke later decides to reveal their identity, and it is not in fact Yudkowsky, you will have done them a great disservice. I think you should take this post down, and if you must, replace it with something more careful.
