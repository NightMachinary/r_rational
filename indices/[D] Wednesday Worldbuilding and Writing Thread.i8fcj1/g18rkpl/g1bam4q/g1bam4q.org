Could we rationalize The Smurfs?

I was thinking about that the other day. My toddlers love watching SMurfs, and I noticed that their whole social system, culture and economy looks like something designed by an over-zealous social engineer.

Everything from how Smurfs come into being, to their personalities, and the way they interact seem like it was designed with the intent of a perfectly rational social determinism utopia, except Smurfs sometimes stray from the program when they act irrationally, or there is an outside-context problem like an evil Wizard or something.
