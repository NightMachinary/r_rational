I'm just going to dump a thing in here and see what people think about it. This is not exactly a snippet, but it's from the POV of a particular character, in the sense of opinions-are-not-the-author's.

.

There are two ways to cast magic, and they both involve insanity. They have to; you can't change the world by fiat without standing in opposition to consensus reality.

The first way is a certainty so narrow-minded it does not admit the possibility of error. Children do this instinctively when they're not paying attention, and never when they are; a person of overmuch faith will do it when they are paying attention, and never otherwise.

The second way is to have a mind so wide open that it just doesn't matter. The water might be next to ice or next to steam; there are no expectations, and so nothing can be outside of them.
