That's exactly right. I was thinking probably the 4 combat classes and then perhaps 8-16 non-combat classes, so that probably fits pretty well. Artisan is perhaps too broad, as both a mason, a smith, or even something like a basketweaver or potter. Artisan could theoretically cover just about anything that produces goods. In our society, that probably accounts for less than 15% of work, but in a medieval/renaissance analog, that and farmer could account for something like 95% of people.

Of course, if we take [[/u/scruiser]] 's idea, there could be only a few classes, and each may lend itself better or worse to a job. One plumber could be an artisan, another an artist, and another an intellectual, and they would all (theoretically) excel at different parts of the work.
