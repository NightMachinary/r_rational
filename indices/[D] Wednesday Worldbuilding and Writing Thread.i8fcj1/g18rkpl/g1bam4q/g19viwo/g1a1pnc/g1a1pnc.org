It depends on what you want to distill classes down into, whether that's type of labor, the product of labor, or something else entirely. The broad "professions" as we know them are socially constructed, and if you want to create your own, you should feel free to do them: it would be interesting to see a society where a cook, barber, and doctor are placed into the same class, since they all deal with the physical health of a person.

If you want to be more traditional (and depending on how many divisions you want), then I think laborer and artisan are good starts, with a catch-all for service jobs (barber, butler, maid, etc.) and a catch-all for intellectual labor (accountant, quartermaster, etc.) probably also being important (though class is a social construct that will highly depend on the society that you're doing this in).
