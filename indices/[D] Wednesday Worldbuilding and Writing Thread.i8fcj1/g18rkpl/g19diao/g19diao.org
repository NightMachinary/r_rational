If you want, we did two episodes of /Rationally Writing/ about magic systems, [[http://daystareld.com/podcast/rationally-writing-6/][part 1]] and [[http://daystareld.com/podcast/rationally-writing-7/][part 2]], where we talk about these things. Altogether, probably not a bad way to spend an hour and a half if you want to get my thinking (about 45 minutes at double speed, which is what I crank podcasts up to unless they're exceptionally information dense). Also, this is about five years old at this point, but [[https://www.reddit.com/r/magicbuilding/comments/2jndl2/magic_building_is_tough/cldgiez/][this comment]] on building unique magic systems is something that I mostly stand by.

Broadly speaking, my "checklist" for magic systems (not the things that they should have, but the things that you should ruminate on) is as follows:

- How do people get it?
- How do people get better at it?
- What does it do?
- What internal trade-offs does it have?
- What rules does it follow?
- What rules or trends emerge from those rules?
- What are the first order effects for society?
- What are the second order effects for society?

Once you have those questions, or as you're asking them, you need to start thinking about what role the magic system will have in ... whatever your story is. Making a /good/ magic system means making one that's either compelling on its own, or weaves itself into the story nicely, preferably both. A non-exhaustive list of things that you might want to use a magic system to accomplish:

- Something that's fun to think about, with either its internal mechanics, its mechanical implications, or its social implications
- Reveal things about how a character thinks or acts, either in opposition to the magic system, or in concordance with it
- Reveal things about how two character interact, or how a character interacts with their society, or other elements
- Reveal things about your views on society, civilization, etc.
- Provide a metaphor that underlines some lesson of the plot, element of the character, or something else
- Drive the plot (careful with this one)

I tend to take the view that the ideal work of fiction does as much as it can in as little space as possible, which means that where you can, you should use the same tools in different ways. If you're making a magic system, it should either do one thing for your book in way that really works for it, or it should do a lot of different things for you.

The general principle of connecting the method of acquisition/progress to the power granted is an emergent one: a magic system will be better able to drive home some point if those two halves are in sync with each other, saying the same thing, or taking contrasting points on the same subject, or otherwise adhering to a theme or thread of some kind. The method of acquisition can be completely different from the method of progress, which can be completely different from the practical effects ... but it will be harder for the system as a whole to find a place in a narrative, unless it's a sprawling one with many threads and many points to make.
