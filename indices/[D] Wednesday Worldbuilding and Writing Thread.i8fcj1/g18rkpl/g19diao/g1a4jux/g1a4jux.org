One challenge I've run into writing up various magic power in Saturday Munchkinry threads is being able to give a good summary in as few sentences as possible.

Worth the Candle does a really good job at this. You can get a crude idea about most of the magics in a single sentence: Blood magic draws upon the heat and motion of the blood. Bone magic taps bones for physical and mental boosts. Gem magic converts willpower into blasts of force according to an RGB pattern and cut. Soul magic adjusts essential traits. Spirit magic adjusts ongoing mental threads/processes. Still mages halt change, primarily motion. Vibration mages add to or subtract from vibrations, primarily sound.

There are all sorts of interesting edge cases and secondary effects/applications and hidden or explicit limitations, but the basic rule is easy to explain in the text without bogging things down with pages of explanation and rules while still allowing the reader to intuitively understand the basic abilities and limitations the characters work with and predict more advanced abilities and limitations.

There are exceptions to this in WtC, but they mostly use already familiar complex ideas to explain the magic to the reader. Gold magic uses the idea of tactile telekinesis as an explanation for superman to explain the power to the reader. This explanation gives a clear mental picture and also give the reader ideas about the weakness of the power. Tattoo mages use tattoos like a DnD vancian wizard, prepping spells with exact effects and requirements ahead of time, with limited spell slots available. This sort of archetype gives the reader an idea about the trade offs of tattoo magic and how a team might utilize it. Druid magic is nature magic and the ineffable, unpredictable, unrepeatable parts of magic. Druid magic doesn't need explanation just a general trust in the capabilities and limits as conveyed by Solace. Passion mages are magic realism (and basically the Force, but Juniper never makes this comparison for some reason).
