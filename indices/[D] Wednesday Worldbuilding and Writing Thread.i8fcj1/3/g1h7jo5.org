What would a society of completely deaf humans look like?

Accept the following as given:

- There are no non-deaf humans. Every human in this proposed system was born deaf, and there are no abnormal humans who were born with hearing of any kind.

- Their society has always been deaf. At no point in their known history has any member of their society been capable of hearing, nor do they recall any period in which "hearing" was an ability that any sapient being (mythical or otherwise) possessed.

- Their world is Earth-like.
