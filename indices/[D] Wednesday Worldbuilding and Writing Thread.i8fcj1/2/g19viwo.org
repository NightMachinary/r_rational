In a LitRPG setting I'm thinking about, there are several base classes that provide moderate bonuses over a wide range of possibilities. I was thinking like the original D&D classes in breadth (4 classes for fighting: cleric, fighting man, magic user, and thief). If there are similarly broad classes for other professions, what would some of those classes be? I was thinking "laborer" and "artisan" to cover professions like that, but am open to conversation or other suggestions.
