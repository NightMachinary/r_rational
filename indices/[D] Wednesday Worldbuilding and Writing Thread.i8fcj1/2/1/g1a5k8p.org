Classes provide particular tools to solve problems. If you look at how people in the real world favor mindsets and approaches to solve problems. this might give you some ideas about classes.

STEM is obviously all one class with abilities related to analytical thinking and problem solving. It has the downside/stereotype of trying to apply its tool set to things outside its expertise and of ignoring the emotional side of problems. Maybe this would be an "Intellectual" class?

The softer sciences, including humanities and liberal arts not in STEM would be another class. Maybe more empathic focused abilities? Overall, maybe this class would be called "Empathic" or "Humanitarian"?

Interestingly, some profession might be able to use either of these classes but with different approaches. A STEM doctor might be good at reviewing data collected carefully and have abilities that allow such, but fail at using empathy and just listening to and trusting the patient in comparison to a humanities doctor. Of course, in this LitRPG world, you might just be better off getting a healing from a cleric.

Laborer might include everyone that does physical labor and provide abilities for increased stamina and consistency of work.
