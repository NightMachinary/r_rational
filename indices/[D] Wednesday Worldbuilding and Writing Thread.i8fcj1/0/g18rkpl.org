The latest installment of the amazing [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]] states

#+begin_quote
  There were a lot of components that went into any good magic system, but [X] magic had an inherent disharmony between the method of acquisition and the actual power granted. [...] the power itself could have been anything [...] and it being [X was] disconnected from whatever the magic was attempting to do or show with its acquisition method.

So. We see here that a magic system has

1. A method of acquisition
2. A power granted
3. An attempt to do or show something with its method of acquisition
4. That should be connected to the power granted.

What are the other components of a good magic system, as envisioned by AlexanderWales, or envisioned by our best models of AW?
