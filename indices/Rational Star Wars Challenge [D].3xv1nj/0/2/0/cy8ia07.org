According to /Legends/ canon, it was caught in part of the antenna as it fell and was eventually returned to Vader. But that's non-canonical now and I have no idea what the deal with it is in the new movie continuity. It's probably something that's explained in some of the supplemental materials or will be explained in the next movie.
