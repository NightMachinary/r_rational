Yeah, the second is most correct, except for the fact that people usually write about a somewhat idealised version of themselves instead of actually writing about themselves. I call this the "I choose as my best self." fallacy of SI fix.

The third definition is something I can't agree with. I'm writing a multiverse SI. In the first world, a God wipes my character's memories before she's born. In the next, her soul gets cut into three pieces, of which only one is aware of the setting. In the remainder, my character dies in the real world at around 147 years of age, and often can't remember much about the settings she finds herself in, because that sort of asymmetry makes it much easier to write a story where she doesn't repeatedly curbstomp the settings she finds herself in while keeping things rational.
