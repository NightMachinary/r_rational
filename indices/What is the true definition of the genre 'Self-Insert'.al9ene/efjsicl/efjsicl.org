Self-insert is a character archetype not a genera.

​

The correct definition (IMO) is when the author include a character that is either explicitly themself, or is based on themself. It's commonly used as a criticism as it suffers a bit from the same issues as a GMPC does in roleplaying games where a lot of authors who use self-insert characters don't keep a leash on their SI's power level resulting in a Mary Sue character. It's also not uncommon for an inexperienced author to over-use SI's.

​

Another common but in my opinion incorrect usage is as a synonym for "every-(wo)man protagonist" (that tehre's another clearer term for it is why I oppose using SI for this) where the protagonist is intentionally described in vague terms to make it easy for the reader to "insert themself" into the story in the point of view of the protagonist.

​

Your first and third definitions are examples of types of story that often include SI characters. But in both cases there's nothing intrinsic to them that requires an SI character, and both have otehr better terms for what they do (Portal fantasy, and genera-savvy/breaking the forth wall).
