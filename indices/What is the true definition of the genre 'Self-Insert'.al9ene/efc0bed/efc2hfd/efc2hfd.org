Ok you are going by the Second Definition. This is what I am talking about.

Worth the Candle is a SI because the protagonist made the rules and settings for his DnD games and now is in said world. So Juniper has 'Almost-Omnipotence' and similarly he got portal-ed into this world.

With This Ring is about a person who has read bunches of DC comics and gets Portal-ed into the DC universe.

Umbras Shade is about a person who has read Harry Potter and gets Portal-ed into the Harry Potter universe.

This is also why I use 'Almost-Omnipotence' since they have knowledge they should not have.
