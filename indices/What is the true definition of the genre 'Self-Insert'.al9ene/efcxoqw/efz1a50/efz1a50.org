Putting a character with knowledge into their younger past self is a 'Peggy Sue', so named due to its first appearance as a trope in the movie 'Peggy Sue Got Married'. There exists a whole separate host of fanfiction of peggy sue'ing characters into their younger selves, generally as 'fix-fic' allowing them to solve the issues that ignorance or lack of communication had previously thrown in their way.
