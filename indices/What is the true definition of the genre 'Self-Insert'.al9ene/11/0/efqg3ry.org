Ums and ahs are a sign of insufficient communication skills on the part of the character or of the character not knowing exactly what they want to say, and that can be very good to depict in a story.

Also, how much rational fic have you read? More psychologically realistic characters are also more relatable.

As I've told people time and time again, in order for a self insert to be well-written and dynamic the self insert needs to diverge from the author over the course of the story. Or in other words, well-written self inserts don't *stay* self inserts.

​

When writing a self-insert properly, you need to ask\\
1. What is your self insert experiencing first hand which you are not?

​

1. How does your self insert react to these experiences and change as a result? Or in other words, how would the self insert's first hand experiences change *YOU* if you were the one having those experiences first hand?

​

1. Taking these changes into account, how would the modified self-insert character react to the next situation they find themselves in?

​

Basically you're using your imagination to simulate an alternate life trajectory and personal development for yourself.

The reason most self inserts are poorly written mary sues is that their authors lack the self awareness to recognize their own flaws and the limits of their own perspective and experiences. Putting yourself into the role of a character in a story requires being able to step outside of your own perspective and look at yourself and your interactions with other characters and the setting from the outside. Most people can't do that.
