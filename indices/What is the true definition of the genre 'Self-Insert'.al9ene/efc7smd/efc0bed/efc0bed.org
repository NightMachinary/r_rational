I wouldn't call SI a genre so much as a feature. Sort of like rationalism is a feature that can be part of a story in any genre. SI is simply a story where the author asks "what would I do in the MC's position.

Issekai elements are unnecessary. The MC doesn't have to have the author's actual life in their backstory. Omnipotence is similarly unnecessary. That's more likely in a wish fulfillment set up than a purely SI one.
