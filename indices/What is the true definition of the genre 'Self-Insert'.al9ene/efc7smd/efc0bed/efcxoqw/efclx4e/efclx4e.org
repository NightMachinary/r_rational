The second definition is the correct one. Self insert is a term for when an author inserts themselves into a story as a fictional character. That character is the self insert. Self insert fics are typically isekai but don't have to be. It is perfectly possible to write an SI fic where the self insert gets super powers, wins the lottery, meets the partner of their dreams, dates celebrities or whatever without getting summoned to another world.

​

Your third definition is just a variant of isekai. There are plenty where the protagonist enters a world that just so happens to match up to a MMO or other media product that they know very well.

​

Worth The Candle is an isekai but not an SI (Unless Joon resembles the author more than I think he does).

With This Ring is an SI and isekai.
