Literary characters aren't people. They're more decisive than people. They don't have the same "ums" and "ahhs" and awkward pauses that normal humans have. And they're often caught up in the dream-logic of their world.

I think a core part of the insert genre is that you're dropping a real-human into a world populated by literary-humans, and then playing with the contrast.

So, a biographical story isn't an insert story, even if I'm blatantly making up events. First person horror stories "... and then we had no choice but to stay in the abandoned cabin..." aren't inserts either, as story-me is just as stylized as all the other characters in the piece.

But you could write a Star Trek fiction where the original character is uniquely genre-savvy, and I'd consider it an insert, even if the character was nominally from the setting.

With the Ring is a fairly central example of an insert. But Worth the Candle is a little weird in that Juniper's knowledge is deeply tied to the dream logic of the world.
