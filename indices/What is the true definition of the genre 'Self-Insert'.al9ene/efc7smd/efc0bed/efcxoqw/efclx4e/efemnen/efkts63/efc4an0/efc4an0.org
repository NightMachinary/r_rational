I asked a similar question a while ago, though the original definition I was working from was kind of similar to your 3rd but not quite, I think a Self-insert story is one where the character or charcaters are either very bland or so broadly relatable as to help the reader project themselves into the story in a gratifying manner, this leads to stories in which the main character is powerful and in control, as those are the emotions that the author is trying to provoke, thus "self insert" the point of the story is for you to be able to /insert/ your /self/ into the position of the main character or viewpoint character and experience these things as if you could be doing them. Examples of this are Sword art online, Twilight, the Kingkiller chronicles, metaworld chronicles etc. It is a *very* broad definition, but I feel it fits it the best, something isn't bad for being a self insert fiction, it just means that the point of the story is to make you project onto the protagonist.
