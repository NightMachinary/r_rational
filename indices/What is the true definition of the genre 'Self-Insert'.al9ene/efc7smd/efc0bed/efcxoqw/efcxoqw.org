The problem I have is describing stories where the author does self-inserts with other people.

That is instead of self-inserting into Stalin in 1912 they put Stalin from 1940 in Stalin in 1912. Calling it an ISOT may be accurate but these stories often share a lot of similarities with SI.

Another example is the story on AH.com of a guy waking up in Hitler's body, the guy isn't actually the author since he's written the insert to be a nazi but otherwise its clearly very similar.

What do you call these nonself-inserts? Other-inserts?

Insert as a genre is perhaps more broad.
