"True"?

The term "self-insert" is used for all of those things. Your first definition is a special case of the second where the character is literally "inserted" into the story. Your third definition is a special case of the first where the inserted character has pre-existing knowledge of the setting.

My understanding is that your second definition is the original one, if it matters. If you use the term "self-insert" outside of fanfiction communities, then most people will believe that you are talking about a character who is not /literally/ the author, but who nonetheless clearly /represents/ the author. The term is often used condescendingly to refer to Mary Sue wish-fulfillment stuff also, because there is a fair amount of overlap between the concepts. But the character usually does at least have a different name. In this sense, "self-insert" isn't a genre, it's a writing criticism. Since this can often be open to interpretation, it isn't especially useful as a tag.

The story set-up of "Me, the actual author from the real world, physically transported into the story" is a much more niche thing. You're not likely to find much of this on dead trees, but it does make a decent launching point for unabashed fixfic and fixfic subversions, and it's popular enough that it needed a name. In this sense, the term "self-insert" /is/ useful as a tag.

Any story can /have/ a self-insert character, who is not literally the author. But a story explicitly tagged "self-insert" as a genre ought to be the portal fantasy one, where the main character almost always has extraordinary knowledge because they are the author and the author usually wouldn't be writing themselves into a setting they don't know. Any other usage would be poor communication, I think.
