I don't think there is any possible 'true' definition. My definition is as follows, but it probably varies from person to person:

First-person, and from either the perspective of a fictionalized version of the writer themself or an OC from a world assumed to be roughly approximate to reality. It differs from isekai in that the fictional universe is generally understood to have existed as fiction in the SI's original universe. (I'm uncertain if there is such a thing as a non-fanfic SI; I'm not sure what it would look like if it did.)

I'd differentiate this definition from your third, in that I've read several SIs whose knowledge of canon is incomplete or minimal and proceed to fumble along as a result.
