Ahh, I see! In that case, 2 examples of such systems come to mind, both of which are wildly different stories compared to one another.

Worth The Candle, which I'm sure you've heard by now the folk here really enjoy (it's p good ngl) has a system that, without delving too much into spoilers, sorta has a will of its own, and actively fights against people trying to get too OP.

The other one is Solo Leveling, which is more along the lines of a cliche wish fulfillment OP protagonist (I do have to say, however, that while the writing is mediocre, the art and monster designs are absolutely incredible). Although I dropped this one a while ago (I can only read people reacting dramatically and crying out in shock every time the protagonist moves a finger for so long before it gets really fucking old), as far as I remember, the system was implied to have an agenda of its own, one that didn't bode too well for the MC.
