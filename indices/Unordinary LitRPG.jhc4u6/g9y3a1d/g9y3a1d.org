  Do you prefer new systems, or the same ones you've seen before?

  Are there pros and cons to being different?
#+end_quote

I'm going to roll these together, because the pros and cons are what would determine my answer to the first question.

A good story involves exploration of themes. If, like [[/u/JusticeBeak][u/JusticeBeak]] said, the system has thematic significance, then you can use the system to explore some really cool ideas. So, if the uniqueness of the system is for a purpose (beyond "I want to build a new system!"), then that's a really cool way to add layers to your story.

On the other hand, if there isn't that resonance between the story and the system, then going too deep into the mechanisms etc. of the system just grinds the story to a halt. So, if that's the case, then either a familiar system or a dead simple one is best, so that you don't have to spend much time explaining it and distracting from the thrust of the story.

  How different can a system be before it's no longer a LitRPG at all?
#+end_quote

I've played in several pen-and-paper RPG systems: GURPS (d6-based), HÃ¤rn (d100-based), Pathfinder (d20-based), and even more freeform gaming, and they all work very differently. I've also played single-player RPG computer games and MMOs, which are different again from both each other, and from the pen-and-paper variants.

And I think that any system that I've played, online or off, would make for a story that was recognizably a LitRPG, if you threw a character into it with awareness of the system. Okay, not the freeform ones (although "attacks only land if the defending player agrees they do" would make for an interesting story, in itself), but all of the others certainly would.

I would say that LitRPG is really more about the style of writing than about the system. You could probably write a LitRPG that took place in the real world, where "advancement" happened through grades at school, performance reviews at work, improvement in your skill at [insert leisure activity], popularity within social group etc., just by quantifying those things and using those quantities, rather than any subjective qualities, to define growth as a character. Heck, some self-help techniques even encourage this kind of gamification of real life (see: step counters).

So, I would say that there probably isn't a limit on what systems will work for LitRPG, as long as the system can be presented in a LitRPG style.
