  Hell, I'm guilty of that myself. My first LitRPG (some mess of a story called /Cinnamon Bun/) has a pretty typical system in it

Did a double take at this part and had to scroll back up to check your username.

Fancy seeing you here Mr Raven! hahahah

Tbh the systems tend to be more of an afterthought to me. Doesn't really matter if the systems themselves are that unique or well worn, but rather how they're used/what they're used for. What I focus on is always the characters and character interactions, or how the setting at large changes, that's what always makes or breaks a story in my eyes.

Obviously, seeing the characters heading towards unusual paths tends to be quite hooking as well, or anything that fundamentally shakes the world and such.

Like, I'm not a fan of the ol' formula of /"haha MC punch baddies. Is strongest there is. Much OP"/; but I really enjoy the formula of /"MC & friends shake the very foundations of society and the world. Nothing will ever be the same"/, y'know?

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/33378/i-became-a-biologist-in-a-fantasy-world/chapter/511524/abiogenesis][Abiogenesis]] is a pretty good example of this, if you're interested.

There was another pretty decent one I haven't read in forever that had an interesting system, good characters and interactions, but can't quite recall the name of. It was about a guy who got isekai'd and became an affliction specialist, got a colony of eldritch flesh eating worms which he named Bob as a familiar, and helped heal people at a doctor's clinic. Would be appreciated if someone could remind me the name if they know it
