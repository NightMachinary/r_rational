Hi <3

I think the story you're thinking of is He Who Fights With Monsters.

The story has a very neat system to it, though I dislike the main character and after catching up I never kept up with it.

I enjoy stories that weave the system into the story, as a source of conflict or an adversary. Just tacking it on feels kind of cheap now.
