I think you've got some great points. There's actually a clever story by the name of [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31963/capo-rise-of-a-gang-lord][Capo: Rise of a Gang Lord]] that just started book two: it's a Grand Theft Auto-ish LitRPG, but cash money is the only metric for advancement in levels and skills. Did you make money doing it? You get better. Do you want a better class? Better have that cash.

It's far outside of what you'd expect if I said "LitRPG", but it is still very recognizable and is a lot of fun to read.
