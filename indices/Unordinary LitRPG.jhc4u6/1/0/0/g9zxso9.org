The magic in Worth the Candle has canonically /always/ been janky, and it requires periodic hotfixes in the form of "Exclusions". For example, they discovered nukes...and then they got excluded to one location, so everywhere else is fission-free. Same with dozens of other technologies, magics, etc.
