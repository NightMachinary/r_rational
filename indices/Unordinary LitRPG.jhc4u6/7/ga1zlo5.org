  Do you prefer new systems, or the same ones you've seen before?
#+end_quote

Same one

#+begin_quote
  How different can a system be before it's no longer a LitRPG at all?
#+end_quote

Litrpg is vague enough genre without sharp boundaries, but I'd say the common part is the power is adequately represented by numbers and gained (directly or indirectly) mostly from experience.

#+begin_quote
  Are there pros and cons to being different?
#+end_quote

Pro: Obvious. Readers generally like fresh settings.

Cons: Author need much more expositions and infodumps. More easy for author to miss inconsistencies in the text. Some readers would disagree with author what constitute inconsistency. Some readers will be repulsed by new settings for whatever reason.
