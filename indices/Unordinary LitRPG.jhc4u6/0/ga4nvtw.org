One of the things I learned by writing [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/][Erogamer]] (tagline: the porn quest with way more depth than you expected) is that the LitRPG system I liked from Ryuugi's /The Games We Play/... is actually way more cumbersome to run in a quest than I would have liked. You have to keep track of X% progress in everything. LitRPG should be different for quests, and maybe should just be different period, especially if the QM doesn't like doing lots of bookwork. /Delve/ does bookwork great, so nobody else should have to do it, just /Delve/.

If I was doing Erogamer over again from scratch, I would have all skills work the same way stats do---leveling when somebody performs a significant feat with the skill, or pushing it further than before. In other words, all skills would work the same way as the Title Skill mechanic I introduced for /Tease Mistress/ only near the story's endpoint.

I wouldn't have perk points and stat points awarded for LVLing. Instead, there'd be gold, silver, and bronze coins, and a Shop. Coins would expire after a certain time, which would incentivize the character to actually spend those coins. This would also allow late-game goodies to be introduced later, without incentivizing the character to save up all their coins for late-game goodies.

With coins as a reward for completing quests, and skills that advance for story-significant feats instead of by grinding, and no more stat points or perk points, there might not need to be any such thing as XP and LVL. Quests could just award coins.

Some of these are features that I've noticed in more recent webnovels, and contrast to the way that LitRPG worked in /The Games We Play/ or in D&D-derived works before then.

So I think my message is "The state of the art in LitRPG is still advancing and people shouldn't be afraid to play with it."
