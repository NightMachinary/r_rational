That number=power is about as narratively unsatisfying to me as always meeting the murderer during the first post-open segment of a police procedural (NCIS, I'm looking at you.)

In Worm, Taylor's power ratings should be increasing every time she figures out a new use of her powers, as a consequence and not as a cause. Talking through her swarm? Stranger 1. Multiple swarm-silhouettes while she's hiding inside one? Stranger 3. Parahumans stagnate because they rely on their basic understanding of their own powers; she boosts the stats of the Chicago Wards just by teaching them tactical thinking.

Anyway, thanks for helping me figure out I'm not interested in by-the-numbers litRPGs.
