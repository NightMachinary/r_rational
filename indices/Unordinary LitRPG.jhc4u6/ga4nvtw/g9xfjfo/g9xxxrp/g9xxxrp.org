I also like that in Worth the Candle the main character is a connoisseur of systems, and the system is clearly a bit jank in parts. I do tend to like when the system has some rough parts, as long as that's acknowledged.

Something I also like is metasystem, or the system acknowledging the system itself. (Can you tell I'm a Lisp programmer?) A story I've enjoyed, though it's hardly the most polished, is Paragamer, in which the main character makes great use of cheesable game mechanics such as free camera, volume, and "in-game" music. The more he cheeses the system, the more levels of specific game-related skills he gets. Delve has done this to some extent with the modification of the system interface. Erogamer probably has a little too much of this, in that the system is a little too flexible and powerful, to the extent that the system precedes reality, which forestalls munchkinry except insofar as the system indulges the main character.
