  It was about a guy who got isekai'd and became an affliction specialist, got a colony of eldritch flesh eating worms which he named Bob as a familiar, and helped heal people at a doctor's clinic. Would be appreciated if someone could remind me the name if they know it

It started out pretty good, but the author has really doubled down on the MC being edgy for no reason lately. Like, at first it was a tactic used to throw his opponents off and get people interested in him because he was crazy/eccentric (depending on which side they fell on) but lately it's like the guy just decided to be ~zany~. It's like the MC is crying out for attention, except that people are already paying attention to him because he's important.

It suck because there was some genuine character growth, but then that all fell away and it's like the MC goes from 30 to 13 whenever someone says "hey, what's up?"
