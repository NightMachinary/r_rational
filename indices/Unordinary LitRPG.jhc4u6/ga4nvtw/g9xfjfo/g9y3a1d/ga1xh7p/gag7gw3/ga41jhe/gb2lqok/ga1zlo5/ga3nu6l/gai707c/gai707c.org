- Do you prefer new systems, or the same ones you've seen before?

New, definitely new. A lot, probably even most, LitRPG is trash and will be considered unreadable in a decade. I think the genre is very new and needs improvement and some of that improvement may be in the form of new systems.

- How different can a system be before it's no longer a LitRPG at all?

Fairly different, I think. Does The Wandering Inn count as LitRPG? (Yes, it does!) It barely uses levels or RPG mechanics, except when it does. One of my favorite aspects of TWI is that leveling is optional and leveling carries an opportunity cost, e.g leveling as a mage closes you off from non-mage-like thinking and ways of acting. (The entire Ryoka storyline hints at this basically.) I think the entire reason there is so little innovation in-universe before the Earthers arrive _because_ leveling forces you entire very narrow fields of focus and narrow strengths are antithetical to innovation.

Also consider that you can have systems without it being a LitRPG. Orconomics features a DnD-esque world, classic fantasy races, adventuring, loot, etc and yet is _not_ a LitRPG. And this is fine, it's a great story without needing RPG-logic included.
