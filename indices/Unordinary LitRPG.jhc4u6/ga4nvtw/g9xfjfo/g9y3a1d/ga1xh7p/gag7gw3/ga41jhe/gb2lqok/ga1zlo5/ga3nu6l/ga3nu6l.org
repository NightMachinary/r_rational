  Do you prefer new systems, or the same ones you've seen before
#+end_quote

I'm highly flexible but I do want my systems to get the basics right. It should have verisimilitude for someone whose played RPGs.

As a rule of thumb that means three things: No defeating people too many levels ahead of you. Trade offs are everywhere, nobody is good at everything. A well planned build is the key to success, characters who wing it will hit their limits.

In other words. Do what Delve does.

(Intently that second one is why I think mixing cultivation and litRPG is a bad idea. One has a heritage of solo heroes fighting duals, the other has a heritage of synergistic parties. If you mix them something has to give)

  How different can a system be before it's no longer a LitRPG at all?
#+end_quote

Very different IMO it's a lot easier to make a bad litRPG system than a system that's not litRPG.

#+begin_quote
  Are there pros and cons to being different?
#+end_quote

Uniqueness is good IMO, stuff like Draw of the Unknown is great.
