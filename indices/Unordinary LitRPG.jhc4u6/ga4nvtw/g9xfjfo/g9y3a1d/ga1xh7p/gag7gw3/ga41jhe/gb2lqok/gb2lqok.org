I am really hoping that litRPG starts to experiment and branch out in the future. In addition to what has already been mentioned, 99% of litRPG protagonists start at LVL 1. Exploring the system with them and determining their build can be a lot of fun, but it restricts variety quite a bit.

Could a heist story where the team recruits our LVL 30 [Wardbreaker] protagonist be interesting? I think so. Or a high level [Detective] whose build is outdated compared to his younger [Divination Mage] collogues. I'm excited to see where the genre goes. Also as a side note I really liked cinnamon bun, although I think the story's "System" was probably one of the weakest parts of the story. I'd love to see something more experimental.
