I think I definitely like unusual systems and, generally, I like those that emphasise skills rather than stats. Stats are just arbitrary numbers. Skills you can see being used and you can have all sorts of interesting synergies.

Two examples of good systems -

Wake of the Ravager by Macronomicon

People undergo 'breaks' when they are near large amounts of warp. Warp is released by things dying, so you can get your first break from the slaughter of some animals, but subsequent breaks require more death like large battlefields.

While undergoing a break, you can learn skills. Skills can be magical (like duplimancy - the ability to duplicate things) or just enchantments of normal likes like (like sneak - the art of, um, sneaking). Once skills level up, you get perks or mutations that let the skills do new and interesting things. There are also stats but they're less important.

This story is all about the main character maximising the synergy in his skills to do broken things.

The Sins of Cinnamon by Questingdragon

This story makes stats at least somewhat interesting. They're tied to classes. Each class gives you a number of stats, though they can be weird things Truth or Seduction not just Strength and Constitution. This story has a really interesting idea with class evolution, with branching classes, which open up new stats and new skills. This story is rather NSFW by the way.
