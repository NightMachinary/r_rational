Yeah, Cinnamon Bun's system is a bit... vanilla. It was never the focus of the story, really.

I've been trying some new things with Stray Cat Strut (A literal pay-to-win system) and Fluff (a morality system pushed to its extreme) and I think if I continue to write new LitRPGs, I'll be doing so while trying new ways to explore the mechanical aspects of the genre.
