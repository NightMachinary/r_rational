Apocalypse: Generic System has a nicely minimalist system, a stat each for body, mind and magic, people can get a single simple yet open ended skill with their class such as set trigger, raise dead, heal or so on. Beyond that it's all practice and ingenuity. It really helps it work as a support for the characters and story rather than as a focus or crutch.

Street Cultivation calls itself "a modern wuxia/litrpg hybrid" but that doesn't really sum it up. The litrpg aspect comes in with how standardized and numeric modern cultivation assessment has become but it's purely descriptive rather than prescriptive so I don't think it really fits with the rest.

I like both of those because they aren't an excuse for oversimplification like most litrpg systems are.

I do think you're a bit unfair to Cinnamon Bun, it's system is definitely generic but I'd hardly call it a mess.
