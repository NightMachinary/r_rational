I'm envisioning the device as if it's a computer that can simulate the world and future actions taken with near-perfect accuracy, but it can't account in advance for any changes that occur in reality due to information that people are acting on from the simulation.

Basically, it can't include itself in the simulation so any information that it predicts, assumes the absence of future knowledge. But it updates in real-time so once there's any deviations, it recalculates its simulation.

I didn't want to include the details of how the device worked to keep people focused on the money earning challenge which was what I was more interested in.
