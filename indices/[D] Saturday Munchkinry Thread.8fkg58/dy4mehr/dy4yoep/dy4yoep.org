Actually hold on a second. What are the limitations on this device's ability to tell the future? Normally time travel involves future you sending data to past you, but in this case it seems to be the opposite as the device cannot tell you anything about your personal future since the device is influencing your future.

So what are the restrictions on the information gathering ability of this device? If I ask the device: "One hour in the future, does god exist?", will the device know the right answer? What about "One hour in the future, does P = NP?"

Or what about information I normally cannot get? Like finding out who murdered someone: "One hour in the future, has suspect X ever committed murder before?"

Or better yet, use the device for research and inventions. "Do the laws of physics one hour in the future allow me to build a super profitable invention within a day using what I have now?" Then play twenty questions to narrow down what this invention is and what steps you need to take to make the invention.
