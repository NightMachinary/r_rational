Well if your goal is just to make money then yeah, of course. With games like keno you only need to play once to win a few million, so no need to care about winning streaks. And sure the casino will scrutinize you, but they'll be looking for things like connections with insiders and things like that, not time travel device. Also they're not really going to care much about a couple million.

I guess the blockchain dice games are probably a better way though, more anonymous.
