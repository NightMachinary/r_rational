Say you start with $10k. Just use the device to play the investing game, if played well you'll make your money in 24 minutes. Just pump your money in and out of bitcoin at appropriate moments, using the device to perform binary searches on the local minima and maxima of the value of bitcoin and/or any other stock. You could extract optimal buy/sell times which are accurate to the second across the whole day in O(16 questions) which, because the questions have simple structure, should take no longer than 30s.

Getting your first 10k might be tricky, but I'm sure you could do something by using the device to extract usernames and passwords for peoples banking/amazon/google accounts. Encode the username as an ascii sequence, with the end of the username/password being the EOF character. Is the next bit of the password....X? hold the accounts for ransom or just extract money from them, or hack the owner of the magic fuel and steal some more fuel.
