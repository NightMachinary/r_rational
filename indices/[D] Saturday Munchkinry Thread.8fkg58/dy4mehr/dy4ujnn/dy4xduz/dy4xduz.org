The question isn't asking for how to make a million dollars, but rather how to make and /get/ the money within a week. Lotteries often have a delay of 4 to 6 weeks before payout, so it's too slow to win the challenge.

People talk about how easy it is to make money with time traveling powers, so this challenge is how to get some large amount of money /quickly/ with time travel.
