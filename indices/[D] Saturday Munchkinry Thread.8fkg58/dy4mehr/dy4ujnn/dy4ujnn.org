Is there a limit on the number of questions you can ask? If not, this is really really easy. To the point where even abyss mode is a joke. Just look for a good lottery that will end within 24 hours, perform a binary search using the device to get the winning number, and buy a lottery ticket with that number.

Don't ask "is the number I wrote down the winning value?" That takes too long. You need binary search. Ask questions like "Is the winning number greater than 20?" If yes ask if it is greater than 30, if no ask if it is greater than 10. This will let you determine the winning numbers really quickly.

The only way you could fail the abyss-mode challenge is if there was somehow no way to gamble in the next 24 hours. But that's ridiculous because stocks and lotteries are everywhere.
