Yes, you can win the lottery quickly. The issue is that lotteries take 4 to 6 weeks to pay out. The challenge is to have the money ready to be spent in a very short period of time.

Someone who also thought of the lottery solution said that they would get the money immediately through loans first and use the lottery winnings to pay off the loans.
