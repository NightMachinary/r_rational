Huh, that looks like a great way to make the necessary money quickly enough.

Couldn't you circumvent winning at the casinos twice by leaving after a big win and driving to another state for a second win? I mean, would casinos share such information over a far distance, especially if they are casinos under a different management/franchise? Also, why $772 exactly?

  "What would a friendly AI with your powers set as the answer to this question?" and start writing down bits to be interpreted as ASCII.

You can't ask such a question because the device is just 'looking' into the future. Not asking some AI to guide you towards some desired future.

You /could/ get some computer program of an AI from the future by asking, 'For the Nth bit of the first provably friendly AI to be made in the future, is it a 0?' and just ask that question n times for however many 1s and 0s there are in the computer program with every yes being 0 and every no being a 1. Just remember that there's 8 billion bits in just one gigabyte. Also, how would you be able to be sure of how the device 'knows' what makes an AI Friendly?

EDIT: I just looked up some stuff about casinos and it turns out that casinos share info about possible cheaters with each other, so it's probably not sufficient to go to different casinos for each 'win'. Better to just save time by winning multiple times in one casino.
