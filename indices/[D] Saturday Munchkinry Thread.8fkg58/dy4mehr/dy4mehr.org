You have a time travel device where you can get information from the future. It will answer only yes or no to any question you ask. However, it can only answer questions about a hypothetical future where the device doesn't exist.

So you can ask 'will it rain today?' or 'is the number I wrote down the winning numbers of tomorrow's lotto?' and get accurate answers. However, questions like 'will I lose the device tomorrow' or 'will I be alive tomorrow' would most likely give wrong answers or no answers at all, because the question is only answering about a hypothetical future where you don't have the device and it isn't influencing your actions. So questions about your future actions will only be about a version of you who suddenly doesn't have the device.

How would you use it to make money in the shortest amount of time? The device's fuel will only last for a week before it dies and you need to make a million dollars or more to buy more of the fuel within the next week before it breaks down permanently. The device can answer questions beyond the week of its battery life if needed.

For hard-mode, the device can only tell information of the future within the next week.

For nightmare-mode, you have earn a million within 24 hours instead.

For abyss-mode, you need a million within 24 hours and the device can only tell you about the future within the next 24 hours.
