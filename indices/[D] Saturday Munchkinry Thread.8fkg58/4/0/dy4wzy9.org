Well going by the description (though ignoring the testing logs which seem to be flawed as a result of the authors knowledge) I'm like 50% sure you could figure out a way to use the chamber as an antitelephone by sticking a robot in it and changing the speed of causality.

If that didn't work (and we're assuming the rest of the SCP canon doesn't exist) then the item would still be extremely useful because it can generate free energy through many different means, so post-singularity civilization won't ever have to fear the heat death with this thing around.
