I'm not talking about relying on energy being put out through the window, ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qam5BkXIEhQ][though with very efficient technology in a very cold universe it could still power a civilization]]) rather I'm talking about the fact that if you can generate massive amounts of energy inside the chamber then that's still going to be released when you open it, even if that causes the physics there to revert back to normal it still won't undo the extra energy created.

Also while the energy of a photon leaving the chamber may be limited it can still put out an unlimited number of them potentially (though realistically somewhat limited by the creation of kugelblitz black holes).

  Else you're just slowing it down until you reach equilibrium between energy from the box and entropic decay of the entire universe. You'd also eventually end up with the ambient energy level rising until the box fails.

Given the box produces free energy and the universe shows all signs of expanding forever you effectively have both an unlimited source of power and an unlimited heat sink to run heat pumps into.
