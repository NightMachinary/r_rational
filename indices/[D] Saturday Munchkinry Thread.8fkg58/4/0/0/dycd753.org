I'm not sure how useful it would be as a power source. Energy out of the system is bounded to 1 keV packets from a 50cm square window.

You could defeat heat death with it, for a very specific definition of heat death. Stopping entropy doesn't only depend on having a power source, but also the bandwidth. Else you're just slowing it down until you reach equilibrium between energy from the box and entropic decay of the entire universe. You'd also eventually end up with the ambient energy level rising until the box fails.

I...think you could make an antitelephone, but it still wouldn't be useful except as a physics experiment. If you're stuck to only using the 50cm window, then you're bound to a 50cm time differential between input/output which is only 1.668Ã—10^{-9} lightseconds /at most/. The only result would be an observer being able to see a laser shone out from the box picoseconds before it was shone in. You can't signal electronics that fast, so even if you did come up with something clever there's not much you can use it for.
