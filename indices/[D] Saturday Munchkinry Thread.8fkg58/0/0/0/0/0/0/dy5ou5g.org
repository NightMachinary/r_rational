Thank you; I will continue to look into it.

Although I haven't brought this up in the story, the idea is that Hector made some very costly mistakes early on relying on lip-reading, and came to the conclusion that it is more likely to give him false information than actual new information. He deliberately avoids doing it so as not to bias his conclusions.

As the story progresses, it would make sense that he would continue to make efforts to resolve this limitation, because adding the ability to understand what people are saying would be a /significant/ power upgrade. I do not intend to limit it arbitrarily for story reasons.
