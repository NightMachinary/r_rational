I do not believe that lip-reading actually works with any accuracy. My assessment of what I have seen/read is that it is mostly using body cues and situational awareness to infer meaning, and in any case where the info is not already known (such as names or addresses the person is not already cued for) the accuracy level is 'educated guess.'

If anyone has done reading/research on the subject, my mind can be easily changed.
