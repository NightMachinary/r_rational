- Solve any missing persons case by verifying when a person was last seen and fast forwarding through what happened.

- Find out location of current kidnapping victims.

- Find out if there was another shooter for JFK, falsify / verify other such conspiracies

- get any login / password combination you want that was written down or entered into a system

- Look/Listen in (via lip reading) on Board Meetings and other such get togethers and glean information that Hector then uses to inform investments (effectively insider trading camouflaged as talented trading)

- Corporate espionage (patents, formulae, ...)

- suffer soul-crushingly from watching any murder you want without being able to save anyone

- verify any crime (requires the judicial system to trust you, of course)

- Check your backside without turning around (are you being tailed? Do these pants make your bum look fat?)

- Uncover the secret identity of anyone who made a public appearance in the last sixty years.
