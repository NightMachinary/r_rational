  Also, why $772 exactly?

It sounds like he is using 1:36 odds, as $772/36/36 = $1.0005 million. The odds he is using are slightly off, though. True, there are 36 numbers on which one can bet (1-36), but there is also 0, for a total of 37 possible outcomes. However, typically the house will only pay out at 1:35 odds. Therefore, if one wants to have $1 million after winning twice at the roulette wheel, the starting bet should be $817.
