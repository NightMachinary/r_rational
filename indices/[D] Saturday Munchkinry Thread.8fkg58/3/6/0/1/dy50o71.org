772*36*36 is 1000512.

I guessed the device might have arbitrary computational power because it must have some way of finding the molecules that correspond to the words "roulette table at the local casino". I'll try to find solutions that don't need to peek behind this curtain.

No need to copy source code. Simply ask for any fact about the world after a singularity - any superintelligence within the hypothetical world that does not contain my device will notice that there used to be a human that remembers having such a device until it stopped working, infer that it's in the hypothetical, and be able to engineer its world such that the device's answers optimize the real world in the eyes of the superintelligence. You can even make it easy and ask for the bits within the envelope adressed to you.

Your readers might have less trouble with the butterfly effect not changing answers between asking for bits if you allow to ask for multiple bits at once at the cost of taking proportionally more time.

Whether the device's definition of friendliness is friendly is of course another matter. An unfriendly AI might simply notice your gaze, code up a provably friendly AI, and have its source code start with comments that enthrall you.

Of course, we haven't even gotten into the shenanigans you can do through the version of you in the hypothetical knowing where it is, and spending its ressources and anonymity on optimizing for the last question you asked. "What is the most upvoted suggestion in my reddit thread about the device?" "What is Yudkowsky's answer to my question of what would convince him of my story?" "What advice has my future self written into an envelope adressed to me?"

For safety reasons, you should probably preface all relevant questions with "Is the answer to that question determined within <lower bound on AI emergence>?" and "Is the answer to that question determined before I let go of this marble?".
