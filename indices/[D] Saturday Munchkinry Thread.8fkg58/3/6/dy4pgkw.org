I'll assume for the sake of argument that the butterfly effect is not a thing since otherwise the existence of the device would impact tomorrow's lottery drawing.

Go to the casino with 772 dollars and put all on the correct roulette number twice. The casino probably won't evict you until that second win. The downside is that if you become known to have that device, the casino owners might be angry at you. Also, if it becomes known that someone must have such a device, then this plan cost you a number of bits of anonymity.

Contact a Lawful entity such as a notary via Tor and pay them 3000 dollars to execute the above plan and give you the winnings, without telling them where you got the numbers. This makes it more likely that the existence of the device becomes known and less likely that you will be found. Using Tor, and having downloaded it shortly before this event, cost you a number of bits of anonymity.

What counts as a question about the future? If the device has read access to its near future light cone, natural language processing and arbitrary computational power, I could ask: "What would a friendly AI with your powers set as the answer to this question?" and start writing down bits to be interpreted as ASCII.

You could pick one of [[https://coinmarketcap.com/]] and extract its value by making it look like you cracked the relevant cryptologic puzzle. Try to read up on cryptology and pick one that doesn't imply the others are broken as well.
