This is excellent munchkining based on the stated mechanism. A good nerf would be, as soon as you ask your question the machine is set, and the only thing you can do from then on is select either 'yes' or 'no' which then resets everything to the earlier time only with a 'yes' or 'no' displayed on the machine.

So the knowledge gained with the machine is limited to what you yourself will be able to figure out in the intervening time without any answer from the machine.

For the time-limited cases, if you don't select either 'yes' or 'no' before the deadline, the machine resets anyway and displays 'no.'
