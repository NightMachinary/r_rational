The limitations affect the money earning challenge though. Normally, time travel only lets you know what future you would know, so it only lets you take advantage of gambling. If this device lets you know more than that, you could do all kinds of crazy things. Ask for profitable easy-to-make inventions and then sell them. That might take a while to earn money, so let's go for something quicker.

"Do the laws of physics one hour in the future allow me to resurrect the dead within an hour using what I have now?" If yes play twenty questions to narrow down the method, then publicly announce your ability to revive the dead and show off to prove it. Desperate people will throw themselves at your feet with tons of cash to revive their dead loved ones. If no try something else. Like a way to cure a horrible disease that you know some rich people have. Or one of the following:

"Do the laws of physics one hour in the future allow humans to gain superpowers?" Give yourself those superpowers and use them to earn money.

"Do the laws of physics one hour in the future allow for backwards time travel?" Time travel back over and over to extend your time limit.

"Do the laws of physics one hour in the future allow a human to become a god?" Become a god and magic up money from nothing, though you wouldn't need it anymore.
