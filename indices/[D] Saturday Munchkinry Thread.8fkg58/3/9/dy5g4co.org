When asking your questions, can you specify at what point the device stopped 'existing' in the hypothetical universe?

If so, ending any "will X happen/not happen/happen in a certain way/etc." question with "......in a universe where this device was lost /immediately/ before X happened/didn't happen/etc." should give you an answer unaffected by the change in your actions after losing it.

If not, prefacing your question with "If I had /not/ lost this device, what would the answer have been if I asked it....." should accomplish the same result. You're essentially asking it "Within a universe where I've already lost this device, what would it say if I hadn't lost it?"

  In more detail: The true state of any universe (as well as the state of anything in that universe) is irrelevant to any questions asked within that universe regarding a elements of a separate hypothetical universe that are inherently inconsistent with the original universe. In other words, if I ask you "what would happen if humans had 2 legs?" your answer would be the same even if humans did not have 2 legs - my question makes the true number of legs on humans irrelevant, since I specify that I'm asking about a universe in which they have 2.

  So, in this particular case, compare the following:

  #+begin_quote
    Within a hypothetical universe in which the device /does/ exist, I ask "In another hypothetical universe, where the device exists, what would be its answer to X?"

    Within a hypothetical universe in which the device /does not/ exist, I ask "In another hypothetical universe, where the device exists, what would be its answer to X?"
  #+end_quote

  In both cases, X is being asked within a hypothetical universe where the device exists. In other words, the speaker's question is specifically about a universe in which the device exists, and so the answer - "what would be the device's answer to X" - is the same in either case.

  Going up one more level of abstraction back to the 'real' universe, ^{although from my point of view the entire thought experiment is itself hypothetical, but that's a different story} the device would answer "Within a universe where this device is lost, the answer to the question 'in a universe where this device was not lost, X?' is 'Y'." And then you have that Y is the answer for X in a universe in which the device was not lost, effectively bypassing your restriction.

So, now that Sir Munchkin has sidestepped your inaccuracy clause, he has an effectively perfect future-reading device. Furthermore, the 'increased difficulty' clauses can be sidestepped in a similar manner:

To see 2 weeks/days ahead, just ask "If I asked 'will X happen in a week' one week from now, what would the answer be", but within the appropriate framework as explained above. For 3 weeks/days, ask "If I asked 'If I asked 'will X happen in a week' one week from now' one week from now, what would the answer be", within the same framework; etc.

For the money, using a similar train of logic as above, ask "If I had not lost this device, and if I had managed to make 1M$ in the way that I would judge optimal, how did I do it?" I would prove this, but it's similar enough to the previous that I'm just going to call it 'trivial' (like all of the /best/ math teachers do, of course.....) and move on with my life.
