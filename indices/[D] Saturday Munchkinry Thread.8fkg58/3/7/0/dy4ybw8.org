So you would use your amazingly useful time travel device to make money from casinos?

How would you disguise your amazing winning streak without giving away the fact that you are using a strange machine at the same time? Unless you are a professional cheater, the casino will very likely notice after a short while before you manage to make the million. I could be wrong on this though, since I don't know how casinos look for cheaters.
