How long does the mental processing for the ability (i.e. deciding what to view, selecting a place and time, etc.) take? How long/often can he use the ability?

Since it works up until the "present," he can just choose to view "the time from X+1ms ago until 1ms ago" (where X is however many milliseconds it takes to use the ability) repeatedly to give him effectively-current vision from any spot on Earth.

Even if repeated usage causes mental fatigue, or if the "processing" takes enough concentration to preclude training himself to repeatedly select the same location as soon as a 'video' ends; he could still use it that way intermittently to get the equivalent of "bursts" of omnivision X seconds long that are 'out-of-date' by X seconds.

I'm assuming that by "until the present" you mean "until the /beginning/ of the playback" - if you meant "he can only view things that have already happened /by the time he views them/" then his 'omnivision' wouldn't even have to be delayed: He'd just have to start an X-millisecond-long viewing at some location from (1ms before the mental 'start' command is given) until (X-1 ms after the command is given). Then, at every point during the viewing, he's still technically seeing 'the past,' but the net effect is that he effectively just sees what's currently happening.

The last one might be a bit too OP though, so if you'd rather avoid it just clarify that whatever 'video' he wants to view has to 'end' at some point before he starts to view it. Even then, though, he could still just continuously start new, extremely short 'videos' (as in the previous paragraph) as quickly and for as long as he could.

Honestly, unless it takes a notable amount of time or concentration to 'focus' on a particular 'video' there's nothing else that I can see really stopping him from doing this. Even if there is, though, a slightly 'out-of-date' version of "X-Ray Vision, but as far away as you want" is still super OP and much more obviously munchkinable.

I haven't yet read your story, so I don't know what Hector's goals are, but when you say most known powers are 'physical' I'm guessing super-senses aren't unknown. So if he wanted to moonlight as a 'conventional superhero' he could use the above technique (or variations along the same general lines of Viewing things from an extremely short time ago until the present) to fake 'standard' X-ray vision, or a 'human/object sense', or really almost any number of enhanced senses.

Or, considering he's already working with the FBI, I can imagine they'd find someone who could spy on anyone, anywhere, in nearly real-time incredibly useful. Depending on how high his 'security clearance' is, the CIA would love to have him, too.

TL;DR: The power as written could effectively be used as if it was a "See arbitrarily far away with a delay" power; the utility and munchkinability of which I probably don't need to point out.
