If he likes the government, he could do /way/ more for the CIA than for FBI bounties.

Any type of forensics becomes almost trivially easy. (Oh look a dead body. A wonder what killed them. A sniper bullet fired by that guy who was hired a week earlier by that other person.)

Diagnosis of machine problems is also easy. Did you know that it takes tens of thousands of dollars to ship out workers, rent a lift, etc. to inspect a wind turbine? If he can do it while it's running, all the better.

Search and rescue, Amber Alerts, missing persons, etc. are all of mixed value, but also easy.

Check if he can see 68 lightyears away (at "present" time), or if there's some other strange interaction. Do astronomical research.

Coordinate with a satellite monitoring system, and get him to focus on things they notice. This would massively increase their utility and his.
