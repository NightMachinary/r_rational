Wikipedia didn't really give any useful numbers, and [[https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602949/ai-has-beaten-humans-at-lip-reading/][this article]] on lip reading deep learning programs agrees with you.

However, Delphic has an advantage the humans in the last, most realistic, test (that had an accuracy of 12%) does not have - he can change the angle and speed of his viewing, repeat it as many times as he likes, and compare with the other participants of the conversation, written notes, powerpoint slides etc. that are present.

Unless it is important for the plot that he does not "hear" anything, I think that he would want to address a clear weakness in his power in some way.
