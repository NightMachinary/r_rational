Lip reading is at best only 30 to 40% accurate. It's because there are too many sounds that form the same lip shape when speaking. Try looking in a mirror and silently sounding out 'pat', 'bat', and 'mat'. Lip reading is only used in situations when one can know fairly easily what the other person is likely to say such as speaking to a cash register at a grocery store. My source is American Sign Language classes in college which taught how poor lip reading actually is.
