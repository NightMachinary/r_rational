A reader of my story /Delphic/ suggested I present Hector's situation for munchkining. Minor (not major) spoilers ahead.

Hector lives in Detroit in a modern superhero setting. Technology is roughly equivalent to our Earth. Hector has the ability to View any time in the past between 1950 and the present, in any location on the Earth's surface (upper mantle to low Earth orbit). He can widely control the angle, position, and "playback speed" of what he sees. He is limited to a normal optical vantage: visible (and very near UV) light. He can freeze and carefully observe a particular "instant" (approximately 8 ms minimum resolution).

Super powers exist, but are mostly physical. A power like Hector's is not publicly known. No powers are known to break timelike causality (there is a lightspeed delay when Hector Views a distant 'present').

In Book 1 of my story, Hector has been making money by taking FBI bounties and providing information to super teams. What else should he be doing?
