Just as the first way to do this that comes to mind, ask the God the open-ended question: "At what digit of pi does the sum of all useful human knowledge, in order from most to least useful, appear, when translated from decimal to English heptavigesimal, and heptavigesimal increments through the latin alphabet from A to Z and a blank." Then, ask for your yes/no question: "Is the [number] digit of pi the digit where the sum of all useful human knowledge..." etc.

Alternatively, ask the God what question you should ask in order to lead to the best situation by your personal morals via butterfly effect. Maybe its weird, but if the open-ended questions must be answered truthfully, then there you go.
