Given I have no way to prove that I got the answer from God and I'm unlikely to have any way of significantly altering future events, asking questions like "are superintelligent AIs dangerous" or "is the Great Filter ahead of us" is unlikely to be productive. I'd probably ask "will human civilization's level of development significantly decline before 2060?" and then live a rather more risker lifestyle if the answer is yes.
