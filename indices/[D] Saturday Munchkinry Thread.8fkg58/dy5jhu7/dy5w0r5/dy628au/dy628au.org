Pi hasn't been proven to be a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_number][normal number]], so it's not actually guaranteed that this will work. It's suspected to be one, though.

Additionally, the answer to your question is almost certainly too deep into pi to compute the numbers, probably so large that you won't be able to actually say the digit because it's so long, and maybe even so large that the amount of information needed to remember the number is more than can fit in a volume of space the size of a human brain.

However, I like your approach of using the answer as a formality and the question to store data. You could just ask "Sorting all humanly useful knowledge from most to least useful, what's the longest statement I can remember?" then "Is [that statement] true?"
