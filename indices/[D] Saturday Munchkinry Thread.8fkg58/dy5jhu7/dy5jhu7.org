An omniscent god feels like answering a yes/no question for you. To avoid ambiguity, you will be allowed to ask as many (possibly open ended) questions and follow-up questions as you want. However, your memory of the question and answer session will be erased afterwards, except for a single yes/no you choose to send to yourself.

What's the best you can do and with what strategy?

Edit: To clarify, you don't remember any of the questions you asked either. You only remember either a yes or a no.
