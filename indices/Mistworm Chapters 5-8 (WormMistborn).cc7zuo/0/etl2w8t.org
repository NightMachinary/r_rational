Continuation of Lord Ruler!Taylor.

I don't feel all that confident about chapter eight. That's the second version of that chapter, the first version having been lost after Google Docs decided to spaz out on me and lose everything. I think what happened was that some bug caused the document to sync to the one in the cloud and overwrite the one on my local machine with the blank document, because I can't find any trace of that version when looking through the version history. So I wasn't really feeling it when I had to write it all over again.
