The story begins [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/300693/1/shears/bridges-1][here]].

Basic info is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3te0fy/rtff_shears_chapter_1_rmlp/cx5d65r][here]].

I'm sorry for the quite long delay on this chapter. University finals, computer problems, a vacation, and a copious amount of drugs have made life pretty hectic for the last month or so.

Comments are especially appreciated for this chapter. Please let me know what you think about Tinder Heart! It's very tricky, adding in another main character, but I think the reasons for doing so outweigh my reservations.

As always, thanks for reading! =]
