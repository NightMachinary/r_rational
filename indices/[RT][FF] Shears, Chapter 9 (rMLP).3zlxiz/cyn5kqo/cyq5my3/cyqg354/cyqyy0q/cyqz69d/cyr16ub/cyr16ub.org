A lack of data, an aversion to male characters in MLP fiction, a strong aversion to straight/non-queer romance in MLP fiction, particularly with the main 6.

...Yeah. I'm a shipper. ._. I'm not psychotic about it (any more), but it just /feels wrong,/ even to approach a plot where it becomes slightly probable that straight romance will happen in the future. I do read stories with male characters and straight romance in them, though, they just need to be better written. You have a good handle on that, I think.
