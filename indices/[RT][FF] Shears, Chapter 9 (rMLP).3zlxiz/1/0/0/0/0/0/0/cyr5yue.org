Hmm, okay. I'll say that that aversion to male characters in MLP is one of the (many) reasons I believe Tinder's existence is warranted; it's one of the themes I want to touch on (but not really explore in-depth).

Regarding romance, I don't want to say much, but I advise you not to worry about the concerns you brought up. Wait a few chapters and see. ^^

Also I just noticed you've got category-theoretic flair. /brohoof
