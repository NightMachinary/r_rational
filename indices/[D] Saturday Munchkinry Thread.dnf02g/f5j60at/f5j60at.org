Through a glitch in the matrix, you are given access to your character creation menu and allowed to modify your base attributes. These are (copied with modification from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute_(role-playing_games)#Dungeons_&_Dragons][here]]):

#+begin_quote
  *Strength* - measuring physical power -- your ability to exert your muscles during short time periods against substantial resistance when engaging in compound lifts, sprints, etc.

  *Constitution* - measuring endurance & stamina (how quickly you tire from mild-moderate exertion), as well as overall health (e.g. with respect to immune function)

  *Dexterity* - measuring agility, balance, coordination and reflexes; how clumsy you are doing everything from shooting hoops to walking & driving in a straight line to carrying a stack of pizza boxes

  *Intelligence* - measuring your ability to learn and retain information, understand complex systems, and solve nerdy problems

  *Wisdom* - measuring self-awareness, introspection, and the degree to which you recognize your actions hamper to advance your values

  *Charisma* - measuring force of personality, persuasiveness, leadership, and likeability

  *Willpower* - measuring how well you can follow through on commitments, resist akratic urges, and force yourself to do unpleasant things

  *Happiness* - measuring your 'hedonic set point' -- the ease with which you experience positive emotion in response to positive stimuli, your overall degree of contentment and satisfaction with life, etc.

These are typically measured on 0-10 scale, where your current score corresponds to the percentile of your performance against a demographically corrected baseline (wrt age, sex, etc.). Scores of 0 correspond to being in the 1st percentile and 10 to the 99th, but scores 1-9 to your score*10 percentile (so 1 -> 10th percentile, 5 -> 50th percentile, etc.). Scores outside the 0-10 bounds correspond to increasingly closer fractional percentiles to either bound, with unit scores representing a 10-fold shift in closeness (so a score of 11 puts you in the 99.9th percentile, 12 in the 99.99th percentile; -1 in the 0.1th percentile, -2 in the 0.01th percentile, etc.). Scores more extreme than anything found in existing human populations measure you against arbitrarily large populations summed across parallel earths featuring comparable, but independently rolled individuals (so a score of 20 would roughly put you at 'best out of 125 parallel earths').

Upon accessing this panel, you find that you can increment and decrement your scores as desired, but their sum cannot exceed the sum of scores that currently corresponds to you. Your finite set of points are currently allocated and can be re-allocated, that's all. Upon exiting the menu, the machine rulers of the matrix bar your further access to it, also wiping your memory of ever having changed anything. Your body and mind are otherwise altered to be consistent with your new attributes as elegantly and with as few changes as possible, and your total 'historical expenditures' towards altering each attribute are preserved (so e.g. if you're an elite strongman and dump strength, you get the body of someone who's trained just as thoughtfully and diligently as you have, but is nevertheless not at the 99.9th percentile but at the 0.01th, or whatever. So no 'reapplying' yourself and getting them gains just as easily as your first go around).

How do you change your 'current scores' and why?
