I mean, if I have to live in a world where there's an actual requirement of min/maxxing (and not just doing the rhodium coin like [[/u/WilyCoyotee][u/WilyCoyotee]] mentions), a person could surgically expand their hand so that (after sufficient time, and depending on the power's definition of the word "hand" and some excruciating expanding surgeries or exercises) a person could load a large backpack (possibly not even having to carry it, it could just be attached to them to count as "on their person"), then just about anything that would fit into a certain-sized puck (Probably at least a few feet in diameter) could be duplicated, assuming you nabbed a new person to duplicate it behind.

The power does not limit what exactly you can duplicate, so other powered people that are small enough to squeeze into the puck are a possibility. Generation ships (Arks for restarting humanity elsewhere) just became a lot easier to fuel, with all those people in interstellar space, I get a new puck of fuel--probably plutonium or Uranium, although this is a situation that antimatter may be possible, assuming a loose enough definition of "behind the ear" and "within your hand." (Can antimatter storage be built into my hand, so it appears "within my hand?")Even a few ounces of antimatter per person's lifetime may be enough to fuel the ship indefinitely. Of course, we would have to acquire the antimatter puck to begin with. Alternately, of course, the puck itself could hold the antimatter, so my hand is free to generate other essentials. None of which, however, would generate as much utility based on the constraints as the antimatter.
