I always got the impression that drugs were expensive because of the ludicrous costs of R and D/FDA approval, plus various perverse incentives built into the law that let them jack up the price. Once you've got the means to make some of a drug, there's generally nothing keeping you from continuing to make it, no? You're restricted only by the supply of ingredients. I'm not involved in drug manufacture, mind you, I just work in pharmacy, and as a tech at that.
