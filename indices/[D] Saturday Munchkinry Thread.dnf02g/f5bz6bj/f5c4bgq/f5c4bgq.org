So, you can duplicate a coin, once per person, as a magic trick.

I'd probably figure this out by using my friends and family up, especially if it's only one trick per person. I'd try to obtain a gold coin to duplicate, for money. The original gets returned to whoever I borrow from, and i use the new coin to duplicate further. Gold isn't the most valuable material, but it would be valuable enough to purchase a platinum coin, which is more expensive. Platinum is valuble, but not the /most/ valuable, so I'd shoot for making a coin out of either rhodium, ruthenium, or iridium, whatever turns out to be the most expensive.

With a 1oz coin of rhodium, I'd be making 2500$ or so per person. That's enough to just pay people 20$ to show up and have the trick performed on them. Selling off the rhodium at fair market price will likely be the hardest part. Partnering up with a metal recycling company might be a good move.

Make sure to pay my taxes, the IRS will be very interested with my rapid spike in income.
