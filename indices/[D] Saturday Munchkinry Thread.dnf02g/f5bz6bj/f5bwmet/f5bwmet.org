Reverse munchkinry: What powers would you need to achieve a Men in Black situation? You are in charge of a world-spanning organization that is keeping an significant Secret [in MIB aliens routinely visit earth, many live on earth, and earth have access to sci-fi level technology but it could be hidden vampires etc.] successfully hidden from the world population with modern day technology. Obviously you could achieve this if you had an worldwide 'erase memory' power that triggered automatically every time someone suspects that this is indeed the case. What is the lowest OP power or power combination that could realistically achieve this and who/which organizations would at minimum need to be in on this?

Solutions needs to take into account that:

1. How to handle civilians accidentally being affected by the Secret directly and indirectly [seeing a fight between aliens or family suddenly missing]? How do you make sure that you catch all incidents?
2. How to handle dedicated Secret hunters [conspiracy theorists, astronomers, etc.]?
3. How do you handle leaks from within your own organization? Bigger organizations have higher chances of leaks but even small ones might have big enough disagreements.
4. How do you handle the Secret being revealed by technology [microphone, phones, security cameras, satellites, etc.]?
5. How do you handle incidents that happens in heavily populated areas and are really obvious [such as a space tunnel appearing / spaceships appearing, an aliens who you can't afford to offend and who just wanders around downtown, etc.]

Bonus points if you avoid both mind control. Is this even possible without memory modifications?
