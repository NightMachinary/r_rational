You need powers for this? I'm fairly sure you could solve most of the problems here with money, which you should have plenty of if you're a world-spanning organization. You could probably get away with a whole lot just by spreading false alarms everywhere. Let the snitches and accidental witnesses reveal the recordings of the truth to the public, it will simply be drowned out by a deluge of other "truth"s. Hire lots of actors and costume designers, and regularly make them pretend to be aliens or whatever and claim it is a viral marketing scheme for some movies that you will actually release. Don't focus on making it high quality, its best if the range of quality is all over the place so that the public just thinks you found an exceptionally good actor/costume every once in a while when the truth leaks out.

The only problems you can't cover up this way are disaster-level events. Like if your alien spaceships death ray a city into a pile of molten wreckage, that will be pretty damn hard to hide. But I think in this case you have much much bigger problems.
