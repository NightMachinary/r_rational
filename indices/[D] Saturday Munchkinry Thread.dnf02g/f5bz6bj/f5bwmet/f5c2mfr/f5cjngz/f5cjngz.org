Certainly a solution. I am not fully convinced about the idea of hiding the truth in plain sight though it is plausible that it could work. It seems that it would bring the hypothesis of the Secret being true to the forefront of people's minds when experiencing something immediately unexplainable.

If an alien did something that couldn't be explained by the current technology such as suddenly teleporting, I feel that just running an advertise campaign wouldn't satisfy the confusion of the people who saw it happen.
