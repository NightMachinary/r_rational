The goal is to keep the number of people outside of the organization who knows the Secret low enough that the Secret won't become public knowledge. Don't get me wrong, I think that flooding the media/internet with alternative truth and claim they are part of a marketing campaign is clever and certainly would help reducing the chance of reveal but I think we'd still look at something like a 0.1% annual chance of reveal which isn't quite low enough.

The traitor problem is hardly impossible, you yourself mentioned the loyalty checking/ensuring power. Alternative options is to have them swear a binding oath that they won't reveal the secret to outsiders or install some kind of sci-fi tech that kills them if they make the decision to reveal the secret.
