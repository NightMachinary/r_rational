  I feel that just running an advertise campaign wouldn't satisfy the confusion of the people who saw it happen.

Well, what is the goal here? Hide the truth from the public? Or hide the truth from literally every person who isn't part of the organization? For the former you don't have to care about the few people who directly saw the teleportation. They are a tiny tiny fraction of the population and few will believe their stories when you flood the world with alternative 'truths' and claim they are viral marketing campaigns when caught.

The latter is pretty much impossible: any traitor on the inside tells a close friend/real boss/whatever and you already failed. You would need some kind of loyalty checking/ensuring power to prevent any kind of defection.
