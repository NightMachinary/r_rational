  It seems that it would bring the hypothesis of the Secret being true to the forefront of people's minds when experiencing something immediately unexplainable.

One possible solution to this is to have a False Truth that /doesn't/ match the Real Truth, but /would/ explain many of the observations.

For example, you could make many False Truths regarding the idea of aliens visiting and living on Earth... which makes a great way to hide the Real Truth that the Fae exist, because if anyone sees anything you can ensure that it gets passed off as a marketing campaign for a movie about aliens, and that the Guy Who Saw Something doesn't get believed.
