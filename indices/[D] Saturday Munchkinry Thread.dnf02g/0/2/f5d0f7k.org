Here's some general ways to munchkin those rules:

Rule 3: Make your hand as large as possible. You can have one hand surgically enlarged to increase the size of the coins. This is likely to have a large quality of life cost though.

Rule 4: Doing it in a enclosed and unmonitored room with the volunteer's eyes closed might let you copy coins that wouldn't fit in your fist. If their eyes are closed the coin could have been "hidden" just by being held in your hand unenclosed.

Crazy ideas:

Get ahold of liquid LSD, put it into a coin and replicate to your max. LSD is extremely value dense if you're willing to sell it, and casually throwing a handful into someone's face is a great non-lethal secret weapon.

Be a supervillain. Get ahold of dangerous substances, coinify them and extort the world. Terrify towns with chemical weapons, threaten the world with pathogens and bioweapons if you can get them. Even relatively safe bacteria can be terrifying if you get exposed to grams of them. A coin throwing villain is terrifying when they're full of gas weapons and anthrax. On your person with nonmetallic coins or them disguised as currency would let you move through security with ease.

Reasonable:

Get rich and make the world rich. Make a ton of rare earth metals so chemical engineers can use catalysts for everything, and computers can be made of gold. Use it on complex alloys, carbon nanotubes, and high temperature superconductors.

Pharmaceuticals: if they can make any amount of their drug you can double it until you're making at least tens of grams of it at a time. This is probably where you can earn and help the most once you're established, some drugs are measured in nanograms so you could be the entire production source for them.
