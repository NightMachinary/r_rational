There is a common magic trick of pulling a coin out from behind someone's ear. This is usually done by hiding a coin in your hand first, then reaching out to the back of someone's ear before revealing the coin in your hand.

You on the other hand, have the magical ability to do this trick for real. An actual coin magically appears in your hand whenever you do this trick, under certain conditions:

- The coin that appears is a duplicate of a coin you have on your person when you perform the trick.
- You can only do this once to each person.
- The coin must be small enough to have reasonably been hidden somewhere within your hand during the trick.
- Once your hand is behind a person's ear and out of sight of any observer, the coin will appear within your hand in a place where it could reasonably have been hidden in.

What can you do with this power?
