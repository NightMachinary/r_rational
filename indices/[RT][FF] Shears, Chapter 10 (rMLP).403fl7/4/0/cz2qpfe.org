There are probably others here who just have too much shame on them to admit it. The fact that one person on the subreddit finds it vaguely sexually gratifying means that statistically speaking there are probably others since there are a few thousand people subscribed to this subreddit and probably even more lurking. Of course, I suppose the next obvious response to that is "What do I think I know and how do I think I know it?" Maybe you are the only one.

Although I thought the Confessor and Lord Akon from "Three Worlds Collide" might have made a cute couple if it weren't for the centuries of age-difference, so I'm not one to talk. :P
