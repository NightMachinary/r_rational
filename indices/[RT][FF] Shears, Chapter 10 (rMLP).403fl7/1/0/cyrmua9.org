I think that's a reasonable complaint. Pacing is a very tricky thing. I did my best to move the introductions along relatively quickly, but I couldn't justify writing more coarsely than one chapter per pony. The leading exposition is almost entirely over with, now, though. Arc 1 will be complete in a few chapters. And I hereby swear that not every episode will get a full arc like this one. =p
