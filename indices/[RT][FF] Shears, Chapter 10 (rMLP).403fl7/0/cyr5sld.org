The story begins [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/300693/1/shears/bridges-1][here]].

Basic info is [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3te0fy/rtff_shears_chapter_1_rmlp/cx5d65r][here]].

This chapter was extremely tricky to write, but I'm very satisfied with how it turned out. However, I'm wary of the classic trap of an artist finding their work to be more transparent than it is to someone without their privy knowledge. The chapter is intended to be disorienting---but please tell me if you feel it's too much so.

Comments are greatly appreciated; Shears is considerably more popular in terms of views, ratings, and favorite selections than it is in terms of actual discussion. As always, thanks for reading!
