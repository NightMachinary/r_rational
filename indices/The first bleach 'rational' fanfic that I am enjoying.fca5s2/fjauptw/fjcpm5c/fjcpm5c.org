Yeah, a lot of typos and grammar problems at first glance. Maybe someone who's reading it could make a list for the author to go over.

The most often repeating one I've seen so far (through the first chapter) is an/a in front of non-silent 'h'. =an hero= -> =a hero=, =an Hollow= -> =a Hollow=, etc.

Edit: also past tense (=didn't went= -> =didn't go=)
