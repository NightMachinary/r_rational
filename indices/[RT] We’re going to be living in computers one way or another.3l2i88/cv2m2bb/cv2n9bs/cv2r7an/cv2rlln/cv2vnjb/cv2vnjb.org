[[/u/sam512]] ended the story on a controversial, but realistic, note. It's not the most satisfactory ending, although I wouldn't call it bad. I think he mentioned burning out on fiction a bit, and it's not what I'd consider his best work.

If you're going to read stuff on qntm, read through his short stories, or the ed stories, of fine structure.

I'd read the spoiler, personally.
