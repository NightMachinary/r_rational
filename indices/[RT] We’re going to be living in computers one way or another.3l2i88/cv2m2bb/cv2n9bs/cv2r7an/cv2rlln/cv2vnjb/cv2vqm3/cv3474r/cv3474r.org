Especially the bit on how biologicals still resemble virtuals so much that we, the readers, view them as practically identical!

Sam's Ra [[#s][spoilers]] that the ending comes off as unsatisfactory because it's so far from our current reality.

I love how the biological is called an "old-timey racist" for being non-PC about virtuals. it added a nice centering point that no matter how much things change, human nature still remains the same about the Other.

edit: whoops spoiler formatting fixed!
