  You can keep an upload going in the absolute lap of virtual luxury for the amount of electricity it costs to simulate their brain. Now admittedly VR means things are pretty cheap for us too, but it's still orders of magnitude more. The population's growing exponentially these days, pretty much as fast as they can manufacture more computers for uploads to live on.

This is not a fixed cost. You can use slower, less power hungry computers.

Still too limited hard drive space? o.O For processors, you can just divide the processor time for everyone. They will not notice a difference unless you give them a window to "the real world". Wasn't there an XKCD about this guy who simulated an universe with moving small stones?
