My answer for both aspects is that this a world that until very recently was dominated by biological humans living in real time, and which is still sort of anchored to that. So yes, you could produce a lot more minds running much slower if that's what you wanted to do, but the point isn't to have the maximum number of minds in existence, it's to do something economically useful with them, which is tougher if you make them super-slow.
