As a reader I found JD's first paragraph to be much more attention grabbing, in a "this would make a great first sentence of the first chapter kind" way, than anything before it. I think that's because it immediately connects to something familiar and makes a connection between the reader and the character. The character has an opinion on a topic that the reader has at least secondhand knowledge of, which is a heck of a lot better than starting with a generalized platitude without context.

That said, the first portion did keep my attention sp it's good enough as is in my case.
