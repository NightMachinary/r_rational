The only other story I'm reading on the site is *[[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/][The Last Angel]]*, which is a pretty interesting space opera. The last surviving human-built AI warship looks to extract revenge upon the alien society that destroyed Earth. Very reminiscent of the Halo universe.
