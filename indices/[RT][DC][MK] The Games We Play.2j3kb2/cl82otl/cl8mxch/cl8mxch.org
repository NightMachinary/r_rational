Are you aware of the [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.272850/][With This Ring]] story?

It's the only one I have read on there but it is fantastic. Updates every day with short (~1500 word) updates.

How are you finding stories on that site? After finding With This Ring, I spent some time trying to find other quality fics and had no luck. It doesn't seem to be organized well to find new stuff.
