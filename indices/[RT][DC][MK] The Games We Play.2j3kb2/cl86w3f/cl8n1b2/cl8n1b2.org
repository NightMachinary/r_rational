Just out of curiosity, why don't you think With This Ring would be considered rational? The world it exists in isn't particularly rational, but the SI charachter is constantly recognizing things that don't make sense and attempting to fix them where possible. And since we still don't have an explanation for what the world is or how he got into it, the fact that the SI charachter is the only person (or one of the few at least) that attempts to go about things in a rational manor, maximizing goals, etc., qualifies it in my book.
