I'll second this recommendation. I didn't post it here myself because I'm not sure exactly how rational it would be considered (like with "With This Ring"), but I've been enjoying this fic /thoroughly/ pretty much since it began.

What I'm saying is - whether it's rational or not, it's a good story, and I recommend it for that.
