Story is a crossover between a manga called The Gamer and an anime called RWBY. I have no familiarity with either of them, and this was not a problem. (In fact, I started reading The Gamer after this fic and gave up after a few pages). Requires very basic familiarity with CRPG tropes, at the level of the original Final Fantasy, but I imagine this shouldn't be a problem for most of us.

Link is to the first post of thread 1 of 4. I recommend reading exclusively via the indices on the first posts of each thread, unless you want to slog through ~600 pages of comments. Story appears to be updated consistently with one chapter per day.

One could probably argue for an [RST] tag--there's definitely an awareness of sunk costs and taboo tradeoffs.

On a side note, I am vaguely disappointed that I didn't know about spacebattles.com until very recently. It seems to be at least as good a source of entertaining fiction as FF.net or AO3.
