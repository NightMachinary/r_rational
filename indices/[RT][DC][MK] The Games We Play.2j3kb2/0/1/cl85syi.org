The Gamer.

I've been reading The Gamer. It has a lot of munchkin potential, with a character that can invent new abilities and can choose which stats to boost regardless of how he trained for XP.

He even chooses to mainly boost intellect in the canon.

But the manga hasn't really lived up to its munchkin potential. I still think its good, and i have more than enough time to keep up with something that only updates once a week, but there's a reason I never opted to post it here.

Edit: That does also make it ripe for making rational.
