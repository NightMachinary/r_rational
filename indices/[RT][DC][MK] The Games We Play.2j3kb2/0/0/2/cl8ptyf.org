Yep, I've read the first few pages of With This Ring and it's on my to-read list.

I sorted the Creative Writing forum [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/forums/creative-writing.18/?order=view_count][by views]] as a proxy for popularity. Popularity != quality, but it should at least have a non-zero correlation with the enjoyability of the story. Then I skimmed the opening posts of the first few threads. It just happened that The Games We Play was both enjoyable /and/ rational-ish. (EDIT: I may just have gotten lucky in stumbling upon TGWP. Continuing the above method in an attempt to find more interesting stories has been a failure so far...)
