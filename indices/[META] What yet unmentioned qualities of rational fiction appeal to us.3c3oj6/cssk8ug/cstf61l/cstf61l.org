  Real life is governed by rules: the laws of physics and mathematics, and their consequences in terms of human behavior and so on -- we do not always understand them, but they exist.

  Rational fiction lets us explore a more optimizable universe than reality, where the laws can be understood by the reader and where the characters are more capable of taking those rules and running with them unhindered by self-doubt or realistic uncertainty.

I really liked this point of yours. Fiction is a possibility for us to live in an universe which is easier to understand. Real life math is incredibly complicated and would take aeons to understand because there are so many branches in it.
