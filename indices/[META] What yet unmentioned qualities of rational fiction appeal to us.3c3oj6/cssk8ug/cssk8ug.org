Rational fiction has plots that makes sense and characters who don't hold the idiot ball. Real life is governed by rules: the laws of physics and mathematics, and their consequences in terms of human behavior and so on -- we do not always understand them, but they exist. Also, while the people do sometimes "hold the idiot ball", there are reasons (stress, lack of education, low IQ, group coordination issues, mental health problems, etc).

Rational fiction lets us explore a more optimizable universe than reality, where the laws can be understood by the reader and where the characters are more capable of taking those rules and running with them unhindered by self-doubt or realistic uncertainty.

This is a form of escapist fantasy, but also a way of reinforcing a preference: We prefer to know the rules of our reality, and we prefer to be smart enough to use those rules to our advantage.

Non-rationalist works often take the form of a universe that is essentially non-optimizable. The rules that the character knows are just for flavor, and the character doesn't take many opportunities to exploit them. Instead of rules, the world is best thought of as a container for flavors. The scenes, characters, and so on are simply a collection of flavors -- good, evil, smart, stupid, and so on are labels for characters playing certain roles, not coherent descriptions of goal seeking. These conspire to keep the reader interested while they are immersed, but the objective was never to prepare the reader for real-world problems or real humans they will meet.

These works can be frustrating to process for a rationalist. The work may hit all the notes that keep you interested in reading, but does not educate you in a way that prepares you to handle realistic problems. That makes it feel incomplete or like the story was told "wrong", despite the fact that the author achieved their goal of building a fan base and making money through it. So one reason we like rational fiction is because of how silly it makes other stuff look.
