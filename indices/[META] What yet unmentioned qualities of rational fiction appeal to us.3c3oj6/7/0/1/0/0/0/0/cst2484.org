Isn't the whole premise that the dude finds himself inexplicably in a world that functions according to D&D rules? I mean without that all the rules you decide on either seem completely arbitrary or they remain the same D&D rules as before, just hidden behind a thin facade. Thus pretty much being nothing more than exploiting a loophole in order to make money from WotC's IP.

Or am I missing something here?
