I stripped all the copyrighted material. Names of everything were changed -- spells, action types, exact numbers, etc. If you knew what it was before you'll still recognize it, but there's nothing left of the actual copyrighted D&D material. It requires some reworking -- there needs to be more explanation so that readers who aren't ready familiar with the world's rules by knowing D&D will be able to follow what's going on. That wasn't as bad as you might think, though -- I never assumed that my readers knew all the D&D rules.

And, of course, there's been a heavy edit. All the bits I thought weren't actually that great were removed, new stuff was added, etc.
