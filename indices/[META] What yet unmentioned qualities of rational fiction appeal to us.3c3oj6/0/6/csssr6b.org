I agree with most of what you said except that I'd really like to see a rational(ist) story with plenty of romance that doesn't rely on stupid misunderstandings, misplaced suspicions, lack of respect or outright idiocy. I know that fresh love actually makes you act less rationally in the real world too but what typically happens in some mainstream stories is just painful.
