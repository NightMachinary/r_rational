Insight porn is the first thing I thought of when I read the header. And man, I do love a good "cold ruthless" character.

Other things I've noticed:

- The feeling of reading something by someone who just /gets you./

- Much better technobabble. Solid science, when there is any.

- The really good works don't crumble when stared at long enough. /Worm/, for example. I think /The Metropolitan Man/ falls into this category.

- Intelligent and wonderful 'antagonists' a la Rationalmort and CelestAI.

- Solid and interesting philosophy, when there is any. You won't see any, "Hmm... Does God exist? Are we alone? Alas, it can never truly be known." Or, "Do you think there's life out there, Timmy?"

- +There is often /much/ less romance in rationalfics. HPMOR, Worm, Ra, FiO, Scott Alexander's fics, etc. I don't know how many other people think this is appealing, but I find it /refreshing/.+

Edit: I think the last point has been contested enough to earn a strikethrough. It does not seem to be the majority opinion, but I'll leave it there anyways.
