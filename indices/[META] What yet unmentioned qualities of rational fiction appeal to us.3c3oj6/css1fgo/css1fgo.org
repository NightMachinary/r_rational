We are a group who reads fanfiction and other web-published fiction a lot. What are the primary problems and worst troubles that such works to founder upon the rocks of our sensibilities and sink beneath the line of readability?

Well, OK, the first /is/ definitely lack of grammar/spelling/lucidity.

And yes, the second /is/ the common Mary Sue characterization and self-indulgent writing that afflicts rational fiction at least as much as it does the rest of fanfiction/web writing.

However, a close third, in my mind, is what I have come to think of as directionless fiction. When your ship lacks a rudder and isn't even trying to navigate and doesn't even have a port it's trying to get to, the fact that it ends up smashing into rocks an awful lot isn't surprising. This plagues fanfiction, and unedited / unpublished works in general. A lot of stories are written without having a conscious plan of where to go, what they are trying to do, or what will happen next. So many technically proficient writers are writing in fanfiction especially without a plan for even the next chapter when writing the current chapter, and without a plan for the story as a whole.

This tends to result in overblown messes that meander through a bunch of triviality without getting to anything resembling a point. Consider the word counts of the first two Potter novels - 76 944, and 85 141. Now consider how many fics that we've all seen with word counts around the cumulative total length (162 085) where a quarter as many important events happen as in a single Harry Potter novel - probably /most/ of the fanfic I've seen falls into this category. However, when you don't actually have an idea of where you're going, it's hard to cut out the bits that don't matter to getting you there. With no plan, no thought as to what will happen next, the most common strategy is to toss down a morass of words about random trivialities in the hopes that a story will emerge. These fics can be written technically well, and may well have interesting scenes and ideas, but they lack an overarching direction that directs the story and focuses it on important events instead of wasting the reader's time.

In contrast, a lot of the virtues of Rational fiction tend to FORCE a degree of planning ahead and strategizing and thinking out the direction of the story. The story having a consistent, coherent background and setting with realistic factions and peopled with coherent people forces a degree of planning ahead to make it all 'makes sense', but even more is due to the tendency to set up puzzles and foreshadowing and explanations and so forth. Doing this properly requires that before you begin writing you have an idea of where the plot is going, how things are going to be resolved, and what is overall going to happen. This means that, therefore, you are able to consider when writing it if the stuff you are writing actually contributes substantially to advancing the plot, or if it's extraneous dross that's going nowhere, or if it's interesting decorating and worth including on it's own merit even though it's not directly important.

Even rationalist fanfiction like HPMOR has a bunch of stuff that's extraneous to the main plot (e.g. most of the Ender's Game pastiches) but at least including that stuff felt like a conscious decision on the part of the author ('yes, this is entertaining and valueable in itself even though it goes nowhere and doesn't matter') instead of the blind flailing that so characterizes (fan)fiction without any planning or goals. Not having a clear goal or ending when starting out writing seems to lead to very frequently not having a satisfying conclusion (or indeed /ever/ concluding - the number of fanfics that are started dwarfs those that are finished). Even more so, if it does end up concluding the reader ends up looking back at the story as a whole and thinking "well, this story would be really good if you edited out about 75% of it". There are ten dozen fics I could recommend to people - if they had taken a big red pen and crossed out like half or more of the wordcount.

Raymond Chandler's famous advice - "When in Doubt Have a Man Come Through a Door with a Gun in His Hand" - creates great pulp writing, and it allows writers to toss out extremely large amounts of words with a minimum of difficulty, but the strategy of having no plan and not knowing where you're going doesn't often create stories that move me or make me remember them. It can work better if you go back and revise your opening when you know where the plot is going - but fanfic authors rarely go back and even fix blatant spelling/grammar errors, much less rewrite entire chapters to work better.

Having ninjas suddenly burst through the wall because you don't know where the story should go rarely feels like a great plot twist, even in Naruto fanfic, if you don't go back afterwards and figure out a place and reason for the ninjas to work into the story naturally. It's much rarer in fanfiction and amateur work to have undirected writing produce a good, interesting plot compared to something more consciously directed and created with an actual focused goal - probably because of lack of editing into a coherent whole afterwards.
