For me, one thing I enjoy a lot is the levels of strategy and planning you can often find in a rationalist work. In a lot of fiction, a person asks about the protagonist's childhood because he's interested, or it's backstory time, or because they want to soapbox about how terrible it is. In a rationalist work, he asks as part of a highly manipulative strategy to get you to contrast how it was with how it should have been as a larger part of his overarching plan to seduce you away to his side of the conflict.

In an average story you can read between the lines and maybe you'll find an easter egg if you're lucky, but most of the time you just find disappointment. In a rationalist story there's almost always something else going on, and if you look hard enough you can see huge churning cogs and interconnected events behind the small peephole you have the view the characters.

That, and I dislike it when characters use their resources in an ineffective or silly manner. This happens less in rationalist stories, which is nice.
