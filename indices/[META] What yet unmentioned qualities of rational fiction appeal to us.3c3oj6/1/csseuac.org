Taking that further: the term "Rationalist Fiction" sounds the same to me as does the term "Christian Music." Both are a description not of genre, but of the clustered preferences of a subculture with shared norms, formative experiences, and some otherwise-uncommon opinions about certain philosophical subjects, that make them hold certain expectations in common about the world.

Or, to follow in going all Robin Hanson: if stories are about /venerating group norms/ (I can't find a post purely on that topic, but [[http://www.overcomingbias.com/2012/05/stories-are-like-religion.html][this]] is an ancillary one), then "rationalist stories" must be about /venerating rationalist norms/. If stories are "narrative" rather than "disconnected sequences of events" insofar as they have some sort of /karmic force/ at work in them, then rationalist stories would be those whose events progress by some engine of /rationalist karma/.

Exploring what exactly "rationalist karma" would entail is a whole question of its own, though. Some initial thoughts:

- A good example might be to compare the reactions of the gods in 2YE (arbiters of the story's rationalist karma) with the reactions of actual mythical gods (arbiters of traditional narrative karma) to similar acts of hubris.

- Rationalist karma lets rationalists get away with various munchkinry. It seems like this model closely parallels that of reality, where rationalists "get away with" things like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process][feeding the world's population by generating ammonia from thin air]].

- The Spirit of Rationalist Karma also punishes those who blithely /rely/ on things to "go the way they do in stories", which is to say, rely on things to work out in the way that The Spirit of Traditional Narrative Karma makes them work out.
