  From my personal experience, I don't understand how anyone can ever be fooled by a dream. I literally have never had the experience where I'm in a dream but not aware that I'm dreaming. Further, in all cases but one dreaming has been very indistinct; I can't understand how anyone could possibly be fooled into thinking they're fully awake to the extent of needing "tricks" to check. Isn't it immediately obvious?

I think you're often semi-consciously aware that it's a dream, but definitely not all the time. I've had dreams that were literally indistinguishable from my everyday life.

Everyone's dreams are a bit different.
