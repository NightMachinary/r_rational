Actual fiction about science. Generally, what is called science fiction is not about the characters thinking in a scientific way to discover stuff about their environment.

Some of the rationalist fiction, however, has significant sections of characters working out how things work, by observing, thinking about the observations, forming a testable hypothesis, testing it, and drawing a conclusion from the results. The observations that start it all off may be fictional, but the reasoning process to get from observations through a hypothesis and experimentation is very much the process of real science, and can be very interesting.
