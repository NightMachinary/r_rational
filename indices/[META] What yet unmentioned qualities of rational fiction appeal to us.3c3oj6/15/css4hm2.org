An interesting article you linked there ("insight porn"). Several things I want to talk about in relation to it, and this post.

#+begin_quote
  Dreams ordinarily fool us; despite their incoherence, we accept them as fully real while we are in them. ...

  Dreams demonstrate that our brains (and even rat brains) are capable of creating complex, immersive, fully convincing simulations. Waking life is also a kind of dream. Our consciousness exists, and is shown particular aspects of reality. We see what we see for adaptive reasons, not because it is the truth.

I am extremely interested to know to what extent this is true in your experience. From my personal experience, I don't understand how anyone can ever be fooled by a dream. I literally have never had the experience where I'm in a dream but not aware that I'm dreaming. Further, in all cases but one dreaming has been very indistinct; I can't understand how anyone could possibly be fooled into thinking they're fully awake to the extent of needing "tricks" to check. Isn't it immediately obvious?

With regard to the second point, this article: [[http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00577/full]] was interesting.

Back to rational fiction. I think the general point of "insight porn" is a factor, although it's rare to find an actually new insight. It's more that it's interesting to experience different perspectives on things, and the kind of subject matter we often deal with is not common elsewhere.

I find that the quality I care about most in fiction (or any work) is that it's well thought through. This doesn't necessarily mean consistent or rational (or accurate), but rather that...Argh. I struggle to capture this concept in words. My brain is suggesting things like "high entropy" or "meaningful". It's that every element is there for a reason; carefully considered. It's like Bach's music, when he plays with a theme, and continues, and continues, and /just/ when it would start to get repetitive, he moves on. It's when you observe someone at the pinnacle of skill: their every action is significant, every move speaks volumes. It's, I suppose, "fitness for a particular purpose," especially where that purpose is nontrivial. I'm not exactly saying that rational fiction is all like this, but there is some correlation. Similar to "rewards readers thinking," I guess; "is worth thinking about." "Amenable to analysis." You can have some confidence that there is something there, rather than "just because" arbitrariness, which often happens when people don't think things through properly.

The other major correlation is self-awareness [of characters]. I generally don't have a problem with suspension of disbelief, but I do find it difficult to sympathise with characters that don't show any evidence of self-awareness. Closely related is Yudkowsky's "spark of optimisation" of "Level I Intelligent" characters.

As to "real reasons," well, it's hard to say. All I can say is that I clearly get something out of it; my best guesses as to the "abstract" reasons are above, even if what's actually going on is rather more mundane.

(By the way, regarding insight porn: [[http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/][Mencius Moldbug's Unqualified Reservations]] was addictive reading. For what it's worth, I think his descriptive insights and general approach to analysis are an interesting perspective to keep in mind. However, his normative prescriptions are very shaky. It can be hard to separate the two; he engages in that time-honoured tradition pointed out by Hume as the is-ought problem.)
