I would absolutely agree with this. The stories I've read on here are captivating in that I can start reading and then finish a story seemingly on the same breath, only to find that hours have gone by. There are very few times when I'm reading stories posted here where the immersion is broken. Even little hiccups add up, making other reads some degree of jolting as I have to regularly re-immerse myself in the world.
