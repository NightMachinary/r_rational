Rational fiction surprises me in two ways, the first is the standard munchkinry, unforeseen (but obvious in hindsight) consequences, and the like. The second is by doing things that any sane person would expect to happen, but defying standard literary tropes.

As a recent example of #2, I was reading [[#s][Book title]] (spoilers ahead), and the ice freighter spaceship that one of the main characters was an officer of came under attack from an advanced warship (he was in a shuttle at the time). The torpedoes were still a few minutes out, so the captain ordered the engineer to override the safety limits on the engines, the comm officer to try jamming its targeting with their radar array, and a few other measures. The engineer is very good at her job, and warned that the structure of the ship couldn't hold against that much thrust, but acquiesced after being ordered again. The support struts holding the engine in place failed shortly after that, making them sitting ducks. The jamming and other measures were similarly ineffective, and the torpedo hit, destroying the ship and killing everyone on board. This /completely blindsided/ me, because it doesn't follow the standard literary formula of a plucky ship full of misfits consistently defying the odds. Any sane person would tell you that warship vs. freighter is a foregone conclusion, but it sure didn't feel that way.
