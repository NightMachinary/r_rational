It seems that I love rational fiction for much of the same reasons that you do.

-Definitely the insight porn. There's usually just not enough good-quality insight in other literature, and rational fiction tries to compensate for that.

-Also, it's really, REALLY refreshing to see an actually smart person as the main hero of a story, rather than being stuck as the sidekick or the villain, like they usually are. In the rare cases outside of rational fiction where the hero is "smart", their intelligence is told to the reader, or implied by things like having glasses or using incomprehensible technobabble or having a PhD, rather than actually showing their intelligence in how they USE it to solve problems. Like Jimmy Neutron, who puts his fingers to his ears to block out the noise, then says "Think...think...think...BRAINBLAST!" and suddenly has the solution to the problem. And he's also a strawman who causes every problem that he solves, despite supposedly being the smartest character in the show.

The fact that real intelligence is so commonly depicted as being a bad thing, or only being useful for providing the REAL heroes with cool gadgets, something that's uncool and sometimes even making you evil (by your lust for knowledge and power and immortality, or something), I find to actually be very hurtful. Rational fiction doesn't misrepresent smart people that way, though.

I really like how rational fiction has more realistic characters with more realistic motivations, regardless of whether they're the hero or the villain.

It would be nice if rational fiction had more focus on the characters and their relationships, both romantic and platonic, without hijacking the plot. Part of the problem with this, it seems, is that when you're trying to depict characters realistically, you can't make them fall in love, it has to happen naturally or not at all (unless you have a sufficiently reasonable explanation for it, like in Luminosity). Characters become friends or partners for their own reasons, not the author's. Maybe if you had a LOT of realistic characters and stuck them together enough times over an extended period of time, eventually you'd have some romantic relationships.

That being said, while I would like to see more romance in rational fiction, it's still refreshing the way it is since there is TOO MUCH ROMANCE EVERYWHERE ELSE.

And the more coherent worldbuilding is a big plus as well. It makes it feel like the world in the story can really be explored, rather than being boxed in by contrived coincidences and idiot balls and all the other things that the precious plot might demand in order to not be derailed. In rational fiction, if the characters try to derail the plot, the plot /moves with them/. The story adapts to the characters' choices rather than controlling the characters' choices because the story is actually driven in large part by the characters choices, (the other driver of course being the setting), rather than author fiat.
