I think your last point is incorrect. There is a lot of romance in Worm, the same is true for Ra, Scott Alexander's has written stories with romance as a major point (The Story of Emily and Control). You didn't mention Luminosity but romance is central to the plot of it. Unless outside of rational fiction you mostly read romance novels I really don't see why you think rational fiction has a notably small amount of romance.
