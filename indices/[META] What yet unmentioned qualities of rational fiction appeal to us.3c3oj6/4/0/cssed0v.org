  onsider the word counts of the first two Potter novels - 76 944, and 85 141. Now consider how many fics that we've all seen with word counts around the cumulative total length (162 085) where a quarter as many important events happen as in a single Harry Potter novel - probably most of the fanfic I've seen falls into this category.

I wouldn't make this particular comparison---each Harry Potter book was /drafted/ (there were many drafts), and then /edited/ (by a person who edits books professionally), and then published. Most fanfic is just typed into Word, read over, (sadly optionally) spell-corrected, and then published. Even the best rational fiction resembles the "weekly pulp serial" format much more than it resembles a Novel that's been through the publishing industry.
