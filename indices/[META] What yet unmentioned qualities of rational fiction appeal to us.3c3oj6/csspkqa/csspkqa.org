Honestly...

I realized a while ago that I can enjoy basically anything as long as the writing style is not too shit (and the writer knows how to use correct grammar & spell check). Though I do also enjoy it the same way as others here do.

So my liking of rationalist fiction is less to do with rationalist fiction and much more to do with the fact that it usually attracts at least vaguely competent writers, so I have to spend less time looking through the crap that is FF to get to the gems.

If I have to read 'instantley he instantly died' or something similar one more time...
