Yeah, I agree with this. My analysis is for them being roughly five times stronger than humans, but it's entirely possible that +no one did the math+ magic is involved somehow. It's hard to peg what the actual difference between a giant and a human is in canon though, if it's consistent at all (which it might not be, because +no one did the math+ of magic).
