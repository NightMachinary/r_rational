It depends on how their strength scales. If a giant is twice the height of a human, then it's eight times as massive. What's the strength-to-weight ratio? Strength per mass goes down as size increases, generally speaking. So let's say that a giant is twice the height of a human with eight times the mass and five times the strength.

Using them as siege weapons almost certainly isn't efficient, since you can just have five men carrying a battering ram. It's /possible/ that they're able to concentrate their force into a smaller area and break down a door more effectively than men with siege tools, but I sort of doubt it. If you do the math, I don't think a Game of Thrones sized giant throwing rocks can do a proper siege either, since castles should be prepared to defend against catapults, trebuchets, etc. which fire much larger projectiles. There's the possibility of the giant climbing the walls, but that depends on the particulars of the fortification in question, and you don't want to send your giant in on his own, where he's vulnerable.

A properly outfitted giant on the field of battle is another story entirely. Give him a sword and not only can he strike with the strength of five men, but he'd also have a much longer reach. That allows him to break through non-giant formations with relative ease. Also, the greatly increased range means that a giant can use slower, heavier weapons relative to his size. Obviously you'd need to armor the giant as well, because he'll be a large target, but it's totally worth it. A giant can probably handle cavalry pretty easily, so long as he doesn't get completely flanked.

I suppose it's also possible that a giant would do well as an archer, but it's my understanding that longbowmen were more about launching huge numbers of arrows into the air than hitting a target precisely. You'd have to do the math to see what kind of draw the giant would have and how far the effective range would be, but that's hard enough when talking about historical human archers. Intuition tells me it wouldn't be worth it, but I don't know how much to trust that.

(My biggest problem with that episode was that they didn't give the giant a weapon. In the books, the giants used large rocks tied to trees, but in the show he was just using his hands, presumably because it would have messed up their ideas for the battle if he'd been as effective as he should have been. (The lack of proper armor can be chalked up to not having the time or resources.) (I also have some trouble with the plausibility of a giant using his bare hands to break down a door meant to hold off armies with siege weapons.))
