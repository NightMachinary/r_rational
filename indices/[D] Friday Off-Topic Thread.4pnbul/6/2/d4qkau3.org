As large as they are, they would become targets for every ranged combatant on the enemy side. If they cannot be armored well enough to turn projectiles, you would not want to use them in most direct combat.

However, they would likely do extremely well tending siege weapons. A giant could load a ballista like a human loads a crossbow. Stone throw rate would be dramatically increased for catapults designed for giants to wind and load. Keep them away from the walls, because they will die rapidly to a competent defender with a ballista.

In an open field battle where archers and/or other ranged combatants are absent or have been routed, a giant with a long weapon would be insanely effective.
