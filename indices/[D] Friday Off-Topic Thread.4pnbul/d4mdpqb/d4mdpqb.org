  "Ha! it was me! I set up those bombs and killed all those people, to learn more about you and your powers!

  "Oh. And you're telling me this why?"

  "As if you could do anything with the information. You can't prove a thing."

  "Okay, forget for a moment that I work for the Men In Black, who have full discretion and a rather low standard of proof. And forget that the person you're taunting is a superhuman who could get angry, in which case they'll never find the body because the body will be a trail of plasma in the stratosphere. /You haven't actually answered my question./"
