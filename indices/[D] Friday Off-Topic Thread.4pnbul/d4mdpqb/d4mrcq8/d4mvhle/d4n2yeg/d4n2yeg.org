I really liked /Steelheart/ by Brandon Sanderson for how he dealt with fighting supervillains. The main character is heavily focused on researching his targets (and Epics (the supervillains) in general), and his primary form of classification is whether or not they have a "prime invulnerability", which is to say: "can you kill them with a sniper rifle?"

If you can kill them with a gun, then kill them with a gun. If you can't, continue researching until you find their inevitable weakness (in-story inevitable, not just narratively inevitable).
