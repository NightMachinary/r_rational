Finally getting over my depressive phase, these days have sucked big time and I can't believe I actually spent two whole days asleep just so that I wouldn't have to think.

It seemed to do the work and now I'm feeling more optimistic (although also a lot more aggresive than usual). Still tired though, trying to come up with some strategy to get back to normal faster and make up for the huge delay on everything.

Seriously, fuck bipolarity/whatever it is I have (even if the manic phases are amazing to my productivity...). Planning to order more *adrafinil* because its the only thing that has kept me somewhat awake and probably seek a specialist.

Also started an anime called *[[http://myanimelist.net/anime/18153/Kyoukai_no_Kanata][Kyoukai no kanata]]* which has some really low reviews. Its a SoL with supernatural elements about demon hunters, makes me think a bit of Madoka Magica with better animation but worse music and slower plot. Managed to watch a bit but lost interest after the depressive episode began, currently retaking it and seeing if it could work for a fic.
