I'm more a fan of anime than you are but I agree a lot of shows fall apart later on. In my opinion it's because shows try to stand out with interesting premises but little direction. Shows with simpler premises but good execution are more reliable in anime, such as Shirobako or Shokugeki no Soma. Though there are some great shows with interesting premises such as Zetsuen no Tempest, Madoka, and Steins;Gate.
