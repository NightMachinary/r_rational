  if the character was an unemotional rational agent, he could just brute-force the scenario and there would be no story.

Well, there would be a very /different/ kind of story. One that's getting kind of overplayed. I was glad to discover a time loop story where the protagonist does /not/ swiftly become an aloof schemer who muchkins through suicide.

The protagonist is not my favourite kind of anime archetype, to say the least. But it's one /completely unsuited/ to a life of mystery, violence, and short-lived relationships. I find it interesting to watch him fail to cope.
