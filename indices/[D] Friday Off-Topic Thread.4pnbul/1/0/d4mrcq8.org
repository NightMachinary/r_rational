Superhero shows are full of irrationality. I've been watching Season 1 of The Flash recently, and while I like some parts of it, the Flash's refusal to incapacitate or disarm obvious villains (instead giving them time to act by starting with dialogue) is severely grating. Why would you stop with the superspeed mode to /talk/ to the guy with the cold gun and allowing him time to plan and act and cause severe property damage, instead of taking the cold raygun out of his hands before he can do anything, tossing it out the nearest window, and THEN talking to him? Why is the cold-gun villain taking time to explain yourself to The Flash while he's incapacitated, when the villain fully intends to shoot him and kill him afterwards? The villain killed his underling instantly without gloating at all earlier in the show in a rare display of competence, why is he now pissing about with the Flash?

There are lots of really good Doylist reasons to have lots of dialogue between hero and villain, but it would be really nice if the writers put in any amount of effort at all for a plausible Watsonian reason. Give the freeze gun a reloading thing that the villain can fumble with for his part, for example.
