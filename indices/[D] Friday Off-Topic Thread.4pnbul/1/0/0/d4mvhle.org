Also: the freeze gun is /not that scary/. It is not a particularly effective weapon, nor does it make you immune to bullets. Yet we're supposed to believe it lets its wielder take on a police station, threaten a speedster, and qualify as a supervillain.

(It's supposed to be extra scary because cold disables speedsters. Well, so does a bullet to the face. The difficulty is hitting them, not harming them.)

God, don't get me started on The Flash, it's nonsense through and through.
