I just watched it tonight.

I loved it; it was basically what I felt the show was promising from the early episodes. That final conversation was well done and showed a depth of character that the series dips into occasionally. Essentially, it's a reason for me to keep watching the series. The tonal mixing also worked better for me this episode, and that's been one of the points that's been hit-and-miss.

I'm still leery of the series though, for aforementioned reasons, but maybe I'll just sit through some of the stuff that I'm not enjoying if there's more character conflict/development like in this episode.
