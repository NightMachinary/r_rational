My opinion on Re:Zero is mostly that way because of how expectations were set. The first arc introduced a lot of characters and intrigue, but then that all got pared away to focus on life at the manor (which is itself a subplot of the crowning, but only barely). The time loop also sort of falls by the wayside, except in that it allows the main character an excuse to be extremely reckless. I don't know, I really try to appreciate things for what they are rather than what I want them to be, but for this particular series I'm having trouble with that, mostly because of how the focus has shifted.
