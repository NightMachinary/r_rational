I think the answer is to look at which anime don't. /MONSTER/ doesn't. /Steins;Gate/ doesn't. Madoka doesn't. What others don't, and why?

I know /MONSTER/ is seinen and adapted from a mangaka with a large following. I know Steins;Gate was adapted from a visual novel/video game.

I'll hypothesize that some of it is planning, as others have mentioned. I also think it's related to how closely the producers and writers must hew to established conventions of Japanese media. Each of the above has characters that come across as real people, and few if any that are two dimension archetypes. Haruhi, for example, is strongest when it shows each character actively pursuing their own goals and weakest when genre convention and archetype shunt those goals into the background.

That said, I'm not well versed in manga or anime; I'll leave the discussion here.
