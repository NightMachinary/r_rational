Why do so many anime fall apart? I've been watching /Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress/ (/Koutetsujou no Kabaneri/) and just shaking my head at how stupid everyone is acting. It wasn't like that in the beginning, or even the first few episodes. (At first I thought I was being picky, but when I went to [[/r/anime]] they were largely in agreement, so I'm probably not entirely off-base.)

So /why/ does this happen? Why do good things stop being good? Is it just a matter of authors not knowing how to keep the plot in motion, or not knowing how to end things? Is it that fewer resources are devoted to a project the longer it's gone on? I can understand interest waning, since I've definitely felt that myself, but is that really the big driver of declining quality?

(I'm feeling the same way about Re:Zero, but while last episode didn't do terribly much to advance the plot, at least it contained an interesting side story with better characterization than I've seen so far.)
