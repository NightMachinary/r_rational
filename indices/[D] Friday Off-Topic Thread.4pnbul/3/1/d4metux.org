Same reason most fanfiction falls apart and how most books can't follow the rational ideal. I've always thought its important to have a team that checks the plot and advises against undesirable plot holes because one single person can't account for all possible interpretations of his work.

I think there's also pressure for some elements like a certain amount of fanservice in every anime to get certain demographics (otakus are the ones that buy the goods after all, and those are the main source of income).

I remember having seen some really good works that were very interesting yet were a commercial failure because they didn't follow conventions of how an anime/story must be.

I think Young Justice was cancelled due to the same reasons in the West.
