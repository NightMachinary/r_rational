  Why do so many anime fall apart?

It at least stops surprising you if you think of anime as the fast food of the Japanese media-industry: even Sturgeon's law doesn't hold true for season-long anime. So continuing the analogy, a nice diet would be to watch quality works like the ones produced by Ghibli and /sometimes/ watch specific anime titles like HÃ—H while still having the expectation that the plot will eventually get to suck.
