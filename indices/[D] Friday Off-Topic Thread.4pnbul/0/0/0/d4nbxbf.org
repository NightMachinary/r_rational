  I've been wanting to pick Jim's brain about The Dresden Files for ages... might be better if I don't though, because I'd probably just vacillate between fanboying and criticizing some of his writing choices

So much. I enjoy the series a lot, and have reread most of the books maybe five times, but I wish there wasn't so much special treatment given to Christianity. My main gripe with Skin Game though was how poorly Nicodemus planned things. Since he knew the relics were all in the same place (He knew both the grail and the knife were there, at least), and /especially/ knowing Mab compulsively keeps her word all the time every time, he should have just said he wanted all the relics there, not betrayed, and if he just couldn't help himself but try to kill Harry, he should have just carried around a big chunk of polonium in his backpack throughout the mission. The noose makes him immortal, his fallen angel gives him regeneration, and the poisoning would be slow enough Harry wouldn't have noticed until after the mission.
