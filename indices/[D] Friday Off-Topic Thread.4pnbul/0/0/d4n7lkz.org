Lucky sod. I've been wanting to pick Jim's brain about The Dresden Files for ages... might be better if I don't though, because I'd probably just vacillate between fanboying and criticizing some of his writing choices (the Deus Ex Machina of the latest book was really offputting, for me, and the representation of the Abrahamic Religions as purely good compared to all the other gods and belief systems has troubling implications for an ostensibly Kitchen Sink fantasy series).
