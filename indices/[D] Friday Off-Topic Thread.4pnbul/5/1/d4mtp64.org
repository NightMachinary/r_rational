I would be very interested. It seems several people here are. The main problem is probably /keeping it going/ once it starts up. Play By Post games tend to die the first time there is a battle, and voice games tend to have time zone issues. I alas am European, and since most of you are American, I'd have to play in the middle of the night, most likely.

If somehow a group could be formed willing to play at Saturday or Sunday noonish EST, I would be very happy to be the game master for a D&D 3.5 game. Or a player for any system.
