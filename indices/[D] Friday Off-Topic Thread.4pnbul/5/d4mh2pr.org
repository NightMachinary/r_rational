Is anyone interested in setting up a tabletop roleplaying game over the internet? Maybe it's just ingroup favouritism, but I've always wanted to play something like Dungeons and Dragons, FATE, or Mutants and Masterminds with other people from the subreddit.

NEWER EDIT: We have a Google Doc and a Discord chat now.

EDIT: The next step would be a discussion about the details of what, exactly, we're doing, preferably in a different format. I don't really have anything that strikes me as a /good/ idea for how to do this, but since I'm temporarily in charge by divine right of Schelling Point, I'm going to use this as a test to see if we can all show up in the same place at the same time. Everyone who acknowledges my vague legitimacy and/or doesn't have any better ideas should try to log on to the #reddit-rational IRC channel at 2PM (7 PM GMT) either tomorrow or the day after (Saturday June 25 and Sunday June 26, respectively). I'll be on the IRC as much as possible this weekend, primarily between noon and midnight Eastern Standard Time (5PM and 5AM GMT), so if you do happen to miss the time we'll still be able to chat.

If you /do/ have any better ideas, "better" meaning "good enough to be worth confusing the issue and possibly not being able to get the basics done over the weekend", PM me and I'll signal boost you. I'll be PMing this message to everyone who posted to make sure it gets out. Anyone and everyone should feel free to show up and chat with me, even if you didn't post in this thread; I'll try to get a headcount and some first impressions for what games everyone prefers.
