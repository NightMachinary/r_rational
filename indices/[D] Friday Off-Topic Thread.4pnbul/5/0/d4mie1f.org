I'm tentatively in favor, as my long-standing D&D group appears to have suffered a fatal blow that it's not going to recover from anytime soon. It really depends on what kind of GM you have and how regular the schedule is (I'm system ambivalent). If you're still looking for a GM, I have a half dozen settings and campaigns that can be dusted off for play (D&D, M&M, or Pathfinder).

Edit: CST for me.
