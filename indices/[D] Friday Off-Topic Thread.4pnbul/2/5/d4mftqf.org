I do have a question- on Reddit and most articles I've read, it seems clear that leaving the EU has a lot of costs and that meanwhile the benefits promised to the Brexist supporters are unlikely to be delivered (more control over immigration, save large sums of money that instead will go to NHS).

What are the main factors in why this still got so much support and ultimately passed? I don't doubt my simplistic reasoning above is missing a lot, but I've also heard that there's an attitude similar to Trump supporters in the United States of unhappiness with the status quo and using this as an opportunity to show it.
