I really enjoyed [[http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2016/06/tomorrow-belongs-to-me.html][Charles Stross venting about it]] on his blog, but don't know enough about the issues at hand to do much more than spout off an under-informed opinion. And I'm American, so have no eggs in that basket except as they relate to the global economy.
