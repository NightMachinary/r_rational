  Also Cameron resigning seems kind of nuts to me, but I don't totally follow UK politics.

The Prime Minister is supposed to represent the will of the people. The will of the people was directly opposed to him, and he wasn't able to control his own party. While I don't like him, I think the alternatives are worse (especially Boris Johnson and Micheal Gove). I can understand why he feels that he should resign, and respect him for it, although I think it's a mistake.

Think of it as an ethical move, rather than a political one designed to help his career.
