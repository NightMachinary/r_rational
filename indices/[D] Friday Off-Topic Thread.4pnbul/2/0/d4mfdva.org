Hmm, I guess we'll see. In and of itself, the Brexit referendum doesn't cause UK to leave the EU. It obliges the government to do so, however. If anti-brexit elements in parliament are clever, they can dissolve the government and call for new elections. If anti-brexit elements win said election, they'll have a mandate for staying in the EU. Otherwise, it's fairly likely the UK will end up leaving the EU.

In general, governments like the EU are underestimated by their citizens. A lot of government policies are invisible to the public but provide benefits. For example, in the EU, they jointly evaluate drugs for medical use with a single [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Medicines_Agency][agency]], rather than on a nation-by-nation basis. This is convenient and saves money while ensuring a certain level of safety and efficacy for new drugs, etc. This is something that your typical EU citizen does not think about or interact with in a visible way, but has a huge and positive impact on their lives.

There are scores of institutions like this that operate invisibly in the background of a typical UK citizen's life, and the UK government will have to be very on-the-ball about replacing these with national institutions. No matter what, it will be expensive and will significantly expand the size of the UK government. They'll lose the institutional history and economies of scale that these organizations have, even if they do their best to migrate to new setup.
