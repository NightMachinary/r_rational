  Profit increase is hardly bad. Tax is an redistribute it if you have an issue

It's /also/ the case that you can arrange it so your company pays most of their taxes in countries with lower taxes, so even if some countries raise theirs, corporations will seek out tax havens. Without the EU, it would be much easier to say "This is the revenue you raised in our country. If you move it out, anything you don't account for will be considered profit and taxed accordingly." But while we are in the EU, companies have the right to operate in one country and (other than sales tax) pay most of their taxes in their 'home' country. And the home country invariably has lower taxes because that's why they picked it.

  The issue here is that Swedish people are not able to compete with foreigners because the foreigners have lower standards. A unified minimum wage and worker right across the entire eu would put every individual on a level playing field.

I absolutely do not want a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_to_the_bottom][race to the bottom,]] whether that bottom is child labour like in the Philippines or 'just' lowering Western wages to those in Eastern Europe. So while it would be great if we could set /high/ minimum standards, that's not what has happened so far. Instead, we are stuck with the Posted Worker Directive and creative accounting.
