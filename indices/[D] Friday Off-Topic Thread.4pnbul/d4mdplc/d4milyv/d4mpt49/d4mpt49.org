Well that was interesting. I have /some/ stake in the game because Sweden too is in the EU, so my perspective is somewhat different. I don't know what will turn out the be the best path for the people of the UK. I can offer up /my/ main reservations about the EU, however, of which there are two. The first is a little abstract. It's that moving the decision making process away from the people decreases faith in, and engagement with, the democratic process. Sure, ultimately representatives in the European Parliament are elected like members of parliament, but Brussels is so much further away in people' minds than [your own capitol]. In most European countries, the percentage of people who vote fore EU reps is much lower than the percentage who vote in national elections. In Sweden, which voted for both in 2014, 85% of people voted in the parliamentary election, while only 51% voted for EU reps. I am active in local politics and knocked on a lot of doors in 2014. Several hundred people gave me some version of "I can't be bothered to vote, it's all so far away and I can't change anything". Then, when laws come into effect that originate in Brussels, either people like them and don't care/notice, or they dislike the law and feel their interests are trampled upon by faceless corporate overlords (It's a pervasive view in Sweden that the EU is more prone to lobbyism than Sweden itself). Sure, if people all made sure to spend half an hour a week on keeping up with politics they could vote confidently and affect things, but psychologically the behemoth of Brussels just doesn't feel close enough to touch. I would guess that many Americans feels the same about the Federal government as opposed to your own state.

The second, more concrete objection is also more party political. I'm center-left in Sweden, which basically means Bearnie Sanders. I /like/ that Sweden has long had strong unions. But we joined the EU in 95, and since then unions have gradually been gutted. In particular, there is something called the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posted_Workers_Directive][Posted Workers Directive]]. What it does is make it easier to hire foreign workers, at the wages and conditions that unions in their home country agree to, regardless of the stance of the unions in the country where they work. So Eastern European workers (poorer) can go work in the UK/Sweden/etc at wages and conditions far worse than local workers would ever accept, and unions can do absolutely nothing about it. So unions can no longer negotiate for all workers, and companies can often straight out ignore them. This used to absolutely not be the case in Sweden. Like many other countries, we are now dealing with a shrinking middle class and widening inequality. And unions have all but been knocked out of the equations, all because the EU made it so and we can't change it short of leaving.

I hope things turn out well for the UK, but we'll see. If it does, I hope Sweden follows suit. If not, I may have to give more weight to economical arguments for staying. But the ever widening inequality, coupled with slowly rising unemployment in the face of technology, makes me very suspicious of the gung ho neoliberalism that flows from Brussels and makes up 80% of the laws and regulations that go into effect in my county every year.
