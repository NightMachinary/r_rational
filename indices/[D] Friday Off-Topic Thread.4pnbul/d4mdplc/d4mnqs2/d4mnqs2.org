I'm Swedish and quite negatively disposed toward the EU because it gutted Swedish unions. Selfishly, I am quite glad that the UK can now serve as a test case as to what happens when a country leaves the union, and am hoping you will do well. Also, England is way, way to the right of us, and whether Scotland joins in the future or not, the 'average' political position of the EU power brokers will now shift toward that of my country and party.

Also, where in Scotland do you live? I studied in Aberdeen for four years.
