Well as a leftist I would say that's not a problem with the EU, at least I think it should be the case that wealth is taken from the west and distributed more equally. However if it leads to growth of inequality rather than just all of the EU enjoying the same standard of living then that's the issue that needs tackled. Presumably if the wages were low enough your goods and services would be cheaper in turn with little standard of living variance.
