Certainly more work for the poor in the East helps the East catch up, but they would catch up considerably quicker if they weren't locked into /their/ minimum wages and unions. If they at least got paid more in the West than in their home countries, wages would have to rise in the East. But as it is, many of them make the same barely tolerable wage in Sweden as they do at home, while Swedish workers lose out on work. It's possible I have a narrow perspective, but it seems to me foreigners make the same $4/hour wages they did in the 90s, while Swedish wages are stagnant for the majority of the population.
