You can easily stop profit leaving for tax land value tax is the simplest way, hell just enforce the entire eu uses land value tax and no corporation tax or income tax. Then all business from the rest of the world might have an incentive to move here if tax on property is less than corporation tax would be somewhere else.

Race to the bottom? So the bottom is eastern Europe already? That kind of thinking always speaks to a privileged perspective. You could pay for ten lives of reasonable quality for the cost of one Swedish minimum wage worker.

Hardly a race to the bottom since minimum wage can be set at whatever required for a positive standard of living.
