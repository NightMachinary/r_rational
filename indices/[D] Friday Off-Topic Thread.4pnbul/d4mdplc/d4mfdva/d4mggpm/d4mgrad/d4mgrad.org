EU institutions have problems, but these problems aren't really solved by abandoning institutional history. Trying to run a similar institution that operates with similar objectives but only for one nation (with fewer resources and less legitimacy) will mostly make these problems worse. There are really really big economies of scale for drug validation. I have no particular reason to think the UK-level equivalent agency will be better, and several reasons to think it will be worse. Most people underestimate the importance of institutions in governance, politics, and general.
