I don't have much to add to [[https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10105426634702363&id=1201231][this]] summary:

#+begin_quote
  Both Brexit and Trumpism are the very, very, wrong answers to legitimate questions that urban elites have refused to ask for thirty years.

  Questions such as - Who are the losers of globalization, and how can we spread the benefits to them and ease the transition? Is it fair that the rich can capture almost all the gains of open borders and trade, or should the process be more equitable?

What I'll add is that it does look like the beginning of the end for the EU.

Also Cameron resigning seems kind of nuts to me, but I don't totally follow UK politics.
