Reddit and the other sources of links you read are a hotbed of "people who are against Brexit" so you get the appearance that everyone was anti-Brexit. In truth, many people liked the idea of Brexit. Many politicians, newspapers, and so on supported it. In fact, most of the people who voted in the referendum voted to Leave, as I'm sure everyone is keenly aware.

Leaving the EU has a lot of costs, but they're non-obvious, and the benefits seem obvious. Remaining has lots of clear costs and subtle benefits. You might think that the EU regulatory regime is expensive and not worth it. Perhaps, the idea of non-UK citizens dictating law of any kind in the UK rankles. After all, most UK citizens identify as British, not Europeans, on some level. UK has always had a distinct cultural identity from the continent. The EU itself has problems, and not having to bear those burdens could sound attractive.

For an American example, imagine you live in an area where everyone cared a lot about the restricting right to smoke marijuana. When you go online to the websites your friends frequent, you read about the dangers of marijuana use. When you see links on facebook or your social media of choice covering marijuana use, it talks about the dangers. Yes, you're aware that there are people in other places with weird beliefs (like in Colorado), but you know that their arguments (marijuana not harmful, taxing it would pay for itself, crime stuff, etc) are unlikely to be true. So you wonder, how do marijuana legalization schemes actually get support and get passed?
