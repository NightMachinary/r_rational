As far as I'm concerned the first is buzzwords, talking about sovereignty is pretty easy.

Secondly it's that for the past twenty years the UK government has blamed the EU at every opportunity for anything bad.

Thirdly the EU is rubbish at telling especially the older generation what they contribute. Everyone who goes to University all intimately know hence the heavy youth vote, but very little older folk know.

Fourth the remain campaign was the worst campaign ever. It was useless at making any point or refuting leaves constant lies.

And last and most importantly immigration. Even though half our immigrants come from outside the leave campaign were allowed to portray as if when we had full control we would stop it.
