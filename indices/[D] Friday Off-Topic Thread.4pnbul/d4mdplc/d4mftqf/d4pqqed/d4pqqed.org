The EU both influences and enforces government policies - shifting them, by definition, away from the UK average and toward to EU average. People are understandably annoyed when a large, seemingly unaccountable body shows up and tells them that half the continent voted and said that you need to change the way you do things. Same as States' Rights in the US.

Key issues here include immigration, differing interpretations of human rights laws, and levels of regulation in various fields.

It was also claimed (apparently falsely) that large amounts of money were being sunk into the EU to no return (on taxes and overhead and stuff I guess) that could be better spent on the UK's cash-strapped healthcare system.
