After the last Game of Thrones episode I was thinking. In a low fantasy battle how would you field giants? How would you arm them, what armor, which combat roles?

You got 1 giant every 500 man. How to use them in the most efficent way possible.

Various scenarios: siege, defende castel, camp battle, skirmish.
