- Banner Saga 2, because the first one was well done with an interesting world and unique art style
- War for the Overworld, because of Dungeon Keeper nostalgia
- Assassin's Creed Unity and Rogue, because I enjoy the games but think they've become too formulaic to pay more than $20 for (my par rate is $1 per hour of entertainment)
- Invisible Inc, because I love turn-based strategy and it's been on my wishlist for a long time.

We'll see what else goes on sale, but I think that's enough to keep me in games for a long time, given my available time to play them.
