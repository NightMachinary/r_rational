Resident Evil 6. It was way cheap, and I've wanted to play it since I saw the thumbs up mechanic. Took it for a go, and the campaign is trash, Mercaneries is enjoyable.

Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 4. A friend and I have a ironic enjoyment of Naruto, so it was a lot of fun to play godtier battle mages together.

System Shock 1. I have this tick of having to start series with the first game, and 2 was gathering dust.

Bioshock 2. Beat it a long time ago, but never paid for it.

Dead Space 2. Enjoyed the first one, but not enough to pay full price for the sequel.

Megabyte Punch. I'm a fan of Team Reptile, the developers of this and Lethal League, and I love Smash, so I thought it was time to this clone\twist on it.

And then a whole bunch of games that've caught my eye through the steam queue: Fortune Summoners (I really enjoyed Recettear's mind numbingly simple combat system, it was meditative to me), Unholy Heights, Valdis Story, Battle Fantasia, and Evil Maze.

Also, Magodo, the plot will be WAY to hard for you to follow. The entire crux of MGSVs plot is from games that are ~20 years old on the MSX. It is chockful of references, callbacks, and retcons. But the worst offender is that the plot of the game was held back by Konami due to budgeting\corperate problems. Good luck, though, it'll still be fun to play, but I honestly think it's the weakest game in the series.
