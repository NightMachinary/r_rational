What did you buy in the Steam Summer Sale?

Some stuff I got;

- Dark Souls 2 and 3, as a big fan of games that last really long, this series is a huge treat. Nothing better than grinding through an area while listening to a podcast.

- Tormentum: Dark Sorrow, this was an impulse purchase I suppose, the game looks gorgeous in my defense.

- Grim Dawn, apparently the real Diablo III, can't wait to see for myself!

- MGS V: The Phantom Pain, my first game in the series, I hope the plot won't be hard to follow.
