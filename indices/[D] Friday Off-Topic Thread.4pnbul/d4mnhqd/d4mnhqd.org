I went to the author Jim Butcher's book signing last Saturday when he visited Sweden, and managed to ask a question about the unsaid things about the setting. In the Dresden Files, all religions are true to some extent, and belief gives power to the gods Pratchett style, so the origin of the world and things like that change over time. Currently the Abrahamic religions dominate, so hell is very real. Hell hasn't been talked about much though, so the books don't explain what it's like. I asked about how much power the devil has over hell (The books show Hades having king like powers over the Greek Underworld), and Jim said that hell operates exactly like a multinational business conglomerate.

I find this amusing. I imagine ancient fallen angels and demons of corruption who saw the stars form, bickering in the lunch room over unreasonable quotas and rules handed down from Management and laughing at stupid customers.
