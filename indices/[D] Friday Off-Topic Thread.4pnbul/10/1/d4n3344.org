There are quite a few computer programs that I would implement in my brain if I could. For instance if you implemented the aiming programs of a smart gun you would basically be a expert sniper.

For something more useful to everyday life I would download one of the programs that reads micro expressions thus giving me awesome social powah.

It shouldn't be to hard to hack yourself into Eidetic memory. By selectively turning off anything not absolutely necessary and increasing your brain's metabolic intake, you could probably increase your mental speed, thus allowing you to have longer to think about snap decisions and letting you study faster. Plus by simply turning off boredom and forcing yourself into a hyper focused state you study /really really fast and well/.

Honestly this sort of power would let you be the best in the world at most endeavors if you were willing to be ruthless enough.
