Simple, a series of algorithms that automatically activated under several conditions:

- An algorithm that forced me awake every day at 4:00 am no matter my level of sleep and that made me alert despite feeling like crap after an all nighter.
- An algorithm that forced me to sleep to avoid pointless all nighters and that improved REM sleep so that I could get the most out of sleep while having to spend the least amount of time in bed.
- An algorithm that forced me to work and that disabled addictions and time wasters. It'd be nice to be able to deactivate compulsions or detect extreme emotional states, shutting them down and entering an "hyper rational" mode of thinking.
- An algorithm that could allow to voluntarily enter the mania state of the bipolar dissorder so that you can enter high performance, high creativity mode while being highly optimist. It'd be nice if it can be shut down after a certain time activated so you don't burn out without noticing.
- AN algorithm to review and link all data you acquire during the day so that you can create "ontologies" on your mind which more easily allow to process the learned contents and better retain them on your mind.

Not sure how you'd harm someone unless you could also reprogram them ala "Mind Sphere" from Mage: the Ascension but if that was the case then mind control or shutting them down are the simplest forms.

*EDIT:* Adittionally maybe it'd be possible to temporarily reconfigure the brain so that it changes the way it processes information (thinking of how Reed Richards is able to modify his internal brain structures to tackle different problems) so that for example one certain are of the brain gets the most brain flow or all neurons focus on a certain problem (spatial processing to navigate a maze, visual information to better detect/recognize patterns) or to temporarily induce some form of autism that allows for hyper specialization.

On the opposite end of the spectrum maybe you can induce a sociopathic/highly social but less rational state of mind so that you're better able to interact in social situations and deactivate it before you can mess things up too badly. Or increase the degree of emotional intelligence/empathy to better read a person's intentions and be able to block it under huge emotional stress to avoid being overwhelmed.
