Context: This story had a different ending at the time that [[/u/neshalchanderman]] probably read it. The ending went like this:

#+begin_quote
  CRACK

  Fuck, the front window! Shit, it's the husband! Maybe I can run him over and claim self defence!

  "You're dead! I know it was you!"

  CRACK

  Oh shit oh shit, the ignition won't catch!

  "Got you, you piece of human excrement. This is for Elise and every other life you have taken and ruined!"

  I feel a sharp object penetrate me between my ribs. So, this is what it feels like.

The reason some people in this thread appear to be talking past each other is, some people read a story in which the protag died because he was rational but only had his own knowledge and resources, and some people read a story in which the protag lived because he used the author's knowledge and resources.
