There's a link in the sidebar [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing][(Yudkowsky's guide to writing rationalist fiction)]] that would help you. Specifically his guide to [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level2intelligent]['Level 2 Intelligent Characters']] has a few pieces of advice for stuff like that, although the whole thing is worth reading. My favourite, though, is simply time. If you have several days worth of thought, you will normally produce something clever that definitely would make a character seem very intelligent if they (in-story) come up with it in two minutes.
