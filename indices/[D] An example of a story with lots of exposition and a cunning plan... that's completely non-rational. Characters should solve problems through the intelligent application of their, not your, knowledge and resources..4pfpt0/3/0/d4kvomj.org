If I had to guess, it would be that the murderer couldn't have possibly predicted that the husband would try to kill him.

Even if he could have, there is no way that he could have predicted exactly /how/ the husband was going to try to kill him. He easily could have shot the murderer on the courthouse steps, or followed his car home and kill him there, or set up a car bomb.

The author knew how he was going to do it, so the murderer ended up planning for that particular scenario, which would have been impossible to reliably predict beforehand.
