Hey! Author of it here. Thanks for the feedback!

I will be honest, this was just a 10 minute story I wrote on my phone. It just happened to get some upvotes. If it were for a book or even a longer story, I would have done more research. I love court room dramas, Making a Murderer had me hooked pretty recently, but I didn't want to bog this down with details as it was just meant to be a moment in the head of a psycho. This wasn't meant to be fact based rational fiction. If you are interested, I did go for a more in-keeping-with-the-character ending on my sub ([[/r/nickofnight]]), and it's a little more realistic.

But if it makes a good piece to analyse on this sub, then I am glad I could help :)
