I recommend Mother of Learning most heavily, of the ones on that list. HPMOR is polarizing and in my opinion its quality varies a lot. I haven't read Glimwarden. Unsong is the author's first novel length work of fiction, and although I like it, it is unpolished and lacks direction. In contrast, Mother of Learning is consistently interesting. It is also very long, and not nearly complete yet.

For a (relatively) quick introduction to the genre, I think the best you'll find is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][The Metropolitan Man]].

A lot of this subreddit is fanfiction, by the way. But some of it is still pretty good.
