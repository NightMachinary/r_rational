sperm <> ejaculate

The sperm you buy isn't the stuff you ejaculate - it's 'washed' to prevent cramping when injected. While there are people who presumably would sell you ejaculate - this has been tried though usually via purchase of used condoms from prostitutes - the method has dubious provenance.

There's reasonably strong safeguards against. Not perfect but reasonably strong.

Forensic services do test/look out for contamination and transferance. (Lab guides assume a clean sample. Crime scene processing guides do not. You actually need to qualify/ be approved to process a crime scene.) You'd have issues with temperature, degradation, the presence of latex (or powder) from the condom, the lack of presence of epithelial dna from the sperm donor (also the nagging problem that what you purchased could be traced back to the dna profile of a dead person or might not even be human or contain spermatazoa), the presence of the victims dna on the attackers clothing, splatter patterns, gunshot residue or hand marks which tie to the attacker.

DNA also means little. It can place you at a scene but it doesn't mean much. 'I was at the scene your honor, I had sex with the victim, but when I left she was still alive' is a frequent and often adequate defence against the presence of dna at a rape/murder trial. Specifically it's not super evidence which overrides eyewitness testimony.

DNA also isn't automatically exculpatory. That's a myth. The jury would be instructed along the following lines: it's possible for the attacker not to leave dna behind and it's possible for non-attackers to leave dna behind.

If the other evidence is strong this stuff isn't going to prevent the attacker's convinction.
