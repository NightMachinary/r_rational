Authorial knowledge should not be used to augment a character's reasoning, nor should a lack of authorial knowledge get in the way of a character's reasoning.

Or, to put it another way, a character should know exactly as much as expected (given their background, memories, etc.) and their behaviour and reasoning should align with this.
