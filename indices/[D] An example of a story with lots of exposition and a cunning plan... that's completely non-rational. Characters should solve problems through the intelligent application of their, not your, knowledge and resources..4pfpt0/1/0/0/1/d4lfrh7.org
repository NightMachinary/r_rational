I like to crowdsource character choices, and compress time. A character twice as smart as me still isn't going to think of something better in two minutes than I did in two hours.

You'll notice that most stories, even rational ones, have charachters reach mostly correct conclusions on unreasonably fast timeframes. Normally we just skip over that, but if you specifically point it out people will realize it /is/ out of the ordinary.
