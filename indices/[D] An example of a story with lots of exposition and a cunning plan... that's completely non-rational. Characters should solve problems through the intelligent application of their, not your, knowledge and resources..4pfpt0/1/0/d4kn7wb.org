It seems OP's point is about the genre, not quality, of the story (as in, the rational genre is about /in-universe/ sensible conclusions and clever strategies, not /out-of-universe/ correct decisions made by the /in-universe/ character).

As far as I can tell, his argument goes like this:

1. People sometimes consider 'rational' to mean 'correct', or 'best chance of being correct'

2. This should be the case for the character, given what the character knows from their subjective view of a fictional world - as in, given what they know, they try their best to win or succeed.

3. Using out-of-character knowledge, that the author knows but the character couldn't be expected to know, is bad (like [[https://chalybsanimus.wordpress.com/2010/02/17/why-metagaming-is-bad-or-and-just-how-does-your-character-know-that-pal/][metagaming in tabletop roleplaying]]) but so is:

4. Assuming that there is no in-universe knowledge that the author doesn't know of (e.g. I don't understand how electromagetism works, so I ignore that it can destroy data storage devices in-universe), if that makes sense. I'm struggling to adequately describe what I think OP means here - I keep wanting to link [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/hq/universal_fire/][Universal Fire]] but I'm not sure exactly why. It's the inverse of the point above, where instead of having extra information flow into the world in a way that doesn't follow any of the already introduced rules, we have information or rules that are removed or disappear with no good (in-universe) reason.

That's the impression I got so far, but I could be wrong. Either way, I think it's a valid point to make - rational protagonists /try to win/, but they don't necessarily succeed, or even succeed often. They just need to maximise their chance of winning, and bad luck or low starting probabilities of success can make it all in vain. Reaching in from outside to have them make unrealistic decisions /given what they know/ that nevertheless work well /because of information they don't have/ is not part of the rational genre.
