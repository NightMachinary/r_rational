Should we consider Song of Ice and Fire as Rationalist? Should we consider Ender's Game as well?

Also, an obscure one: Vampire High by Douglas Rees might count. There's some very fun supernatural munchkinry afoot, not to mention it's a great book (which has NO SEQUEL. IGNORE THE NONEXISTANT SEQUEL.)
