If this community continues and grows, and everyone upvotes fictions that are 'rationalist' and downvotes those that are not 'rationalist', then sorting the subreddit by top - all time would serve much the same purpose. That said, a lot of works upvoted on this subreddit don't really meet most definitions of rationalist I use, sadly, so some form of curated index would be very appreciated.

I would be hugely in favor of more people posting actual books and novels rather than just web-based fiction.

Thanks for the recs, by the way - I hadn't heard of Marc Stiegler before now, and I will have to find and try his stuff.
