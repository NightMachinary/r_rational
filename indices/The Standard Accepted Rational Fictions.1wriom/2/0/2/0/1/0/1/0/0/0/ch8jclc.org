In the US, the number of laws overturned or changed by the Supreme Court is a matter of public record.

Unconstitutional and Preempted Laws 1789-2002 According to the GPO (Government Printing Office Database):

1789-2002 Acts of Congress Held as Unconstitutional..............................158

1789-2002 State Statutes held unconstitutional......................................935

1789-2002 City Ordinances held unconstitutional....................................222

1789-2002 State and City laws preempted by Federal laws.......................224

Total State, Local and Federal Laws Declared Unconstitutional................1,315

Total State and Local Law Preempted by Federal Laws..............................224

Total Laws Overturned, all governments..............................................1,539

This of course doesn't cover all changes to law which come as a result of previous cases however. Part of my post above is about how public opinion and reactionary responses to past cases (even those which failed to change laws) is one of the primary drivers in the alteration of laws. I don't have on hand statistics on the ratios or similar on that, and as it was something I spent 8 months on in a single class in law school, accurate evidence is likely not something that can be summarized quickly in a reddit post.

As an aside, I made no claims on the effectiveness of Yudkowsky breaking laws in this case, or copyright in general, simply a general point on law itself.
