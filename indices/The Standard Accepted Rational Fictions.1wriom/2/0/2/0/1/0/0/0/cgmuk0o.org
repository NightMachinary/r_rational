It's a matter of game theory. Of course the author should be able to sell the copyright, but should these kinds of situations influence our decision making on what length a copyright should be maintained for? I would argue "only so much as it influences an author's decision to write the book in the first place."

If a ten year reduction on copyright would have meant Peter Pan was never written, then it'd be tough to say. How much do we value that book?
