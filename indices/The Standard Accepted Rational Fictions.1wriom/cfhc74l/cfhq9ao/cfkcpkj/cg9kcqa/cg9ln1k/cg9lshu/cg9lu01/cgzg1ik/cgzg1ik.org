Actually, most of the time laws only get changed after or because someone has broken them.

This is not just the standard civil disobedience argument, that one is common and I have no particular skill which would allow me to speak accurately about it.

The two main ways laws do change however are via legislative rewriting or judicial review. Judicial review can cause laws invalidated for constitutional reasons to be destroyed, changing the current state of the law itself. What most people do not think about however is that the court is /a purely reactionary institution./

The court cannot simply say "Hey, we were reading that law you passed and it's no good", they must wait until a case comes to bar that touches directly on the law itself. Not only that, but they must wait until an advocate for one side in that case makes an argument that the law should be set aside for one reason or another. That advocate would only be doing so if it benefited the one they represented for it to be so. That likely means that person has broken that law. That is how it happens.

The other time the law will be changed is when the legislature changes it. Legislatures are inherently focused entirely around electable platforms. Elections are what drives policy, you put policy into place so you will win support in the next election. Laws which are not important to your policy or to public opinion tend to not be modified, even if legally they cause enormous issues - in Canada, our Criminal Code both has 30 sections or so that have been eliminated but still exist in the printed version, because Parliament hasn't updated it since 1985, and has no section with clear definitions of all included terms which causes a hell of a lot of problems.

As such, we know that issues which /are/ in the public eye, and which /are/ policies which can effect an election, tend to get changed. I can list off the top of my head a dozen or more instances of controversial court rulings on a case, usually criminal, which prompted legislative reform of the laws governing that case. This would never have happened if that crime had not happened, been prosecuted, and then created a media frenzy, which led to political fallout. And again at the base of this, you have a person who committed a crime - breaking the law.

It is in fact very, very rare for a law to get changed /without/ a direct correlation to a time it had been broken. It's one of those ever so wise sounding statements spoken by those who think they know how something occurs, but doesn't understand the actual numbers. Something that sounds good, a meme that is oft repeated, but something that has no basis in actual fact.

Of course, by the same logic, breaking a law is much less likely to lead to that law being changed than it is to you being punished for the transgression. That doesn't change the fact that change only tends to happen at some point after a breach, even it it is less that 0.1% of cases.

As most things in life, it ends up being a lot more complicated than just 'Don't do /x/'.
