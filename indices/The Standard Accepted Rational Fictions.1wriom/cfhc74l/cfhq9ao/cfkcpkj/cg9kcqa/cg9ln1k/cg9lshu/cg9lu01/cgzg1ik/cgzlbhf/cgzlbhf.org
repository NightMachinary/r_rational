  Actually, most of the time laws only get changed after or because someone has broken them.

Do you have a source for this claim? (Not the "after" claim, of course people break laws.)

While I agree, for the most part, with the rest of your post, I don't see how any of that changes my point. (That "breaking the law is no way to change the law. Whether copyright law is justified or not, breaking it only hinders your cause.") A D-list pseudointellectual like Yudkowsky breaking copyright law, even if his posse helps out, won't change shit.
