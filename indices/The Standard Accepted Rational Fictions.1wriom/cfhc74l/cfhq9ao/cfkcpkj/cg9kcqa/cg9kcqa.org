Copyright was created as an incentive for authors to create works without fear of theft and no profit. Why write Harry Potter if the first person to read it can make their own copies and sell them just a rightfully?

However, maintaining that copyright years past the creators death is /completely unjustifiable/. Idk about you, but my utility function (in regards to money) doesn't really go past my death, seeing as I wont be around to get paid. The Copyright is now just lining the pockets of whomever's got their hands on it, and happens to be /disincentivizing/ derivative creative works while no longer rewarding the creation of original works! I've yet to hear a single good argument for why copyright should last as long as it currently does.
