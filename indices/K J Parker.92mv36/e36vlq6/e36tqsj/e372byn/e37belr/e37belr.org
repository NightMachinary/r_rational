I think the biggest divergence from the rational fiction subgenre is that often you can't puzzle out his mysteries beforehand, it's good writing and when done well it mimics the fog of reality but it isn't hewing to the definition of rational fiction as I asserted in the OP.

However, his occasional deus ex machina very rarely help the MC, it really is diseases and storms all the way.

I might recommend The Company. It's one of my favorite novels, and it is very different from the folding knife. I think one of the axis of Parker's writing is between concrete worldbuilding and essentially style/characterization. The folding knife is really carried along by it's somewhat charming MC, and not enough work goes into establishing the different elements of it's plots, nor the physical locations in which they take place.\\
The Company isn't as expansive in it's reach, but is a much tighter book, and the success or failure or the main characters rests solely on their own abilities. They aren't lucky or unlucky in excess, other than their prior success in the military.
