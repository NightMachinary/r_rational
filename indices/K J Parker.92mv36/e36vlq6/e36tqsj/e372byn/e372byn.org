I've recommended The Engineer trilogy before. It has many rational tropes, and I am quite the fan. :) The Folding Knife was a bit disappointing in that the characters failed to talk to each other. Even though, given their temperaments, that was entirely believable, and may not have made a difference. It also did a great job portraying the random nature of reality--how events completely out of your control can change everything, and you never had a chance to do anything about it. Sure, I know that many armies have fallen to things like an unknown/unexpected disease decimating their ranks, or adverse weather events sinking all their ships. But boy is it narratively unsatisfying!

I got distracted by the tangent. Yes, KJ Parker is great!
