I've seen some threads discussing K J Parker here before, but I don't recall if there was a thread as such.

My favourite K J Parker works are the Engineer Trilogy, but most of the stuff he's written is good.

Apparantly K J Parker also wrote under the nom de plume of Tom Holt; I tried ~4 books published under the Holt name, and got no more than 50 pages into any of them before abandoning them. There's a spectacular difference between the two authors, and I would never have guessed they were the same person.
