I would suggest starting reading KJ Parker with his short story collections, [[https://www.amazon.com/Academic-Exercises-K-J-Parker-ebook/dp/B00M6BXQVQ/][Academic Exercises]] and [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0789SY9MR/][The Father of Lies]]. I find that novellas and short stories are perfect format for the kind of story he usually tells.
