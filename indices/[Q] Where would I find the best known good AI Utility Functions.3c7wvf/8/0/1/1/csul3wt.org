  Wireheading happens when your terms are constrained and reduced to their most basic meaning. But what if we used a broader, non-Western term like Dukkha? [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukkha[1]]]

The whole point of Buddhism is that the way to stop Dukkha is to annihilate your soul by achieving Nirvana -- the bliss of /nonexistence/, or at least, a kind of consciousness-without-desire.
