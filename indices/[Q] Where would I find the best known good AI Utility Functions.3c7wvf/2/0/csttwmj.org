If you use Chrome, you might have an interest in installing the [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lazarus-form-recovery/loljledaigphbcpfhfmgopdkppkifgno?hl=en]["Lazarus"]] plug-in, which puts a little Ankh in the upper right-hand corner of text fields and saves as you type. It basically eliminated the "crap I just typed all that up and then lost it all" thing for me. Most of the time I don't notice it, but it's exceptionally nice to have when I need it.
