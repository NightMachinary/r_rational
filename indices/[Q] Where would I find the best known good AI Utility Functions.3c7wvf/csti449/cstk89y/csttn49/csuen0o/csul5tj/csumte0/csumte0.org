I didn't say "optimal", I said "friendly". Perhaps I'm defining friendly wrong. To taboo the word "friendly" for a moment, the issue I said was disputed is "Would CelestAI as written be considered a /good/ outcome for humanity?". This is different from "Would CelestAI as written be considered the /best possible/ outcome for humanity?".

As you've pointed out, the answer to the second question is a definite no.
