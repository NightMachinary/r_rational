You're right, 'eliminate suffering' leaves a lot of leeway for interpretations like 'put everyone in an opiate induced happy stupor.' Thanks for introducing me to that vocab word -- I first read about wireheading in the Last Christmas with the elves prototyping the "happy button."

Wireheading happens when your terms are constrained and reduced to their most basic meaning. But what if we used a broader, non-Western term like Dukkha? [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukkha]]

In the way that Buddhism defines suffering, even being bored or having existential angst counts. I'm not Buddhist and I don't think that full relinquishment of desire is the solution to our problems.

However, if we use a meditative approach to eliminating suffering, we'd be more chilled out, less stressed, more focused on the Now, and more content. Not ecstatically blissed out, just content. If the magic elves designed a "mindful meditative" button, it would 1) induce a state of self-regulation of attention 2) bring awareness to the present moment and 3) create a space of curiosity, openness and acceptance. This seems to be much more benign than injecting drugs to make us comatose. Also, it allows for muse and inspiration to still occur through part #3... counteracting the argument on how we may lose art and culture which seems to be another fear of wireheading.

Still, I subvert these two goals with my dracolich story and even though this "FAI" never succeeds at accomplishing them, she still does something good, in my opinion.
