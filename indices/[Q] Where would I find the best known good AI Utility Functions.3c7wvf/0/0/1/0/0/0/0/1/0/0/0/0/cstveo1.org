  I was actually referring to GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem[1] .

So was I! The Incompleteness Theorem can be viewed from two angles: computational (in which it's about undecidability) or model-theoretic (in which it's about standard versus nonstandard first-order models of Peano Arithmetic). Calude's work solves the undecidability aspect, which means that a probabilistic first-order arithmetic reasoning system based on Calude's publication will "zero in" over time on the semantic theorems of the standard model of first-order arithmetic, which is identical to the /only/ model of /second/-order arithmetic (arithmetic is fully determined by its axioms from the perspective of second-order logic and higher-order type theories).

Russel's Paradox isn't an "unsolvable problem", it's a nonsense statement. Any reasoning system that can detect nonhalting of computations will detect the paradox as a nonhalting behavior and thus treat it as "proving False" (ie: as paradox).

  Guaranteed lack of information is a problem.

Not for a reasoner designed to work with limited information. Probabilistic inference (and therefore, the rest of statistical learning theory) gives well-defined results when information is finitely available. In fact, that's more-or-less what it's /for/.
