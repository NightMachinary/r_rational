Guaranteed lack of information is a problem.

I was actually referring to GÃ¶del's [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del's_incompleteness_theorems][incompleteness theorem]].

My Cantor reference should have been [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell's_paradox][Russell]]; I forgot the paradox was /based/ on Cantor's work, not defined by him. My mistake.

But, whatever. We are definitely into 386 territory at this point.
