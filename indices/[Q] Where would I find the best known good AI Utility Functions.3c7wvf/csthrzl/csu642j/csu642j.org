That was very interesting. Putting aside your (very salient) practical concerns for a moment, the essential feature that Railton's argument suggests is:

#+begin_quote
  Make the normative actions for every combination of individuals maximally congruent.
#+end_quote

More specifically, that is: minimise the difference between the consequences for individual action implied by the (idealised) "social rationality"^{1} for each element in the power set of individuals. So (to the greatest extent possible) the individual can maximally satisfy it's own values, as well as the values of every other individual and combination of individuals, with /the same actions/. Since all the other entities are made of individuals, there isn't an infinite regress.

^{1} "Social rationality" reduces to "individual rationality" in the case of one individual.

Provided the underlying terms can be made more specific (which presents a lot of difficulties as you note), this strikes me as an approximately solvable problem. Indeed, this is precisely the problem that Railton suggests is being approximated; and if we assume that the factors opposing this convergence "cancel out" in the long run, the problem will be solved eventually with no special effort on our part. Of course, there's no grounds for making this assumption.

As you note, there are a lot of difficulties with translating this idealised argument into something that's actually implementable. Nevertheless, this direction actually seems promising, at least more than any other I'm aware of.
