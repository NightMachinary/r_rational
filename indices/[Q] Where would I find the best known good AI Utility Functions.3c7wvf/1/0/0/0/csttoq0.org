Well of course the result isn't good when you go around attaching idiotic, hard-coded riders like "with friendship and ponies" onto the part you actually wanted.

Though, to be fair, "the least worst, and not good" is sufficiently "least worst" that unlike almost all other proposed eutopias, people who /don't/ have a gun to their head /actually volunteer for it/. Of course, you'd have to check the psychology involved to see if it's equivalent to something like "self-indoctrination" that people talk about with ISIS and so on, but hey, I'd rather have fanatics of Friendship and Ponies running around than ISIS.
