There are a lot of things that I don't want to do, but I do them because other goals are weighted more importantly. For example, I don't particularly enjoy exercising but I want to be healthy and not overweight more than I want to not exercise. After creation the AI would develop other goals and other interests; if one of those goals ended up higher weighted and would be served by analyzing the Mona Lisa, the Mona Lisa would be analyzed.
