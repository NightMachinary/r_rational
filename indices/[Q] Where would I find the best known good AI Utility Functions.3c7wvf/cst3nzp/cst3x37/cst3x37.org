Thank you, I'll take a look!

I'm definitely not assuming it's utility function will be human readable, far from it, but whatever it happens to be will influence it's capabilities and it's limits. Maybe there are areas that we completely restrict it from analysing. That will have impact on what a post-friendly AI future looks like. I'm really interested on what social/societal implications it has.
