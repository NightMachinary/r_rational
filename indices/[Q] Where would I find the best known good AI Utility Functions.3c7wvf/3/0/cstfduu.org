Yudkowsky even discouraged people to talk about utopias because it's such a fun subject to argue about and you can waste a lot of time doing it. And whatever suggestions you may have will probably turn out to be useless later on and trying to guess what is good for humans is really hard to do in advance. Trying to work on stable goal-keeping and how to align AI's values with humans is probably much more fruitful when you are trying to do it years before the actual implementation.
