There is something to be said for the Outside Context Problem style stories where a person usually armed with modern science, gets put in a civilization without it.

A Conneticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is an early exploration of this trope.

Other good ones is Two Year Emperor (person with knowledge of D&D as game, gets thrown into universe with D&D as reality,) and Dungeon Keeper Ami (Saylor Mercury in the Dungeon Keeper 'verse.)
