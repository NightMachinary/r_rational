The short webcomic [[http://www.shigabooks.com/fleep.php][Fleep]]. The protagonist tackles some damn hard problems, but shows his work at every step so you /know/ it's solvable - if you happen to be a genius with encyclopaedic knowledge and excellent Fermi estimate skills. Finest example of competence porn.

Might only be fun for a niche audience though, so I don't know if it's a good example to follow.
