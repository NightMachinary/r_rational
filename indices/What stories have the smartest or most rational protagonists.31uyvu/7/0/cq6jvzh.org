  *Louis Gridley Wu*, a fictional character, is the main protagonist in the /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringworld][Ringworld]]/ series of books, written by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Niven][Larry Niven]].

  Louis Wu was born in 2650 to Carlos Wu and Sharrol Janss. When he appears in /Ringworld/, Louis is 6'2" (188 cm) tall. Without Flatlander bodypaint, his brown eyes show no discernible slant and his yellow-brown skinned features are a blended fusion of Earth's many races. Born a "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatlander_(Niven)][Flatlander]]", Louis is best known among his friends for inventing the "Sabbatical"---going off alone in a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship][spaceship]] outside the boundaries of known space until one can tolerate human company again. Louis was the first human being to make contact with the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinoc][Trinoc]] species.

  He is also the only hominid ever to become a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pak_Protector][Protector]] and return to normal ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pak_breeder][Breeder]]) state afterward.
