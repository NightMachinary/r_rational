This is true, but my real problem with Jaune is that his ever-growing power list makes his chapters boring chapters for 99%+ of all chapters. Characters are more interesting when they have a meaningful chance of failing, and adding abilities on until a character sheet starts to be written in small text on a poster because of all the abilities is not conductive to that. The author has had like one section of the past ~hundred days be actually a conflict that mattered and that Jaune could lose, and and that was a long time ago. The vast majority of recent entries be either meaningless/stakeless fights, unloseable fights, or reactions/aftermath/explanation chapters - if you thought HPMOR aftermaths excessive, well, you ain't seen nothin' yet!

Also, writing a high number next to 'intelligence' doesn't make a character feel meaningfully intelligent, nor does giving them bonus spells for intelligence or whatever. Actually having them do intelligent things makes them feel intelligent, and there's been a paucity of that.

I'm almost at the point of giving up on the fic, in spite of it's strong points and strong opening.
