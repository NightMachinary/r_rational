I feel genius in terms of persuading others, lying to others, and manipulating others for your own ends is portrayed really well in R Scott Bakker's Second Apocalypse trilogy, in the person of Khellus Anasurimbor. The story follows a delicate balance of having him make persuasive, followable arguments and persuading others from their viewpoints, with Khellus's internal narration so we can see the manipulation, with a couple of other characters' internal narration who eventually see the truth of his deceptions. I felt like Khellus embodied certain ideas of deceitful/manipulative intellect very well. Basically none of his techniques or abilities could be used or emulated by a reader, but it still felt pretty convincing when reading it.

Several characters from Anathem by Neal Stephenson portrayed academic/intellectual/scientific/mathematic intelligence very well and persuasively, and even conveyed certain fairly trivial insights to the reader and made them feel like reasonable insights.
