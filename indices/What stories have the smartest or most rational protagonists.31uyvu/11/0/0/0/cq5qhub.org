I would not mind his power list if he actually applied it to meaningfully counteract the known threats or ran some experiments to try and understand how it actually works or did something else productive. Instead he's just killing time waiting for the next big crisis to happen while name-dropping Malkuth theory every other sentence like that label means anything by itself. Feels like he's literally incapable of spending his time productively unless some immediate goal has been handed to him.
