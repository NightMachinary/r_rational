It's a decent fic, but I do not consider Jaune a truly intelligent or rational person. Mostly because he has really bad judgement about where to invest his resources. I'd sooner describe him as an average guy, who just happened to win a power lottery. As far as the rational characters go, the best you'll find in TGWP is his granny, but she's barely in the fic.

For me, the big problem with Jaune, aside from his priorities, is that he doesn't feel agenty. All he does is react to stuff and even his long-term plans get thrust upon him.
