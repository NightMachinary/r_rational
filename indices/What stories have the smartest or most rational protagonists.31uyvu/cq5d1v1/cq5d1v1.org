/The Metropolitan Man/ has a good level of revelation regarding Lex's gradually increasing knowledge about Superman, and the techniques he uses to gain that knowledge. We get some detail about what he does to put his ideas into practice, but not full detail, because seeing all the go-betweens between him and his final lackeys would be boring.

HPMoR is interesting, it successfully conveyed for Harry (to me) "Very smart, but nonetheless, overestimates his own intelligence (or at least his ability to apply it to achieve ends he wants)".

Another possibility is to have the super-smart character just go ahead and do the super-smart thing, without being the POV character, and then have some other quite-smart-but-not-/that/-smart character work out for the audience exactly what their thought process was. I'm sure there are a lot of examples for this, but the one that comes to mind, of all things, is when some onlooker (I think Asuma?) explains for the audience exactly what Shikamaru is doing in the third chuunin exam. (I think Shikamaru's canon tactics are relatively elementary compared to a lot of smart characters on fiction on this sub, but still advanced compared to the rest of his canon; forgiven because it's targeted in such a way to be accessible to a younger group of readers/viewers.)
