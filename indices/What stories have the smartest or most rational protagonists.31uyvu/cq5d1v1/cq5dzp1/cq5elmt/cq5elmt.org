Canon Shikamaru was somewhat more of an /informed/ intelligence; what he put into practice wasn't nearly as high-level as what one would expect after being told how smart he was (200+ IQ?). This could be because of lack of ability on the part of the author to imagine a really super-smart character, but looking at it more charitably, it's because the format was meant to be accessible to elementary age kids, and so it couldn't get /too/ complex without leaving part of its audience in the dust, so to speak.

Also, there's the fact that Shikamaru is really lazy. Really, really lazy. He has no designs on saving the world, dominating the world, optimizing the world -- his end-state of his utility function is that he wants to grow old with a normal family and enjoying relaxing in his old age. He probably figures it's too much /effort/ to expend the whole of his intelligence, he figures he can get to his end state with minimal effort. Until Pain, and the events after Pain, such as the Great Ninja War, anyway.

That said, I do like Naruto's use of the "watcher explains to audience what's going on" trope. Naruto uses it to make sure younger viewers are able to keep up with Shikamaru's moderate-level schemes, and also, with things happening in combats like Lee vs. Gaara that wouldn't be obvious to viewers otherwise. (Kakashi/Gai explaining 8 gates to Sakura/audience, for example.) Not sure if that has a trope name on TVTropes; it should. I think this trope could be used effectively to accomplish what you want, if the intelligence level were scaled upwards to something more targeted at smart adults.

And, glad to help!
