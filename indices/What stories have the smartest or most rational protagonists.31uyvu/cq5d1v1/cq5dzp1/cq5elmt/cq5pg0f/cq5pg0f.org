It's sort of an extension of The Watson, but more applied to a single instance than to an entire character. I rather enjoy when it happens in fiction (the best use that I can call to mind is in A Knight's Tale, when someone asks another character what the rules of jousting are, and it makes total sense in-Universe for that to happen). I'm sort of compiling a list of examples like that, actually, in the hopes that I can someday make that an actual trope: I'll add your examples to the list.
