Nice!

I don't remember being impressed ever by Shikamaru.

HPMoR was entertaining as hell and I'd consider it mostly a success on showing the work the protagonist had to go through to reach his conclusions.

Thank you very much, I'll read /The Metropolitan Man/ now on your recommendation. I did hear that Lex was meant to be smart but I've never read anything from that universe canon or non.
