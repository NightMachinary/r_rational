Gotta throw out Worm, my favorite book.

All of the characters work off of what they know, and make intelligent decisions based on that knowledge. There are several different layers and factions at play, some of which know about each other, all working towards different (or the same) goals.

It's just a beautifully designed story, with awesome characters.
