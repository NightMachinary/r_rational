  I'm looking for writing techniques here.

Here are the three super secret methods of depicting genius that I have identified that a person who is not a genius themselves can use to portray genius:

Method 1: Puzzle-Solving. It's not necessarily a hard problem, but within the context of the story we're going to have most characters not figure it out, Protagonist finds the solution via an insight which the reader can understand. Protagonist uses that insight to win. Examples: Ender's Game

Method 2: RPG-style Skill-Tree. Have the character slowly work on a skill, which progresses in sensible but hard-won steps, and that skill makes them hold an edge. Bonus points if the protagonist explains exactly what the other characters are doing wrong, and has "insights" within the magic system (which may be opaque to the reader, it doesn't matter). The depiction works because that's what happens in real life - you slowly gain skills and become more powerful. Examples: "Mother of Learning", "hogwarts battle school". (This is a very common fanfiction trope)

Method 3: Genius Aesthetic. The protagonist has all the stereotypical qualities of a genius. He has complex monologues. He has Machiavellian plans. He sometimes casually makes deductions from the evidence presented to the reader. (Note that it doesn't actually matter if the reader /could/ realistically have deduced it from the evidence presented, as long as it /uses/ the evidence presented.) Examples: Death Note, Sherlock Holmes.

  Why does one character seem like a genius for figuring something out while another seems like a normal person because this was just an obvious thing.

You chose a puzzle that the reader's mind doesn't /automatically/ solve using background processes while reading AND you /showed/ the reader that it's not obvious (even if it actually is pretty obvious) by making it non-obvious to all the other characters. What sorta loony toon would /actually/ hold on to the old notion of "down" after spending even 8 hours in 0g? Yet when you read Ender's game it all seems plausible. If you go a purely Aesthetic route with so-called "puzzles" that the reader could never really hope to solve, it's same effect on most readers as long as it /feels/ like it makes sense, which is how Holmes was so successful.

Also, you might want to see Yudkowsky's ideas on the topic. [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing]]

I can identify elements of all three of the above methods used heavily in HPMoR. Yhere's also a fourth element of genuinely valuable rationality content incorporated into it that really pushes our impressions of Harry's intelligence over the top.
