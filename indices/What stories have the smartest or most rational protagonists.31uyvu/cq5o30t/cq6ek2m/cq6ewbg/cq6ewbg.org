Fair enough. There's lots of reasons to dislike those books.

I thought that the characters were probably about as sexist as the average for the real-world time period of the actual Crusades, which is pretty extremely sexist - and the characters' sexism wasn't tempered by any sort of contradiction of their viewpoints in the rest of the narrative. There were a lot of opportunities to present female characters in a better light that Bakker could have taken but he did not do so. The followup books to the first trilogy seem to be somewhat better in that respect, but still skew pretty strongly sexist - if you dropped the first series, you'll probably want to avoid those too.
