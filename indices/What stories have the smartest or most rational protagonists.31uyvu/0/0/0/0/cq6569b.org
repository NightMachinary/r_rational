  Also, there's the fact that Shikamaru is really lazy. Really, really lazy.
#+end_quote

The following occurs to me:

1. Shikamaru would become a very different person under the influence of prescription-strength dopaminergic drugs. He basically has ADD.
2. The regular military kind of "soldier pills" have a dopaminergic as a large component.
3. /Chouji's/ family are basically "street-fighting biochemists" who create various nootropics and then tune their bodies over the long term to work optimally when under the influence of those nootropics.

Which is all to say, as often as Shikamaru and Chouji are together, there's absolutely no reason Chouza wouldn't have noticed that Shikamaru was a bit lazy---thought further that this made him a bit of a liability to his teammates, being perhaps unwilling to check thoroughly for traps when scouting and so forth---and brewed up an exact fix for that. (Save, perhaps, for Shikaku and Yoshino not liking the idea. But I can't imagine Shikaku in particular would object, having observed Chouza's continued health and efficacy for as long as he has.)
