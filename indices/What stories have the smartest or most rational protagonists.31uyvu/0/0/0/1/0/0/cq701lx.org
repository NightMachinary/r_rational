I might go ahead do that, yeah. I mean, I only have like, two examples by this point. I was hoping to at least get five before I made the YKTTW page.

I... don't really see how it would be Informed Ability. It's a bit of exposition done by having one character (acting as The Watson in that specific circumstance) ask another character to explain to them what's happening. It's not quite The Watson, because that's an example of a character archetype, and this is just a single instance; a character who otherwise acts as Mr. Exposition in other circumstances could even do this, if there's a single thing they could reasonably be confused about.

Edit: I was referring to what [[/u/Chimerasame]] referred to in their third paragraph as "watcher explains to audience what's going on" trope", by the way.
