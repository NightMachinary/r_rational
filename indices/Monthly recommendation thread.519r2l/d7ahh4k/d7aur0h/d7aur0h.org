In terms of VNs, I haven't played that much. I did enjoy Fate / Stay Night, Tsukihime, and the Muv-Luv trilogy. Fate/Stay Night is a story about a bunch of magic users summoning heroes out of the past to fight over a wish. Tsukihime is a complicated story about a guy with the power to kill anything fighting vampires, more or less. Both those two stories by Nasu had cringe-inducing flaws - I think that at this point Nasu has proven he should not be allowed near sex scenes of any type, as they have been absurdly terrible every single time. Also, the pacing is extremely slow and there's a lot of slice-of-life stuff that breaks up the action.

Muv-Luv is a complicated story where trying to describe it spoils badly, but it initially /looks/ like garbage comedy harem anime BS until it really suddenly and abruptly isn't. The story takes forever to get off the ground, as basically all of Extra is garbage, and even a lot of Unlimited is fairly risible, but Alternative is amazing and good enough to justify the time spent in Extra and Unlimited. Unfortunately, you can't just skip to Alternative as that would deprive the story of all it's force - the setup proves to be necessary for the whole thing to work.

I also quite liked social-justice-ish stories Digital: A Love Story and Analogue: A Hate Story a lot, but Hate Plus was a disappointment and I don't recommend it at all. These are neat games told through interacting with fake computer interfaces - Digital is in close to the present day and is about AIs on the net, while Analogue is in a far future setting exploring a failed generation ship.
