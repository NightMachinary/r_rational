The D&D podcast [[http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/adventure-zone][The Adventure Zone]] is what I've been recommending to my friends for the last several months. If you're a fan of RPGs or the McElroys (who have six~ish podcasts among various members of the family), give it a listen.

I think they start playing a pre-written 5e campaign but depart from it for the DM's own plotline. It's full of wonderful characters, the story is compelling, and the players have a fantastic chemistry, very entertaining overall. I would start on [[http://www.maximumfun.org/adventure-zone/ep-3-here-there-be-gerblins-chapter-three#comments][Ep. 3]] where everyone starts being comfortable in their characters and the DM starts using his own material.
