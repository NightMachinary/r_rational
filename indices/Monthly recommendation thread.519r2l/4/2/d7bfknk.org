Seconding GC (anyone who gets put off by early chapter art: persevere, it gets way better) and Nedroid (wish it updated more often).

In similar veins, [[http://cucumber.gigidigi.com/][Cucumber Quest]] is a cutesy-with-plot comic I've been enjoying a lot, and [[http://owlturd.com/][Owlturd]] does the humour almost as good as nedroid, but much more regularly.

ETA: eh, Great wasn't great. Decent, maybe, but the plot gets stale very quickly and the jokes are repetitive.
