I've been reading a lot of RWBY fanfic recently. Unfortunately I haven't found any well-written longform Weiss/Ruby or Jaune/Pyrrha fics yet, but there are some good choices. Here are my recommendations:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11352744/1/Spectrum][Spectrum]] is probably my favorite. The summary is this: Jaune's seven sisters are possessed by the swords passed down the Arc family lineage and it is now up to him to save them. It has some great action scenes, fleshes out Jaune's sisters, the omakes are hilarious, and has an unusual Jaune/Yang pairing.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/silver-moon-golden-sun-rwby-pokemon.380918/][Silver Moon, Golden Sun]] is a promising Pokemon crossover on Spacebattles.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/satellite-penny-ciel-rwby-fanfiction.411014/][Satellite]] is a good slice-of-life fic focusing on Ciel Soleil and her friendship with Penny. It's quite funny and it's interesting seeing such a minor character getting development.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11518796/1/From-Beyond][From Beyond]] is a competent romantic comedy. Jaune dies during initiation and ends up as a ghost haunting Blake, who is the only one who can see him.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12027237/1/Breaking-Through-the-Bottom-of-the-Bottle][Breaking through the Bottom of the Bottle]] is my favorite as far as pure romance fic goes. It's a Jaune/Yang story, with the two of them meeting again years after the events of the main plot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11765215/1/Just-A-Few-Pointers][Just a Few Pointers]] is one of the only good Jaune/Weiss romance fics I've found, though [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12111333/1/Letters-to-Winter][Letters to Winter]] also looks promising so far.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dust-to-dust-percy-jackson-rwby-crossover.419948/][Dust to Dust]] is a Percy Jackson crossover with Percy ending up in Remnant. It's a bit too early to evaluate it, but it looks good so far.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10534001/1/Broken-Wings][Broken Wings]] is quite good if you're okay with sad stories where self-harm is a major theme. Weiss was born a faunus and is forced by her family to cut off her wings each time they regrow and attempt to pass as a normal human at Beacon.
