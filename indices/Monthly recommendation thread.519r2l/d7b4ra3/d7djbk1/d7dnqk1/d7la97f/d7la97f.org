I really enjoyed A Few Pointers so far, although I still can't tell if it's Jaune/Weiss or Jaune/Pyrra, to be honest. It's very true to the show's characters, very well done.

Do you find your RWBY fan fiction through the (horrible) fanfiction.net search or through the RWBY subreddit, out of curiosity?
