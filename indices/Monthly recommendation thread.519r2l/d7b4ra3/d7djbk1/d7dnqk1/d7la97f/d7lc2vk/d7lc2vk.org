The tags and author's note for Just a Few Pointers indicate it's Jaune/Weiss, but so far the romance is developing slowly. If you like it, you might enjoy the author's other story Technician. It starts off without very much direction but in the later chapters a plot is starting to form. I suspect that it will eventually end with a Jaune/Yang pairing but there's no evidence yet.

I find RWBY fanfic through a variety of methods. I check the tvtropes fanfic recommendation list, sort by most favorites on fanfiction.net, and look for recently updated RWBY fics on spacebattles' creative writing forum every now and then. I also ask people on [[/r/RWBY][r/RWBY]] for recommendations. None of these methods are very reliable unfortunately since a lot of readers don't have very good taste and a story being popular doesn't necessarily mean it's well-written. I do notice that, for whatever reason, Spacebattles tends to have the most consistently entertaining stories with decent writing and interesting premises. The tvtropes lists will usually have a decent number of good stories, but since anyone can add to the list there are also a lot of bad stories there. Recommendations from other people tend to be hit or miss, but sometimes they'll point you to something good that you wouldn't have noticed otherwise since they're not that popular.
