I recently started listening to the audiobook version of /[[http://www.audible.com/pd/Fiction/Jonathan-Strange-Mr-Norrell-Audiobook/B0036NAYIQ][Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell]]/. I've read the book before (and it is actually one of my favorite books), but I think I might like listening to the prose out loud even more. Audible has a free trial offer where you get two free books before having to pay anything, so it's real easy to get of a copy of it if you've never used the service before.
