Liked it mostly. However, part of the plot hinges on humanity having mined out Ceres (asteroid) of water, which immediately blow my suspension of disbelief out the window.

Ceres has a diameter of 1000km, and an estimated 200 million cubic kilometers of water... No way in hell or heaven that could be mined out in that setting.
