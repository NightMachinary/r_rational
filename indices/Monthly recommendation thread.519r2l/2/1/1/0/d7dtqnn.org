  You might want to try the books. They are better not awesomely rational, but good. I say why not awesomely rational but I'm on cell and it's a spoiler but I will say [[/u/Docfuture]] could predict it..

The books are... um... very odd. The first one was pretty good. Every one thereafter was worse than the one preceding it, making less and less sense and having worse and worse writing and plotting.

Did the authors seriously think that someone who enjoyed the massive scope and tense action of the first book would like a later one that was mostly all about a crazy girl having revenge fantasies while (almost) nothing happens? For the entire book?
