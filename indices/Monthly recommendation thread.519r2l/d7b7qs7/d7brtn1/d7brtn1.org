While I liked the hard sci-fi setting and excellent special effects, I just didn't find the story interesting enough to keep watching. I found most of the characters boring, or just unlikable in the case of Amos, and none of them were undergoing development. The plot hooked me early on, but progressed so slowly without a clear direction that I stopped caring. It's got the science down to a tee, but I found the fiction to be underwhelming.
