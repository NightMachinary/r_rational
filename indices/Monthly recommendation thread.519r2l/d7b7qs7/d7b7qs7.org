[[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3230854/][The Expanse]] is a SyFy series about a detective in space and an interplanetary conspiracy. In addition to being excellently written, with consistently great dialogue and a fleshed out cast of complex characters, the worldbuilding and background science are (almost always) spot-on. A great example was pointed out in [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3230854/][the review]] that got me to watch it. Because a lot of the action happens on a spun-up Ceres (since the local gravity is too low for humans to survive in), people living there need to take the Coriolis force when pouring out drinks. It's that well-researched.

The space battles, especially, are one of the best thought-out elements of the show, and I think the people on this sub who were discussing the realism vs excitement dichotomy should really watch it and study it.

About to finish the only season out (only two episodes left!) and I can honestly say it's one of my favorite scifi series of all time.
