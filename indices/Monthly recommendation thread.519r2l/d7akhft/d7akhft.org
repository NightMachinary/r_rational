/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11913447][Amalgum: Lockhart's Folly]]/ (121k words, ongoing) features a Harry who accidentally merged with Gilderoy when he attempted to travel back in time to his younger body. It's a nice treat for anyone who enjoyed /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4240771][Partially Kissed Hero]]/. (Indeed, the two stories seem /[[http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4zp1g2/d_friday_offtopic_thread/d6xuwrj][suspiciously]]/ similar in style...)

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8923291][DID You Hear the Rabbit Cry?]]/ (140k words, ongoing) is an interesting story, featuring a Harry who developed multiple personalities (some of them female!) as a result of the Dursleys' abuse.

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11790377][Champion]]/ (110k words, ongoing) features Hermione going back in time to turn Tom, who apparently was meant to be a champion on the side of good in the great meta-conflict, but somehow was seduced to evil, making Albus' burden significantly heavier than it should have been. (I think the background is cool, at least.)

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12097887/1/Wharf-Rat][Wharf Rat]]/ (131k words, ongoing) features a Danny who can control rodents, rather than a Taylor who can control arthropods. He also seems to be more of a coordinator than an administrator.

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9065052][Soul Mirror]]/ (383k words, ongoing) purports to be a deconstruction of stories in which the Kyuubi gives mind-control powers to Naruto so that he'll create a harem.
