Two days later, I'm done reading Wharf Rat.

I literally have to say - that's the best Worm fanfiction I've ever read. Not even joking. More content per chapter than most others, no ridiculous plotlines, no exceptionally obvious twisting of powers from their canon variants into different and brutally more powerful variants... It's great.
