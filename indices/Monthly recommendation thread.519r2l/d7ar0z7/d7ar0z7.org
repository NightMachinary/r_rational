I'm quite enjoying the music rhythm game [[https://osu.ppy.sh/][Osu!]]

It's a very challenging game with simple rules but seemingly limitless difficulty.

The gameplay is similar to titles like Elite Beat Agents where you click circles to the beat. There are also 3 other modes (Osu!Mania which is similar to Beatmania, Taiko, and Catch the Beat).

The best part is that it's completely free, community driven, and customizable. All you need to play is a mouse. (Though I recommend aiming with your mouse and clicking with your keyboard. z and x are the default click keys. Really helped me up my game).
