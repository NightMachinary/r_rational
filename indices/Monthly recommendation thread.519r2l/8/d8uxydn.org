[[https://tiraas.wordpress.com/][The gods are bastards]], a web serial that I'm currently marathoning.

Summary: adventures of a group of students at an exclusive 'adventuring' university (think apprentices to an epic-level D&D wizard) in a high-fantasy setting where humanity is currently experiencing the industrial revolution using magic as the power source. Brilliant characters, funny quips ("You each have a valuable role to play, as anyone can attest who's tried to play a game of chess without pawns"), interesting settings... One of the best things I've recently read.
