The Adventure Zone is my favorite D&D podcast. Every Arc is completely unlike the one before, yet they all fit together seamlessly into an over-arching plot, and you can tell the players are having a lot of fun. I have my pod-catcher set to auto-download every episode as it comes in.

If people want more D&D stuff, I also recommend: [[https://www.theincomparable.com/tpk/][Total Party Kill]] for the great character interactions and decent plot. [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDXQ_XXbAws7gyakXAPAC8XmqzW38Ivbk][Critical Role (Youtube)]] The DM is the best I've even seen, and all the players are voice actors.
