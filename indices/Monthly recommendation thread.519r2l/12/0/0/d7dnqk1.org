I wasn't a fan of The Games We Play. As I said in another thread: Jaune is completely out of character, even considering the INT and WIS boosts. Which is fine IMO when, like in HPMOR, the character getting replaced is boring, but I felt like the new Jaune in this fic was less interesting. I prefered Ryuugi's other fic Prytaneum, where Percy Jackson retains his most important character traits.

I'll take a look at those other fics though.
