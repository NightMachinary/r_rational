  I think that at this point Nasu has proven he should not be allowed near sex scenes of any type, as they have been absurdly terrible every single time.

A couple of them manage to get out of comically bad territory, I think. The one where Akiha watches Kohaku have her way with Shiki comes to mind, although I may have underestimated how bad it was due to how well it hit some of the fetishes I had at the time.

  Unfortunately, you can't just skip to Alternative as that would deprive the story of all it's force - the setup proves to be necessary for the whole thing to work.

I think skipping Extra may work well enough. I've went through Extra diligently, but I haven't built up any kind of empathy with the characters due to the whole thing being a horrible boring mess. Sure you get to contrast the "happy" carefree days in this world with what happens in the later games, but I don't think it's worth the time investment in the end. Unlimited does way more work at getting the reader invested in characters, and even then in retrospect the only one I really cared about was Marimo-chan, and that's mostly due to the /impactful/ way her storyline ends, which was great.

  I also quite liked social-justice-ish stories Digital: A Love Story and Analogue: A Hate Story a lot, but Hate Plus was a disappointment and I don't recommend it at all.

I can second this recommendation. Not the most amazing of games, but work well enough. The cake thing in Hate Plus was pretty ridiculous, but aside from that I thought it wasn't that bad either.
