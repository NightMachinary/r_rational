Since I usually get a lot from the recommendation threads without contributing much, I'll put forward a few suggestions of my own of things I've enjoyed in the past.

Video Games / Visual Novels:

-Phoenix Wright trilogy: You are a poor defense attorney trying to save your clients. Memorable plot and character, compelling gameplay that makes a court of law seem like the most fun thing ever. Definitely not rational, so if that might bother you please be careful. If on the other hand you aren't afraid of a couple Idiot Balls and silly twists, there are countless moments of heartwarming and awesome to be enjoyed. Nice brain teaser as well overall.

-Danganronpa 1&2: A bunch of talented kids are trapped in a high school and forced to kill each other for the amusement of a sick heartless mechanical teddy bear. Find the culprit or die! Similar to Phoenix Wright (same disclaimer applies), more stylish and anime-esque. The concept is really interesting and well-executed for the most part. Outrageously over-the top and ridiculously immersive and enjoyable, if you ignore the sheer irrationality of it all. Also some interesting logic puzzles.

-999 & Virtue's Last Reward (Zero Escape trilogy): This completes the good visual novel series. People are trapped in (insert game location) and have to escape. A bit different from the others, in that it's based on branching paths and multiple story endings. The games are convoluted and well-executed and with no courtroom-style segments. I found VLR to be especially cool and dealing with interesting issues for this subreddit, heavily recommended!
