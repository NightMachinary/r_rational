I've also been having a lot of time-wasting fun lately with a Steam game called [[http://store.steampowered.com/app/303840/][Point Perfect]]. It's a randomized arcade game in the vein of Binding Of Isaac (albeit somewhat lighter on content; it doesn't have the literally hundreds of items that BOI does by now). It's much faster-paced, though, and only gives you one hit point (but three or four lives per game, and three games per session). It makes excellent use of mouse controls and has a nice aesthetic, though, IMO, an offputtingly rude sense of humor. (Not in the grossout sense of Binding Of Isaac, but in the sense that it routinely insults you for your failure.)
