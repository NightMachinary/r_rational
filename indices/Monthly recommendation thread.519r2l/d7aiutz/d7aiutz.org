I already recommended the webcomic The Dragon Doctors in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/50750j/rt_the_dragon_doctors/][this post]], but I don't think many people noticed it so I'll share it here. If you can get past the crappy artwork, you'll be in for one of those rare stories that's truly special and deserves more attention. See link for details.

As for books, I'm almost done reading The Night Angel Trilogy and have loved every word. It is the single darkest fantasy series I've ever read, there are some points where it makes Jessica Jones seem downright lighthearted by comparison, but like JJ it's disturbing and disgusting for all the right reasons. The plot is intricate, the characters complex, the writing tight, and the whole thing is surprisingly rational with even some munchkinism.
