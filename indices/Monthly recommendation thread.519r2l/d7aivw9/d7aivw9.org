[[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][Finally finished Worm this month, and man, is it good.]] I think it'd be fair to call it the best novel I've ever read; it's better than HPMOR for sure, and IMO, HP canon as well. It's gotten a lot of acclaim around these parts, but frankly, it deserves wider acclaim as well. I'd love to see it be a household name like the MCU, and lord knows Wildbow would benefit from the attention. I'm going to finish up a writing project I'm working on, and then I'm going to read Pact, the second novel Wildbow wrote. I'd like to live in a world where Worm fandom is as large and as mainstream as HP fandom.

I hope this doesn't fall afoul of the no self promotion rule, but I'm learning to draw, and I did [[http://imgur.com/a4F1Zbr][some doodles of the main characters]]. If you enjoy Worm, I hope they amuse you, and I hope to do some more soon, maybe of the Slaughterhouse Nine. :)
