If you find yourself not enjoying Pact, skip ahead to Twig. Pact has some issues that may or may not lower your enjoyment of it, but Twig is significantly better about those things.

That said, if you enjoyed Worm /that/ much, you probably won't mind it. I'm not explaining the issues because when you point them out, they pop out that much more :)
