I have not read or seen Game of Thrones, but I'm a huge fan of Mistborn. I actually picked up Night Angel because Brandon Sanderson is my favorite author and recommended this series. I admit neither series is totally rational, but I think they're both a step up from the standard fantasy fare I've grown tired of.

They have all the standard tropes, but each puts their own spin on them and rationalize aspects of the story. Night Angel has intelligent characters, including a rationalist later on, while Mistborn has its clever setting and magic system. If you don't like them, that's fine, but I count them among my favorites.
