I'm going to offer a counter to this, because while I enjoyed the trilogy I don't think I'd recommend it to a rationalist audience without disclaimers.

In my view, the Night Angel Trilogy is similar to Mistborn in a certain way: it starts out very strong, and gets weaker with each book. I really enjoyed the first one, moderately enjoyed the second, and can barely remember the third one outside of its major set pieces.

Also, while you're right to say it has amazingly well done characters, its magic system is almost completely unexplained and irrational, especially the convoluted and mysterious rules of the Ka'kari.

The main thing I would recommend Night Angel for is the characters, which again are mostly fantastic, with one or two exceptions. The worldbuilding is okay and has some neat ideas, but the rest is pretty standard fantasy fare, if a bit on the more darker side than most. It's definitely an entertaining read, but not in my top picks, personally.

Out of curiosity, have you read A Song of Ice and Fire? I saw a lot of Game of Thrones influences in the first Night Angel, and in my view GoT is at least as dark, if not more so.
