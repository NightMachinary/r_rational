  As for books, I'm almost done reading The Night Angel Trilogy and have loved every word.

Hmmm. I tried starting the first book in that series, and got about ten or twenty pages in before I quit in disgust. It read to me like bad fanfic. I think what got me was the (to me) fake seeming grunge on everything mixed with My Immortal writing level hero worship of some thug because of how badass and "free" he was about randomly killing people and making pretentious statements about how wise and baddass he is.
