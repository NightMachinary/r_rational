On the contrary, Paragon is learning the exact right lessons from this. That the veneer of equality and democratic ideals are insufficient to keep the lower classes in line, and are ultimately more trouble than they're worth. While serving no purpose to the Epistocrat's except to make them feel better. It's in their best interest to drop the pretense and rule by force, and to expand and conquer to fuel a new golden age (for them) via pillage and exploitation.

Remember that Rome lasted for 400 years (an extra 1000 if you count Byzantium) after it's last vestiges of republican government fell away. One of the worst things about authoritarianism and imperialism is that they actually work, and can make civilizations and the people who rule them rich and powerful. At the expense of basically everyone else.
