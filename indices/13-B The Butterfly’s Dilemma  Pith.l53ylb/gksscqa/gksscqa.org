I really like this as... not the conclusion of Wes' arc, because it's clear there's still more to come for him, but the conclusion of this part of his arc. Ana's arc has always been about the ideals Paragon claims to represent, but Wes' arc has been much more concerned with the reality of Paragon and what it's like to live as a part of that system. So as much as it sucks to see the gang split up and Tasia returning to poverty (and I really hope we haven't seen the last of her), it's very fitting that Wes returns to his old life now. It makes all his growth so much more apparent and forces him to confront things that he's thus far ignored by tunnel visioning (heh) on his goal of returning to this life. I really couldn't stand Wes at the beginning, but seeing him here makes me appreciate how much he's changed and makes me realize how much I actually like him now.

I'm entirely unsurprised that Paragon is learning all the wrong lessons from this failed revolution. Furthering the inequality and formalizing the defacto caste system by reviving the Conclave of the Wise, eliminating all dissenting voices by nationalizing the press, going to war with the Shenti to use them as a scapegoat, etc. It's like they looked at all the conditions and practices that led to the rise of Commonplace and said "clearly we need more of this."

On a related note, I can't help but laugh at the fact that the challenger won both of the Ebbridge Ousting fights. While Ousting is supposed to reward the best, most talented person with a Paragon education, it sure seems like that spot at Paragon is more of a punishment than a prize. Doubly so considering it comes bundled with a life as Rowyna Ebbridge's daughter, which... yeah. You'd think the fact that her "daughter" lost the Ousting both times would prompt some introspection and cause her to wonder why that happened, but just like the nation she serves, Admiral Ebbridge seems to have learned all the wrong lessons.
