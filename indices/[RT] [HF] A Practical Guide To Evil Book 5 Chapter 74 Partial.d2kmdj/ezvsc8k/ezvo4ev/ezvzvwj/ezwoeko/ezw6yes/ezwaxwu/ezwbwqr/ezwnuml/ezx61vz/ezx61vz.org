  by choosing who to judge Hanno's judgement is still a major factor in outcome

That's not the worst of it. The problem isn't outsourcing the function of passing judgement to the Choir, but in also deferring to the rules by which they make that judgement.

We know the principles on which the choirs operate are inscrutable to mortals. They /might/ very competently judge, using inscrutable angel rules, that a three-day-old infant should die. Hanno's insanity is that he wouldn't question or argue or hesitate at all. Judgement was rendered.

The way in which Hanno attempts to overcome this is to only enable the Choir to pass judgment on the cases he selects for them. But that's just welding the two flawed processes together. How can Hanno identify the cases that need divine judgment, especially if he doesn't know the rules divine judgment follows? Is he bringing the right cases before the right court?

Best case scenario: Hanno understands and agrees with whatever the Choir's criteria are, and they're preforming a purely functional task (weighing the sin of the subject).

Worst case scenario: Hanno /thinks/ he understands and agrees with the Choir's criteria, and that they're preforming a purely functional task, etc. etc.

Paranoid rationalist scenario: The Choir's rule is "pass the judgment that will result in the greatest degree of confidence by mortals that a just decision was made."
