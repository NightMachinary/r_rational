Dumb question: do we know what the White Knight actually does? First, is it a given that Hanno's coin expresses the will of the Choir of Judgment?

If so, what are the criteria used by the Choir? Is it simply "destroy that which is more Evil than Good?" Because I have no clue what that means in practical terms. If we don't know, does Hanno know?

This bears heavily on just how insane Hanno is, and therefore whether I can support this ship.

...it would be amazing if the Choir of Judgment simply doesn't care about arbitrary killing, and the only special thing about Hanno's coin is that he trusts its determinations.
