The fascinating yet infuriating thing about the Choir of Judgment is that their function is so complex that mortals rarely judge /rightly/. I suspect you're right about killing, at least from a sentimental point of view. Mercy is about caring; Judgment is about correctness.

The best description I've seen about Hanno's function is that he doesn't judge - but he determine's when the Choir's judgment is needed.
