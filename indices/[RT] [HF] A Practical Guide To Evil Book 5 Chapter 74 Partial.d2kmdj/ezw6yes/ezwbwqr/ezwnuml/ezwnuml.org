  The best description I've seen about Hanno's function is that he doesn't judge - but he determine's when the Choir's judgment is needed.

I have issues with that philosophy. I don't doubt Hanno and the choir hold to that notion, but I'm curious to see what happens when Cat/Pilgrim point out that by choosing who to judge Hanno's judgement is still a major factor in outcome.

Also, I really want to see a pissing match between Mercy and Judgement. I'm pretty confident it'll happen even if it's not over Cat.
