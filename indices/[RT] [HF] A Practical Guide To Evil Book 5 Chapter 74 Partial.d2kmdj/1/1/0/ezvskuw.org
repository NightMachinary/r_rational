Stabbing a mysterious friendly stranger merely for being a mysterious friendly stranger would have huge narrative consequences especially when she's here for a peace conference. Especially when this kind of plot can easily branch into a friendship instead of enmity.

Remember, though, that Cat talks to many people, it's just they're not important enough to mention in the plot, so she isn't always immediately suspicious though she probably started to wonder a bit as the conversation went on.

Plus, this is sort of a unique situation in that /Catherine/ is actually the mysterious stranger here even more than he is - he's just working on the farm, she's the mysterious stranger who wanders in. They just fit the mysterious stranger role for each other, simultaneously.
