the Judge Dredd Movie was almost entirely inside a single megastructure. The building almost assuredly counts, though it is at the lower end of spectrum, much like the Great wall of china. Though I won't rate the movie highly, it is something to show the unique challenges that stories in megastructures face and the advantages of having a story in a megastructure.
