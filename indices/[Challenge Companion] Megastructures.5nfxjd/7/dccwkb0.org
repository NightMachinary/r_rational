The note about Gravitational Balloons got me thinking - and this is purely speculation at this point - about a smaller-scale (possibly housing several thousand or tens of thousands) floating station/habitat.

The concept is to have a 'bubble' habitat for (likely flying/aerial) beings with sufficiently advanced technology to build a structure with e.g. a nanofibre weave to keep weight down. (Beings which fly would have fewer infrastructural requirements, keeping the weight down further.)

The structure itself would be filled with their breathable atmosphere, which has a sufficient density differential with the upper atmosphere of a gas giant to stay afloat at some required altitude to have a comfortable gravitational force. (The atmosphere would have to be very light e.g. helium; I need to research light atmospheres that could potentially be useful to the biological systems of life as we know it.)

I imagine it would also need at least six stabilizer engines to maintain the intended altitude and attitude given variable weight of the system and external pressures (e.g. winds).

My initial concerns are: 1) that gas giants can have extremely strong EM fields - is this true for most or all? 2) that the two different atmospheres (when combined with the weight of the habitat, determining its 'natural' altitude) and its orbital speed must all be balanced in order to find a comfortable gravitational force - is this possible?

What are your thoughts? I do want to be very careful about realism when designing these kinds of things, but haven't researched anything yet. I'm thinking about using this concept in one of the later books in a sci-fi series I'm working on that follows the development of an AI society after a human extinction event.

Thanks!
