Regarding #1:

I think you typically /want/ a strong EM field around your artificial habitats. It keeps you safe. Would the stronger EM field around a gas giant actually be disruptive to anything? Maybe telecommunications, but would it cause problems for anything locally? I could see it being an issue if the field was both really powerful and really chaotic, but if it's relatively stable, I don't see why it would cause a problem unless it's strong enough to affect the inhabitants biologically.
