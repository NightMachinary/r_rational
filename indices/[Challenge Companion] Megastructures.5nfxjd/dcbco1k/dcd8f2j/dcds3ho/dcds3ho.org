Nicoll-Dyson beam is when you use a Dyson sphere as a gigantic [[http://www.radartutorial.eu/06.antennas/Phased%20Array%20Antenna.en.html][phased array]], which is when you run multiple radio emitters in sync to produce a directional wave (laser, in the case of visible light) at the point where they add up. There are some efficiency issues with phased arrays (much of the energy is lost in side beams called grating lobes), but it might not be a problem in this context.

They are pretty versatile, as you can vary the intensity and deliver to any number of targets simultaneously. You could use one to make a black hole (which functions as a matter to energy converter), ignite fusion reactions on Jupiter, terraform iceballs throughout the Oort cloud, etc.

You could also focus the energy on disassembling the Sun (aka Star Lifting), to slow down its hydrogen consumption and permit use of its hydrogen throughout the solar system.
