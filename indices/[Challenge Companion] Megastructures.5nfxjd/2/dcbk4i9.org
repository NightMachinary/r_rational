Plot seed: there is a megastructure left behind by Inscructable Ancient Aliens for Inscrutable Ancient Reasons. They left the security on, so while it has advanced technology and possibly knowledge, it's also highly risky. For Reasons, the protagonist needs to get a package from point A to point B, and to evade detection has to pass through the megastructure.

TL;DR: Megastructure as [[http://princessbride.wikia.com/wiki/Fire_Swamp][Fire Swamp]].
