Just for posterity, one of my favorite megastructures is the manga Blame!'s (pronounced blam) "The City", a place built by building machines that were simply never turned off for millennia. It has a radius of at least 5AU, and the protagonist, at one point, walks across a room as large as Jupiter. He isn't really human.
