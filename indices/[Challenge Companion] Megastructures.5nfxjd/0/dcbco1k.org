[[http://www.orionsarm.com/fm_store/Paul%20Birch's%20Page.htm][Orbital rings]] and [[http://www.aleph.se/Nada/dysonFAQ.html][Dyson spheres]] are possibly good examples.

[[http://gravitationalballoon.blogspot.com/][Gravitational Balloons]] are also pretty cool, and might be more realistic than an O'Neil cylinder since they allow very thick radiation shielding, micrometeor protection, etc. without the kinds of structural limitations that a spinning object runs into.

Dyson spheres typically need to be more swarm like than solid structures. Contrary to Star Trek and other popular representations in fiction, they are a relatively poor candidate for a shellworld -- the gravitational physics don't work out well. DS's should be thought of more along the lines of a very high capacity power collector, which can feed lots of smaller colonies (and/or computronium for simulations, which is vastly more efficient than physical habitats).

An interesting variant on the concept is the 'Dyson Bubble', which is supported by light pressure rather than orbital momentum, which gives greater flexibility in terms of the shape and so on. Such a structure would be engineered to be so lightweight that it would weigh about one large asteroid (2-Pallas) if it was positioned at 1.0 AU, or about a tenth that size at 0.3 AU. For heavier designs based on planetary disassembly, a spinning globe design would also be a possibility -- orbiting normally at the equator, with the poles being supported by the light pressure alone, and the hemispheric regions being partially light supported and partially orbiting. This would permit a fixed coordinate system between each point on the globe, while also letting you position the disassembled remains of Mercury in a ring.

If you do use a shellworld as a habitat, you will probably want a Gravitational Balloon (which exploit asteroid gravity to maintain their shape and pressurization) with a suitable engineering workaround for the lack of noticeable gravity on the inside. For example, you might have a bunch of small-ish plastic town-sized cylinders within a large zero-gee metropolitan structure. These would be powered to keep them spinning against air friction, possibly with a non spinning outer layer to prevent kicking up excessive wind currents. Another approach worth considering is genetic engineering to make humans tolerate zero-gee better, or cybernetics (bone surgery, etc.) that make its effects irrelevant.

Many of the 'structures' considered in the topic of megastructures aren't continuously connected physical objects, but swarms that are held in place by the dynamic activity of their components. Dyson spheres (aka dyson swarms) are one likely example of that. Orbital Rings (Birch Rings) are another possible example. A solid wire-like ring around the earth would have [[http://alnaspaceprogram.org/dynamic.html][stability issues]] as perturbations propagate along its length and pull it out of alignment. This might be damped out by building in shock absorbers, or it might turn out to be easier to use a swarm of millions of discrete pieces of ballast (perhaps with on-board magnetics and programming to continually nudge them into an optimal vector). Regardless of whether it is contiguous or not, the mass would be distributed relatively evenly in a ring /shape/ that moves at slightly higher than orbital velocity, being kept closer to the earth than its natural orbit at that speed by the space elevator cables that it supports.

Economically speaking, orbital rings are a great example of a orbital launch capacity bootstrapping. You would boost a few thousand tons initially, then use the first ring to boost the materials needed to build additional rings (or beef up the original one). Eventually you end up with the capacity to launch materials at close to the cost in energy that it takes to get to orbit. Birch's papers note that you can launch a ring's mass in about 1/1000th of a year (about 8 hours). He extrapolates to 1000 times the initial mass in a year in his example, but if you were serious about growth you would actually double the ring mass once per 8 hours for 80 hours and wind up with 1024 times the original ring mass.

Dyson spheres are what happens when you get serious about collecting solar energy using self replicating robots. For example, a single robot unit gets set loose on the planet Mercury which uses solar energy to refine and launch materials to make additional solar panels. This results in the eventual disassembly of Mercury after a few decades, assuming the capacity of the robotic swarm doubles once per year. (If it doubles every month, the disassembly of the planet occurs much more rapidly than that.) The energy of the Sun is plenty for disassembling rocky bodies on the scale of Earth and smaller in a matter of a few days, but this ends up being a substantial bottleneck for things like disassembling Jupiter (which requires centuries using the full solar output). On the other hand, using full solar output (which is the result of around 4 million tons of mass converted per second) to generate laser energy focused on a small point should be more than enough to ignite fusion, or even create a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_starship][black hole]]. So this might be best thought of as a mechanism to bootstrap even more dense power sources.

The economical story of Gravitational Balloons has to do with the benefits of population concentration and economies of scale. Materials strengths limit the size of spinning structures to some degree, but if you can work around that by putting lots of small spinning structures inside of one larger non-spinning structure, you get to exploit zero gravity for the sake of transportation between those structures. Even setting aside the physics of spinning, the shielding provided by the gravitational balloon can also be much thicker without costing as much materials per unit of volume, because the surface area of a very large structure tends to be much bigger per unit volume.
