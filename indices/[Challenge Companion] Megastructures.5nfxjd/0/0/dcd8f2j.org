This is called a Nicoll-Dyson Beam and, even with our own sun, would be powerful enough to vaporize pretty much anything in the galaxy given enough time. You can also use it to accelerate a relativistic kill missile by shining it on its mirrored "solar sails" if you'd rather blow something up via impact rather than vaporize it. It's so ridiculously powerful that there's not much use for it other than destruction, unless they really can create black holes and that turns out to be the best way of gathering some limited resource.

On the other hand, if you don't go all the way to making it a laser, you can use hemispherical mirrored Dyson shells called Shkadov Thrusters to actually /move/ stars (and drag their planetary systems along with them) which seems much more useful, especially if you want to move a star that will eventually supernova out of your galactic neighborhood.
