I don't think you want to encourage pay-what-you-want, because you don't want to encourage authors, or readers, to see the platform as being primarily a mechanism to pay for content that would otherwise be free---effectively, as an alternative to donations/tipping of authors.

Instead, you want the platform to be full of stuff that you can't get outside of that platform; you want people to be told "to get the new updates of this story as they come out, you'll have to download the Serials app and subscribe" or somesuch---you want the exclusivity of the content to funnel people into the app, much as the exclusivity of a video game funnels people into a console.

Effectively, you want to be seen as a bookstore, not a library. People don't value stuff if they get it from a library, even if it's the same stuff they could get from a bookstore. You don't want to be Netflix, carrying the same shows that have been re-run on broadcast television for the last 30 years; you want to be HBO.
