These are fantastic ideas. I totally agree about the need for a marketplace and helping authors get paid more easily. I /love/ the idea of mixed content.

I got onto the above version of the idea after talking to wildbow on the phone. He told me that good authors are extremely skeptical of backing a platform before it's been proven, and it never gets proven without any good content.

So I had the idea to index content no matter where it is. Hopefully this gets people using the experience, and it could transition into being a trusted for-the-people publishing platform. The hardest part is figuring out the pricing model for authors who haven't opted in yet.

We could make all subscriptions cost, and try to hunt down the authors and hand them money, but I have the feeling that Wildbow wouldn't like that. Or they could be free until the author opted in, and we could do the delayed thing. Or any subscription could be free and there could be some other path to helping the authors get paid.

Any thoughts?
