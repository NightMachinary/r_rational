When I get and update, I export it into epub with the Calibre Fanfiction Dowloader Plugin, and then read on my tablet, usually on the same day, but not immeditely. For custom sites that the plugin doesn't support (e.g. /Worm/, /Ra/) I usually don't bother following them, and just wait until they finish and there's an ebook available (either 'oficial' or not so much).

Edit: Not a typical case at all, in other words.
