This matches my intuition. Serials are a small market, and patronage seems to fit better than sales. I've donated 100x to 1000x what I would have spent on serial content.

I'm really worried that charging up front would kill the whole thing. It's not like an app store, where people just dropped $200 on a phone and are looking for something to buy. A healthy marketplace would benefit everyone, but you can't necessarily will it into being.

Follow up questions, if you have the time: it sounds like you usually read on the computer? Do you read chapters because you got the notification or do you wait and read several things at once?
