  Or, put a third way: webcomics, podcasts, "web-original serial novels", and whatever-the-heck-you-call things like Homestuck could all be making money, from every consumer, every time they update

You seem to be making an assumption that every consumer who consumes that stuff for free, would've paid if only you had a way to force them.

Now, I'm not an expert on marketing, but I thought it's a general consensus that even token paywalls (like $.05) reduce the following significantly. And it's more cost-effective for such web projects to offer content for free to create as big fanbase as possible, profiting from that small percentage willing to pay through merch and donation (+ ads).

I don't know, maybe you'd be able to squeeze more money out of customers for relatively big names like /Homestuck/ or wildbow, but I'm not sure it's universally advantageous strategy. And in any case I feel like your proposal stinks of RIAA et al.'s rhetorics (lost profits, and all that).

I'm not interested anyway (whether it's paid or not), I use RSS and email notifications, and I'm happy with them, so feel free to disregard my opinion.
