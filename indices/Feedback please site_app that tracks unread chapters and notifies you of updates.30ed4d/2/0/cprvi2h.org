Oh hey---I was thinking about doing just this site/app. Except, with the subscriptions costing money.

To put it another way, it makes sense to have something like [[http://www.amazon.com/b?node=5044445011][Kindle Serials]] as its own app, with an extremely low barrier to entry for indie authors. You go to someone like Wildbow, and say "just publish your new chapters on /this/. It's as easy as posting them to a blog. You can still publish them online for free; just maybe do it a week/month later, if you want a healthy profit margin." (Heck, maybe the app itself lets you make them free-after-some-period and gives you automatic blog-like hosting for those "freed" chapters, too.)

Or, put a third way: webcomics, podcasts, "web-original serial novels", /and/ whatever-the-heck-you-call things like Homestuck could all be making money, from every consumer, every time they update, instead of their producers having to get majorly distracted by running merch stores and doing Kickstarters for compilation books and doing live tours and so forth. All that's standing in the way of it is that there's no app (or no marketplace, rather) for that.

If I had a program on my phone that served as an inbox for new chapters of graphic novels, audio novels, text novels, mini-HTML5-game novels, etc. that program would account for half my phone usage. (Technically, this is what iOS's Newsstand is /supposed/ to be about. Bad marketing and the need to /make an app/ just to show users you content, killed it for the regular indie content-creator, though.)

And you know what'd be the neat-est part? A given serial could actually be /part/ podcast, /part/ text, /part/ graphic novel, etc. And it'd understand exactly where you're bookmarked in the whole mess.
