Just to give you a heads-up, fanfiction.net in particular seems to frown upon people scraping their site. A friend of mine used to have a site that periodically (twice a day) pinged FF.net about a user-selected list of fics and generated an RSS feed of updates. It worked for a while, then they started blocking it.
