NOTE: See the clickable prototype above. Click links to get an idea for how the site might work

So there are lots of great books being published. There are many publishing platforms, but many of the best authors like to control their content. It's super annoying to try to keep up with serial fiction. It would be nice if there were an app you could launch that would show you which books have chapters you can read. Like the podcast app, but for fiction.

The idea is to create a site and mobile app that make it easy to subscribe to books anywhere on the intertubes.

Features:

- keep track of which chapter you are on
- notify you when new chapters are posted
- works no matter where the book is published
- directly links to author's content
- some kind of discovery of new books (although this isn't the main focus)

My main questions:

- Do you usually read on your computer, tablet or phone?
- Would this be useful to you?
- What other ideas does this give you?
