Hey daydev, so I know you said you wouldn't use this because you already have notifications taken care of. But the other major feature is bookmarking. Would you be interested in taking a look and telling me if you would use it for the bookmarks?

For example, if you read through hpmor, it's super long, and the app will keep track of where you are.

If so, PM me your email address and I'll send you an invite.

Thanks!
