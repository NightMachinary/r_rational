I like your idea of only needing to build a data scraper/importer for each author (or platform). I especially like it because that's what I get paid to do right now and that's the approach my company takes.

If any of the following pieces of jargon sound relevant, I'd be delighted to take a stab at helping you out: ASP .NET, MVC, jQuery, PHP, XML, MySQL, SQL Server

Also, you might want to look at the work done by [[https://haveibeenpwned.com/]] and the technical blog posts of how the site runs on a tiny budget while providing real-time alerts based on scraping Twitter, Pastebin, and other sources.
