Hi Amit,

I finally have the very early first draft up.

Source code is here: [[https://github.com/seanhess/serials]]. It's written in Haskell and React.js. I'd love some help on the front-end, and react isn't that hard (in many ways it is easier than Backbone). I can help you learn if needed too. One simple thing to start would be to make our user-facing side responsive.
