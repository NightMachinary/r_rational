There are two kinds--the original ones serving the Wanderer were a lot like Norse/Germanic Valkyries. Golden Valkyrie's ones are human women who died that she regarded heroic and worthy enough to bring back from the dead to serve her. They didn't necessarily start as warriors--Margie was a doctor who died in her 60s while helping to eradicate polio from the more remote, war-torn parts of Africa, and she's been a Chooser for 17 years or so.
