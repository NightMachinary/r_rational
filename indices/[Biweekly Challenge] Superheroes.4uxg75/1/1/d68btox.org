Lol, I've had similar thoughts whenever I see storylines where the public/mortals protest superheroes. Who's going to deal with the supervillains now? Like, it's never made sense to me. Authors try and justify it with claims of property damage, vigilantism, etc. but does any of that matter when Darkseid shows up? When the Joker holds the Mayor hostage? When Doctor Doom launches an assault that no conventional military can combat?
