Yeah. I was put in the same frame of mind by the recent captain america avenger's film. I mean, yes, the avenger's actions killed a couple people, but in the first avengers film they were about to resort to a nuclear warhead before that, in the second under 100 (I think) died from what was supposed to be an extinction level event. It seems like a really bad idea. I've never really seen a story make someone confront that to my memory. What happens after you ban superheroes and Darkseid comes to slay?

Metropoliton man made me want an ending like that too.
