Nice! I really wish there were more initiatives like this (be the change you want to see, I know, etc. etc.). For slow updating fics, or fics I drop and then revisit after later recommendations, or fics that go on hiatus, it's really nice to be able to recap what's happened. I feel ye olde timey novels would often have an "in which our heroes find themselves at odds with the nefarious shark people and eat a huckleberry cake" at the start of each chapter but haven't seen that convention in anything more recent.
