The idea behind this is that its for people who have already read the series and want to find a specific moment and not have to read the whole story again to find it. Because of that, I don't think spoilers are something to worry about. If you still thin it would be best to have a blank page after every ten chapters, then you could add that in yourself, since the document is public.
