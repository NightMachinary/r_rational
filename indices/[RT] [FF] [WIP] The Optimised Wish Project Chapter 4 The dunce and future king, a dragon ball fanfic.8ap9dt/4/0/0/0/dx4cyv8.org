Hmm, could be about Goku (I'm leaving this out of spoilers since I'm not going to dig into anything special anyway). I'm still trying to find my way around the characters I guess, I have plans and ideas but perhaps can't always make them coherent 100% of the time. My idea there was that it was him following his feral instinct and making a rushed decision (that he /does/ regret immediately afterwards).

Also [[#s][about magic]].
