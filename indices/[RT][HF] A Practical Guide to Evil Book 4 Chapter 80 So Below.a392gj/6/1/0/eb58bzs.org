Your proposed solution of 'Change Sve Noc's name to trick the Dwarves into paying out' does not address the fundamental conflict of genocidal conquest between the Drow and the Dwarves. Or the fact that promises to Cat as Fae have not been demonstrably useful without the other party being injected with Winter.

And the last two chapters have been Cat half-assedly throwing out arguments to try and ally with Sve Noc, not Cat trying to usurp the Night and become immortal again.

You can like the story and still admit that it's not telegraphing itself in an intelligent direction.
