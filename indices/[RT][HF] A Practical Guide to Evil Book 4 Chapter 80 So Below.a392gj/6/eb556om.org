I'm not sure I like the "trial" setup the chapter ended on.

What is Sve Noc even trying to prove here? A name from Below comes with evil baggage, that shouldn't be news to anyone. Is she trying to argue Cat is 'special'? Are we going to have a turning point when Akua shows Sve that Cat wasn't all Evil when she set up that pre-war agreement with the Grey Pilgrim? Cat wasn't going to use Devils or Demons in the first place, because she has longer term goals that don't involve nuking Harrow; she basically conned her way into a free 'No Angels' rule for the Battle of the Camps.

What does Cat stand to gain by 'winning' this trial? The Drow don't want to settle the surface, the Drow ostensibly don't want to fight foreign wars, and Cat doesn't want Winter back. Does she help Sve Noc manage winter? Get some partial cooperation agreement? Betray the Dwarves? Migrate the Drow into Arcadia? Let's not forget, *the deal Cat hashed out with the Dwarves required Sve Noc's death*. Callow is still broke. The Drow can't pay. The Drow seem as poor as a sack of shit, assuming they'd even part with whatever possessions they have left after slaughtering each other for so long.

If an agreement, ANY agreement, can be reached, then what could the purpose even be beyond saving the Drow population? The Drow don't even know Callow exists, the Crusade is irrelevant. Will Sve and Cat team up to fight the ULTIMATE EVIL that is the Wandering Bard? Who doesn't even have anything to do with the /current/ situation and whose location / plans are unknown? Are Cat and Sve going to go on a little tromp around Calernia to bitch slap the Bard and set up the Liesse Accords because 'Oh my gawd that's such a good idea! Cat, I get it now! We don't /have/ to be Evil after all! We can totally pull one over on our omniscient, all-powerful, and unknown overlords! Let's ask the crazy Tyrant in Helike for advice!' Or maybe the Bard will show up randomly and make herself relevant, just because.

Side note: If Cat is still sticking with the name 'Liesse Accords' while speaking with Sve Noc, who has overseen an entire civilization made up of events unfathomably worse, then I declare she has gone full idiot protagonist. Completely full of herself. Same as the heroes. The only way I can imagine that going is 'Neat, can we use that against the Dwarves?' when Cat goes to explain the atrocity that inspired the name.

*tl;dr* Fuck me for writing this. I need to have faith Erraticerrata will do this right, but these past few chapters have been a left turn away from a train wreck and do not (as they currently stand) qualify as rational fiction. Cat's acting erratically, Sve is acting irrationally, and Akua is YOLOing it as a Hero when she could have just bolted.
