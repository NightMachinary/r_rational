Making people eat their finger isn't normal, but on Below it is. Below, not even once.

I wonder how much of these snippets of regretful memories are underlining how the alienation went (first from her Name then from Winter), and how much are hinting at something else. A new Name, closer to the fence than a Black Knight's Squire? Ascension like the Intercessor, not bound by either side? Back to nameless mortal, but armed with the knowledge that sanity and full ownership of one's own thoughts are weapons too? Red herring and I should go back to sleep?
