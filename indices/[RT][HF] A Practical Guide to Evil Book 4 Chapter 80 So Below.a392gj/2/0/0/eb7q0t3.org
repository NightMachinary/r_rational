I think the bard is a runaway game piece. She had a task, possibly for both sides but the Tyrant implies she wants to erase "The line in the sand" entirely. I think her end game is an end to the game between good and evil, possibly through any means necessary.

It would make some sense, her existence kinda sucks ass, and there's no escape.
