The moment Akua reappeared I realized something. The Akua/Catherine arrangement is similar to the Andronike/Komena situation. Bitter enemies versus close sisters, sure, but the rest of it parallels pretty closely. You have an older, more experienced mage being bound to a younger warrior and cast more-or-less into the dark in an advisory role. You have ascension with a poorly controlled mantle to a tenuous position of quasi-godhood. You have the constant sacrifice of their people to accomplish a highly unlikely goal. They both tried to usurp Winter.

They were both driven by the meddling of the Intercessor into things their former selves would have loathed.

That last one, I think, will be what brings them together. They both have grievance with the third side of the game of creation, the Meddling God. Where Above and Below are bound by stories, the Bard chooses their course and makes them. Whatever she is, it doesn't appear to be driven by any of the great powers we currently know.

And it's possible the Bard will cheer on this opposition. One of the few things we know about her for certain is that she wants to die. She makes absurdly powerful enemies of both sides, and it may be in the hopes that one of them can destroy her. Maybe Sve Noc and the Queen of Moonless Nights working together are meant to be another force for the Bard to fail against.
