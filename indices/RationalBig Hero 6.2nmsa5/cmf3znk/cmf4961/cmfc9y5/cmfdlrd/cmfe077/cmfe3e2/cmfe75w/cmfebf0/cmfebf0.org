Well, formal training is exceptionally hard. Still, I come here, and everyone easily starts pointing out flaws I had not considered. I think with a sufficiently intelligent [or number of intelligent] writer, a rationalist version fic of Hero Six would be interesting, given that two characters are designated as geniuses, and the other supporting heroes are probably also geniuses, as it's their technology used later on to become their powers. This doesn't really do anything plotwise (As the plot is more or less centered entirely around Hiro, Baymax, and the villian), so it probably does not count as a spoiler.
