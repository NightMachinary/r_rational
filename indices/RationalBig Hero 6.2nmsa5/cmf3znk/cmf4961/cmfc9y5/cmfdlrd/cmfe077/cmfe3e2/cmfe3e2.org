I vaguely remember someone pointing out an idea for rationalist!Frozen (Free ice golems for everyone!) but I don't believe I've read that yet. I'd like to, though. Still, I'm mostly concerned because people here almost certainly have more rationalist training then I, and so thus I wander in, a noob to the slaughter. And not the fake noob Hiro pulls in the first ten minutes, either.
