That seems a reasonable enough counter. Of course, if the characters WERE rationalist, then that wouldn't really be /as much/ of a problem, I'd imagine since, you know, being intelligent, they'd realize and attempt to combat it. I well know I'm not smart enough to follow through on a fanfiction with such heady topics like rationality, and I keep taking minor emotional hits anyway as I see my topic continually upvoted and downvoted (Why? What is wrong with it? If it's something, i'd like to know.)
