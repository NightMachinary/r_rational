Hey there, and welcome!

First, off: don't be so afraid of rationality. You're not "dumb" just because you notice others being "smarter" than you. Rationality is more of a skill than you think, and to some degree, a lower amount of "talent" can be made up by a larger amount of work and study.

So don't be so down on yourself! You never know what you're capable of until you try, and even if you don't ultimately accomplish what you want, you still learn from the attempt :)

Now, onto the story:

I very much enjoyed the movie, but you're absolutely right that the "genius" characters were cripplingly dumb. Hiro has somewhat plausible excuse: [[#s][]] The villain is the real issue: if it was just some random guy that saw Hiro's invention and decided to steal it, his ridiculously poor use of the technology might be understandable, but as written, we need a lot more.

My idea: change his goal. [[#s][]]

As for what role Hiro and pals might play in that, he might learn of the plan and realize that [[#s][]]

The major problem, really, is Baymax.

Forget the [[#s][]] thing. Why the hell is Baymax important at all? Hiro is unforgivably, brain-numbingly dumb to think that, no matter what upgrades he tries to give him, he would stand a chance against *what he himself made and should know the capabilities of.* He keeps saying Baymax can "take" the bad guy, no matter how many times the bad guy demonstrates that this is very much not the case. That kind of stupidity is only passable in a kid's movie.

Baymax can't just be a comic relief rock-em-sock-em-robot if he's going to have any relevance at all in the story. He has to be something more.

What that is, I think, is up to you, if you decide to write this. I would say that's your first real challenge. For my part, I'd be interested to see how it goes :)
