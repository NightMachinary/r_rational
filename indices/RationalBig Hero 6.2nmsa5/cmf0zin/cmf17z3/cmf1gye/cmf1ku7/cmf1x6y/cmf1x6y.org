Against the brute-force version of the villain, yes, the fully upgraded Baymax eventually shows some use. But breaking tendrils is just a stalling tactic without the portal to suck them up, and ultimately, him being useful is just what the story required. Against a villain that actually used the microbots to their true potential, he is too localized to stop such pervasive, fast, and deadly threat.
