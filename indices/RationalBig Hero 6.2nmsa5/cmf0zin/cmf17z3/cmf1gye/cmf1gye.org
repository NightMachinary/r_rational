Right, the character himself is important, but functionally, he has no uses as-is, other than being a medic. If Baymax was actually /true artificial intelligence,/ that would completely make him useful and awesome. It would also completely change the story. If you're okay with pretty much tossing the script as written, that's the route i'd go.

Hm. I guess that is a spoiler. The phrase only makes sense if you know what happens, and by then it's kind of obvious anyway, but I'll bleep it :)
