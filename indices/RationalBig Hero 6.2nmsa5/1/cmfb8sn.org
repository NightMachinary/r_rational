I was shocked at the stupidity of the characters as well.

1. Hiro's microbots are neat, but the real prize seems like it should have been the headband. A brainwave-reading piece of technology that can transform complex thought to complex instructions without invasive implants? Seriously, the psychic-tech impressed me much more than the metal Lincoln logs.

2. Beymax was innately capable of performing about 30 different complex medical scans in about 1.5 seconds from across the room. His helmet increased this ability to several dozen blocks (through walls, even).

3. The chemist girl wasn't performing science, that was alchemy. Some of her reactions were similar to real chemical reactions, but much bigger and faster. Say goodbye to the second law of thermodynamics.

Those are my top 3 gripes, but there are many more.
