Honey Lemon, Chemist Girl, pretty much behaves like some kind of idiot savant compared. It looks as if she could whip up a chemical cocktail to do pretty much anything in seconds with a device slung over her shoulder, but it fails to be put to intelligent enough use, especially with the kind of intelligence that she must have to do so in the first place.

Baymax starts off as an idiot, but does gain character development- Very well done character development, as the robot develops only from it's experiences, and we are shown just what it's learning from. Good effort put in there, I'd say. Shame his self-optimization levels seem to be low.
