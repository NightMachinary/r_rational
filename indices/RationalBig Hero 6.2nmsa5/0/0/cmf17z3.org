Baymax could be given a huge, huge, huge rationalist upgrade if his total dependance on humans was removed. He can reason, but reasons only in canon to serve humans medically. Even as he becomes a superhero, this is purely for his patient's 'mental health'. If he was able to use his robotic inteligence to do goals other then "heal"... I can't even imagine that kind of potential this late at night.

Fist chip: Oy, that's a spoiler, shh. Secondly, because he's a character, as far as meta goes, and thirdly, because [[#s][SPOILER]] , and so of course he's important, at least to Hiro. I will admit he is kind of cripplingly dumb at times, so I'm not sure how a rationalist! upgrade would fit him.
