Yea, I love this story, I've read it twice. It's an interesting look at what could happen if big corporations continue on a sort of soulless trajectory. And what scared me about the story is, aside from my skepticism at such a software being made and implemented so easily, it felt sort of plausible. Hyperbolic in some instances, but it never felt like some unbelievable fairy tale. It seemed like it could happen.
