I had a lot written, but if I'm being honest, I've rehashed this argument so many times I'm sick of it. Go to [[/r/DebateAnAtheist]], or visit [[http://www.lesswrong.com][www.lesswrong.com]] and start a thread about it, or go to [[http://www.slatestarcodex.com][www.slatestarcodex.com]] and post in the latest open thread about it. [[/r/rational]] is for discussing rational fiction, not rationalism. (for reference, the last two are rationalist and the first one is just very likely to give you a similar answer)
