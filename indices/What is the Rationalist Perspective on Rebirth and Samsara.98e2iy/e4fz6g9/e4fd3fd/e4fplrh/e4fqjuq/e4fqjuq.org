Not really. [[/r/slatestarcodex]], maybe? I don't know if there's a subreddit for Less Wrong. I'm not saying that rational fiction isn't ostensibly about rationalism, more that meta-discussions of philosophy aren't really on-topic unless they're specifcally about fiction. At least I think. Rationalists have never been really active on reddit.
