You're blatantly overusing and misusing the phrase "doesn't make sense". I can't even understand what you mean by it. It seems to me that you use "doesn't make sense" for whatever doesn't aesthetically please you.

But whether that's what you mean or not, I suggest tabooing that phrase. By "doesn't make sense", what /exactly/ do you mean. What exact conditions would an AI have to check to verify whether an idea/theory/concept 'makes sense' or not?
