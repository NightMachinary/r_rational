I always loved the philosophy behind Buddhism. And its emphasis on being present in the moment. The practical aspect of it that we can apply to on our lives. The ancient monks had a very insightful understanding of the human psyche.

Respectfully though, I choose to view reincarnation as more of a metaphor for the cycle of life, as matter flows from place to place to momentarily become you. I in particular liked what Stephen Batchelor had to say about the subject in his book, Buddhism without Beliefs. Even if you disagree with his views, I'm sure you'll find the perspective fascinating and better understand where agnostic Buddhists are coming from.

Jon Kabat-Zinn's Wherever You Go, There You Are will remain one of my favorites.
