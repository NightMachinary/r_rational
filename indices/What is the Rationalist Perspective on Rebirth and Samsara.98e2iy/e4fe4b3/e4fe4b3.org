Doesn't "nirvana" mean something like "the blowing out of a candle"? Like, the realization of Anatta and all that, like there is no individual self/soul because All is One or something, and "reaching nirvana" is like "dissolving back into the All after you realize your sense of "you"ness is an illusion," and by becoming one with Everything you for all intents and purposes cease to exist?
