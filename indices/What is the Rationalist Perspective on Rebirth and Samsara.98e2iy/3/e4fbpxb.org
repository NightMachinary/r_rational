I think samsara is an appealing concept, for me as well as, apparently, for you. But there's no evidence for it, just feelings. The only evidence for samsara would be the unlikeliness of living this life (yours or mine) here at all. Unfortunately, that can more or less be explained by the anthropic principle...if we didn't exist, we wouldn't be here thinking how unlikely it is that we didn't exist.

A better path to go down, I think, is the negation of self. If you can internalize the idea that there is no "you," no hard line between you and everything else around you, then you've just extended your life expectancy quite a bit, because the universe isn't going anywhere for awhile. Kind of hard to stay in that mode and actually live, though.
