There's also the consequentialist perspective: When you believe that you're conscious experience ends at death it can result in unskillful action i.e. some of my atheist friends often talk about how their gonna try hard drugs when their near the end of their life because they believe there's nothing after it's over. For Buddhists the moment of death is the most important time to be fully present and bring all your faculties to bear during the process of death to help ensure you go to a good destination. In this context which is a more skillful belief?
