In Last Air Bender we're seeing the tail end of a hundred years of war which wiped out the Air Nomads, and devastated the Southern Water Tribe to the point they're in a post apocalyptic state with no ability to properly train their one remaining water bender, fostered extreme nationalism in the fire nation, and hate of the fire nation in pretty much everyone else. The only two powers who could in theory be swapping benders at scale in any form otehr than forced conscription of conquered people would be the Earth Kingdom and the Northern Water Tribe, but the Northern Tribe appears to have reacted to the sacking of the South with isolationism and trying to keep out of the line of fire. And the Fire Nation seems to (weirdly) have naval superiority over the Water Tribe so travel is dangerous.

Even then we do see some remnants of internationality bending. The Foggy Swamp water benders live in Earth kingdom territory and practice a distinct style of water bending, and the Sand Benders live in an isolated desert and appear to have learned to mimic some air-bending like methods with earth bending. The Kioshi warriors use fans in their martial arts, which in context looks a lot like they're adapting Avatar Kioshi's air bending to non-bending styles.

​

Then in Legend of Korra, we see exactly the kind of muti-disciplinary bending and industrial boom that wasn't happening during the war and we find out that bending isn't straight up genetics as people with no known air nomad heritage start spontaneously gaining air bending.

​

As to walls.

I expect cost is more important than resistance to direct attack by a bender, for much the same reason we still make windows out of glass, and most doors can be battered open with a hand ram. Especially since the kind of design it'd take to make a house that can withstand a giant flying rock probably doesn't come cheap or comfortable. Historically buildings are usually made out of what's readily available and designed to withstand local weather more than to be vandalism-proof.
