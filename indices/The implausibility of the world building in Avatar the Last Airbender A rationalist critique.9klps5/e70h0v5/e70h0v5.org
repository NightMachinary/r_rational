I'm trying to think of equivalent situations in real life. The first thing that springs to mind is the Chinese embargo on silkworms. They managed to keep an incredibly valuable resource from falling into the hands of other cultures for a surprisingly long time.

Of course, that only lasted so long, and, subtle as silk moth eggs are, they're easier to spot than bending ability.

What about actual prodigious abilities? There are definite hotspots. The fastest runners in the world disproportionately have their origins in a single tribe in Kenya, the Kalenjin. A startling number of the scientists who worked on the development of the Atomic bomb attended the same high school in Budapest. An astonishing proportion of the greatest motorsport drivers in the world are Finnish.

While there's undoubtedly an innate hereditary component in the speed and endurance of the Kalenjin runners, they're not particularly genetically distinct from their less exceptional countrymen. It's therefore hypothesized that what's actually exceptional is their culturally instilled pain tolerance, engendered or at least exemplified by their absolutely brutal coming-of-age rituals.

If the Ashkenazim are innately more intelligent than anybody else (and all those Hungarian-highschoolers-turned-nuclear-physicists were Ashkenazim), it's hard to ignore that this seems to come at a price; they're undeniably more prone to genetic disorders--and indeed, the carriers for the recessive genes that cause some of these disorders may correlate with higher I.Q.

Another, more solid example of genetic mixed-blessings is sickle-cell anemia. Those who carry recessive genes for sickle-cell but don't have the double-dose necessary to express the disease are more resistant to malaria than people who have no genetic markers at all.

Finally, Finnish drivers may be so over-represented in international motorsports because Finland is a very dangerous place to drive. It's characterized by icy, hilly, wooded rural roads that are quite treacherous, and Finland has very high standards for licensing drivers.

So, what might be some reasons for regional differences in ability that wouldn't promote diffusion into a broader population?

With the Kalenjin, it appears to be culturally-specific rituals that carry a high enough cost not to be picked up by outsiders--the monastic asceticism and childhood tattooing of air-benders might be somewhat equivalent.

Congenital abilities coupled with costly drawbacks might only persist in areas where the environment mandates those abilities-- malaria resistance in one portion of the population at the cost of sickle-cell anemia in another portion is unlikely to be a trait that would persist for long outside of malaria-plagued regions.

The famed Ashkenazi intelligence may be related to either of these factors, or both; a costly in-group cultural focus on literacy or a genetic propensity for intelligence that comes at the price of higher rates of genetic disorders--either way, the anomaly is unlikely to persist outside of the insular community that puts an unusually high value on intelligence. Also worth considering--this intelligence was eschewed by industrial nations that /really/ needed it--the Germans and the Soviets--for purely cultural reasons.

Finally, the Finnish ability to drive seems to be engendered solely by the necessity of their environment, though I'm not familiar with much anthropological study of the subject.

Of course, all of these abilities are far less dramatic than "Can you casually hurl boulders around or conjur flames from thin air with a flick of the wrist, Y/N?"

But I think it's reasonable to imagine that such factors could play into an Avatar-like culturescape.

To my knowledge, we've never seen a avaricious airbender; the cultural asceticism necessary to develop airbending might not be compatible with a personality that finds contentment stoking blast furnaces in a Fire Nation factory.

Waterbending seems only to manifest in regions where it's necessary for survival--polar ice caps and swamps. Maybe a single recessive gene for waterbending yields Katara, but if you get a double-dose you end up with someone with horrible mental deficiencies like Sokka?

The most obvious explanation for the heterogeneity of firebending is old-fashioned xenophobia. This could explain why other bending styles aren't pursued within that culture and why other nations seem to lack the genetic basis for cultivating that skill. Sure, the other bending techniques might've been useful, but costly cultural signaling is an astonishingly powerful force. As far as we can tell, the Norse settlers of Greenland /didn't eat fish/, presumably because of cultural taboos because no other reason seems sufficiently insane.

As to your point on walls...didn't a lot of Asian cultures use rice paper as a major construction material, just because it was cheap? I'm pretty sure most medieval peasants in Europe didn't have locking doors.

Come to think of it, my back door is made primarily of glass, and I (a rank amateur) can pick most residential locks in under 30 seconds.

Criminals aren't deterred by the actual robustness of building materials. They're deterred by the social consequences of crime. Likewise, building materials aren't selected for their ability to keep other people out; they're chosen for their price, resistance to the elements and other functional considerations.
