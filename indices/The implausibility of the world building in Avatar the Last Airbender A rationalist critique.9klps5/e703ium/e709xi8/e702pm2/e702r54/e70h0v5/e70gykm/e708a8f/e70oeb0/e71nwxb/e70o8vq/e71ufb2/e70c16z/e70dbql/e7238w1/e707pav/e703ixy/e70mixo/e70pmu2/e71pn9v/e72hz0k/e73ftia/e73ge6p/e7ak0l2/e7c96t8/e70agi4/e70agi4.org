I'm going to go out here and say, after reading your points and doing some thinking, I believe you are mostly correct.

I can understand people trying to rationalize the problems away, but frankly I'd expect better from this community. Rationality means we care about finding the truth or the closest to it we can get, not defending things we like even if we need to avoid the truth to do it.

That's what religious people do.

His points are valid, based on the evidence we've seen he is correct. Trying to rationalize it away won't change this fact.

It's still a great show, this doesn't change that.

All this means is that the show isn't 100% perfect, but nothing is..
