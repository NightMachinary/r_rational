I don't believe there's any actual confirmation that those original benders were the ones to teach humans. Every nation has their myths about how they acquired bending, but I think that's all they were. Or maybe the animals + moon showed them how to better use their existing abilities, even if they didn't grant them those abilities in the first place. Say, dragons shared their philosophy of fire and techniques of bending fire, which boosted a firebender's power far above someone who was untrained by the dragons. And I guess the actual moon spirit may have done the same for the water tribe.
