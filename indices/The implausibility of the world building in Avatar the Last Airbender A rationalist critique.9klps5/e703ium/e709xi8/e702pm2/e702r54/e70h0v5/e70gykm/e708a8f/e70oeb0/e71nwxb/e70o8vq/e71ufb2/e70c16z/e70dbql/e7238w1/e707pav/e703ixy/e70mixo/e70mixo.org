I think OP needs to bring Korra into his argument. A lot of what he's brought up seem to be supported (in a roundabout fashion, maybe even needing a fan theory or two) by Korra's season.

Things like the insane development of tech in Korra (which I attribute to the mixing of ideas), the resurgence of legendary bending, to becoming common place (metal and lightning are good examples, but we also see Bolin lava bend, Zaheer fly, Tenzin's daughter Spirit bend? and of course Mako gender bend).

I'm not sure about the spiritual aspect of bending. Aang and Katara's kids were Air, Water and nothing (until he became air powered too). Bolin and Mako were earth and fire despite being brothers and super close. Given the mixed culture of republic city and mixed marriages why did Bhumi (who seems very similar to OG Bhumi and Bolin) not become an earth bender. Why is Meelo who doesn't seem like a typical air nomad not become a earth bender. Why do children of non-benders not seem to develop bending powers more often (I think Toph is a good counter example, but then we have Asami). How does Katara develop ability in so many different elements barring air till she get's some training?

I agree that racism and lack of transport technology explains a lot, and the Fire Nation can in many ways be read loosely as an allegory of British occupation of Asia (Earth Nation), which is why there wasn't a lot of movement, but OP does bring a lot of points. In india, spices, wealth and sand were siphoned to britain, china got the opium treatment and had it's tea and gunpowder formulas stolen, most of SEA was occupied by the Brits. In this world, when you could have people that could divert water and build walls, I'd have expected far more slavery. Or if that was abhorrent, the situation of the gulf where poor workers are paid a pittance to risk their lives. Technology asymmetry should result in some serious exploitation.

Finally, the avatar is a problem here. Given his/her huge cultural significance, it's a bit trickier to be racist when you have a mythical figure who's had equal representation over history. They're much more connected than the current world and it should've prevented racism at the top at the very least, if not among common people. If there was limited transportation, there'd have been no contact and thus limited contempt, if there was transportation, there should have been more contact and if racism was a thing, attempts to conquer. Maybe the avatar prevented this, but it was very short sighted to not keep the various countries on an equal footing so as to not require his presence (and we can see how Aang ensured reduced tensions between the various tribes).
