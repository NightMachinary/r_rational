All 4 Bending Arts are dangerous if you know how you want to use them. With water comes the power of erosion and you've seen water jet cutters right? Those are basically erosion tools highly focused to a massive degree in the use of water though small, but with water benders you can basically scale it up without requiring larger equipment. And since water is a liquid in most occasions as well as it being a fluid, its motion is highly dangerous which leads into erosion and much more. It can cause rain, it can dehydrate, it can blood bend, it can suck the water out of plants; why not out of humans, you also have the ability to basically flash freeze things the instant you freeze water around it (this can affect blood as well). Then there's the problem in where humanity/man might follow our world's rules in survival, 3 days without water is a death sentence and if you're able to take away the water then you take away the motive to move around be it militarily, survival, or for travel purposes. IF you can affect water in a myriad of ways, why not basically affect the rain, snow, or hail to where it becomes razor hail. (A Phenomena seen in Gears of War, not the bending things into razor hail...)

I'm just saying with the right ideas, water can be just as dangerous as the other elements. Erosion is dangerous why do you think we have to repair/maintain things so much.
