The part that bothered me the most as a young rationalist watching the show for the first time was that every form of bending follows the same rules /except/ firebending.

An airbender bends the air around them. An earthbender bends the surrounding stone in the area. A waterbender needs to be close to a body of water to bend water (barring some advanced techniques). If you put any of these three in an area where they have no access to their respective elements, like an earthbender at sea, then they are essentially powerless.

Fire does not follow these rules however. Firebenders don't need to have a source of fire to use their powers. They simply /create/ fire out of nothing every time they use their powers.

I found this endlessly annoying as a kid because it's inconsistent and breaks the established rules of the setting.
