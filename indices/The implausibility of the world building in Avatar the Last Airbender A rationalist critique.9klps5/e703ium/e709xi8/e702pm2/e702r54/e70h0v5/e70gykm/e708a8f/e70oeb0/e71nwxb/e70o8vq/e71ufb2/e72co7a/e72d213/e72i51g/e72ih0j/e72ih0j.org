  No, you were saying it's not a good analogy because one is the majority and one isn't. I'm saying neither is the majority.

Speak English, please.

  I mentioned a few in the OP.

The opportunities you mentioned require a very high end transportation infrastructure that doesn't exist. Or would piss off the other cultures. The Water Tribe does not want firebenders to keep them warm, that would be an insult to their ability to live.

  You don't need cultures working together. You only need one firebender teaching firebending to people in earth nation...
#+end_quote

Earth kingdom people don't have the genetic capacity to firebend, no amount of teaching can fix this.

  Whoever wants their services. Firebenders in earth nation can command a high salary because there isn't enough supply to meet demand.

/Who wants their services?/ There is no demand! Which is what you keep missing in this entirely economics focused, and therefore entirely ignorant, analysis.
