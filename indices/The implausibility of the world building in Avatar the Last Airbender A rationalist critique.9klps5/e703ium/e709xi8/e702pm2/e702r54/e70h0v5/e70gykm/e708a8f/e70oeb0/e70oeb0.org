Only got time for a new nitpicks. Given that both Water Tribes in the show live at the poles, they have no need for earth benders. In their world, ice already is a lasting, durable material that they have perfect control over, and any earth is buried so deep under the ice, that it is never seen.

Immigration on the levels you are speaking of here, is also probably incredibly difficult for people at the start of the series. Most people, benders or not, are simple farmers living in simple cities. Mass transport simply doesn't exist, and the only people with good ships or technology are the Fire Nation. In fact the Fire Nation was poised to use their tech to usher in a new age of movement and cultural blending... But they choose to use it to go to war with the world instead, so we don't get to see that happen.

Of course oncre the war is over, the presence of all that technology makes cultural blending much easier... And that's what Legend of Korra is about.
