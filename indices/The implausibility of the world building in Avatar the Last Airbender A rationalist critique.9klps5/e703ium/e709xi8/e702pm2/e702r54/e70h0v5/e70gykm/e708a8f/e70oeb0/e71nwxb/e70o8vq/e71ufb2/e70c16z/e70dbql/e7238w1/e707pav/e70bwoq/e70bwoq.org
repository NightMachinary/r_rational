Except that it retcons what we knew of the origin of bending in the original Avatar, which is that each bending tradition arose naturally from observing nature. Water benders with the moon and tides, fire benders with the sun and dragons, earth benders with the badgermoles, and air benders with the flying bison. Now it could be said that the traditions were forgotten over time and then relearned through the observation of these things, but I think it's more likely that Bryke were just being lazy with their worldbuilding. There's plenty of /that/ in Korra.
