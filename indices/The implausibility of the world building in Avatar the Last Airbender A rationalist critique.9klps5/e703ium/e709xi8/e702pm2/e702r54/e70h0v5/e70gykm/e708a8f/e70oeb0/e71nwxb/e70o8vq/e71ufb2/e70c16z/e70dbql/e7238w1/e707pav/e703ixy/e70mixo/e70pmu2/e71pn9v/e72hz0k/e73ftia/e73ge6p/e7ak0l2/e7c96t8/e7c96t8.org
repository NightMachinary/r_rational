I absolutely agree with #1.

Here's another thought. There is in-canon evidence that bending is genetically inherited, excepting the Avatar. Thus in a world where there is intermingling of all kinds of benders, we could find people who can bend 2 elements.

Or 3.

Or 4.

Aand you have your own pocket Avatar, at least functionally.
