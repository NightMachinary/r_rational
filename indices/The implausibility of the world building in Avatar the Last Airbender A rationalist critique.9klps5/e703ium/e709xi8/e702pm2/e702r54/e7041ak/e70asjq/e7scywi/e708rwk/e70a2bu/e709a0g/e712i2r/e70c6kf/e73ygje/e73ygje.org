  They have hang gliders, flying bison and airships, how expensive is transportation really?

Humans have hang gliders. Could you imagine using one to commute? Only a well trained air bender can use them that effectively, and most air bender belong to monastic orders.

Flying bisons are a rare species.

Airships are a relatively new invention by the Fire Nation. On top of that they are constructed with the ability to fire bend in mind.

  They all seem to be the same race though.

If "their skin and eye size seems similar to each other" is your argument for why there shouldn't be much racism then you really know nothing about racism. Look at Europe for all of its history before WWII. Look at various modern age genocides across the world.

Black vs White racism only became a thing when Europeans decided to colonize and needed excuses for their behavior. Other than that it is a pure mental construction, as you can see by the fact that someone who has 3/4 English and 1/4 Congolese ancestry is considered a different race from an English person more so than a half Italian half Polish dude would be.

  This was true in medieval times but medieval times still had merchants and craftsmen going from place to place.

In medieval times Europe wasn't doing so well when it came to science and medicine. And yet you didn't have Arab doctors travelling all over the place in high enough numbers to be noticed.

  Maybe, but a bigger concern than (rampant) theft?

Motion sensor alarms are a relatively new thing. Lockpicking is not. Yet people used simple locks on their doors for centuries.
