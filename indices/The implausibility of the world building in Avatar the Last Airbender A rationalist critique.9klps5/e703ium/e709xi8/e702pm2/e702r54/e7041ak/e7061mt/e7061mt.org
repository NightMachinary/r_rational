Even beyond patching it out, it's not even hard to justify actual free energy. If the objection is that free energy makes the rules of our universe freak out, it's simple to picture our universe's rules and models, and add a framework on top of it that adds or subtracts energy as it pleases.

Free energy and defeating entropy are only relevant problems trillions of years from now, as much as they /are/ big problems. For all relevant purposes, stuff like "Why does the universe care about human brains thinking certain thoughts" is much more compelling than "How can magic possibly create free energy?"
