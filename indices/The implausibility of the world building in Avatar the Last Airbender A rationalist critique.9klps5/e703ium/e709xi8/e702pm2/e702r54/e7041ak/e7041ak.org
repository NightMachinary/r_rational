  From a rational fantasy perspective the real problem with Avatar world is the thermodynamics. Where do they get all of that free work?

I've never really liked this criticism/observation (which applies to a lot of settings), since the answer isn't actually /that/ important within the content of the setting. You /seem to/ get more power than you put in, but that doesn't really change the setting much, especially if the (seeming) gains are minor and/or rare. There are hundreds of ways to patch thermodynamics in such a way that the patches would be "invisible" to people of the tech level in Avatar and/or non-exploitable, and it wouldn't have to have an impact on the setting or plot.
