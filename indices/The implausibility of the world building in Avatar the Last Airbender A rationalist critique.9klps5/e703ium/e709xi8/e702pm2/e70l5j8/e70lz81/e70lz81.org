Are we including Korra in this as canon (I do!!), because i think it supports OP in many ways. Given how all the characters go through DBZ style powerups (lighting and metal bending is now common) and we see the rebirth of all the legendary bending so much so that it's common place, I like to attribute this to the benders coming together and learning from each other. No longer an intellectually stale artform, I'd argue that lightning bending is a thing from merging air and fire (lack of control over power is a thing of air and Iroh), lava bending is from fire and earth as an example (control and unleashing of power)

  Also, and in relation to your second point, benders were quite rare. There weren't enough of them to change entire industries.

In Korra when you're producing electricity from fire benders I feel like that's definitely not the case any longer and Republic City is an example of what OP is arguing for. Even before the spirit season, we saw this as a thing, reminding me of [[https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2011-07-13]]

Mako and Bolin are brothers yet one's a firebender and the other is an earth bender. I can't believe that two brothers who are so close would have such a different culture. Not to mention that Katara and Aang's kids developed Water and Air (and nothing) despite having a very mixed cultural upbringing. I'd argue culture is a thing of societies and two children from the same family wouldn't develop so differently if it was cultural. This implies genetic to me (though not quite your point), and raises a question of causation vs correlation. Are their personalities influenced by the type of bending they can do or the other way around (Meelo being an air bender raises a few questions)

Finally, Korra the avatar was bending multiple types of elements as a child (besides air)

The main characters only had one non-bender which gives us a very skewed idea of what the proportions are. Combine this with all the powerful recurring characters being benders, you get a very skewed sense of the world, either it's awfully unfair to non-benders (a la Amon) or most people are benders and the characters are representative of the underlying population. Besides Asami, the non-benders are mostly comic relief (think Sokka, Bhumi (aang's kid), the crazy merchant in Korra), so you can see how this is a very reasonable reading that bending is actually quite common. We have no explicit statistics nor do we see an inherent class system (outside of Amon's season) to read otherwise.
