  Mako and Bolin are brothers yet one's a firebender and the other is an earth bender. I can't believe that two brothers who are so close would have such a different culture. Not to mention that Katara and Aang's kids developed Water and Air (and nothing) despite having a very mixed cultural upbringing. I'd argue culture is a thing of societies and two children from the same family wouldn't develop so differently if it was cultural. This implies genetic to me (though not quite your point), and raises a question of causation vs correlation. Are their personalities influenced by the type of bending they can do or the other way around (Meelo being an air bender raises a few questions)

I think you've got his point backwards. His point was not that certain cultures produce certain benders. His point was that the nations/benders don't intermingle due to the differences in culture.

I don't know how much of Korra you've watched, so spoilers for that ahead. The nations started out as cities/alliances of cities, with each being on the back of a lion-turtle that provided a certain kind of bending. At this point in the history, there was no intermingling due to the general danger of travelling as well as (iirc) prominent xenophobia. By the time that intermingling became viable, each nation/culture had been shaped by the bending that they had available/their location in the world. So we got the nomadic Air people, tribal water people, etc.

It's not difficult to imagine that, until somebody went out of their way to found a city that was basically an embassy for every nation, they stayed largely separate because of their cultural/philosophical/etc. boundaries.
