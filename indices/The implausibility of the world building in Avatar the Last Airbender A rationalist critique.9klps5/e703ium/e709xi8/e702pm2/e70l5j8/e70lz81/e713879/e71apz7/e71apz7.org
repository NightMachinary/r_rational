It is the only place with mixed heritage, so there is almost no way to compare otherwise. Furthermore, Tenzin only has air bender kids as a counterpoint (if culture was so important, why doesn't one of his kids become a waterbender like grandma?). I'd also say culture within one family is a lot closer than in a city and shouldn't give rise to two very different bending types.
