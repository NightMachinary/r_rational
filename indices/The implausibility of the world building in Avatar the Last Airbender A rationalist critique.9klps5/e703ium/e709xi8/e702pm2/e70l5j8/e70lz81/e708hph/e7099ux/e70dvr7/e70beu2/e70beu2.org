  thinks Korra's tech is canon
#+end_quote

I'll pass on this. Bryke went out of their way in the director's commentary to mention that the aesthetic of Korra was strictly rule-of-cool and not exactly thought out. (I mean think about it, [[http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Mecha_tank][metal-bending mechs]], really?) If I wrote fanfiction of it, I would work it in because it was interesting and 1920's style settings are hard to come by, but not because it was rational. Likewise, seeing as knowledge of electricity in the original canon is nonexistent, I would also ignore schizo tech in the first Avatar that was used for a one-off gag. Ba Sing Se might have plumbing, but it probably doesn't have toilets.

The fire nation was only early industrial revolution with coal and steam: fire nation ships have what look like [[http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_22ZYl0hFu5U/SLJ_RIeesvI/AAAAAAAAASs/9RyDnKO7tcI/s1600/inside+the+fire+nation's+ship.jpg][gas lamps]] in them instead of electric lighting; in most shots fire nation residential buildings are only two to five stories tall, this is consistent for every nation except the air nomads, who, ironically, seemed to be the only ones to build primarily with stone. ([[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/a/aa/Sector_bajo.png/revision/latest?cb=20131226144759&path-prefix=es][Even Ba Sing Se seems to be mostly wood]], at least in the lower-class areas - it's only Omashu that uses stone heavily in both its architecture and infrastructure.) The Earth Kingdom is very clearly a set of at least two kingdoms, because we know both Kuei (in Ba Sing Se) and Bumi (in Omashu) exist. There might be some kind of hierarchy here that we don't get to see, but it's safe to say they're probably feudal. The fact that bending doesn't seem to be used to great effect in construction in the biggest city in the Earth Kingdom leads me to believe that there just aren't the same proportion of Earth benders to civilian as there are, say, water benders to civilian. In fact, the most non-benders we see in a given place are in the Fire Nation and the Earth Kingdom, and the most benders we see are in the Air Temples during the Aang's flashbacks. I'd put good odds on the civilizing factor of large societies dampening the influence of spirits or something of that nature.

  How so? They seem very distinctly useful to me.

The usefulness of benders is tough to pin down because most of them are conscripted into the military. It's obvious that at least some earth benders push carts for a living, but every available water bender at the north pole is probably serving in their army or as a healer. The same is probably true of the fire nation. And I can't really see any /industrial/ applications for air bending. I don't buy the whole conceit in Korra that lightning-benders could generate enough energy in electricity to meet even a fraction of the demands of an industrial society; the same should hold true for fire bending to fuel a steam engine or water bending to push a turbine - it might be good enough for /transportation/, like how the fire nation uses their hot air balloons, but probably not for industry. Think rowing a boat versus hand cranking a shaft to generate electricity. Even if it was, benders require years of training and probably don't enjoy monotony, in /addition/ to being rare, so you'd have to pay them tons of money. Which is why the fire nation was enslaving earth benders to mine coal for them rather than just fueling their growing economy with their fists and sheer rage.
