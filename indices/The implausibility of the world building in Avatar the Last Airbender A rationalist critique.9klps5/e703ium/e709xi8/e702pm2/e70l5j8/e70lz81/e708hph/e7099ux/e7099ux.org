the fire nation was in the industrial revolution, yes, and it was also in the middle of, well, "sharing" its fire-bending powers in the world by colonizing everything. There are, in fact, fire nation colonies in the earth kingdom. Meanwhile the airbenders are already wiped out; there are almost no water benders in the southern water tribe, and the northern water tribe is turtled up to stay out of the war. And it's not like anybody is going to move to the fire nation and start selling their bending services.
