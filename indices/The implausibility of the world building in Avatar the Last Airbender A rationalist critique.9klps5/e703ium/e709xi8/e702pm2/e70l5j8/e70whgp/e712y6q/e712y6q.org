Yes, every nation would want waterbender healers for their government officials. But demand does not mean that there is a supply. At the time of the show, the Northern Water Tribe was rather xenophobic, and the Southern Water Tribe had no healers to spare. The Northern Tribe only allowed women to be healers, and kept close control of their women. Is it at all likely that a Water Tribe healer would be allowed to leave? And if they left without permission, doesn't it seem likely that they would be dragged back? An escapee would need to cunningly fake their death, and then make it to an employer, who would need to treat the healer with enough respect that they could trust the healer not to kill the patient out of spite. And with the amount of racism and xenophobic paranoia we see in the show, that seems unlikely.
