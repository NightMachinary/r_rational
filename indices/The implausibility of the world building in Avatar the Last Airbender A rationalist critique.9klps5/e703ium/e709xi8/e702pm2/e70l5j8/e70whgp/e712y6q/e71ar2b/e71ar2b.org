  Is it at all likely that a Water Tribe healer would be allowed to leave?
#+end_quote

Yes. First, there were other waterbenders besides the polar tribes. Second, you're taking the world shown to us as a given, whereas OP (and me) is arguing that it's impossible for the world to come to that state. People trade and people love being paid. Healers would be showered in money and favors. There's incentive to regulate that, yes, but to prohibit? In any way, prohibition doesn't work, we know that very well from the real world examples.

  And if they left without permission, doesn't it seem likely that they would be dragged back?

That's kinda hilarious considering that the show was about a group of runaways.

No, it doesn't. At least not /all/ of them. These women are not criminals, nobody would help the water tribe to enforce their customs. Sure, some unlucky runaways would be caught and brought back, but some won't.
