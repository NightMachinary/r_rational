Perhaps I misrepresented my stance. If you are determined enough, it is possible to come up with /how/ it would have happened. After all, munchkining powers is like half of what this sub does.

The main issue I have is that it is entirely illogical for a world that relies entirely around very specific kinds of magic to develop precisely to 1920's Earth technology. Throughout the entirety of ATLA, every part of the technology was clearly developed from the perspective of a world that has these magical powers in it. Why, then, does Korra essentially throw out all of that effort and reduce everything down to "technology is identical to Earth, just we use Benders to generate power instead."

If I didn't know better, I would interpret Korra as particularly lazy fanfiction, rather than the "official" continuation of the series.
