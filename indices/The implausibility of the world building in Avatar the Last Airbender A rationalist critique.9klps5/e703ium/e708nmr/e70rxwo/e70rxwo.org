  We have police in the real world too, but that doesn't mean people leave their front doors unlocked.

Yeah but remember that bending is still fairly rare. A bender usually won't be unemployed and as bending is still partially genetic, benders are often children of other benders and almost always require a bender to teach them how to actually use their powers. The chance of a bender coming along that can use their powers effectively and also has no connections/opportunities to make a better life for themselves legally is very low.

People typically don't become criminals when placed in situations like this. There is corruption and people abusing their position but petty crimes and murders aren't common from benders, certainly not enough that building houses the hard way is worth it for the absolute majority of the population.
