I just think it took a generally interesting mythical origin story that fit with the theme of the first avatar and turned it into something pretty lame. Just like how the in-story title of "Avatar" went from "Avatar of the spirit world, master of all elements" to "Avatar of this one overpowered spirit that's one half of a world-destroying whole based on a whole yin-yang thing that we /already did/ for the moon and water spirits in the last show." And now the bridge to the spirit world thing is /literal/. What used to be a story vaguely based on real Asian mysticism completely detached itself from that inspiration.

And it also means the power of bending isn't really /the bender's,/ it's just on loan, which I think is bad for other reasons.
