  The Mongols could have taught the Chinese to be amazing Horsemen, and the Chinese could have taught the Mongols how to establish a centrally planned Kingdom.

That's because the Chinese had arable farmland and thus cities (which makes having horses a lot less useful than on the Mongolian steppe) and thus the ability to have a centrally planned kingdom. The moment the Mongols took over China (Qin) they stopped using their amazing horses and started using a centrally planned kingdom.

Yes, because humans lived in groups of less than 200 people (where everyone knew everyone) for most of human history. But the moment you leave your door unlocked in a city (like Ba Sing Se was) you're opening yourself up to getting things stolen from.
