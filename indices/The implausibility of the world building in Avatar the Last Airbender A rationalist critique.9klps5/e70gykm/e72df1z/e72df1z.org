  Look up how many groups people lived in other nations back in 1000 AD on Earth.

They don't have to be other 'groups'. I bet ya craftsmen of all types were in all nations back in 1000 AD. Likewise there should be benders of all types in all nations, they're literally just another profession.

This is true for small, tribal/village communities of no more than 200 people. But if you lived in a city (which Ba Sing Se clearly was) and you don't have at least something to discourage people from breaking in (like a lock), you're just asking to get stolen from.
