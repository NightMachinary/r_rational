re: point 2, or maybe people just build houses out of the materials that their nation can bend because... that makes it really easy to build houses, you know?

Also, it doesn't really matter if your house is made of earth or not when an earth bender can just chuck giant rocks at it, or wreck havoc on the very ground it's built on.

All that being said... are you even correct that people are building houses out of earth or rock? I just skimmed through the /City of Walls and Secrets/ episode, and a lot of the walls in Ba Sing Se look wooden to me. Also, the water nation does has some igloos, but they seem to mostly use tents.
