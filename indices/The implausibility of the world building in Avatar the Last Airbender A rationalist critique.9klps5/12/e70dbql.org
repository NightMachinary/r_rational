I think your first point is the strongest. I'm not particularly sure how useful fire and air benders would be, although being able to make sailing ships go far faster would be handy, but earth and water benders would be extremely useful. Water has healing, which would be amazingly useful in such a society before the invention of antibiotics and anaesthesia. Couple that with their ability to pull fresh water out of the air in the middle of the ocean, and catch fish with almost trivial ease, and water benders would be amazingly wealthy and welcomed in every corner of society. Earthbenders could build homes, levees, roads, bridges, wells, mountain paths, just about anything structural that a society could need. Their ability to reshape terrain on a large scale if given enough time would also make them indispensible for any nation that wants secure borders.
