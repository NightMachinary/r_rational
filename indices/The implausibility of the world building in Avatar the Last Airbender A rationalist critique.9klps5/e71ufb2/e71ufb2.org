  To draw an analogy, imagine you had four nations: Tailor Nation, Smith Nation, Carpenter Nation and Mason Nation, with each nation populated solely by craftsmen of the namesake of the nation (ie all the tailors in the world are in Tailor Nation, etc).

Bad analogy because the benders aren't the sole population of each nation, the majority aren't benders.

  In this kind of world, Tailor Nation would have a desperate need for smiths, carpenters, and masons; and similarly for the other nations. e.g. For Tailor Nation to get a Smith would be of enormous economic benefit to the nation - they'll finally be able to smith tools!

The essentially functions of a national economy do not need benders to function. Farmers hoe fields scribes write taxes without them.

You're also completely ignoring how bending is not a solely practical function. It is a spiritual art and practice native to each culture. *A firebender and non firebender of the fire nation have much more in common than a fire bender and any other bender.* Why would a fire bender ever want to leave and offer his services to the other nations?

  But in Earth Nation, literally every bender is an earth bender, meaning any one of these people can treat your house like it's rice paper. Any of them can go into your home and loot your belongings, or kill you in the middle of the night with little or no advance warning.

So can regular thieves, doors and windows aren't impenetrable.
