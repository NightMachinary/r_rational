I think with some high level techniques yet to be developed that firebenders could be the most offensively powerful class of bender.

Firebending isn't just about fire. It's about heat, light, life, and explosive power. If an earthbender can make instant lava, I see no reason a firebender couldn't shoot a plasma beam or something.

Airbenders could probably do stuff with vacuums and shock waves, which is obviously pretty powerful if you can make them have the force of a grenade or more.

Personally, I'd rank earth and fire benders as strongest, followed by air and then water. I know water has bloodbending, but most people can only use that on a full moon if ever. On the other hand, shooting blades of sharp ice through the air is pretty good, so as things stand (currently airbenders can't do powerful explosions with air pressure) I guess the bottom spot would indeed be taken by Air. Water is more deadly on a small scale, but if airbenders can figure out air grenades then they join the big boys, and Water just doesn't seem capable of the large scale destruction the others could without many benders. It's too targeted.
