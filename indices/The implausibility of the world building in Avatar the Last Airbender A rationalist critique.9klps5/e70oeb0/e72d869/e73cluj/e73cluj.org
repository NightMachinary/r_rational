But who says that one single firebender would be able to teach benders in the Earth Kingdom how to firebend? Where would that person find students? All the new, young firebenders would be born back in the Fire Nation, where they would probably have access to much better tutors, and all of the benders born in the Earth Kingdom, would be Earth Benders. The original canon is a bit fuzy on this regard, when it comes to whether bending is spiritual or genetic, or some mix of the both, but even in Legend of Korra where significant mixing has occurred, people who can firebend still have at least one firebending/fire nation parent. Bending isn't just a skill one can learn, with elements just being trades (which is where the original metaphor fails). One's ability to bend, and the element one bends, are both innate qualities, that cannot be changed (which is what makes the Avatar so special; only they can bend more than one element).

Also, my main point is that, from what we see from the Poles in canon, it is extremely hard to find any earth. In fact, from what we have seen, there might not be any Earth there at all; from what I remember from the show (and Korra) there are ice tunnels and caverns that go significantly deep underground. The only Earth I remember ever seeing was in the spirit gardens which, being spirit gardens, could just have been magical areas created by the spirits, for the spirits. It seems likely that the poles in Avatar are both like the North Pole in our world; two floating masses of ice, with no actual rock or stone underneath.

And also, why would a society of primarily water-benders want earthen walls, instead of ice ones, when they live in a society where ice never melts, and they can use their water bending to repair ice walls a lot easier than they could earthen ones? Earthen walls may be sturdier, but given how easily a single water bender can manipulate their ice walls to create stairs, doors, pathways, etc... is probably a lot less economic for a society's whose main concern is foreign invaders, rather than internal strife.

And if bending is at least semi-spiritual (as it is heavily implied to be in canon, and by the creators comments after the fact), most earth benders would greatly dislike living in a place so acutely cut of from their element. At least for Earth - Water Tribe transitions, I think there are too many barriers in place to make that any kind of profitable, especially considering the fact that there might not be any earth to bend at any of the poles in the Avatar universe, and that the Water Tribe doesn't really have any use for earth-benders when it comes to construction.

I think the original Trade metaphor has muddied the waters a lot. 1 fire-bender, or water-bender, or earth-bender, couldn't move to a new nation, and open a school teaching their style of bending and start a business and create a whole new industry. Not only would they have to bring with them a lot of their country men, in order to preserve the genetic aspect of their bending (so that it passes on), they would also have to transplant significant amounts of their culture as well, in order to make certain those kids born with the potential to become benders, actually become benders. And at this point, the leadership of wherever hey are moving to might start seeing this endeavor less like a business venture, and more like a foreign power trying to set up a colony.

Plus benders are actually quite rare in this setting, to the point where, in the original canon, a semi-average sized village might only have one or two, and it was actually plausible for the Fire Nation, in acts of war, to try and exterminate/round up all the benders in an area to try and kill off the ability.

So you would need a lot of transportation (to transplant enough people to start a self-sustaining micro-culture), and a whole lot of incentive to convince highly spiritual people (benders), to leave a place immersed in their culture and spirituality, and go somewhere foreign. And I argue that that kind of transport technology was only created by the Fire Nation... right before they went to war. And that kind of incentive, was only created by Aang when he, as the Avatar, beat the Fire Lord, and started campaigning for the need for the nations to come together, creating Republic City.
