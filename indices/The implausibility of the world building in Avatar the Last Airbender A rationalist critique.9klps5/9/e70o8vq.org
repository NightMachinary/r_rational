One easy solution would be to make bending a matter of culture, or even geography. If two fire benders move to the Earth nation and their kids are raised surrounded by Earth nation culture, they'd be Earth benders not fire benders.

So you'd still see stuff like rulers paying a lot for a water bender healer to come around, but by the time of the show a large war would have resulted in the borders going back up and each nation reverting to a single style.

You could also get some cool ideas with Republic City being a culture capable of producing any type of Bender, but it's got a notably lower proportion of benders to any other nation.
