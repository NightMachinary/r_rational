How is the firebender going to teach firebending to people who aren't capable of learning it?

You're like the guy who asks why the Jedi don't teach everyone how to use the Force, except there are four flavors of Force here and only one person at any given time can use all of them.

Earthbenders can't learn how to bend fire, water, or air. Non-benders can't learn how to bend anything at all: bending is something you've got or you don't, and if you have it then it's a matter of learning how to use it well, just like you can teach running to a person who has legs but you can't teach “has legs” to someone who doesn't have legs.
