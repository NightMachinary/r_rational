  they have no need for earth benders

They'd be very useful for mining for raw material such as metals. And ice is very fragile compared to stone.

  Mass transport simply doesn't exist

Neither did it exist in medieval times, but given the massive potential to turn a profit, people would have underwent the journey. And don't forget that once a single firebender goes to the earth kingdom, he'd have massive incentive (tuition fees) to teach firebending to others there. So you don't actually need much transportation.
