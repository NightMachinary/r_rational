I wish it was. I really, really wish it was.

​

Unfortunately, it isn't actually so. Rather, technological development was simply far faster in the four nations than it was in our own world due to their particular brand of magic lending itself very well to industry.

​

First off, a major inhibitor in technological advancement has often been energy consumption, and progress stalls until new energy methods come along to allow for progress to continue (I've even heard it go so far as to have people day that 'Industry is just the story of humans getting better at making fire'). In the world of ATLA, there is no such inhibitor, as there's entire countries that can create fire out of nothing, who can power waterwheels by waving their hands, and move literal tons of raw materials with virtually no effort. As such, transport and energy difficulty are both vastly reduced with this system. In addition, at about the same time as their Industrial Revolution, Metalbending was also on the rise, which only further allows industry to move on at essentially light-speed.

​

So it is indeed possible that they could have had an Industrial Revolution taking them from circa 1800 to 1920 in 70 years- given all their advantages, though, I'm almost surprised they didn't get even further. I will still agree with you on the 'why' part, though. In a world with Benders, technology is largely redundant.
