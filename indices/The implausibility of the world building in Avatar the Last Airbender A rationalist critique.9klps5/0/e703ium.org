  Because of the potential benefits of doing this, benders should go to where they would be in higher demand and the four nations would go out of their way to recruit benders from other nations, until ultimately all four nations have the same proportion of each Bender type.

[[http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Bending_arts#Inheritance][Bending is at least partially spiritual rather than genetic.]] If some isolated firebenders move to the Earth Kingdom, they'll be influenced by Earth spirits, and some or all of their bending children will be not firebenders but earthbenders.

You can make a case that there should be a constant, gigantic stream of back-and-forth migration between all the nations to make up for the deaths of immigrant benders, or that each nation should have within itself persistent pockets of immigrant benders large enough to sustain their own spirits and cultures and therefore their own bending---but mass migration across huge distances doesn't seem very realistic for low-tech, agrarian societies, and it may be that even city-sized pockets of immigrants are insufficient to supplant the native spirits without violence done against the native environment by the invaders. It seems much easier to say: "Barring the wholesale destruction of Earth people, culture, and environment in the area (as executed in the Fire Nation colonies, and as attempted across the entire Earth Kingdom by Phoenix King Ozai), the spirits in the Earth Kingdom are powerful enough to convert most Earth Kingdom inhabitants to Earth affiliation, and all or nearly all benders born in the Earth Kingdom are earthbenders."

  Even if the nations were single element at the start of the story, the fire nation should want to impress benders of the other types into its own armed forces because of the tactical advantages doing so would offer.

[[http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Hundred_Year_War][The propaganda behind the Hundred Years' War was centered around the Fire Nation's desire to impose "civilization" on the other, "inferior" nations.]] Admitting other nations' soldiers into its ranks (even as slave soldiers) would subvert the Fire Nation's own casus belli and reduce morale.

  The point of walls made of stone[/ice] is to provide secure, sturdy shelter, including protecting one's belongings from getting stolen, or from being attacked. But in Earth[/Water] Nation, literally every bender is an earth[/water] bender, meaning any one of these people can treat your house like it's rice paper.

In Ba Sing Se, any thieves will be caught and /severely/ punished by the Dai Li. I think it's safe to assume that similar (though less-draconian) measures are in place in other Earth Kingdom and Water Tribe cities and villages: Bending police are best-equipped to deal with bending criminals.
