  Why do you believe this?
#+end_quote

One waterbender can't run a factory, you need mass migration of all the waterbenders in the world to factories to make to make a meaningful impact, it's far simpler to just make a non bender system that removes water.

#+begin_quote
  Right. In the same way that the West wouldn't want the East's gunpowder, because it would be an insult to their romantic notions of warfare.
#+end_quote

No, not in the same way, because gunpowder is a tool any culture can produce on it's own and not a basic feature of civilization's culture. Asking firebenders to heat them in the winter is saying that they can't survive the winters on their own, this is really very obvious.

#+begin_quote
  Really? Where is this in the canon?
#+end_quote

Where is bending being genetic canon? It's all over the show, characters either bend or can't, and each region is made of people who can only bend one element. ðŸ˜’

#+begin_quote
  Of course there is. In the winter, or for lighting, or for crafting (ie. smithing), or for powering steam engines, and much, much more.
#+end_quote

There is no demand for having /an enemy/ do these things. Some other user made the great analogy of the Chinese asking the horse riding tribes to teach them horseriding. It's an idiotic utopian fantasy.
