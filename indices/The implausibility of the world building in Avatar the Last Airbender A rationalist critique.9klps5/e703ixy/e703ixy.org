Maybe genetics are to blame?\\
For example, if every person carried a gene of a determined element and for a person to be a bender, neither of his parent's gene can be of another element. It would then be unpratical to keep an foreign element of bending for multiple generations.\\
That problably wouldn't hold until modern era, but it could certainly last until around the industrial revolution, when avatar takes place.\\
Non-standart benders would then be too rare to affect the economy too much, instead being treated as valuable resources.

As for the walls, I can't remember if any benders were shown actually going through them, but I'm pretty sure they could. Maybe most were reinforced with other materials, but that seems pretty ineficient.
