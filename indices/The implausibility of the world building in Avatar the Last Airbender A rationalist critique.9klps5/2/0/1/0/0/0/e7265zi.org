  In cultures willing to trade, in cultures that accept money. Southern Water tribe was too small for money.
#+end_quote

If they have no money does that mean they can't be paid in tropical fruits? Everyone needs something, trade precludes currency. We know that even primitive tribes facilitate trade.

  a mendicant waterbender moving from town to town, encountering King Bumi who has stubbed his toe, healing his toe, and then being invited to Omashu to live a life of luxury: the waterbender would sense a trap.
#+end_quote

What trap, exactly? If one can offer unique and valuable services that are in demand, they can expect the market to react accordingly. It is common knowledge that King Bumi is an idiot who stubs his toe every week, and has desired to hire a healer on several occasions. And if he has a reputation of treating his other hires fairly, why hiring a healer would be any different?

  a mendicant waterbender being captured by the Fire Nation Army and being forced to heal Fire Nation soldiers: the Fire Nation Soldiers would anticipate that the Water Tribe healer would have been trained in the arts of war, and would sicken the soldiers in order to allow the Water Tribe healer's escape. Thus, the Fire Nation soldiers would not use the healer.
#+end_quote

That's a niche case. Okay, a water tribesman won't collaborate with the fire nazi, or the Dai Li, because unlike King Bumi these guys don't have a good reputation. But the point is, fire people aren't in nazi mode perpetually. It's a relatively short period of their history. I mean, come on, Iroh was fully willing to settle down in an earth city serving the best tea in the world, and only for narrative reasons he didn't. So why a water mage would be different?

  Aang is the Avatar; his spiritual mandate is to wander the world, solving problems. In the plot of the show, good people help him on his quest and bad people restrain him.
#+end_quote

How is this fundamentally different from a healer? She helps people of all tribes. Good people aid her, bad people want to capture her?

  Katara and Sokka aren't runaways; they're his escorts. Zuko is in exile.
#+end_quote

They are enemies of the fire state, being on the run for the entirety of the show. Zuko was in exile but later defected and became a criminal in the eyes of the fire state AFAIR. A healer on the run won't be in such a dire situation.
