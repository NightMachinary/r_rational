Sort of.

We do see Wan being guided through the "dragon dance" by a dragon in the montage prior to his first use of actual fire-bending forms rather than just crudely throwing gobs of fire like he did before.

It's at least plausible that the modern story of how benders learned bending is a reference to the traditions and forms they use to not suck at it more than just having the ability to command an element.
