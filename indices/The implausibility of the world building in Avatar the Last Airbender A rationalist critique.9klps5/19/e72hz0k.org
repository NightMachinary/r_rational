BTW, random thought relevant to #1 that I haven't seen anybody bring up: there IS an example of a set of benders working for another nation: Azula has major successes by working with the Dai Li. It's a pretty bold move, all things considered, but a very shrewd one. She's basically the rational character picking up the $20 bill.

(and yes, I do still think there are perfectly good reasons why that $20 bill was still on the ground until azula picked it up)
