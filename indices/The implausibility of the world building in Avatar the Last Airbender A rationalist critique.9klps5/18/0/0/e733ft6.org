  Nope, there were like at least 50-100 drawn out in the anime for when they were entering the water tribe place and the subsequent battle there. Similarly there were at least 50-100 earth benders and fire benders. With the implication of their being a ton more.

[[/u/eroticas]] is correct. Katara was the only waterbender in the Southern Water Tribe. You may have mixed it up with the Northern Water Tribe. I'm not sure where you're talking about the 50+ Earthbenders.
