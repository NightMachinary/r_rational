  people don't use bending for technological progress

Yes, but the thing is, they /totally would have in a realistic world/, you just don't leave obvious uses for bending un-explored when there's a lot of money to be had from finding uses for bending.

  Wasn't Katara the only water bender in her tribe?
#+end_quote

Nope, there were like at least 50-100 drawn out in the anime for when they were entering the water tribe place and the subsequent battle there. Similarly there were at least 50-100 earth benders and fire benders. With the implication of their being a ton more.
