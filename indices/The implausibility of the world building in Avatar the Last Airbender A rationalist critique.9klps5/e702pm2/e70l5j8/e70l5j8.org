There aren't any primitive cultures among major nations of Avatar. There are highly sophisticated societies with millennia of written culture and developed economies. They are also fairly urbanized, and that comes with a certain degree of tolerance by the very nature of big cities.

You inadvertently pinpointed the core issue with the worldbuilding here: civilian applications of magic were not thought out at all. The 4 bending schools were meant to represent earth martial arts. Yeah, there aren't many useful applications for them on Earth, because they aren't magic, they're just fancy ways of waving fists and pointy sticks. But transforming them into magic gives a /ton/ of useful applications, and some of them were well defined, i.e. healing. Every kingdom's ruler and major noble would desperately want a water bender healer, and bigotry be damned. I'd say every nation would want an earth bender for an architect of their royal palace, but ironically earth's nation's architecture was the blandest of them all.

edit: martial, not martian, duh
