  People trade and people love being paid.

In cultures willing to trade, in cultures that accept money. Southern Water tribe was too small for money. Northern Water Tribe didn't trade because they were closed off, because of xenophobia, which is an accepted our-world reason not to conduct trade with other countries. Swamp benders weren't known of outside the swamps.

Which is why I went on to address the scenario of an escaped waterbender healer who does get hired. There's a trust deficit caused by cultural xenophobia and suspicion of outsiders, which would prevent use of waterbender healers by any country rich enough to hire them.

I'm not ruling out:

- a mendicant waterbender moving from town to town, healing people.
- a mendicant waterbender moving from town to town, encountering King Bumi who has stubbed his toe, healing his toe, and then moving on

What I am ruling out is:

- a mendicant waterbender moving from town to town, encountering King Bumi who has stubbed his toe, healing his toe, and then being invited to Omashu to live a life of luxury: the waterbender would sense a trap.
- a mendicant waterbender being acquired by the Dai Li for the purposes of healing the Earth King, because the waterbender would object so much that the Dai Li would be opposed to allowing this unruly outsider to enter the Earth King's presence.
- a mendicant waterbender being captured by the Fire Nation Army and being forced to heal Fire Nation soldiers: the Fire Nation Soldiers would anticipate that the Water Tribe healer would have been trained in the arts of war, and would sicken the soldiers in order to allow the Water Tribe healer's escape. Thus, the Fire Nation soldiers would not use the healer.

    And if they left without permission, doesn't it seem likely that they would be dragged back?
  #+end_quote

  No, it doesn't. At least not all of them. These women are not criminals, nobody would help the water tribe to enforce their customs. Sure, some unlucky runaways would be caught and brought back, but some won't.
#+end_quote

The waterbenders would pursue their own escapees, as waterbending healers are an important natural resource and a force multiplier that they'd want to deny to the Fire Nation or other outsiders.

  That's kinda hilarious considering that the show was about a group of runaways.

Aang is the Avatar; his spiritual mandate is to wander the world, solving problems. In the plot of the show, good people help him on his quest and bad people restrain him. As we are shown in the show, the Avatar has authority that in many cases transcends national authorities. Katara and Sokka aren't runaways; they're his escorts. Zuko is in exile.

The only member of Team Avatar that is an actual runaway is Toph, and she is tracked down and captured at least once by representatives of her parents.
