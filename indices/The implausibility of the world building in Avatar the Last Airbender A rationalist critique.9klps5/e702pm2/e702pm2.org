I think you're drastically underestimating the impact of tribalism and nationalism in primitive cultures. The vast majority of people in each nation would have a mindset of "other nations are inferior". An earthbender would think that anything a firebender could do, they could do better. You don't need to be a firebender to start a fire, or an earthbender to build a wall. Also, and in relation to your second point, benders were quite rare. There weren't enough of them to change entire industries. The defining attributes of the four nations were cultural, not what they could bend.

I don't agree with your analogy of tradesmen. Every nation needs something akin to tailors, smiths, carpenters and masons, but the usefulness of the different benders is much less well defined.
