You can't have it both ways. Either we're talking about the time before the hundred years war, which was well before the start of the industrialization of the fire nation, or after it when the political landscape is vastly different.

Benders aren't useful because they are rare. And powerful benders are even more rare. The show obviously focus' on lots of characters who are benders, but I think it's made obvious that they are a relatively tiny minority. There might be plenty of benders in the few big cities in the world, but most people are farmers in tiny villages that might have one or two benders. Aside from fighting, there's not much at all that benders can do that a handful of men can't accomplish with a days work. And there are a lot more of those groups of men than benders. It's no surprise that the economy of the world would be based on them.

That, combined with the tribalism that comes from generations of families living in one place, means people are far more likely to focus their efforts on their home village rather than traveling and seeking their fortune in the wider world.

Rationalism as a genre is usually focused on an individual or small group due to the simple fact that most people aren't rational. In fact, the average peasant is probably pretty stupid. Religion, mysticism, tribalism, heck, most war in general, isn't rational, but they are all staples of most fictional worlds histories.

You can't treat the entire world as main characters.
