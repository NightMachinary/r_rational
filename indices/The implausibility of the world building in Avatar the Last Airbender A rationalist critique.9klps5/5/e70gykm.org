  1. Bender Homogeneity of Nations
#+end_quote

People do not work like that.

Look up how many groups people lived in other nations back in 1000 AD on Earth.

How many communities of Europeans took their knowledge of steel and make a killing in sub-saharan Africa? Or how many groups of Asians made a living off their wood block printing in Europe? How many Polynesians went and showed up the Vikings on how to fish?

Nations were homogeneous before the modern world.

Spoiler Alert: /You/ likely live in a building that any person can break in to in less than 30 seconds and kill you while you sleep. The only thing keeping you alive is your society. Avatar's societies did not need protection from each other. The community itself was the protection, as it has been for the majority of human history.

Any guesses on how often the Native Americans locked their doors?
