  They have hang gliders, flying bison and airships, how expensive is transportation really?

Only airbenders can use hang gliders, and air bison are probably pretty rare. I guess that doesn't stop airbenders from selling their services (although, interestingly, we don't know for certain that they didn't before they were wiped out).

Also, airships weren't even invented until after the series had started.

  They all seem to be the same race though.

That's not really true (water tribe has darker skin) but here "racism" is more about culture, not race.
