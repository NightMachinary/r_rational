  Any of them can go into your home and loot your belongings, or kill you in the middle of the night with little or no advance warning.

This is true *right now*. The vast majority of doors are incredibly easy to lock-pick (without using superpowers). People could turn their home into Fort Knox and /really/ protect themselves, but they don't because the cost of building a safer home is greater than the risk of some nutjob breaking in. I imagine it'd be the same in the Avatar world. Building an earth/ice home is much cheaper (and easier to repair) than building it out of some other material. The risk that some bender will go crazy or go on a stealing spree is always there, but for the majority of people it isn't a big enough concern to justify the cost of building a house some other way.
