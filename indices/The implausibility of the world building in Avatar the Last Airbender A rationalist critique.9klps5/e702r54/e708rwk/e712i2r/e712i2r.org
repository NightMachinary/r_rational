  They all seem to be the same race though.

Paraphrasing [[http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Influences_on_the_Avatar_series][the Avatar Wiki]], the different Nations are based on the following cultures:

- Water Tribe: Inuit and Yupik, with aspects of Polynesian, Australian Aboriginal, Native American, and Venetian cultures and designs
- Earth Kingdom: China, with a bit of Korea on the borders
- Fire Nation: China, Japan, and Southeast Asia, set in Icelandic geography
- Air nomads: Tibet, Sri Lanka, and the Hindu portions of India

To which I ask: are the cited cultures all of the same race? What is race? Is your observation here mainly about skin color? And does a world in which spirits determine the magical powers of babies seem like a world that must follow Earth's rules for melanin distribution?
