  Maybe, but a bigger concern than (rampant) theft?

I think something you're not considering is that while wooden walls might make theft from benders more difficult, it doesn't actually stop them. An earthbender can knock down a wooden wall, and a waterbender can slice through one. If you're poor, would you prioritize defending against rare benders when that defense is more costly, not particularly effective, and destroyed if they damage it sufficiently, or would you go for walls that can be raised and repaired in seconds and do the normal job of walls as well? The comparative costs and advantages don't make sense, especially if you don't have many valuables to steal in the first place.

I think theft would also be less common, since anyone you find in their home could kill or ensnare or with barely a second's notice, including the elderly. If your grandma never leaves the house, which would be common in rural/poor societies, a thief can't risk that they're a bender.

These aren't the same concerns rich people would have, but they could also have wood or steel surrounded by walls of earth/water that can be easily rearranged and repaired.

Also, since moving earth and ice would be so trivial to anyone who can afford to hire a bender, hiding your valuable possessions in underground vaults that are difficult to find would be easy. Toph is unique in being able to sense the shape of the earth around her, even if it's a teachable skill, so hiding valuables could be done fairly simply. If a thief wanted to get at said valuables, they would need to rip up the entire floor, which could take time and create noise to alert any guards or neighbors.
