Just to do the apologetics:

For point 1, that does eventually happen in Republic City. There are a few things that make that mixing slow. (1) transportation is expensive, (2) people are really racists, (3) the dominate political paradigm is not production focused, is a blood and soil nationalism, (4) bender abilities are not just a matter of birth; you also need training and aculturation.

For point 2, that just means that construction costs are a bigger concern than assassination.

From a rational fantasy perspective the real problem with Avatar world is the thermodynamics. Where do they get all of that free work?
