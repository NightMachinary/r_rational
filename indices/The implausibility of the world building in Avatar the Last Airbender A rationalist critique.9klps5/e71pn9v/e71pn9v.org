You're right of course, but we have to try for apologia now.

Well, you can keep out non-benders, and more importantly animals and the weather (which is the original point of a wall - for most of human pre-history irl, a human made wall was an ephemeral structure and did not really keep a human out).

I think the reason this works in canon is that people don't use bending for technological progress until we get to republic city. Before that, bending is pretty much just a fighting style, and it doesn't even seem to matter /that/ much which particular fighting style you have. We don't even have confirmation that bending is used for housing construction, for all we know they're building igloos and mud huts in the non-magical way using the available material.

Also, I think it might be worth considering that terrified humans were living on the backs of lion turtles for protection until /just recently/. So arguably, the civilization of the Gaang is actually brand new.

So maybe they were all basically isolated tribes until fairly recently?

It's hard to square that with the level of technological progress in the Fire and Earth nations, though.

Another potential point is that bending might be /very rare/ for non air nomads (how much of that is because non, and only appear infrequently and randomly in people who live in a climate that predisposes for it...and we just think their are a lot of benders because the dramatic story arcs follow benders. Wasn't Katara the /only/ water bender in her tribe? And Sokka seemed to think bending was pretty mysterious, not an integral part of society.

(Yes yes they killed off all the old water benders, but consider that Katara is one of many children in that tribe)
