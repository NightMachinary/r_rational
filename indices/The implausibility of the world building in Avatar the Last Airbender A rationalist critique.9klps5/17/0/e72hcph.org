  [deleted complaint about overanalyzing a children's story, what was I thinking?]
#+end_quote

I was gonna say something like this too, but I also decided against it because it's [[/r/rational][r/rational]] after all. But what the hell, I'll say it anyway.

I don't think posting a critique of the worldbuilding on a children's show is super interesting. Frankly, it's just not surprising or interesting if a children's show has holes. (Actually, the other reason I almost didn't say anything is that Avatar /does/ have much better worldbuilding than most, so in this particular case, it is much more worth discussing these things than, say, /Steven Universe/, which is a great show but you can drive trucks through the holes in its worldbuilding, which makes it hardly worth discussing unless you're actually proposing major fixes.) At any rate, I think it could be worthwhile to make an Avatar rational fic exploring the economics of house building or cultural diffusion in Avatar-land -- but just posting a list of things wrong in the avatar world and then denouncing the worldbuilding as "implausible" just has me rolling my eyes, especially because those things are more complicated than the OP makes them out to be, as demonstrated by the ample discussion on the thread. ((1) is mostly explained by nationalism and the fact that it's war-time while (2) is mostly explained by the fact that actually, plenty of houses in the world /are/ just made of wood anyway.)
