Is there a defined "room temperature"? Local average right now? Over some period of time? Is the sampled range the same as the area of effect? If someone starts lights some thermite inside that range, can the whole area be burned? If there's a tank of liquid nitrogen, can the whole area be frozen solid?

Moving a person's whole body to room temperature would probably kill the person, and I don't think there'd be any sign of death.
