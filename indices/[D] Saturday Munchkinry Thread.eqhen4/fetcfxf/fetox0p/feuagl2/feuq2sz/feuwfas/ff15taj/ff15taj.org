Generate energy by providing heat energy to reactants in an endothermic reaction, storing the energy as chemical potential energy and removing it from the zone. This can be used to directly produce fuel.

Alternatively, activate power in a container of cool gas; use the expanding gas to drive a piston, then deactivate the power to allow the heat energy to disperse and piston to retract.

This is assuming 1) you can't just blow cool air through the zone and have it come out the other end warm, i.e. the heat energy itself is restricted somehow, 2) this power pulls energy from somewhere normally inaccessible.

Also calculate things by heating specific monitored fluids in massive fluid container arrays as extremely rapid input, or heating specific places as instructed by a computer in a carefully monitored fluid container, for a computer based on calculating/ observing fluid dynamics.
