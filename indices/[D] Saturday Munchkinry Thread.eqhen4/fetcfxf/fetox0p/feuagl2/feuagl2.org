Pretty handy in Antarctica or Death Valley, though obviously there are relatively simple workarounds both cases (like wearing appropriate clothing).

Using this ability on ice could be interesting. You could de-ice an airplanes' control surfaces, engines and sensors. You could tunnel through an ice shelf if you had a pump to get rid of the water. You could clear snow and ice off of your car with remarkable ease.

This ability could be handy when using a paintball gun or other compressed air gun. Normally, the temperature of the compressed gas drops with decreases in pressure, and lowered temperature adds to your loss of pressure. As such, rapid fire with a paintball gun will result in more rapid decrease in muzzle velocity than you'd get with slow, intermittent firing. Using this ability, you could disregard that problem and fire as fast as you like.

This is extremely handy if you'd like to be able to perform maintenance on the furnace of a coal power plant without interrupting operation, though in most cases you could simply shut down temporarily during off hours while other plants or generators pick up the slack.

Incredibly handy for a firefighter. It's no guarantee against building collapse, and you'd still need a reliable oxygen source, but basically you could shut down the fires everywhere you go by bringing the fuel and air to sub-combustion temperatures and then dousing everything in water to keep it from re-igniting.

Grants immunity to lasers and flamethrowers, so could have some significant combat applications. There's certainly things that can be done to reduce susceptibility to lasers and flamethrowers, but this is definitely beyond any kind of defense that other approaches could offer.

On that note... this stops combustion engines. You could use it to stop a car. If it has significant range, it could be used to shut down engines on an aircraft.

This ability could also disable guns. You won't stop the percussion cap from going off, so there might be a click/pop sound, but the powder could be prevented from igniting.

Oh, uh, one other thing: This ability can literally kill people. Instantly drop their body temperature to room temperature and they'll die of hypothermia.
