It's basically a cooling power, since heating things is to room temperature is easy. Does it matter what's in the effect area? It's more effective if they can aim it at a thermal conductor, like a chunk of a copper heat sink.

Room temperature is ideal for computing, but data centers already achieve this (at great expense, but they get there). On the other hand, the efficiency of a thermal engine is limited by the ratio between its cold end and hot end, and in power generation the cold end tends to still be hundreds of degrees. Cooling some strategically placed lump of copper in a power plant would probably be the best use of the power.
