Extremely useful for power generation. Power plants rely on the difference between a hot and cold area to generate power from a fuel source. If you can force a location to maintain a constant temperature, the power plant doesn't need to radiate the heat into the environment, and the amount of power generated goes up as well since the heat sink temperature would normally be above room temperature.

Alternatively, very useful on the ISS, because dissipating heat is a non-trivial problem. Removing the need for a lot of the cooling would mean that it doesn't need to be resupplied with the ammonia coolant that's used to dissipate heat.

Data centers spend a lot of money on cooling their servers. If the air could be circulated through the area you're keeping at a constant temperature, you could save a ton of money on electricity.
