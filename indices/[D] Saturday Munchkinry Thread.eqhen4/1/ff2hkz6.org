You could probably do some impossible things with chemistry.

What if you took a lump of molten metal and forced it to be room temperature? It wouldn't cool as its molecules bumped into air molecules and transferred their momentum - its molecules would just...slow down. All of them at once, The metal would pass from above to below its melting point in 0 time.

I'm not sure what you'd get if you did that? Maybe an amorphous solid with no crystalline structure? Or would the metal dissociate into dust?

What about boundary effects? If every molecule in the effected area is arbitrarily slowed down or sped up to the same speed, molecules that straddle the boundary will...be torqued? I don't know whether torque makes any sense in chemistry. Maybe molecules on the boundary get ripped apart, so there's this fizz of re-combining ions whenever you use your power, stronger or weaker depending on the difference between real temperature and fiat temperate. That's kind of cool, and maybe it gives you a place to dump all that entropy.
