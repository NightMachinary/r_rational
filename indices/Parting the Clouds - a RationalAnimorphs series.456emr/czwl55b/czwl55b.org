So having read through until the "next chapter" button stopped working, I /very nearly/ stopped after 'part 1' thinking that was the end, and that the other parts in the list had been direct links to the chapters I'd already read.

Having realised that it doesn't end on an abrupt cliffhanger at that point, /I have some reading to do/.
