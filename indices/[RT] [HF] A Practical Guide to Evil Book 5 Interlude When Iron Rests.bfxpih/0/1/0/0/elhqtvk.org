1. When we compare the respective size, I'm not sure that Theodosius is the USA and Procer the Vietnam... It's more like Alexander the Great vs Persia where Persia would have tried an attrition strategy.
2. Losing the war is different from losing the battle, especially "horribly". Theodosius lost the war because he couldn't continue it. It doesn't mean he lost somewhere specifically. That's the whole point of " /A hundred battles, even victories, will always lose you the war." + "/ /the First Prince asked of her when she expected the war to be brought to a successful conclusion. ‘It should take,' she famously replied, ‘about a hundred battles.'”/ The Maddened Fields weren't a military defeat for him, despite Isabella saying so.
