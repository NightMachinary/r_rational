  eventually goading Theodosius into believing his own myth and committing to a battle with terrible odds in his favor that he loses horribly and ends him.

I will have to quote someone about it:

#+begin_quote
  “Isabella the Mad's book?” she asked, voice rough.

  “She was the only one to ever defeat Theodosius on the field,” the diplomat said.

  “That's, uh, a very generous assessment of the Maddened Fields,” General Basilia said, and tried to pass her convulsive laughter for a cough.

For reminder, Helike has 40K soldiers. We don't really know how much the population grows over time, so let's say Theodosius had the same.

​

For the Maddened Fields killing over 100K soldiers with Helike still being able to "retreat in good order" means that Theodosius never, ever "lost horribly". He just said "she is too crazy, i'm fucking out of there" and went back. He lost politically (he couldn't annex the territory), but from a military perspective, it was an overwhelming victory.
