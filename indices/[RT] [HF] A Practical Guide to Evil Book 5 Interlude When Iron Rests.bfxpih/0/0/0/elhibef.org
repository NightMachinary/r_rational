It was way more than 4 proceran soldier for one soldier than Helike. He """"lost""" the maddened field with over 100K overall casulties, and since it was impossible to lose 20K soldiers (it's a route, you can't retreat in good order in such a case), it means that the death ratio is more likely 1-6 or even higher. And it was only one battle. The attrition battle before may have been even worst for Procer.
