You are assuming everything went hunky dory after the Maddened Field. Procer was a wreck already with multiple princedoms already eviscerated and now even more dead. 100k dead on that one battlfield with months of fighting in the southern provinces before hand to get Theodosius to that point under Isabella's control. Add on a few months more of him slapping the princes around and you have one pretty terrible war.

Procer probably devolved into open warfare for a time.
