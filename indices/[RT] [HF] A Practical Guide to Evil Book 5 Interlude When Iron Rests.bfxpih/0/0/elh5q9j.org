I think the implication is just that Isabella knew she outnumbered Theodosius and so committed to a strategy of attrition where she gave up 2-4 soldiers for every one that Theodosius gave up, and so was able to beat him even though he had the weight of his Name and narrative behind him.

The problem is that she was so focused on beating the enemy in front of her, she didn't consider that sapping her country's military might made her vulnerable to other players on the stage, and then Callow came in and walloped the weakened Procer.

I'm not sure the timeline makes a ton of sense for that - 20 years /should/ be enough for a nation to recover its military manpower, unless the war against Theodosius really, really, critically drained Procer of its supply of able bodied adult men.

I think she's simply saying that Callow and Procer should work together to thump Kairos rather than fight it out amongst each other and then let Kairos mop up what's left, but Kairos' comments about the metaphysical implications of Masego creating a new, unclaimed domain adjacent to Creation suggest there are broader implications.
