I think "other friend of mine that will get his due" refers to Keter's Due, where sorcery can't be perfectly efficient. Hierophant is working an incredibly large sorcery in the ruins of Liesse he pulled to Arcadia. It's possible the destructive excess that is Keter's Due will only be released when that chunk of Arcadia reaches Creation, unless Cat and Tyrant win and can turn their attention to Arcadia to stop it.
