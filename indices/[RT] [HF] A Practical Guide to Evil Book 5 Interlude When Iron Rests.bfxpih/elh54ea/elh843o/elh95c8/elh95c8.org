  Also, Cat assigned Hierophant to work with the Daoine in order to undo whatever Diabolist did to them, so he's got prior expertise with it. Add to that his interest in Ascension, the, it's obvious what he's doing with the ruins of Liesse in Arcadia--he's forging, or reusing, the souls that Diabolist sacrificed into a gestalt in order to ascend.

Not sure if you're correct. The souls are the "blotting out the sky" kind of visible, and Akua needed over a dozen captives from the Watch to summon them - a liability that Hierophant has personally shored up. You're right in the sense that the shape is there: if Cat had actually become the Black Queen, she wouldn't go to the Everdark - she would exalt the souls of her ancestors.

That said, the princes are definitely about to run into the Hierarch: they have all the cavalry and the Tyrant only has his personal guards and a bunch of gargoyles to hold them back. They are about to turn into a mob, and the only hope is that Cat will manage to spare Rosala by ratting out Kairos' collusions with all those foreign tyrants and having Anaxares execute him instead.
