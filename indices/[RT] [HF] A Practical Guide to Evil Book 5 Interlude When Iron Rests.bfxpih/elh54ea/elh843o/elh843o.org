  “Here's a secret for you, Adjutant,” the Tyrant of Helike whispered, leaning closer. “The thing that waits for you in the depths of Liesse stolen isn't just your friend. I would be a great deal more wary of what it intends, were I you. For if this night does not go to the Black Queen or to myself, well, it is another friend of mine that will get his due.”

So do you think the Hierarch has some sort of necromantic powers that will let him raise the souls of those sacrificed by Diabolist at Liesse in order for them to hold a tribunal and pass judgement on /everyone/?

Oh, that reminds me: Diabolist was experimenting on the Watch and the Fae way back when, and they learned that the Watch gets their powers from a gestalt comprised of all their ancestor's souls, an entity that Hierophant called a god. Also, Cat assigned Hierophant to work with the Daoine in order to undo whatever Diabolist did to them, so he's got prior expertise with it. Add to that his interest in Ascension, the, it's obvious what he's doing with the ruins of Liesse in Arcadia--he's forging, or reusing, the souls that Diabolist sacrificed into a gestalt in order to ascend.
