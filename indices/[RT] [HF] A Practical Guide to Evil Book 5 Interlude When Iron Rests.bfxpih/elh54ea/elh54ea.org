Jehan the Wise, who +hung+ hanged seven Princes and one, was a Callowan King. Cat's letter has a jump in causality that the average person probably couldn't put together, but that suggests that there's an underlying Story that Catherine is hinting at, but I'm not sure what:

Theodosius, first Tyrant of the League, invades Procer and wins victory after victory. Isabella the Mad leads Proceran troops and fights numerous losing battles of attrition to weaken the Tyrant, eventually goading Theodosius into believing his own myth and committing to a battle with terrible odds in his favor that he loses horribly and ends him. Then, twenty years later, a Callowan King invades Procer and hangs seven Princes and one.

What does the latter have to do with the former? Is it a backlash for Isabella's strategy of giving us land and battles to Theodosius to weaken him? Isabella essentially sacrificed all those lives and those of the commoners in the name of strategy, and Jehan the Wise, the Good King, eventually came along to exact retribution against the Princes who did not defend their people.

It's obvious that Cat is drawing a parallel between herself and Theodosius, saying that she'll only weaken herself the more she wins and that there's a real danger of her buying into her own mythos and pushing herself too far. Hence the surrender, wherein she's sidestepping Theodosius's blunder. Does that make Pilgrim the equivalent of Isabella the Mad, then? He said last chapter that he was purposefully sending in his soldiers to die in order to increase the Narrative weight behind his miracle--that same sort of sacrificial pragmatism that Isabella used. So does Cat then expect a third party, namely Kairos, to come in and balance the scales for her; I mean, Kairos literally just found a bunch of Proceran Princes this chapter.
