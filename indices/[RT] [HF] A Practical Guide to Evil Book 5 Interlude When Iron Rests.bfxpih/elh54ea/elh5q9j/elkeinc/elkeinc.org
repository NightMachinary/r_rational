It's two separate narratives she's referencing. First, it's exactly what you've mentioned - avoiding a war of attrition when another enemy (the dead king) is on the horizon, with the implication that the Legion and the Crusade are playing the parts of the participants in the Maddened Field. But it's important to note that the victor which came later is Callowan, who came and sacked a weakened Procer. It's not just a caution against exhausting the troops and losing men in a fight which will have more long-term negative consequences, it's a message that Cat expects the Tyrant to attack the Procerans and for her to be able to ride in later for an ultimate victory.
