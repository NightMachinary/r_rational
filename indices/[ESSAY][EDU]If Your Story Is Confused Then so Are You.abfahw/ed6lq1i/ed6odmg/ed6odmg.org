Internally consistent with all of the observed facts about canon, at the expense of suspense of disbelief. I wanted to imply that there's a difference between using the observations you already have versus modifying the story. Playing around with Dumbledore as an antagonist is interesting, but going into conspiracy theorist mode about whatever reason he left Harry at the Dursleys is going to result in more questions, because that particular decision is inconsistent with the rest of his character. Once you "solve" that one question, you're forced to reinterpret the entire story in light of it, which opens up more questions. Maybe the process of answers creating more questions stops somewhere, and you've successfully explained canon Dumbledore's actions, maybe it doesn't. What matters is that the moment you reimagine Dumbledore's role for the sake of explaining his canon /actions/, you've sacrificed his canon /character/, and the character of whoever else was swept up in his conspiracy. Sacrificing canon accuracy for canon accuracy is kind of a raw deal when it comes at the expense of your impression of a kindly authority figure.

And all of that's only if you somehow manage to find an explanation for all of his canon actions from the perspective of a level one intelligent character. This perspective must not make Dumbledore do things that he didn't do in canon, because then we run into the obstacle of sacrificing canon accuracy for canon accuracy again. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Rowling's work, but I'd be putting it lightly if I said I was /extremely skeptical/ that her work had some internally consistent explanation like that.

If reinterpreting canon like that was the only way to write a villain Dumbledore, I would be more understanding. [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanfic][But it's not]]. Literally the only reason you would ever end up with a Dumbledore like this is if you tried to meet the /artificial constraint/ of not changing all of the canon events. My alternative suggestion was, instead of looking to canon for answers that might not lead anywhere, to use your internal creativity to come up with something that actually makes the story make more sense instead of less. Especially because actual authors in the wild use that constraint of canon events to justify bashing Dumbledore when they simultaneously modify other parts of canon to their own preference.
