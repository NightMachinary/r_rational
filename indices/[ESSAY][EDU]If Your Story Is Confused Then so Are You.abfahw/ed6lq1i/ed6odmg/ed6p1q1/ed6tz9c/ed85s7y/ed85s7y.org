The way I would put it is that an evil Dumbledore is actually a great change from the Dumbledore depicted in HP canon, and if you want to write that changed Dumbledore, it should have many consequences everywhere including that Dumbledore does not do many of his canon actions. To defend this by pointing out that somebody in the special genre of children's book did something that looks evil in an adult book is unfaithful to the story logic of canon Dumbledore and results in a grotesquely inconsistent world. Canon Dumbledore is not a consistent evil character. If you want consistency his actions cannot be the exact canon actions, period, and why are you trying for exact repetition in a fanfic anyways? You can try to rationalize the exact canon actions by changing other facts and characters, but then that becomes the whole story, and that's very rarely worth it.
