Thanks for reading! If you're wondering: I'm not actually a new poster appearing from thin air. I've been here for a while, but I've recently decided to rebrand under my actual name. If the mods are interested in knowing who I /was/ they can send me a PM, but I'd like that information to remain private for now.

+I'll have a video up tomorrow narrating the essay, if you don't feel like reading it conventionally. I can't promise it will be good, though. The next time I make an ominous Twitter commitment about uploading a video, I'll try to remember that I actually don't know how to edit.+

I'm going to retract that statement, because not only do I not know how to edit, I also don't know how to narrate. I now appreciate the various video essayists that crank out those things like I crank out actual essays, because I never knew it was possible to make that many recording errors in five minutes.
