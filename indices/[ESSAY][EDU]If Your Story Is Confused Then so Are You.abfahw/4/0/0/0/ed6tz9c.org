I'm more saying that it's extremely improbable to do it in any way but poorly. I'm warning against doing it because the only stories I've ever seen of someone doing it that way are bad. Additionally, I'm providing an explanation as to why I think that they failed. I think "fair play" was a bad phrase to use, but that's what it feels like - people who do this pretend they're competing on an even level with other fanfic authors because they've solved /one inconsistency/ in the canon, but most of the time they're running on imaginary realism. That, by revealing the /true/ motivations of one character, they've suddenly made the story more realistic. Even a cursory examination will show that most of them haven't changed or challenged any of the /other/ things that make no sense, or that they've replaced them with even less sensible versions.

The reasons they fail are usually simple:

1. They're exercising a grudge where none should exist ([[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/empathyrespect][a good author should have some empathy for their villains]]). This is usually because /they/ at one point believed Dumbledore was good, and the idea that he was bad is a betrayal. This can make them write him less intelligently than they ought to.
2. They waste all of their mental resources trying to cover up one plothole, and fail to cover up others. The singular plot hole in question is only one of many, but because of the manipulative!Dumbledore meme, it's the only one that a lot of authors think they need to solve.
3. Having actually set up a Dumbledore that is evil, they fail to capitalize on it because they're too busy religiously following the other plot points. I mentioned this in another comment chain, but it's hard to have Dumbledore be a proper antagonist when he still has to act the same way canon Dumbledore did on the surface. Any overtly antagonistic action on Dumbledore's part also has to simultaneously come with an explanation of why canon Harry (inquisitive, quick to mistrust abusive authority) never observed it, otherwise, their version of Dumbledore loses all pretense of being close to the canon.
4. Even as an antagonist, Dumbledore has to compete with Wizard Hitler. Those are some pretty high stakes to run up against. If Harry ends up calling Dumbledore out on sacrificing people for the greater good, it would be pretty strange if Dumbledore didn't have a good argument backing himself up. But in these stories, Dumbledore usually doesn't justify himself well at all - he still engages with Harry on the level of the eleven-year-old he was in canon, even when Harry is engaging with him on the level of a skeptical, angry adult. It usually feels like the author is deliberately sabotaging Dumbledore's chances at being justified, rather than actually testing their own beliefs. Again, this is [[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/77][yet another problem that HPMOR solved]] simply by departing from canon for a little bit. (CTRL-F for "phoenix's price" to find what I'm talking about).

That's what I mean. Like I've said before, evil!Dumbledore isn't something that's inherently wrong. But exploring that concept by twisting canon around in such a way that it appears /canon/ Dumbledore is evil, is nonsensical. It's trying to be faithful to canon by disregarding what canon meant emotionally, and if you're just going to disregard canon as a fanfiction author anyway, why would you disregard it in such a way as to preserve /only the parts of canon that make a certain character look bad?/ It's sloppy.
