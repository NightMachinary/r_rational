Okay. It kind of sounds like you just don't like some fanfics where Dumbledore is portrayed badly.

This doesn't really say anything about rational fic in general, or even the idea of criticizing Dumbledore or portraying him as simply manipulative, utilitarian, or careless. I guess I get how seeing this done poorly could be a pet peeve though.
