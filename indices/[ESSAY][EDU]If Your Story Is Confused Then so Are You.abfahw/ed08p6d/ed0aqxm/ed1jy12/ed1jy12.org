Wow. I'm not sure what happened there. I have no memory of typing that comment. I think I was trying to say something about plastic water bottles and plastic drinking straws and plastic individually-wrapped candy bars, but looking at it now I don't see how that follows as a response to your comment about inhumane products, because they're /not/ inhumane, they're just technically immoral.

I may have brought up the egg cooker in reaction to

#+begin_quote
  an induction cooktop where putting a largish pan on the element activates the power switch and turns it off (or on) unintentionally
#+end_quote

because it works by converting water to steam and it shuts itself off once all the water has boiled away.

Either way, I apologize. I'm too good at typing (I'm not claiming to be the best at typing, or even in the top 80%) (the previous parenthetical exists because the "Elizabeth" pseudonym is arrogant on purpose a lot of the time, and I'm not speaking as Elizabeth and I don't want my words to be misinterpreted, I'm not boasting about my typing skills) so my fingers are capable of doing it just based off muscle memory so my brain can be almost entirely nonfunctional and I can still type (for the most part).

Oh, and as far as claiming it would be "uneducated" to drink the tap water, I'm currently living at my grandmother's house and she has a well and the well has been tested and there's lead in the water.
