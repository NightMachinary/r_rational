We're going in circles. I said if you want to stay with canon events and canon chatacterizations you need to write a crack fic, because that IS the tone that you ascribe to HP.

Which is not disagreeing with you, other than you seem to be reluctant to characterize HP as a crack fic.

Edit:

I could call some of Dumbledore's actions evil. That's not calling Dumbledore evil.

  I'm presenting this as a binary because people seem to think

I'm not "people". I've already stated flat out that I'm not defending whatever story it was that "people" wrote that make Dumbledore binary-evil. All I'm saying is that this, among many other things, make it hard if not impossible to write HP fanfic without either writing an AU or a crackfic. Because the HP universe is cracked.
