  People are complex, there can be reasons other than "Dumbledore actually intends for Harry to suffer" for him to do evil things, but what he did was evil.

My logic here is more along the lines of: if you rely on canon to inform your setting but not your tone, you create villains like Dumbledore that don't make any sense. So, it's less that the /specific/ evil Dumbledore I gave is inadequate, and more that the set of evil Dumbledores that don't significantly diverge from other parts of canon are inadequate. And that's the point I was trying to make.

Any analysis of Dumbledore as evil based solely on that single plot element needs to /also/ explain away the many plot points that indicate his character is good. Like the fact that he's generally well-respected within the school, kindly, and that the only morally ambiguous thing he's done in recent memory is leaving Harry at the Dursleys. You could write a Dumbledore where those actions were all subtle manipulations and that he's actually working on his ambition, but Occam's Razor says to cut the cruft - the simpler explanation is to read the tone of the story, which tells you that the /one/ morally ambiguous event that takes place within the scope of Harry Potter is non-central to how Rowling defined his character.

If that was too complicated, here's the same thing a bit simpler:

1. Dumbledore has done one thing (within the scope of Harry Potter) that's unilaterally bad.
2. Rowling defined his character based on elements other than that one. This isn't a deduction from things she's said, it's a deduction from the attitude of the text itself.
3. As a reader, you have a choice. You could call Dumbledore evil and ignore the plot elements that show he's good. Or you could call Dumbledore good and ignore the plot elements that show he's evil. I'm presenting this as a binary because people seem to think the weight of his bad actions nullifies his good ones anyway. /Ordinarily/ this choice would be evenly weighted, or you would accept some more moderate explanation in the middle, but...
4. The evidence presented in point 2 exists, within the text. The story itself ignores the fact that he left Harry at the Dursleys when defining his character. Now, instead of it being a choice between ignoring his good actions and ignoring his bad actions, it's the difference between ignoring his good actions /and his characterization/ and ignoring his bad actions. Maybe you have a mix of both. But I don't think that when you weigh those together, Dumbledore comes out of the equation as /evil/.

To anticipate the obvious objection: no, I'm not saying /literally ignore/ the fact that Harry was left at the Dursleys. What I'm saying is that when it comes down to it, the choice that preserves canon the most is the choice that paints Dumbledore in a light that makes sense in the context of the story's attitude toward him. The first few books are /children's stories/, not game-of-thrones style dramas. Analyzing their characters and motivations from a literal-minded perspective is going to return something unrecognizeable, because the truth is that those books are /not rigorously plotted enough to be held to those standards/.
