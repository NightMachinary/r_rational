To be honest I couldn't read the canon Harry Potter without feeling /all the time/ that Wizarding Britain is a deeply sick society. Dumbledore's neglect of Harry is part and parcel of that. Dumbledore may believe himself a good guy... nobody is a villain in their own mind... but his actual actions were evil.
