I can't even figure out what you guys are disagreeing about and I read a ton of this stuff. XD

you both seem to think that Dumbledore's behavior re: the Dursleys was immoral and that there's no real resolution to this contradiction in the canon.

And you seem to agree that tropes and inconsistencies in fiction are bad.

So...what's the problem?
