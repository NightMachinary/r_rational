  I don't know if you've been spoiled by [[/r/rational]] or what, but ordinary stories do this shit all the time.

I've been spoiled by reading fantasy and science fiction for 50+ years, and being increasingly tired of stories that do this all the time. Luckily there's lots of F&SF that doesn't do it.

  They make jokes that have terrible implications and then expect you to take those implications seriously only sometimes.

Humor that breaks the set and setting is lazy, slapstick, and really only works in stuff like Monty Python or Blazing Saddles.

It's perfectly possible to be funny without being crack. You can write stories that are set /in the real world/ that are funny, with no magic at all, or super-science.

Some of them are bad and have unbelievable characters and situations, like your typical romcoms, but others manage without any cracky stuff at all.

  Harry Potter is still 80% serious.

So, you're saying that only 20% of Harry Potter is crack?

That's an awful lot of crack.

  Do you know how many thousands of entries are on the TvTropes page for fridge horror?

If it's really fridge horror, it's something you notice later on when you think about it. If it slaps you in the face with it, it's not really "fridge" horror. It's just horror. That's what you get in HP.
