A story is made of more than its plot. Tone is communicated through the aggregate connotation of all of the words related to a specific context, and most readers are sensitive to it. Writing a story where the fridge horror pokes through the cracks is tonally different from a story that plays the story elements the same way Rowling does. So, in the same way that there is a canon /plot/, there is also a canon /attitude/.

Sticking to the canon attitude is boring the same way sticking to the canon plot is boring. But disregarding its existence has a chance to lead to bad writing.

Consider bashing. The reason Ron Weasley isn't a compelling villain in the stories that vilify him is because his attitudinal position in the story meant that his plot position wasn't suitable for a villain - in canon, Ron is a poor underdog without any money or talent. It's often even worse than that, the way fanfiction authors do it, where he lacks even the support of his family. Whatever happened to "If you give Frodo a lightsaber you must give Sauron the Death Star."? If Ron is your villain then they're doing a very bad job of making him compellingly antagonizing.

You can apply the same logic to Dumbledore. Sure, the fridge horror of being left at the Dursleys can be extrapolated from canon. But if you're taking /that/ from canon, surely you have to take into account the fact that Dumbledore intervenes basically zero times in Harry's life until the end of book five. He likes to keep Harry abused, but also only hires /one/ abusive professor? And he lets Harry sleep in an actual common room with actual friends? If he's a villain, he's not a very good one.

The problem isn't that the people who write these stories have diverged from the tonal meaning of canon. The problem is that they've disregarded that tone, and then written a story extrapolating from the worst examples of behavior for each of the selected characters. And often the way these characters are selected is arbitrary - Draco Malfoy's personality will be rebuilt around his best moments. On occasion, so will Snape's.
