While that's a great Doylist explanation of why Wizarding Britain is deeply sick, it doesn't make it not actually deeply sick.

Basically, HP is a crackfic.

So, unless you're writing an equally crack fanfic about it, or you're writing a fixfic AU, you're going to run smack dab into this in-your-face Fridge Horror. Treating Dumbledore's fuckups seriously isn't AU, it's quite the opposite. You can make him (possibly accidentally) evil, incompetent, or overworked to the point he's dropping plates in public. But Rowling's presentation of him as a benevolent genius just doesn't fly in a "straight" fanfic.
