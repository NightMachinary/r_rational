I think that fan-fic authors going full on conspiracy theory on things like Dumbledore and other elements of canon can still be fine, as long as they accept that their story is now an AU, and so decide to focus on world-building instead of character bashing. After all, the whole point of fan-fiction is changing canon in some minute (or major) ways, and then seeing how the story flows from their.

Take HPMOR for example - many of the people I've seen hating on the story online abandoned it because they felt like it was character bashing; like some characters, specifically Dumbledore, had been changed simply to make rational!Harry look better. And yet the story is amazing, because even though there is a conspiracy theory at work behind the scenes, the author commits to it; he writes the story in such a way that it can be believed that the character of Dumbledore, as he is portrayed, would act like he does. In sum, the author created a slightly different version of Dumbledore, and then (not really, but practically) built a world around him that explained the character, instead of just using him as bash fodder. The same can be said of HPMOR Voldemort, when you actually look at his backstory - the author had a vision of who he wanted Voldemort to be, and instead of just changing the character for no reason, he changed Voldemort's backstory in ways that more than justified the change. He made, in a way, the conspiracy theory rational. Voldemort and Dumbledore had to be different, and so the entire Wizarding World was changed around them accommodate this, providing the reader with not only interesting new characters, but also an interesting 'new' setting to explore and theorize about.

A story that I think had the potential to do this, but didn't quite get it right, was a Well Groomed Mind. I have a soft spot for any fic that actually explores what the consequences of mind magic, as it's shown in the Wizarding World, could be. And it starts off pretty strong; it asks the question "how did Harry grow up, essentially, an abused little boy, and then go to Hogwarts only to quickly lose all the traits that usually characterize abuse and become a textbook hero instead?" And then thinks a bit, and then provides an answer that seems vaguely possibly in canon, and interesting "Dumbledore is using mind magic".

And then it goes nowhere with that idea. Good world-building in fanfics, in my opinion, should be based around the most important changes the fic has made to canon. A Well Groomed Mind makes a very important change (Dumbledore is now an evil mental manipulator who tried to inflict personality death on Harry), and then spends most of its first few chapters on world-building that doesn't justify the change. Dumbledore being evil now is just taken as a fact, and while the fic does spend a lot of time fleshing out a system of mind magic I vaguely remember as being much more detailed than canon, is doesn't spend half as much time justifying the change. I got pretty far in the fic, and in all my reading it didn't give a reason for why Dumbledore became the way he is, or how the Wizarding World that could produce this Dumbledore was different in new, and interesting ways. The Headmaster of Hogwarts was using mind magic to control his students, and yet the rest of Wizarding Britain, where the majority of the story takes place, was basically the same. Instead most of the world-building time was spent explaining how the rest of the magical world was different, and Britain was weird, which is good and all; only the story takes place in Britain, and so that came off as a lot of telling and very little showing.

TLDR: Basically, I think reinterpreting certain key elements in canon, and engaging in some 'conspiracy think' can lead to some very interesting fics, and can be rational, if the author uses that reinterpretation as a springboard for world-building, rather than character bashing.
