I don't remember if I let that caveat in, but I think I did mention that /intentional/ paranoia can work in the author's favor. One of my favorite examples of this is /Steins;Gate/, where the main character's delusions are all part of an elaborate inside joke with his friends. But almost seamlessly, those delusions are brought into reality. The emotional crux of the show is the contrast between how he deals with his fantasy versus reality, and how he resolves that inconsistency by staying true to himself.

I'd contest that HPMOR has /Dumbledore/ bashing, though. He kind of does becomes the resolution to the entire plot in an epic chain of prophesized events leading to his own demise. Harry and Dumbledore have their disagreements, but throughout all of them, there's this persistent feeling that Harry is /missing/ the final clue to Dumbledore's behavior. And, for what it's worth, Dumbledore is never overtly mean. The closest thing to bashing I can recall is Harry resolving Snape's bullying with blackmail. I'm /pretty sure/ this had some kind of elaborate purpose, like convincing Harry that Dumbledore thinks entirely in narrativism or something, but I can't really identify what off the top of my head.
