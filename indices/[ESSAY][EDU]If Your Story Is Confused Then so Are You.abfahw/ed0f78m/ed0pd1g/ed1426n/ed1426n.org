oh yeah I'm not saying that I agree with the idea that HPMOR has Dumbledore bashing, just that when I see people on the internet argue about whether its a good fic or not, I often see HPMOR haters saying that it bashes Dumbledore and other authority figures. Anyways, I don't quite think Steins Gate is the best example of what I'm trying to say, as it is something that only really works in the context of fanfiction. Essentially, while I agree with all of your points, I do think that 'reinterpreting' parts of a canon work in weird, conspiracy-esque ways can turn out rational, if that conspiracy is then actually included into the world-building, and not just used to kickstart the plot.

Like how in HPMOR, Dumbledore's weird behavior wasn't just something the author threw in for no reason; it was actually a major part of the plot, and was brought on and justified by major changes to the world around him, making it feel less like it was the author just changing Dumbledore for no reason, and more like the author was writing the true, canon version of Dumbledore, if Dumbledore had been raised in the strange new world the author had created, instead of the canon Wizarding World.

That one, key difference, I think, is where most people draw the line between a character being a thinly veiled OC, and a character actually being themselves; if the world around them justifies their changed personality. And I think the same thing can be applied to conspiracy reinterpretations; they can be rational, if the world around them justifies their existence. A rational fic author totally could write Dumbledore as a manipulative dude who left Harry with the Dursleys just to make him impressionable and desperate for attention, like a lot of fanfic authors do; they're just going to have to do a lot of work explaining what changed in the Wizarding World to turn Dumbledore, of all people, into the kind of guy who would do that (and that's the step most fanfic authors skip; the actual, difficult world building).
