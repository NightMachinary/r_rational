I think that "deeply sick" would be a good way to describe wizarding society if it wasn't a clear satirization of real life. To be perfectly clear, the following were all exaggerated in the story for the sake of humor:

- The entire Ministry, including Fudge.
- The Ministry's intervention in Hogwarts in year 5.
- The Dursley's behavior and obsession with "normality".
- Malfoy (minor) and his relationship to Malfoy (greater).
- The house-elves and later Lockhart in year 2.
- Love potions and the other date-rapey stuff in year 6.
- Ron and Hermione's pig-headedness in year 4 (and basically all of the awkward puberty stuff in that year).
- Even more stuff I can't keep track of.

Just about the only thing that wasn't played for comedy was Voldemort himself. I understand that these things are /sometimes/ used as actual sources of drama, or that the humor in these things is expressed in British and therefore unintelligible to an American audience, but treating them as serious is seriously tone-deaf.

The Dursleys exist because Rowling thought they were funny and because a rags-to-riches story is more fun than a riches-to-riches story. Any theory that calls Dumbledore evil because of that is invalid. Dumbledore bringing Harry into the fold to fight Voldemort isn't evil because Harry wants to help out of the goodness of his heart. Any theory that calls Dumbledore evil because of that has to /first/ prove that Harry was somehow coerced into fighting by Dumbledore. The same cannot be said for the opposite - keeping Harry out of the loop for so long because of his lack of occlumency was a smart decision, but not a nice one. This is what makes him a morally conflicted protagonist (aside from his history with Grindelwald and his sister).

Don't get me wrong. The resulting story from this half-parody half-serious format is hardly rational. It relies on comedic convenience for one half and then regular old narrative convenience for the other. But in the end, people liked it. If that means we have to go through an extra amount of effort to read the story as it was intended, then so be it.
