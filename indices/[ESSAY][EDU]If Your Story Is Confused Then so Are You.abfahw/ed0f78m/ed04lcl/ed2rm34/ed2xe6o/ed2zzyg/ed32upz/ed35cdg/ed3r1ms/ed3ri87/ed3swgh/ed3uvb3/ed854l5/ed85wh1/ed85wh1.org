OK, point, but does it matter for the fanfic writer?

I'm having trouble coming up with an HP fanfic that actually tries to fit in that genre, certainly can't think of one that succeeds. Adult situations and serious discussions of goblin history and how one can or can't hack the magical gold exchange rate to make a killing in muggle goods and whether Runes can be used to create magical computers, plenty of that.

Trying to match the tone of HP in that kind of story produces something that is indistinguishable from crack.

It's like hitting the Josh-Baskin-breakdown part of "Big" except you're not actually trying to write a story about the conflict between adulthood and childhood where it actually fits.
