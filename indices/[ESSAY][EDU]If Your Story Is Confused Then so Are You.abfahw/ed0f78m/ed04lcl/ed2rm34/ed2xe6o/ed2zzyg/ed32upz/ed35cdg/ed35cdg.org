First, I'm not defending any particular fanfic that I haven't read anyway here. My point is that the OP's argument that fanfics should accept the fucked up world Rowling created is asking a bit much.

  Writing a story where the fridge horror pokes through the cracks is tonally different from a story that plays the story elements the same way Rowling does.

For me, Rowling wrote a story where the fridge horror slaps you in the face. Not as badly as, say, the typical romcom where sitting back and going "OK, this is a crack fic" doesn't reinforce the suspension of disbelief for me to sit through it, but where you're talking about the tone of Rowling's writing you're talking about the things that make it a crack fic.

  You can apply the same logic to Dumbledore. Sure, the fridge horror of being left at the Dursleys can be extrapolated from canon. But if you're taking that from canon, surely you have to take into account the fact that Dumbledore intervenes basically zero times in Harry's life until the end of book five. He likes to keep Harry abused, but also only hires one abusive professor? And he lets Harry sleep in an actual common room with actual friends? If he's a villain, he's not a very good one.

I think you're arguing against some kind of parody of what I actually wrote here. "Dumbledore's actions are evil" doesn't imply any of that. People are complex, there can be reasons other than "Dumbledore actually intends for Harry to suffer" for him to do evil things, but what he did /was/ evil.
