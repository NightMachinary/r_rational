OK, here's where I'm coming from. I've thought about your idea that I'm too "spoiled" to take HP seriously or whatever. Let me put something to you.

Let's say you're watching that Sandra Bullock vehicle where she's marooned in the space station, and I walk into the room and stand there behind the couch watching it with you, and they get to the scene where Sandra and her space-buddy are holding into the the basically intact and airtight space station and the guy lets go.

And instead of just floating there, maybe drifting away a bit until she can tug on his rope and pull him back, he gets hurled off into space.

I roll my eyes and walk out because that's just too stupid to keep watching. Because if the station was spinning fast enough that happens the thing would be an uninhabitable wreck, with modules and solar panels stripped off, because it's not built to handle that kind of stress.

Yes, ordinary stories do that kind of shit all the time, /and that's a problem/.

It's not "I'm spoiled by [[/r/rational]]", it's that /literally the only reason I'm here/ is because, despite the LessWrong shenanigans, this is one of the few places where whopping plot holes like that attract the kind of derision they deserve.
