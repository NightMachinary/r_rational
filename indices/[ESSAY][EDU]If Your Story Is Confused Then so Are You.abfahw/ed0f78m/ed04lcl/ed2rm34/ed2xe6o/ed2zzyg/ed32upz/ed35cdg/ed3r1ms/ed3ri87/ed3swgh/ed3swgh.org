Because I'm not willing to take the definitions of things and throw them out the window. I don't know if you've been spoiled by [[/r/rational]] or what, but ordinary stories do this shit /all the time/. They make jokes that have terrible implications and then expect you to take those implications seriously only sometimes. Whereas a crackfic is defined as something that is [[https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Crackfic]["intentionally unbelievable and insane"]]. Keyword "insane". Harry Potter is still 80% serious. It's not all comedy. There is an actual plot in it. It's just that there are components of the plot that /are/ written for the sake of humor, and those need to be treated differently from the rest of the work.

Do you know how many thousands of entries are on the TvTropes page for fridge horror? Most of those aren't crackfics, but I also sincerely doubt they were also written with the intent to be horrifying later on.
