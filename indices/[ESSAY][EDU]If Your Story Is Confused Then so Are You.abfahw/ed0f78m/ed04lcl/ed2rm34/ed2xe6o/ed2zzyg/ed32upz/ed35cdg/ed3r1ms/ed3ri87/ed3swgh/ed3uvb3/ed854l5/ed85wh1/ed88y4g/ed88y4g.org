Right, but that also means that you can't have a Dumbledore who repeats his canon actions without that being plain inconsistent. He is not depicted as being consistently secretly evil. This is not being revealed by Fridge Horror. British humor in a children's book is being revealed. If the Dursleys were the only fact we knew about Dumbledore, that would be one thing, but they're not.
