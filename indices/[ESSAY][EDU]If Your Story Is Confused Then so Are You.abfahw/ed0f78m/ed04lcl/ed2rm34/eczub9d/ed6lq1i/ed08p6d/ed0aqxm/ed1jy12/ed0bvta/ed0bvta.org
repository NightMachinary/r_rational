You're not wrong. Sure, I'd feel bad about drinking excclusively *(drunk, ca't typ like ommoraly,(), I don't drink soda. I only drink alcohol sometimes. I drink water. I'm in a situation where' it'd be uneducatred to drink the tap water, so I drink bottled water. Like, I drink o=nothing but bottled water. Plastic straws and "don't steal this product" packaging are much more egregious than just water bottles. I have a "perfect egg cooker" and it's perfect.
