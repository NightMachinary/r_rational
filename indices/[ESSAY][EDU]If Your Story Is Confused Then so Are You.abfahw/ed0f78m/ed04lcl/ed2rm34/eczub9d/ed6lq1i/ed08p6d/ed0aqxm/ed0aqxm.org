  Consider a story where one of the main villains is a stereotypical greedy capitalist who is testing one of their inhumane products on the poor underclass. One of your characters is making their way through the corporate headquarters, reading classified documents and finding out about the true nature of the company, and then quips: "Who the hell even buys this stuff anyway?"

This would be more convincing if there weren't so many examples of inhumane products.

Or even just stupidly designed products, like an induction cooktop where putting a largish pan on the element activates the power switch and turns it off (or on) unintentionally. Such things actually exist.
