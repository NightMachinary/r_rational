> The idea of making a protagonist an antagonist is an interesting one that I think should be explored more in fanfiction, but as I've gone over elsewhere, blowing open a hole in a story like this isn't fair play.

​

I find your position a bit confused. You seem to be criticizing people for extrapolating from the cannon and concocting justifications for an apparent plot-hole. You go on to imply this is bad because Rowling didn't intend it - in fact she had no real answer to the inconsistency of the Dursely's awfulness and Dumbledore's Goodness.

Attempting to reconcile the two is bad because it is *making stuff up*.

But the entire purpose of the activity is to *engage with a fictional world.* Yes, people get invested and extrapolate far beyond the author's intentions. (if you think this is bad, spend some time in [[/r/asoiaf]] !); and, at some level there is no *real* answer to "why did Dumbledore leave Harry with the Dursleys" because Dumbledore isn't a real person.

But I wouldn't say this isn't "fair play".

It is play. It is having fun in an imaginary world, and attempting to make of that world the most nuanced and compelling story you can.

And as such it does have rules - the conclusions aren't random. They are trying to build a model that is consistent internally and with all observed facts. This, to me, is absolutely "fair play."
