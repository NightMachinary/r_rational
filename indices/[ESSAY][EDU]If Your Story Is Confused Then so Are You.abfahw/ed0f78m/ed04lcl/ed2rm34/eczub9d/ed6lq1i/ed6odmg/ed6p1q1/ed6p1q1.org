  Once you "solve" that one question, you're forced to reinterpret the entire story in light of it, which opens up more questions.

why isn't this "fair play" in a fanfic? the entire activity revolves around re-imagining the story world?

or, why isn't it fair play in fandom fullstop? imagining head-cannon to explain apparent discrepancies is part of invested fandom.

I guess I get everything you are saying, I'm just not sure what your point is. Are you saying people aren't allowed do this? that is invalid somehow?

It more seems like you are criticizing people who do it /poorly/ in fanfic, which is an entirely different thing.
