  I don't think you want to show up at a panel and tell people you're into this niche genre about characters who don't hold idiot balls and aren't made of evil at the atomic level who live in a world with consistent rules (well, maybe all that is more radical for anime).

That's actually still pretty radical, for /most/ genre fiction. And for most literary fiction, for that matter, which seems to enjoy taking unrealistic psychologies to extremes in order to Make a Point About Society.
