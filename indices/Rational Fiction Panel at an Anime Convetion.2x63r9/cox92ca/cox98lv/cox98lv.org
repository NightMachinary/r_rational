  I don't think you want to show up at a panel and tell people you're into this niche genre about characters who don't hold idiot balls and aren't made of evil at the atomic level who live in a world with consistent rules (well, maybe all that is more radical for anime). The rationalist bullet points on the sidebar are much more distinctive.
