I would put the emphasis on rational/ist/ fiction. I don't think you want to show up at a panel and tell people you're into this niche genre about characters who don't hold idiot balls and aren't made of evil at the atomic level who live in a world with consistent rules (well, maybe all that is more radical for anime). The rationalist bullet points on the sidebar are much more distinctive.

Maybe some emphasis should be on how intelligence can and should be really portrayed in fiction. E.g. less "aha I saw that all coming cuz I read the script" and more, well, Professor Quirrell. And on how shaking up the readers/watchers in ways that are logical rather than retarded can make a work of fiction feel distinct and fresh.
