Less so. Most writers, even successful ones, are terribly unoriginal, and intelligence is rarely portrayed as well as it is in Harry and Quirrell. But yes, you do have to come up with a way of presenting it in some manner other than, "Gosh, all your characters are dumb and your stories cliche." Find some term, nothing with preexisting connotations like "rationalist," and say we're into this new idea of x writing based on this idea of shaking up the reader into seeing with fresh eyes. E.g. lines like Uncle Iroh saying, "no, she's crazy and she needs to go down," which indicate that he's actually wise and not just a fat walking cliche.
