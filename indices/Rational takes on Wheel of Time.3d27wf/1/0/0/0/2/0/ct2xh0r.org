Yes, Two Rivers is not gender-flipped in any way. In fact, it's pretty much a default fantasy setting, I suspect because it's literally the first place you see in the series. However, there's a reason that the first place they visit after leaving Two Rivers is Cairhien, where a Queen rules, the line of rule is matrilineal, and kings are selected for political reasons. That is explicitly the gender-flipped version of how kingdoms worked in our history. The most powerful people in the people in the world? The Aes Sedai, all female. In fact, the White Tower seems to be directly inspired by the Catholic Church in Medieval Europe in terms of power and organization, so another case of gender-flipping history there.

I would not say the entire world is gender-flipped, but Robert Jordan intentionally messes around with gender politics the entire series. Every culture seems to be different, from the familiar Two Rivers, to that one city where men are treated no better than slaves and are expected to obey women or be beaten. He is not perfect, and I can think of several problem areas, but he was definitely trying different things, and deserves credit for that. Saying that it's just 1950's sexism is blatant misrepresentation, in my opinion.
