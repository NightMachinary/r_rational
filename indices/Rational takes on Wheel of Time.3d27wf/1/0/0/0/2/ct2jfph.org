  The argument for WoT being feminist is largely that it's a gender-flipped society.

Gender-flipped? Really? Men are more excused in gallivanting off to the ends of the earth, as we see in the first few chapters of the first book. In that same interlude, we see Rand &co trying to order Egwene not to join them -- they seem to expect to be obeyed. The Two Rivers standard is that men can order their wives around, and women must connive and manipulate to get out of those orders or to get their husbands to do their will. Women aren't allowed to fight in the Two Rivers or indeed most armies, the Seanchan and the Aiel being the exceptions. Even among the Aiel, men can have children and still go off to war, while women have to choose between children and war. Family names are patrilineal in the Two Rivers and probably most of the WoTverse. I'm pretty sure most of the itinerant traders and crafters we see are men, and the times we see women who are crafters, they tend to be weavers or seamstresses. Taverns tend to have women minding the tables, but they're there to be fondled more often than not.

No, it's not sexism reversed. It's the sexism of 1950s nostalgia, toned down slightly, then made slightly gritty. It scares me that you think that that is a gender-flipped society. How sexist against men would you view a society with actual equality, I wonder? Or do you simply not remember the books well enough?
