Fun fact: when I first read that as his "rule #1 of fanfiction" I initially scoffed - it's far too specific to be "rule #1". At the time, I'd been reading fanfiction pretty much everywhere except fanfiction.net - HPMOR was my first. Then I branched out, and saw just how /many/ stories broke that rule on ffn, and finally realized why he gave it that place of honor.
