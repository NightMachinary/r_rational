It's not that I didn't enjoy reading the fic, it's just that it was not terribly satisfying. I think that you can have a fic with an overpowered main character because maybe it IS fun to watch Harry Potter effortlessly crush every enemy! It just won't leave you feeling like something has been resolved. An example of this done well is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] which is possibly my favorite fanfiction.
