I have not yet read that fanfic, so I'd be interested to learn people's thoughts. Rand is a /massive/ Gary-Stu as it is, and giving him a book-1 powerup is the last thing he needs. Does the story have other redeeming factors?

(I know that this kind of fanfic is a popular genre, so it's okay if it's a don't-like-don't-read sort of thing)
