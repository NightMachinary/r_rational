if you are finding it drags horribly by the end of book 3, you probably shouldn't continue. Books 1-4 are the most solid, until Sanderson picks up and makes the last 3 more active. I hardly remember anything about books 7-9, other than that they could have been just one book and still would have felt like nothing happened.

someone really needs to make a the Abridged Series for WoT. Isam's summaries are a decent start, but I'm imagining something more in the vein of how DBZ Abridged manages to fit at least 90% of the important details of a 10 hour anime season into a 2 hour parody.
