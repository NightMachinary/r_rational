So, there's been enough negative discussion of this fic by now that more would just become bashing. Instead, let's ask how would /you/ make a rational WoT?

I'd want to write it from Matt's perspective. He's got the right genre-savviness-to-power ratio. He could figure out the whole Ta-veren thing and manipulate it to his advantage, and curse his luck when it bites him in the tail. Come to think, though, that's pretty much just how he acts in canon already.

If you want to write "ambitious, knowledgeable character seizes power and saves the world with an iron fist" story like most rationalist fics, Moiraine would be a good pick. You could start before she meets Rand. She gets frustrated with her inability to find [[#s][]], and starts manipulating the world to prepare for the last battle. Bonus round: maybe this causes Rand & Co to not have her present, so they whether the trolloc raid on their own, causing further divergence.
