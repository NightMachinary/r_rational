Rational Wheel of Time might be cool.

That story, although it's fun to read, is deeply unsatisfying. It doesn't seem like the characters are challenged in a significant way, and their interactions with Moraine and Lan are too "easy".

Usually, a fic that centers around time travel, memories getting passed, or some kind of "main character knows a lot more than he should about the plot or about the world in general" are tough to write well. A lot of what makes plots in general, and Wheel of Time in particular enjoyable is that the main character is learning about the world and him/herself. You can still have a character be confident and competent in his domain, but there should be encounters where the outcome isn't clear or the character isn't in a position of strength.

A good example from this would be The Metropolitan Man. Lex is rich, he has well-managed criminal connections, and he is smart, handsome, and charismatic. You might think Lex is a Gary Stu because outside of supernatural powers he has everything he needs. A lot of what makes the plot interesting, though, is that Lex lacks information. He doesn't know what Superman can do. He doesn't know how Superman thinks, or if/when Superman will go mad and destroy the world. He is able to do some stuff very well, like get information from Lois, make money, and fund the bomber. Things outside of his domain are difficult for him, though, like putting agents in Smallville or any sort of physical confrontation with Superman (which he tries and fails to avoid). Also, he's really really restricted by the constant threat of Superman's information gathering powers.

When you read The Metropolitan Man, you're excited because the main character is competent, but you're always a little bit afraid because you don't think it will be enough. Lex is brilliant, charismatic, fabulously wealthy, and above suspicion, and when I read the story I kept on wondering how he could possibly stand a chance against the Man of Steel.

Watching Rand-with-Lews-Knowledge build a perfect kingdom and yank Moraine's chain is fun, sure. But I won't be bookmarking this fic.
