The problem here is that until the very end, the series is rational. Everything that people would do if they were intelligent and had the knowledge and skills they have ... is done. There are clever plots, there is a whole lot of game playing, there is heavy threat to protagonists. It may not /feel/ rational, because the world is literally a narrative that follows something of a predetermined path and revolves around a single hero. But once the setting is laid down, the story makes all kinds of sense.

The one place that totally makes sense for a rational remake is the end, but it would be a short one. So short I can't even be bothered one-shotting it.
