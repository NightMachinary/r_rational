The argument for WoT being feminist is largely that it's a gender-flipped society. It's a matriarchy instead of a patriarchy, and the gender roles have the women in a mostly dominant position. Most of the criticisms of women in WoT are along the lines of "women treat men like they're little boys", but this is part of the point that Jordan was making; a paternalistic society becomes a maternalistic society, and that's a comment-by-comparison on patriarchy more than it's a comment on women. If you wrote a gender-flipped version of WoT, it would be really hard to read it as anything other than a critique of gender roles.

But a lot of people miss all that, and think that Jordan was just writing bitchy, domineering women as a critique of women. (Sanderson has explicitly said that women in WoT have female privilege in the same way that men in our world have male privilege, so I'm not just blowing smoke when I say that this is intentional.)

I mean, there are arguments to be made about characterization, etc. But at its core, I do think it's trying to be feminist, even if it has some failures.
