Nope. I read to chapter 4 and skimmed later ones; while the initial premise was promising (more in themes of 1632 than WoT) it really does seem the point of this fanfic is Rand showing Moiraine how it's done:

  "Still feels earthshattering, doesn't it?" Rand asked her.

  "Yes," she nodded, then smiled. "It's just that I can't..." she shook her head. "All these revelations are making it so that everything is different. Nothing is as it was, anymore, and I find my head throbbing with all of these new... ideas."

  "Hmm," he smirked. "I know that feeling. That's a good thing. Your brain is like a muscle. It needs to be worked in order to grow, but it too has its daily limits, even if there is a ter'angreal as powerful as Lavanth, giving you the motivation. There's so much more that you need to receive today, and I'm not sure that it would be within anyone's limits."

/groan/ I was willing to forgive Rand&company turning their village into an economic powerhouse & fortress in 7 years if there was some 1632 action coming, but it doesn't seem so; and the treatment of Moraine in particular is just shabby.
