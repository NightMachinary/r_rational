I gotta say, the decision to basically load Joffrey with so much torture he thinks he is in hell was a good one; it's hard to stay mad at him, despite how bad he was in the original canon, after all that. Watching him make the kind of mistakes I'd expect before while slowly, slowly learning his lessons was a good way to endear him to the reader. Matching his learning with his growing recognition of just how horrible a person he'd been before helps the plot stay grounded in the source material.

I'm only just starting the Yi Ti arc, but I really enjoyed the lifetime with the lemons and the Broken Knights. Clegane, Jon, and Tyrion all deserved a bit of camaraderie and laughter.
