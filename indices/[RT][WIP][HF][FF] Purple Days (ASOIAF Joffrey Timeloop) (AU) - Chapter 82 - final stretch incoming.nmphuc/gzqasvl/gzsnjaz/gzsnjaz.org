I don't hate the Yi Ti arc. It's necessary for character development, it gives Joffrey a lot of ideas about how to run a Kingdom and an army that he'll need later, and it's the first real exploration of what will become the main plot of the story. My problem with it is that I think it isn't set up properly in terms of pacing or tone. If I went into it expecting that Joffrey would be spending the next ten chapters brutally learning what's at stake in the upcoming war against the dead, rather than thinking that it'd be more like previous loops, I would probably have enjoyed it more.
