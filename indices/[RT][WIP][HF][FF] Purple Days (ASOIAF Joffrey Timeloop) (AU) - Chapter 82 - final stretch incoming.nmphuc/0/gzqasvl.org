I'll second the recommendation. It's one of the best story I discovered through this sub. The character development is really well done, I've rarely seen a story that is able to take such a hateful character and turn him into someone completely different while still making the progression feel natural. Joffrey and the other characters rarely hold the idiot ball and make rational decisions based on what they know (well except at the beginning when Joffrey is literally an idiot)

Side note: A lot of people hate the Yi Ti arc but I actually really liked it because of the added world building.
