Yeah, I felt like I started the last half of the arc expecting each chapter to be the final chapter, given the scale of the threat. Its a good arc for driving home Joffrey's drive to keep on going, how he doesn't want to lose people (as he knows them), and how everyone else doesn't have that "retry" of the loop as an option in their lives and plans. The events and themes of the arc work well, it was just hard to see the scope in the moment of first reading it and is better on a reread.
