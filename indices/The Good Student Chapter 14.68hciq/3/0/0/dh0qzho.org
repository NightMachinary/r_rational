One of the better rules I follow in the real world is that, when either malicious intent or incompetence are both possible reasons for a thing, assume incompetence. In this case, its likely a system enacted by a well-intentioned powerful government official, that fell prey to rampant classism. It continues because it makes no political sense to end the system, but no one really cares to fix it.
