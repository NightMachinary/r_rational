  And we assume the average aristocrat is only slightly better off the the average non-aristocrat because of how readily available schooling is to everyone.

Nah; I think this is easily explained by the difference in level of expectations in schooling (for Ransom specifically), school environment, and the level of education offered in each school. There would also naturally be a level of culture shock/playing catch-up when the Also-Rans come in (hence the opportunity for remedial classes in Chapter 4) - but if the school doesn't offer to help the Also-Rans automatically, the gap widens and it increases the chance that the Also-Ran would drop out. In that case, the Also-Ran would be more likely to say "I dropped out because I couldn't keep up," rather than "I dropped out because I was thrown out the system was stacked against me".
