Yes, after Grundschule (elementary school), students are split into several tracks: Hauptschule, Realschule, und Gymnasium (In some Bundesl√§nder instead of Hauptschule and Realschule there is Gesamtschule). These different tracks take the place of middle school and high school.

If you're in Gymnasium, the advanced track, you take your Abitur at the end, which are a large series of final exams. Going through the Abitur is similar to an IB program in that it's a wider range of studies than a typical American high school. Lots of required arts, political and language courses.
