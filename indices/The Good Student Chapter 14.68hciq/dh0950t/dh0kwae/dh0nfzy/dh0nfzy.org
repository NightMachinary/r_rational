so fun fact. I have known that croix means cross but the whole surname is a classic french surname meaning "of the cross"

quite nice

and yes the part where they try to drive also rans students away doesnt make much sense but i guess nepotism and the elitism in the society kinda does explain that ? idk. I dont feel like it is that much weird. the system was decided with it in mind ,aristocracy is just against associating with commoners i guess
