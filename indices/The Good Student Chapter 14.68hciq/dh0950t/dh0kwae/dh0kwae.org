Yes, some things don't seem to make sense.

Getting the also-rans into the school makes sense. Find the smartest and most driven people who aren't already part of the aristocracy and getting them incorporated into the aristocracy so they are less likely to try violent revolution. But then trying to get them thrown out of the school doesn't make sense with that. That makes the plan into 'find all the most intelligent and driven people who aren't part of the aristocracy and make sure they now have an axe to grind with the aristocracy'.

We'd also expect the regular ransom students to be more normal in their achievements. The aristocracy probably isn't so large that it's just the smartest and most driven members that attend Ransom. And we assume the average aristocrat is only slightly better off the the average non-aristocrat because of how readily available schooling is to everyone.
