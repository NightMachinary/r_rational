Delcroix ....do we read his surname like the del and french croix ? because thats the way i had been doing this...

and i am glad we are getting the perspective of multiple characters. All of them are really interesting and the plot starts to ramp up!

I am currently liking the portreyal of elitism and aristocracy. The propaganda within the country is done really well too. The only thing that really bugs me is the level of studies the main character had to do to get to the school. It seems almost impossible to have such self control and determination to do such a thing + what is the real level of knowledge he had to absorb and all the kids in this elite school? And he is only in the low level class that is supposed to be expelled anyways ? I get that they are high born people and they are destined to do many nice jobs like running this god damn country and all of that but i find it hard to suspend my desbelieve over it.

Another thing could someone tell me the age of these kids. I cant recall it but i think they werent that old which in another way kinda bugs me with the whole how do they learn that much and how intelligent they are.

but as the story stands those are my only complaints tho.

- the characters seem really intelligent but i dont remember their exact age

- the amount of work in studies they have to do to be that good etc

  the story is really good and i recommend it for anyone
