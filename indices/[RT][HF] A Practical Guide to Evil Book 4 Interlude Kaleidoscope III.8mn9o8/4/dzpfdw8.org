As much as I love this story, I feel like this is a sort of litmus test for whether PGtE qualifies as a rational fic.

Based on everything we know about the capabilities of each side, can we really figure out what Juniper's plan is?

If the win comes from Cat or Masego emerging from their respective comas at the most dramatically pivotal moment, fine and good. It's been lampshaded, and in a way this is a huge part of the lore of PGtE. But it is also entirely out of character for Juniper to commit massively to a strategy that invites certain doom if one specific event out of her control doesn't materialize.

Either way, can't wait for the next chapter
