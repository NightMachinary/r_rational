I don't think it would be that far out of left field for Daoine to come back into the Callowan fold. The Duchess of Daoine has had a front row seat to Cat doing some ridiculous stuff and is cooperating fully with repelling this Crusade, which probably wouldn't have directly been a problem for Daoine anyway. She's acknowledged that Cat has Deoraithe blood too. The Grey Pilgrim thinks that she's becoming personally loyal to Cat.
