Well, assuming this is Battle of the Camps, second camp has to get involved. I expect that juniper would ruin their supplies (thus ensuring they would lose on a strategic level due to attrition if they continue marching deeper into Callow), and then threaten to ruin /her/ supplies too if enemies don't stop the attack, while promising to share supplies if crusaders concede defeat here. This would negate the main reason crusaders have for fighting (to get supplies - you can't eat food that is on goblinfire.)
