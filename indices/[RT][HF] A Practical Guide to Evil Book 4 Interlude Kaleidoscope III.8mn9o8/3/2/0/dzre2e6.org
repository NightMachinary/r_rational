I'm not going to go through the whole story again to confirm, but I'd say the reason the proportion of lesbians in this story feels high (to me, and a bunch of people who upvoted me) is that while the proportion of characters mentioned as lesbians to total female characters is low (something like 1/10?), the proportion of lesbians/bi characters to female characters whose sexuality is mentioned at all is high (I'd say at least 1/2 or 1/3).

Also, most characters whose sexuality is mentioned are female, which might be part of the perceived effect.

But by contrast, male characters whose sexuality is mentioned are mostly heterosexual: Hakram (probably), Ratface, Nauk, Robber, Black are mentioned as heterosexual, vs Warlock as homosexual, no bisexual male characters that we know of.
