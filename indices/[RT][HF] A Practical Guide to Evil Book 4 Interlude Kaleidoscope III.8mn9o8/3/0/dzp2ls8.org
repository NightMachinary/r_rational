  Is it just me or does this story has a statistically improbable number of lesbian characters?
#+end_quote

Who's to say what is statistically improbable in Guideverse? If you have to, just imagine that Dread Empress Malodorous I, the Desperately Horny, really wanted to increase her pool of potential partners and dumped something in the water a thousand years ago thereby altering the course of Praesi genetics forever. Call it a day.

Anyway, the only confirmed lesbian I can recall is Malicia, maybe Killian (she could still be bi, I think). Cat is bisexual (although she definitely seems to prefer women) and Archer is pansexual. There's like fifty recurring characters in this story. Probably more. Throw in Warlock (gay), Tikiloshe (pan), and Masego (asexual), and the number of LGBTQ characters is still way less than ten percent of the characters, although they do make up a fair chunk of the main cast. I don't recall any trans or genderqueer folks though, especially not in the main cast.

Everything else, like this Juniper passage, is just ship teasing. Aisha was boinking Ratface anyway, so she's probably straight. Cat's also our most frequent PoV, and she eyeballs every lady she sees; it's not necessarily reciprocated, as we saw with Princess Rozala.

This calls to mind the complaints that too many of the important and competent characters are women in proportion to men.

Honestly, we've had so many stories that totally lack this kind of representation. It's not a big deal to tip the scales the other way every once in a while. Even if Guideverse had precisely the same historical demographics as our universe, outliers happen. The main cast doesn't have to perfectly line up with the most statistically probable distribution of anything.

  Yay! Casual war crimes!

  (aw, I can't stay mad at Abigail)
#+end_quote

I hope we see General Abigail by the end of this. Is desecrating enemy corpses a war crime in this universe? It is in ours, but we don't have major powers that employ orcs in their professional armies. Anyway, it'd probably be a mercy to just get eaten by the damn orcs, since you know everyone else is gonna become part of Cat's undead reserve forces.

Edit: oh yeah, Malicia also sleeps with Ime, but she could be bi or Malicia-sexual, since evidently everyone in the Guideverse is.
