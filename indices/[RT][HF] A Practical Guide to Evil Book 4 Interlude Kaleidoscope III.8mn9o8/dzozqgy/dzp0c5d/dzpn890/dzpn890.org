You're on.

My prediction:

It'll be the standard tactic of one side retreating to double up the other, except Procerans can't give chase because buried munitions. What's more, The Callow army are relatively free to use the Marshland too because they're the one's with the repeating siege engines.

Portals are a viable strat destpite cat being dead, so one side of the Proceran host can be sandwiched, then munitioned up. The remaining quarter is attacking the priests(they're +Indriani, to mess with the Rogue dude). That one 'Possibly Assasin' dude from the chapter before might also come into play somehow, and Hakram might level up from all the fighting.
