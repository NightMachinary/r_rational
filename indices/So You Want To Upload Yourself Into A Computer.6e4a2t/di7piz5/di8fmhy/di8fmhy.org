Although I completely disagree with your extrapolation, it's more important that I think your extrapolation is entirely non-applicable.

The point here is that your upload would use the /exact same/ argument to believe itself conscious as you, ass in chair in this literal moment, /currently/ use to come to the same conclusion.

This argument doesn't even have to apply to /other humans/. If you believe yourself conscious, and you believe yourself copied, your copy has a copy of that belief in your consciousness.

Then again, all is theory until and experiment is viable.
