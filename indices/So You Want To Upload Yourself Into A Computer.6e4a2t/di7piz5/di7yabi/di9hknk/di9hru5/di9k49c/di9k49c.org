[[/twibeam][]] Yeah, I'm mostly just being argumentative for the fun of the debate.

  The reason a human can think is because we are imperfect self-replicators that gained an advantage by thinking.

[[/twiponder][]] Technically, that's the mechanism by which an unutterably tiny chance of carbon and other atoms coming together in a shape capable of thought became, well, less unutterably tiny. Evolution doesn't make otherwise impossible things happen - it makes otherwise /incredibly unlikely/ things happen.

[[/twipride][]] So, yes, you're right. The odds of any given rock being a naturally-formed processor by unknown mechanisms is so unlikely that one can't expect it to happen. (I wouldn't say it doesn't bear thinking about, but that's only because it's occasionally fun to speculate about extreme low-probability but nonetheless entertaining possibilities). Of course, the odds of a given chunk of silicon being a human-formed processor powered by well-known mechanisms is a lot higher... but it's generally easy to tell those apart from natural rocks, as they tend to be very visibly distinct (to the point where they're often not even considered in the category of 'rocks').
