The central idea of a p-zombie is that they appear to be sentient yet are not. If something doesn't appear to be sentient, it can't be a p-zombie.

It's possible that rocks are sentient, but we're incapable of discovering this. That's also true of everything though; the Earth, the number 6, a set of all sets that do not contain themselves. All of those /could/ be sentient, but given the complete lack of evidence for it (or, indeed, any coherent definition of what that would even mean), we can't really treat them as if they are.
