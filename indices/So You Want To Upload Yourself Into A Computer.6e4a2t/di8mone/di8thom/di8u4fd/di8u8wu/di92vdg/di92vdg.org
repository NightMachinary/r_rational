I absolutely cannot fathom that. The idea that consciousness is an illusion makes no sense to me.

An illusion TO WHOM?

  I could be shown the part of the brain that computes consciousness

Who is the "I" in this scenario? How are you being "shown"? Who is "seeing" those parts of the brain?

If there is no observer, these statements make no sense.

you posit a "part of the brain that computes consciousness" and "part of the brain that computes reason" but do we even have any evidence these things exist, and are separate?

EDIT:

Hold up! What you just posited was the possibility of P zombies, which I always took to be a huge no-no for uploaders. If you accept P zombies, why the heck should we believe software copies are conscious?
