That's a bit of a bad example because you can totally disable specific functional parts of a game. Most games even have commands for it.

Personally I think consciousness probably functions as a shared workspace in which sensory data and metadata is projected, that allows for reorganization and reinterpretation as well as comparing with model prediction. I think some of the senses that feed into this workspace are meta-level reports like awareness, which would mean reason would be inoperable without it, whiiich is actually a pretty good argument against q-zombies now that I think about it. Hmm. I guess I would say that a sense like that would be pointless if it wasn't sometimes off, so there's probably modes of reason that bypass it. Not sure though.
