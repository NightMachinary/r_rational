  Non-conscious people can still reason.

  we're talking about a mind that had its seat of consciousness physically subtracted.

  A Q-Zombie believes they feel conscious despite having no consciousness.

Where in the /world/ are you getting these ideas? I suspect you have a very different definition of consciousness than I, and most scientific and philosophical literature I've encountered.

You seem to believe there is some sort of "consciousness organ", or specific part of the brain that makes you able to experience qualia or not.

This is not supported by Neuroscience or any of our best guesses about the nature of consciousness.

Your definition is also inconsistent:

  there exist disorders that destroy parts of our sensory apparatus while denying us the ability to even notice that we've lost them

Sensory apparatus is not the same thing as consciousness! A blind person does not cease to be conscious. Even destroying all sensory nerves leading to the brain would not destroy consciousness, if imagination and internal monologue were still possible. Senses are integral to the experience of qualia, but not /identical/ to the experience of qualia itself.

There is no single part of the brain associated with "reason" or "consciousness" that can be independently disconnected.

Basing your metaphysics off a sci-fi novel is perhaps not the wisest course. ;) I will check out the novel, though, as it sounds interesting.
