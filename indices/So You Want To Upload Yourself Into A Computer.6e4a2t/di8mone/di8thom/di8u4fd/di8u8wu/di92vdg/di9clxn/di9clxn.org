  Who is the "I" in this scenario? How are you being "shown"? Who is "seeing" those parts of the brain?

Non-conscious people can still reason. Though admittedly it's hard to believe that they can reason about themselves. Maybe they'd have to relearn what consciousness gives you intuitively.

  Hold up! What you just posited was the possibility of P zombies

Far from it. We're not talking about a mind who is in all respects identical to a mind that is conscious; we're talking about a mind that had its seat of consciousness /physically/ subtracted. A P-Zombie is a mind that had its /qualia metaphysically/ subtracted. What I described is more of a ... Q-Zombie?

A P-Zombie behaves like a human despite feeling nothing on the inside. A Q-Zombie believes they /feel/ conscious despite having no consciousness. Mind you I don't believe that a Q-Zombie behaves identically, I just think they /think/ they do. The diagnostic in their brains that says they're conscious is set permanently to "on".

If we allow for the existence of Q-Zombies, then no reasoner can decide /even from the inside/ that they are conscious with 100% certainty.

As opposed to P-Zombies, Q-Zombies have precedent in neuroscience; there exist disorders that destroy parts of our sensory apparatus while denying us the ability to even /notice/ that we've lost them. Read Blindsight!
