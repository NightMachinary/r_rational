I think I could be convinced that I am not actually conscious. For instance, I could be shown the part of the brain that computes consciousness and the part of the brain that computes reason, and the link between them that informs my reason that I am conscious, and I could be shown the emptiness in my brain where the first part was and the electrode connected to the second part, which would force me to conclude that I am not actually conscious.

At that point, the sensation of being conscious would lose its discriminative value.

I think at that stage I'd start believing in a model such as that espoused by [[http://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm][Blindsight]], where consciousness a vestigial cognitive organ that would occasionally be discarded.

It is very dangerous for a Bayesian to believe anything at 100%.

My belief that I am conscious is /more certain/ than my belief that another is conscious, because there are more steps in the chain for the other, but they are not /fundamentally different types of belief/.
