  *Mr. Pump*: 'I Worked It Out. You Have Killed Two Point Three Three Eight People.'\\
  *Moist von Lipwig*: 'I have never laid a finger on anyone in my life, Mr. Pump. I may be --- all the things you know I am, but I am not a killer! I have never so much as drawn a sword!'\\
  *Mr. Pump*: 'No, You Have Not. But You Have Stolen, Embezzled, Defrauded And Swindled Without Discrimination, Mr Lipvig. You Have Ruined Businesses And. Destroyed Jobs. When Banks Fail, It Is Seldom Bankers Who Starve. Your Actions Have Taken Money From Those Who Had Little Enough To Begin With. In A Myriad Small Ways You Have Hastened The Deaths Of Many. You Do Not Know Them. You Did Not See Them Bleed. But You Snatched Bread From Their Mouths And Tore Clothes From Their Backs. For Sport, Mr Lipvig. For Sport. For The Joy Of The Game.'
