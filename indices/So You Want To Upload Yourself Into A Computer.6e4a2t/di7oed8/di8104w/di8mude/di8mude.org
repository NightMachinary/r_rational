There's a fun theory by Scott Aaronson. If we assume that something about consciousness cannot be exactly cloned (which is reasonable, since instruments have a finite measuring precision):

"this suggests, to be conscious, a physical entity would have to do more than carry out the right sorts of computations. It would have to, as it were, fully participate in the thermodynamic arrow of time: that is, repeatedly take microscopic degrees of freedom that have been unmeasured and unrecorded since the very early universe, and amplify them to macroscopic scale. [...] Such a being also couldn't be instantiated by a lookup table, or by passing slips of paper around, etc."

So an approximately-copied upload would be exactly measurable and thus not conscious.

Do read the whole blog post, it is fascinating. [[http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2756]]
