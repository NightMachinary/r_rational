  entailed by embodied-cognition and predictive-mind theories. I'm not familiar with these theories. Are they reductionist to the patterns of matter? Could a mind in embodied-condition and predictive-mind theories be briefly instantiated by random patterns of particles, a Boltzmann brain?

If so, they don't entail participation in the arrow of time; since random patterns that momentarily /look like they do the work/ are conscious too.

Apologies if I'm arguing against a strawman, if that is the case just dismiss my objection.
