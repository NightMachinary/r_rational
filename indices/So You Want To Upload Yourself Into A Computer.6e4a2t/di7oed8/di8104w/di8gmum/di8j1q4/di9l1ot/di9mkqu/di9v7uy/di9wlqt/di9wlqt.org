The Higgs Boson was confirmed experimentally forty years after it was postulated.

It's a heck of a lot of an explanation compared to a lot of philosophy. In that it is a bundle of neurons, we can find it and if we are unethical, lobotomize it out of people to create people who reliably profess non-consciousness despite displaying all the characteristics associated.

Turning people into P-zombies (not conscious, profresses consciousness) is then perhaps a matter of also giving them that neurological condition where people are incapable of recognizing that they are disabled. Or to do it to a pathological liar who /really/ wants to be a P-zombie.

Distinguishing people who do not have the consciousness-sensation is a matter of accurate fMRI.

Turning an AI conscious is an oxymoron. There is no need for an AI to have sensory modalities in the manner which humans do, hence we will not see an AI with a consciousness-sensation that is analogous to messy wetware built by evolution. Again, this is conflating consciousness with capability.

Is an AI that can reshape the solar-system with nanotech and have a conversation with a billion people at once conscious? Mu. Is it capable of self-reflection? Yes. Is it a person? Arguably not. Does any of this matter? No.

Let's instead talk about Sapient AI's --- those that match or exceed humans in cognitive capability. There is definitely a "hard problem of Sapient AI" and it is unsolved.
