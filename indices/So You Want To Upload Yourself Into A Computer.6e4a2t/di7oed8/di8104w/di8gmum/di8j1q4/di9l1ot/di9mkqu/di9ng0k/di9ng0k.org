I am not confused whether or not I or any other human is a p-zombie. Nor do I think there is anything other than physics going on in me.

My question is how would you establish, without doubt, that the illusion of consciousness is present in a computer? You won't be able to read it in the source code (it's just trillions of chemical reaction simulations) and you can't fMRI a CPU.

All we can do is ask. And a flawed program can give the same answer as a fully qualified upload.
