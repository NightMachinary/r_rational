We're talking past each other.

I'm familiar with AIXI, with Goedel Machines, I have a buddy studying TNS/CCS at MIT.

What I mean by an AI not having sensory modalities like humans do is much more implementation specific. An AI could have whatever algorithms like... Fast approximate inverse kinematics, and vast neural nets to do sensorymotor effects, and /those are fundamentally different from what human brains do!/ It achieves the same results, sure, but my core thesis is "Consciousness is what some neural algorithm of the human mind feels like from the inside."

AI need not have the same algorithms or the same feedback algorithms or the same anything, really. It can be a fundamentally different system which is still Sapient-level intelligent.

(Contrast and compare Avians vs. Mammals. Most mammals are kinda familiar to humans, most avians are not. They have different basic reaction and behavioral patters.)

And yeah P-Zombies are epiphenomenal, and epiphenomenal theories are strictly more complex than their materialist counterparts. My theory is not, and I don't understand how P-Zombies relate to uploads in most ordinary people's heads.
