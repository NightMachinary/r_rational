  I'm arguing that illusion of consciousness is caused by a brain center.

If that is a known fact, then I don't understand why people talk about consciousness being tricky.

  First, you get a working model of all the types of cells in the brain and which ones are computationally important and how they perform computation.
#+end_quote

All the cells are important. Our mood is affected by wierd things like gut bacteria. The digestive systems has comparable amount of neurons to a cat brain. I don't want to become some kind of ultra-Vulcan when I upload. If want to be able to have /fun/. And to be honest, /fuck stuff/.

To do a systems test you need to know what every cell does, and what the expected results of interaction with other cells are. Including various signalling substances in the body and brain, from blood sugar levels to endocrine signalling proteins.

If we knew all that we could just achieve biological immortality instead.
