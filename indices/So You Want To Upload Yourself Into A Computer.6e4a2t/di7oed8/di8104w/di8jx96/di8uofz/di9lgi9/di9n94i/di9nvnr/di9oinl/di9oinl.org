Enjoyment sits in the brain. Check for the enjoyment related neuron clusters and see that they function normally.

On a meta-level, remember that enjoyment exists for no deeper reason than to make you do shit that's useful to your continued survival and procreation. It's just another brain function, and there's no Enjoyment-Zombies for the same reason as there's no P-Zombies.

On a meta-meta level it seems like you're not actually accepting a materialist view of the mind. You seem to think that two brains containing 99%+ of the same information, memories, response patterns, etc. will somehow be ineffably "different" because one is digital.

There is no "copy," there is two originals.

Okay, tough customer, consider this:

What if instead of scanning your brain and simulating it abstractly, I buy a quantum computer the size of the moon, scan you to subatomic resolution and simulate you quark-by-quark?

Say I put you under general anaesthetic with zero-EEG and in a state of protective hypothermia so your metabolic rate is basically zero, and construct a physical replica of you, accurate to sub-molecular scale, then wake you both up in identical rooms?

Say I reduce you to a brain-in-a-jar and let you pilot an incredibly realistic android body?
