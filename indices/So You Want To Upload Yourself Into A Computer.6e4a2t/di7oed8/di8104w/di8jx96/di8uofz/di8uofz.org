You can define anything you like until the sun grows cold and you will be no wiser as to what universe you're living in.

You need to remember that your brain is a total mess and everything you call "you" or "self" or "consciousness" is an abstraction built into it by evolution to make it easier for the messy, messy brain to reason about its own component systems.

You are not one person, for starters, as split-brain patients tacitly prove. You are not even two persons. You are a committee of perhaps more than fifty brain regions that all try to figure out what you're supposed to be doing. Condensing fifty to one and providing a plausible (if wrong) narrative for how things came about is a lot cheaper to do than to reason directly about fifty things.

Human brains are lazy. Assume your intuitions are minimum-effort and that your interpretation of reality is 90% almost-accurate fabrication. Only then can you actually start reasoning about human thought.

Feelings are /neat/ and /compact/ and /cheap/ and /mostly accurate/ abstractions over a complicated reality. Evolution came across one way to implement them and applied it to /everything/ (or possibly it came across the same thing several times.)

Seriously, the answer to why we experience feelings is right there in evolution. The human brain isn't designed to think, it's designed to facilitate maximum procreation, and caloric austerity is important to that.

It is useful to wave away consciousness as being on the same level as "ineffable redness of red" because it lets us be better physicists and AI theorists. Looking for the source of consciousness is a fool's errand.

There is no "hard problem of consciousness" there is only "not smart enough" and "smart enough." You can pack up your sub-thermal-noise ghosts in the machine, and your P-zombies now and get back to figuring out how the hell Quantum Gravity works or something.
