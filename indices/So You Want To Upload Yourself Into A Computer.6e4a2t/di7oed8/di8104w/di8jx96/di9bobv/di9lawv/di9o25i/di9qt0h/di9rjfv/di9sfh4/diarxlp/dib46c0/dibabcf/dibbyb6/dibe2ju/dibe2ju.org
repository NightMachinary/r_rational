  That's exactly my point. Until there is a way to verify that I will not upload. Asking an upload is not good enough, because the (by me) desired features are not about how things appear to outside observers.

It doesn't seem like it's even possible to satisfy your criteria, let alone do it with realistic future technology.

  An emulation without emotions and consciousness is per definition not a perfect emulation, so it would be of no use to me.
#+end_quote

I suppose I just don't get the point then. If it doesn't affect behaviour, including the response to questions like, "Are you conscious?" and "Are you happy?", then it's meaningless.

If I said, "An emulation without qowijeqlkjalsd is per definition not a perfect emulation.", because qowijeqlkjalsd would be exactly as meaningful. There needs to be a prediction that isn't met for something to be different.

  That is, a software that is comprehensibly proven to not be conscious, self aware, etc. would be perfectly fine according to you as long as it can fake being those things good enough to fool outside observers.
#+end_quote

No, I'm saying that it is literally impossible to prove something is not conscious. At best you could prove that you can't see a reason it would be conscious, but that's not the same thing.

If something says it's conscious and perfectly imitates the behaviours we would expect from a conscious organism, then that is exactly the same standard of proof that you or I provide. Anything that passes that test has to be conscious, or we have no reason to believe anything is.

My personal opinion goes further, which is that the imitation of consciousness requires consciousness.

It'd be like saying that somebody was faking knowing Japanese, despite being able to effortlessly talk with any Japanese-speaker they met. Maybe it's possible that it's all one big coincidence, that the words coming out of their mouth were accidentally correct every time, but that's true of any Japanese speaker.

  I enjoy my current existence, illusionay or not, and I want the same for my digital instance.
#+end_quote

Well, this hypothetical digital version of you states that they do enjoy their existence. I see no more reason to disbelieve them than I do to disbelieve the past versions of me (and in this scenario I could actually talk to your upload, whereas all past versions of me are dead).

  You want to sell me a car. It looks like a car, and when I ask about it you show me the car moving on a highway, parking, etc. But you won't let me look inside the car.
#+end_quote

No, the salesman lets you look inside the car. You can see that the inside is different to the inside of other cars. Even though it's clearly meant to feel the same, it isn't the same material and so can't be physically identical.

You declare that to be sure it really feels like the inside of a car, you'd need subatomically precise data about it during function, and an abstraction layer to interpret that information, and verification that the abstraction layer was valid.

The car salesman asks if you've ever checked to see if your own car passes that test or, indeed, if any car ever to exist has ever passed that test. It's a no to both questions. So even though you can't see any reason why it wouldn't feel like a car, and the driver inside tells you how much it feels like a car, you still question whether it feels like a car because you think "feeling like a car" is somehow engrained in the physical components.

Anyway, this whole conversation has become unproductive. If you'd like to rebut this post, I promise I will read your rebuttal and consider your points, but I won't reply.
