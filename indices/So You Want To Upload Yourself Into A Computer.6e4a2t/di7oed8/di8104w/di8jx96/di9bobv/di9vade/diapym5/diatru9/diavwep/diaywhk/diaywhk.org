  I agree that the meat-puppet wouldn't be conscious, but there would still be consciousness: the super-intelligent AI.

It's not necessarily conscious. AIs don't have to think at all like us, as long as they accomplish their goals. An efficient AI for accomplishing some task may strip out a capacity for conscious experience that we built into it. We'd have to understand the precise causal role of consciousness to judge that.
