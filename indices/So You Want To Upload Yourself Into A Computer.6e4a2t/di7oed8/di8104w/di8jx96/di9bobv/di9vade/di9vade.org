  Take the claustrum for instance. You say the claustrum may be involved, and it does look like it may be. But what if you created a synthetic claustrum, attaching the artificial neurons to the surrounding tissue in exactly the same way as the original?

We'd have to try taking out the original, putting in the synthetic one, and then removing that one and replacing it with the original. And we'd have to try it on /you/.

  Either consciousness is a necessary precondition for important things like thought, emotion, memory, etc. in which case the presence of any of those things implies consciousness, or it isn't a necessary precondition and we have no particular reason to care.

The question is not whether consciousness is necessary for all aspects of cognition, but /which/ aspects require it, and what the mind can /suffice/ with in its absence.
