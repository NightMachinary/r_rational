Can't talk for others here, but I have a longstanding agreement with my alternates to use each other as tools without any moral worth. That doesn't necessarily make continuity important. In fact, as long as there's only one of me, it doesn't matter at all. But if there are two, even if one is one of those mythic 1:1 uploads, I would expect them to do anything and everything they could and had to to me to maximise their own values, and I would not fault them for it. We had an agreement.

Between continuity and configuration-locus, I wouldn't use an uploading technology that violated configuation-locus-identity. I might use a continuity-violating one that preserved configuration locus, given appropriate incentives. I'd prefer not to, though, because time seems to be continuous, and the physical process of the mind is built out of continuous processes.

Which stop in death.
