  Your standard does not have that property. And that's all right; but it's not something I can bring myself to embrace.

I agree with you then that our main disagreement is arational, and that we can rationally disagree. Just out of curiosity, do you think your preferences themselves might change if this sort of mind-uploading became commonly accepted in the future? If everyone you knew was doing it, and seemed pretty happy with it, do you think you'd eventually adopt a standard that was more relaxed? Or would you be a holdout forever?

I'm just asking out of curiosity, and I agree that whichever stance you have on that is rational, since it's a question of preference.
