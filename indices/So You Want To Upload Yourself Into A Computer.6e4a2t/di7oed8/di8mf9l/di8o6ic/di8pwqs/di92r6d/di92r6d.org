I don't think my preferences are likely to change based on how other people feel about actualising their decisions, no. I tend to preserve major values to the detriment of interpersonal relationships.

That said, there are things that can change my mind about uploading. All we need, really, is a hell of a lot more knowledge on how brains work. Everything that I have right now (everything anyone has, really...) is a series of best-guess approximations. Replace those with enough actual facts, and I'll probably end up having to conclude differently. I would expect that I'll have to seriously re-evaluate and adjust or outright discard my notion of identity-in-the-moment within the next two decades.

Configuration space locus...?

That's harder. Breaking in-the-moment requires a series of specific answers to a bunch of known unknowns and a few unknown unknowns directly associated with the answers to the known ones. Breaking CSL is almost entirely unknown unknowns, but there are two difficult known unknowns that would kill it outright:

- Many Worlds is False.
- There is no multiverse, or at least, there is no /infinite/ multiverse.

Given those, configuration space is no longer anything but a mathematical tool as opposed to an abstraction of an external reality. The only rational choice I could make in light of such evidence would be to discard that notion of identity, because the other selves implied by CSL locus would not exist anywhere.

I don't know if I would then begin following your notion, but since my present notions are just about as hostile to uploading as it's possible to get without becoming in some sense religious about it, I really doubt that they would be anything but friendlier to the idea.

And with that answer given, I also find myself curious: can you conceive of a sequence of events that would cause you to take up a position similar to mine?
