  I don't want to do any of this "while the subject is asleep"; the point of the sleep analogy is that there is no continuity that matters.

It is of course true that neither consciousness, intuitive personal identity, nor body-ownership are "continuous" in the sense that you can cut them into infinitesimal points that integrate to the whole.

It's also a fairly good point that after someone has already died and had themselves preserved, well, call that continuous or not, you're still basically going from dead to not-dead. There's a spectrum between dying and dead, but once you're firmly dead, count yourself fortunate that you have even a philosophically weird route back from that.

The thing is, though, if you die, you're not continuously living. We can definitely measure out the period of time in which you were dead. That's /definitely/ discontinuous.

On the other hand, a jump from "meat-living" to "digital-living" can be argued-over in terms of how small a time-slice you need to "cut" in-between to constitute subjective instantaneous change. Sleep or death, in that context, constitutes an expected and subjectively acceptable discontinuity in consciousness: you don't really /expect/ to continue your subjective awareness during sleep, so you /prefer/ that way as more /comfortable/ (not necessarily philosophically "more continuous", but less weird to think about).
