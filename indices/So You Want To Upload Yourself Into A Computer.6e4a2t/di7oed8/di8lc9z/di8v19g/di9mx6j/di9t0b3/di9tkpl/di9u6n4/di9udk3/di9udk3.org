I just don't understand what it is about continuous consciousness that's worth preserving that /isn't/ interrupted by sleep.

I hear people say things like "the brain keeps working during sleep, therefore only a progressive uploading scheme with gradual replacement can truly preserve /myself/" and I don't get it at all. It feels like a sort of motte-bailey shift from "active conscious awareness" to "brain activity".
