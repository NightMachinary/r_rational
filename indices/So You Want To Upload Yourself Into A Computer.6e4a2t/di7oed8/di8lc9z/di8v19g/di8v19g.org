When someone tries those cheesy lines on you, */BLAM/* them for heresy. The Emperor protects.

But seriously, if anyone says that shit to me without a thick slide-deck full of rigorous neurosci and cogsci by which to extensively demonstrate the point, I'm just gonna assume they're malicious. That, or they've read too much scifi, and are also /epistemically/ malicious. They're trying to get me to generalize from fictional evidence.
