Gods and fire, yes, it drives me insane. Its like, hey, look, the author had a chance to show us their intellectual muscle by justifying how it isn't suicide, or, hell, even taking the courageous stance that it is, but /you should still do it/.

But, nah.

So many stories just have the author shut their brain off. Well that, or the pro-uploader in the dialogue is a questionably-motivated individual outwitting a character being written as a credulous idiot.

I don't get it. I'd love to be wrong about all my notions and uploading being a miracle technology that leads to a never-ending wonder parade of transhumanism and immortality... but to start at that conclusion and work backwards?

It's the same type of stupidity engaged in my those individuals in [[/r/singularity]] who think that ASI, regardless of what it's designed for, will spontaneously self-configure into a Culture Mind.

It's a bad meme, and I hope it dies.
