Hahahah. I've read so many stories like this:

"Hey, want to get uploaded? We'll destroy your physical brain during the scan and then you'll be immortal."

"You mean my scan will be immortal, and I'll be dead. No thanks."

"Hey, every time you fall asleep it's no different that permanently destroying your physical brain."

It's a fun assertion, but I haven't seen too much attempt to actually establish it.
