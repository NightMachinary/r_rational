  and for gods sake if someone posts that sleep is also a discontinuity, it fucking isn't.

I grit my teeth every time I read that. As far as I am concerned I am the chemical reaction that is my brain and its supporting systems (since even things like gut bacteria can affect mood). This chemical machine is sometimes aware of itself. But it keeps going in sleep, just in a different operating mode. There is no disconnect, there is no "off" time, there is nothing that could even remotely be compared to death.
