It's anecdotal best-guessing. Since the dose of Huperzine A I used was slightly toxic - excessive salivation, a symptom of too much ACh activity, was noted - I really doubt that you'll ever find any research not done on animal models unless you want to turn yourself into a case study, like me.

Here's the premise:

1. Anticholinergic drugs negatively effect memory transcription.
2. In sleep, acetylcholine levels plummet, except when dreaming.
3. Dreams are remembered.
4. Dreamless sleep isn't.
5. The variable that changes the most between those states is ACh levels.
6. it is likely that natural low ACh levels cause similar symptoms to artificially lowered ACh levels.
7. So the lack of ACh during normal sleep may be why normal sleep is not memorable.
8. By being insufficiently risk-averse, I have been able to remember sleep by artificially forcing my ACh levels to remain high throughout.
9. It follows that (7) is even more probable.

Seriously though, I had to go pretty high up the dose scale before the blockade the Huperzine A established on Acetylcholine breakdown was sufficient for a positive result (lower levels resulted in vivd, lengthy dreams). While my waking cognition did not seem to be impaired by what I took, and no permanent ill-effects seem to have resulted, I can't recommend pursuing it yourself.

Should you decide to anyway, I'll warn you that the remembered experience of normal sleep is more-or-less like hours upon hours of wordlessness attached to varying degrees of delerium and semi-total immobility (you will occaisionally feel as if capable of movement without actually moving your body). Definitively /not/ for someone with claustrophobia. Also, Huperzine A has a very, very long half life, so any side effects you invoke will be with you for a day to a day and a half.
