Please tell me what you are referring to by tick rate, since there are various things in the brain which have definable clock rates and I can't know which one you are talking about off-the-cuff.

I agree that for all we know, concioussness is caused by memory transcription. For all we know, it is caused by subtle details of the fine structure of the occipital lobe. For all we know, it is caused by the ion gradients between nerve cells. For all we know there is a special protein, and nerve cells with that protein generate conciousness while those without it do not. For all we know conciousness solely exists in the proposed quantum effects that the mind is thought to exploit to communicate with elements of itself not directly connected, like those evolved FPGAs used magnetic flux between circuit elements to enhance their voice recognition capability. For all we know, conciousness arises from the pineal gland, and cutting that out turns someone into a P-Zombie. For all we know conciousness is a delusion endemic to all neural networks, and everything alive in this universe are little more than non-sentient meat computers affected by an evolutionary bug.

*We don't know*. All we know is that making assumptions that the data have /not/ sufficiently born out is overwhelmingly likely to lead to false inference, so why are you trying to use that as a foil for my ideas? Surely you see that in doing so, you are trying to use the consequence of a weaker hypothesis as evidence to overturn a (for the time being, given the present state of evidence) stronger one. The entire operation seems sketchy, in a bayesian sense.

As far as blunt trauma and anaesthetics go, I don't know. Last time either of those occurred to me, I just couldn't seem to get to an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor in advance. Pity that I don't see any ethics board ever signing off on that shit, but what can you do? Most people just don't regard people willing to take permanent brain damage for science to be sane, these days.

But, assuming that that was a prompt to get me to think things through and realise absurdities resulting from my worldview, /I reject that the consequences are absurd/. Assuming that conciousness is terminated by some process without also destroying the potential for it to restart, performing such on a person without their explicit, informed consent should be morally regarded as somewhere between extremely brutal assault and murder. Less than murder because killing an "in the moment" identity doesn't necessarily also equal killing a configuration locus identity; whereas murder /does/. Certainly a form a death though.
