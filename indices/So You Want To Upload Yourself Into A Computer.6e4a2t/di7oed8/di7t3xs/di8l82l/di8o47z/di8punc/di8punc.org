Memory doesn't mean conciousness; it's only evidence thereof. I see memory of concioussness and assume concioussness for the same reason that I see a picture of a man in a room, and assume he was there. I suppose that concioussness remains even in the absence of biochemical tweaking for the same reason that, if I set a camera to go off at 3PM every day, and a specific person is always in frame, I conclude that they were there on a day when the camera was out of film. Occam. Given that AChE inhibitors aren't concioussness altering in any other circumstance, it seems less extravagant to assume that conciousness is an axiom of the brain, while memory transcription is not. Especially as there are many examples of lack of transcription as with, eg, automaticity.

Sleep paralysis is utterly unlike what I experienced with AChE inhibitors. Being asleep is like being very delerious, nonverbal and basically unable to act (not that there was enough coherence /to/ act...). It's probably the closest thing someone with a healthy brain can come to experiencing severe brain damage. Sleep paralysis is more like cultivating a nightmare on the waking visual field. Hard as hell; payoff not really worth it. At the very least, I didn't get any insights beyond the fact that it was possible to both know it was fake and believe it was real on an animal level.

It's fine to be okay with the death of present-moment-identity, but I think your example is a little disingenuous because we both already agree that such an exactingly precise copy satisfies our highest/most important/only concept of identity. You can't make a 1:1 youmunculus by anything other than vanishingly low chance unless you're in a universe where a you existed. Too much specificity involved. I'd be even happier if the copy was down to the quantum level, but it still basically /works/.

First-gen uploading technology is far more likely to be synapse-resolution garbage run on a substrate that doesn't capture physical processes. That is certainly not an identical replacement.
