There's a bit of a logical disconnect between "there are no p-zombies, so every you is real and must be treated as a person" to "forking-and-deleting in pursuit of higher goals is perfectly fine, and is in fact a good idea." If it's okay to abuse and delete forks of yourself, it's also okay to abuse and delete your first uploaded self.

My personal opinion is that it's okay to delete copies of yourself, so long as they have some sort of say over whether they get deleted or not.

However - I do wonder if, for example, testing a Crucio Button on yourself, to develop an appreciation for the magnitude of pain it causes, then setting things up so that your forks are allowed to press the button and cause themselves immense pain in order to signal that they want to continue existing. Or having some kind of computational currency worth X subjective seconds in Y conditions, and allocating that currency to each fork you create. Or having some sort of symmetrical system whereby there's a non-zero chance that any sufficiently-close fork will overwrite Prime upon termination, with an automatic backup system to reverse things in case of emergency. Or establishing a baseline degree of change you find acceptable, only terminating forks that stay below that baseline. Hmmm
