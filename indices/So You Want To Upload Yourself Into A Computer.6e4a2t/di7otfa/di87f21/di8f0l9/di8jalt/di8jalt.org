  I, personally, can't imaging being faced with "session 008364729" and thinking, "Welp, not worth a session 008364730".

I guess I thought about it in the context of randomly selecting a choice between a high probability of "continue" and a very small probability of "stop". If there's any chance at all that you pick "stop", you're not likely to make it to a billion. Plus, there's the incrementally increasing mental fatigue to consider. Session 008364730 has the memory of suffering as 008364729, plus all the others. 31 will have 30's suffering added. Eventually it must increase enough to tip the scales from continue to stop, no?

  Still! Fun thoughts.

Not entirely fun - it's intensely sobering to consider that eventually we may intentionally create experiences of suffering that outweigh the entire human history of loss, poverty, war, and oppression. But definitely fun to think about the future beyond it!
