I'm pretty sure most people will drop off after 2, and then powers of 10 - but I'd bet on 90%+ of STOPs occurring at 2. It's not like you went "ah, one more turn..." a billion times, the you that you're currently would just do it the once.

I, personally, can't imaging being faced with "session 008364729" and thinking, "Welp, not worth a session 008364730". Part of this is the sunk cost fallacy. A more important part is that, presumably, 8364728 me's made the same decision. It's excessively unlikely that the 8364729th instance would behave differently than the first.

Still! Fun thoughts.
