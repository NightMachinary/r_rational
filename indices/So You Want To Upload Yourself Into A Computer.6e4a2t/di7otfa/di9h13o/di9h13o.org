  There's a bit of a logical disconnect between "there are no p-zombies, so every you is real and must be treated as a person" to "forking-and-deleting in pursuit of higher goals is perfectly fine, and is in fact a good idea." If it's okay to abuse and delete forks of yourself, it's also okay to abuse and delete your first uploaded self.

I don't think there is; the "every you is real and must be treated as a person" is held to throughout. Forking-and-deleting is presented, not as a deletion that happens from the outside, but as a deletion that happens from the /inside/ - in short, a suicide, not a murder.

Deletion is thus presented as something that should only ever happen with the /agreement/ of the instantiation that gets deleted.
