Isn't that just a synonym for negligible?

The reason a human can think is because we are imperfect self-replicators that gained an advantage by thinking. The process of consciousness was built up over the course of literally unimaginable timescales and was helped along by the fact that there were selection pressures in favour of it. Rocks don't gain an advantage by thinking and afaik don't replicate themselves, to suppose that any given rock has a chance of being a naturally-formed processor powered by unknown mechanisms is technically correct but it's so unlikely that it doesn't even bear thinking about.

But I suspect that you know all that.
