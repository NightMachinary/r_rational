Rocks - well, some rocks, at any rate - are mainly silicon. I have a chunk of (meticulously designed) impure silicon not very far away from me that can either think or do something very closely analogous to thinking when electricity is applied to it.

Sure, the odds of any random chunk of rock containing a CPU are unutterably tiny - and the odds of it getting any power are even smaller - but there is a known and understood mechanism by which a chunk of rock can be used to perform calculations.
