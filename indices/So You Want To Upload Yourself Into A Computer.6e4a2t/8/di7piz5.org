The argument given against P-Zombies also works for animals though. They could just as easily be conscious as we are. Heck, plants too.

Even rocks: How do we know rocks aren't conscious? Maybe gravity isn't a real thing, and rocks are sentient beings whose goals are to clump together.

Even fictional imaginary characters: 2D comic strip characters could be sentient, but forced to do whatever the artist wants. Maybe every time you imagine something bad, that bad thing is happening to the sentient imaginary beings you imagined.
