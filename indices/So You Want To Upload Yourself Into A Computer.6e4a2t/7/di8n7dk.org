Second criticism:

Why bother imbuing a "fork" that you intend only to complete a specific task with your personality?

To be honest my personality is shit at completing tasks, in an absolute sense. I may be more capable than many humans, but I'm in the bottom percentile of intelligent agents when it comes to completing specific tasks. If I'm going to fork, why not specialize? Why not enhance a fork to be smarter, faster, more focused, single minded even?

And once you are going that far, why give them personality and the simulcrum of consciousness /at all/? This gets at the core contradictions behind "uploading."

If the purpose is to get stuff done, it's wildly inefficient to add baggage like personality and character flaws. The only reason to upload is out of some sense of sentimentalism. You want to make a snapshot of yourself you can send into the future, not because it will be useful to anyone there, but because you want to persist -- while at the same time admitting that this projection isn't you.
