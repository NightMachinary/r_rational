I really want people to start at the beginning so they understand the context and have some investment in the characters beforehand, otherwise it's just a really weird situation where a bunch of crazy stuff happens without explanation. The early pages are just strips so it's a pretty brisk read even if not all the jokes are funny and the setting doesn't make a whole lot of sense at first. InfernoVulpix explained it in more detail.
