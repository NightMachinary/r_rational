I adore the Bobiverse books, but I see a lot of people get turned off because the author takes the hammer to the knees of a lot of stupid shit, like religion and theocracy, with gusto.

For me, it's a plus, but if you're the sort of person to either cherish their fantasies or become offended on behalf of others, fair warning.

Bob and religion do not mix well.
