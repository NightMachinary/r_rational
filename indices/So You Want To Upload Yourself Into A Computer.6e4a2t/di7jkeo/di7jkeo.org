The only story I've ever read that dealt with what's it like to have your consciousness permanently duplicated is the webcomic [[http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=1][El Goonish Shive]]. The copy is a physical clone created by magic, but it's still relevant to exploring this sci-fi concept and both individuals go through some excellent character development as they explore their own identities.

The relevant story arc starts on [[http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=180][page 180]], which is where the comic starts getting really good, though without knowledge of earlier continuity several things will confuse you. If you try the early pages and don't like them, don't worry. Literally every single stupid plot point and dumb character decision gets retconned into rationality.
