100% agree. You're the first person I've met who is also a fan of this comic, which makes me happy since it's one of my favorite stories ever and has had a big impact on me over the years. I picked it up at a time when I was unsure what kind of person I was and what kind of life I was going to live, and this story about teenagers making intelligent decisions and discovering their own identities reassured me that I could /do it/.

As someone who didn't intuitively understand emotions, including my own, it was incredibly fulfilling and formative to see characters intellectually analyze themselves and succeed at self-actualization. It also ended up being my introduction to a lot of LGBT concepts I didn't /get/ before. One of the characters has as arc about finding out they're gay, and it managed to make me feel like I was in their shoes despite having no doubt about my own sexuality at the time.

The characters also react to the supernatural in a really interesting way. Everyone, including background extras, treat the supernatural like any other part of the world they don't understand and don't usually care all that much when it isn't a big part of their lives. The Men in Black are actually pretty easygoing and have logical reasons for it, while still taking danger seriously and wanting to help people.

When serious danger does present itself, though, the comic almost becomes a deconstruction of teens fighting the supernatural. These events have a lasting impact on their lives for better and worse, their skills and resolve are always put to the test, and even then they still need help from outside forces because they aren't that powerful or experienced. They don't even look for trouble, just fight back when it comes for them.

Not that this is a dark story, much of it is meant to be comedic even though the context is rational. Painted Black definitely has some very dangerous situations and a villain who's realistically psychotic, but no one has anything like PTSD and many story arcs focus on the characters living relatively mundane lives. It's not an action adventure or slice of life, just good characters going through good development.

I should acknowledge some of the comic's flaws, though. The author's understanding of gender identity and sexual orientation have improved over time so there is some unintentional misrepresentation, but it has been justified in-universe as the characters improving their own understanding with time. Also, despite characters using transformation magic to change gender, transpeople have only recently appeared in the story.

While I think the story is really about the character development and the setting is one of the most rational urban fantasies I've seen (after retconning some early stuff), the myth arc is very slow and convoluted. The author will introduce new plot threads only to drop them and pick them back up years later, only to use their resolution to lay the groundwork for future story arcs that won't be resolved until years later.

The author has also admitted that individual story arcs tend to take longer than he intended since he keeps adding in scenes as he goes. Slow pacing is very common in the webcomics I've read and the plot is nowhere near as overcomplicated as Sluggy Freelance or Schlock Mercenary, but I still recommend reading the author's commentary when you're confused and you will get confused at least a few times.
