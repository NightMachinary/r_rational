David Brin's /Kiln People/ explores the idea quite well I think. It doesn't strictly speaking deal with "uploads" but it's about a world where copying your mind into what are effectively short-lived golems is commonplace. Not a particularly philosophical piece, but it plays enough with the premise to provoke a lot of thought.

:edit: Well, none of the copies are permanent, so not quite the same thing, but given that high-quality copies tend to live with the expectation of reintegration at the end of their lives, very similar situations arise.
