EGS is still worth reading since it examines this idea in the context of people living relatively mundane lives. It's not just about the sci-fi concept, it explores the people effected by the event and how they adapt to such a situation in order to live happy and fulfilling lives.

Not only does the clone have to go through the initial shock and trauma of their creation only to later accept that they're a different person than the one they share memories with, but we see them struggle with that idea as time goes on and figure out just what the relationship between the two of them is.

Personally, it's among the most emotionally invested I've ever been in a story. Introducing the characters before the event as regular characters and then showing them develop naturally during and after the event is...I can't think of a word to describe how impactful it was on me.
