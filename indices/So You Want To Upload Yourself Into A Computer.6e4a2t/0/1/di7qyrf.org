El Goonish Shive really had to work hard to make everything introduced early on as gag humour fit into the world coherently, but I do think the author's done a quite good job of it.

In broad strokes, the story starts off as gag humour with frequent plotholes, including in the above clone situation, but soon enough the story enters a surprisingly dark plotline that, while still including many of the attributes of the early strips, show an intent from the author to take the comic more seriously. After that arc ends, the author kept the intent to take the comic seriously but steered it back to the less grim atmosphere it had before, which I feel is the best of both worlds.

From that point on, I can attest that El Goonish Shive has done a very good job of keeping track of an interconnected world and tying together past and future events even for the plot arcs of lesser importance, though there are some pieces of foreshadowing from the early days which have gone unaddressed for a long period of time because the now coherent overall plot isn't ready for the follow-through yet. Transformation is one of the most frequently seen uses of magic in the story, letting the comic thoroughly examine the associated topics, as well as the broader scope topics related to magic in the modern world such as what extent it should be spread around. The comic's been going for over fifteen years with a quite consistent update schedule of three times weekly and I've quite enjoyed the story, especially once the gag humour from the beginning began to be addressed and the plotlines became more thought out.
