That's why I called Patternism an "advanced technique".

In my experience, it took years of playing with the concept to come around to it. And I obviously still haven't tested it in practice.

As far as I can tell, the key is to /identify yourself with the pattern itself/. For a simple System 1 proxy, you can just identify yourself with the surviving copy.
