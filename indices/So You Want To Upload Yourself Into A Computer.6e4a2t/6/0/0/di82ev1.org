I guess that's true, there were people out there who have sacrificed their lives for others so I know that the mindset is humanly possible. I think it would require a type of mental discipline I don't have to deliberately set out to create a situation for myself wherein I would kill myself after completion of a task. Even if I pre-committed to kill myself I would almost definitely start rationalizing reasons to stay alive just a bit more and so on.
