I don't think you can say that the number of "you" goes up to two that would require for me to believe that "I" am a constant and that I don't change subtly from instant to instant, I don't believe I am the same person I was a second ago if that were true then I couldn't have memory or growth or thought at all! All that happens is that there are now two people based on past-me.

If I fork myself (pun not intended but hilarious nonetheless) I make another person and it would be unreasonable of me to expect that new person not to be self-interested and even to choose to die for "original" me.

The text makes a good point about p-zombies though, I have been warned from over-using the word "emergence" but I think that the process of consciousness could just as easily happen in a brain as in a sufficiently detailed emulation of a brain.
