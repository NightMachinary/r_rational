Given your premise of sleep being a non-interruption, I should like to mention a third scenario that might be acceptable- gradual uploading.

You are put to sleep. In one moment, a suitable neuron, not firing at the moment, is replaced with wires to a computer that emulates it. Next, an adjacent neuron is replaced with wires to the same computer. Of course, one of the second neuron's synapses went to a wire replacing the first neuron. Since this synapse is also replaced with a computer-wire, it can be replaced altogether with the computer internally simulating this connection.

The process is repeated for all neurons, all of which are replaced so that cognition is not interfered with. Would this qualify?
