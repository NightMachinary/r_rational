I don't really understand why people are so hung up on continuity in any case. Surely future-me and past-me are the closest people to me to feel empathy and sympathy towards right? They are my closest friends and I want them to be happy so present-me acts in such a way that past-me would be proud of me and future-me benefits. This perspective even explains why people plan for the short term instead of long-term, because soon-me is closer to present-me than later-me so present-me acts to benefit soon-me more than later-me.
