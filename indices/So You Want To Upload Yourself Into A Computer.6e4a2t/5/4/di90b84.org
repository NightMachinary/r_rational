  and for gods sake if someone posts that sleep is also a discontinuity, it fucking isn't. You can re-enable memory transcription during sleep by blocking the breakdown of acetylcholine. I can't recommend the experience, but it's certainly a form of conciousness. Just one that doesn't get transcrbed to LTS.

Thank you. I also am really tired of seeing that response.

It's especially vexing since I've long since become proficient with lucid dreaming and trained my mind to recall most dreams (at least long enough to put pen to paper), and am working on recalling the transition of wake/sleep on a consistent basis.

Your mind and consciousness is just as active, if not more so, during sleep and dream cycles.
