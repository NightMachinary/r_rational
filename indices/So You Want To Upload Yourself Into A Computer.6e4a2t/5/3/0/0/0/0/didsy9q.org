I think the most likely sequence of events that would make me change my opinion would be if quantum events had a significant influence on the consciousness computation. Right now I suspect that most sub-cellular events aren't a part of the computation, and that any effect they do have is just noise, like drugs or other things that aren't part of the computation itself. If it was ever definitively proven that quantum events that are hard to compute were a significant part of consciousness, I would adopt a much more conservative outlook.
