Oh, I don't think any of the things that bother me should necessarily bother you. Since identity is arbitrarily defineable, it's perfectly valid for two rational people with the same evidence to disagree over it. But you seem to believe that you don't have a concept of identity. You do. Your concept of identity is "two minds with the same behaviour share identity".

Of course, so long as upload-you isn't made with the total set of all information contained within your brain plus a substrate that allows that information to evolve as it would have in nature, the fact of the matter is that your upload will never exhibit /exactly/ the same behaviour as you, because of imperfections in the simulation. The problem with wavefunctions is that you never quite know where the electron is, so any simulation that /does/ know that information automatically fails to be 1:1.

Of course, that's still fine. It's "you enough" to require you as part of it's stochastic history.

In /this/ universe.

What I am primarily concerned with is ensuring that I don't accidentally kill myself. You know, in the 1920s, everyone thought radiation was the bees knees, and they owned these things called Radithors that hyper-irradiated their drinking water. They subsequently died horribly for having the temerity to do something they thought would enhance their survival. Ignorance and faulty assumptions can kill; my notions of identity were designed primarily to be the strongest possible criteria for an uploading technology. Any tech that preserves my notions? Cannot kill me, even if those notions are wrong and even classical brain-structure scans are sufficient.

Your standard does not have that property. And that's all right; but it's not something I can bring myself to embrace.
