  First of all, there are two senses of "me" I believe in. The first is the "me in the moment". The second is the global me. The me in the moment is merely the agent experiencing that moment from my perspective. The global me is defined as the agents generated by iterating from a specific locus in configuration space. Most uploading violates the causal identity by introducing a discontinuity

I think that's where you diverge from the transhumanist-uploader perspective. I say in response to that: Okay, that's a definition of self. But what makes that definition matter at all? It seems like humans have an intuitive conception of identity, and your definition sounds like an attempt to make that intuitive definition more internally consistent. But another way to think of identity is that the identity intuition is just bullshit. It's an ad-hoc amalgam of concepts that don't have any real grounding. An illusion. Why should I care about a causal continuity? In fact, of course there's going to be a causal continuity in some way; it's not like another piece of matter just happened to form into the shape of my brain. It's just a question of how tenuous the strands of continuity are. So why should strenuous strands bother me at all?

If there are two processes (minds) that exhibit the exact same behavior, then asking if those processes are different in some way is a nonsensical question. As well ask if the "two-ness" is ontologically different when it applies to two electrons or two quarks.
