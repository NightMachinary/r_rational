Well, I kinda agree with you there. I just think you have to find some smaller time-slice to "pause" at /once the patient is already asleep/. Or rather, putting the patient to sleep (or under strong anesthesia) probably helps slow activity to the point where we can "cut at the gap" between discrete slices of brain activity, but it's only very likely necessary, not sufficient.

With none of this applying if you die and get preserved, of course. In that case, maybe you're a "different person" in a philosophical sense, but holy shit, count yourself lucky even for that.
