  Now, under that same theory, the brain makes discrete updates to a continuous model of the world based on a message-passing algorithm of some sort. We then have the interesting question: can you "pause" the brain between such updates, or slow them down sufficiently to then pause it, scan and upload the brain, wire it to its new embodiment (to prevent sensory deprivation and the resulting psychosis), and then restart it?

I mean, to my knowledge the "standard plan" is "freeze the brain, then cut it into slices to scan".

I don't want to do any of this "while the subject is asleep"; the point of the sleep analogy is that there /is no/ continuity that matters.
