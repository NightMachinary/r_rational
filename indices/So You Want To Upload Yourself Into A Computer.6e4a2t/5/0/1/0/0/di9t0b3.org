  That the mechanism of the brain keeps operating during sleep does not mean that it does not represent an interruption in consciousness. Even the fact that you can force it to record memories does not argue against that.

So first of all, are we talking non-REM sleep in which dreams can't happen? We remember /some/ dreams, so we know we're experiencing /something/ during that period.

  Hell, I don't see how you can call it continuous if it doesn't record memories - what exactly is it that continues, here?

Depends how we think the brain works. Under the best theories I know of (textbook I've got, printed 2017), the brain performs a kind of model regularization during sleep, compressing and smoothing-over experiences from during the day. As part of REM sleep, the brain more-or-less samples randomized top-down predictions (of the kind which seem to induce a perception-experience).

Now, under that same theory, the brain makes discrete updates to a continuous model of the world based on a message-passing algorithm of some sort. We then have the interesting question: can you "pause" the brain /between/ such updates, or slow them down sufficiently to then pause it, scan and upload the brain, wire it to its new embodiment (to prevent sensory deprivation and the resulting psychosis), and /then/ restart it?

Mind, that's going to cause a /fuckton/ of disorientation from the uploadee's point of view: your brain /never/ predicts on any experiential level that its own embodiment will radically change. It just has no data on /what that's like/ in terms of sensorimotor signals. Probably a really disturbing way to go.

Then the question would be: can you "smooth over" the experience by re-wiring the top-down predictions discontinuously, while you're not running the brain, to accommodate the new embodiment? That is, can you rewrite someone's sensory expectancies and body-ownership maps /in vitro/, re-embody them, and thus have them experience no sensory /overload/ from their new body?

And then you'll probably want to do all this incredibly extensive neurosurgery while someone is asleep (or dead and preserved), just to make the subjective experience of the whole thing as comfortable as possible.

Good luck, /heretic/.
