I'll totally use that line. That the mechanism of the brain keeps operating during sleep does not mean that it does not represent an interruption in consciousness. Even the fact that you can force it to record memories does not argue against that. Hell, I don't see how you can call it continuous if it doesn't record memories - what exactly is it that continues, here?
