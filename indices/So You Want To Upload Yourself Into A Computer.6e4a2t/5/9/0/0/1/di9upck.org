  Is there a case where a patient has suffered a loss of this feeling of consciousness? I believe so. Though the case in question escapes my Googling at the moment, there is one significant one where a rather religious man sometime in the late 1800's, early 1900's, suffered a brain injury either from trauma or stroke.

Blindsight would be a much better example. Someone might subjectively report that they have no soul, but then the interesting question is whether they're actually part p-zombie: whether information processing takes place in the absence of a subjectively reported experience.

  (Compare: people assigning undue weight to the "redness" of red. It's just the way your brain interprets sensory information; an artifact of architecture.)

That more or less completely fails to explain the quale of red. We know that the brain forms the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space]["color space"]] it does because that's a good map of the territory of signals sent by our eyes. We also know that such a space can easily be invariant under certain transformations. So why do I perceive red as I do, rather than another point in the space which, under some transformation, could wind up in place of red?

The theory of inverse graphics also says that I perceive a red /material/ rather than just "pixel values", which does explain why I perceive the color and the object as separate from just transforming bottom-up data. This still doesn't really explain why red looks like red, rather than there being no experience associated with a top-down prediction of a red material under active inference when factoring in body movements.

The qualia problem is slowly eroding under ongoing investigation, but it's by no means done yet.
