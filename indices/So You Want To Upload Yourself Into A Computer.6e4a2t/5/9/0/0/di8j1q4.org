Yudkowsky has a pretty interesting philosophical technique wherein you consider a philosophical quandry like "do humans have free will" not from a "yes/no" perspective but from a "why do we even debate this" perspective.

For the problem of free will, Yudkowsky's proposed solution isn't to say either "yes" or "no," but to /accurately define/ free will in terms of /psychology./

Essentially, he proposes that the ineffable feeling of free-will-ness is caused by the subjective experience of your brain evaluating the feasibility of various plans of action. In particular the feeling of "I could if I wanted to" happens when you consider actions of negligible effort, like basic motor actions. This, Yudkowsky argues is where the /feeling/ of free will comes from; not from whether human cognition is nondeterministic or not.

Conclusion: be careful with the 'big questions' of philosophy, since they often orginally arose from intuition, and intuition is informed by feeling and sensation. Consider whether you're actually arguing about something unrelated to the sensation in question.

So, let's apply it to the concept of consciousness. Lots of people argue about it, and find it interesting. Why? It must be because many, many, /many/ people /feel/ that they are conscious.

Interesting. That must mean it's a process in the brain, and potentially something that could be impeded by brain damage. As it happens there are cases in which people lose their feeling of "being able to do anything" i.e. their "free will" due to illness or brain damage. It's called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboulia][Aboulia]].

Is there a case where a patient has suffered a loss of this feeling of consciousness? I believe so. Though the case in question escapes my Googling at the moment, there is one significant one where a rather religious man sometime in the late 1800's, early 1900's, suffered a brain injury either from trauma or stroke.

Subsequently, this man claimed that his soul had departed from his body, quite vehemently so. He went on to compose several beautiful psalms, and subsequently died of malnutrition due to his disregard for his claimed "lack of a soul."

This I believe is at least weak evidence, and at best strongly suggestive, that "consciousness" is a feeling, namely the background sensory modality our brain assigns to having a continuous internal narrative.

(Why we have /that/ is a different bag of works.)

So... Are uploads conscious? Mu. Do they have the feeling of being conscious due to some part of their brain sensing the presence of a continuous internal narrative? Quite probably.

You are not "conscious" because consciousness is more or less an empty term. You do, however /experience/ consciousness, and that may or may not prompt you to argue about ethics of uploads on the internet because you assign undue weight to the feeling of consciousness. (Compare: people assigning undue weight to the "redness" of red. It's just the way your brain interprets sensory information; an artifact of architecture.)
