  "There's a little bundle of neurons in your brain that makes you feel that way, as a way to summarize the gestalt state of having a working brain in an easy-to-reason about manner or something like that. It was probably put there by evolution so you have an easier time introspecting about your own preferences or similar."

That is not an explanation. It doesn't predict anything, offers no experiments to be done, and doesn't allow for controlling or manipulating the presence/absence of consciousness.

If you really understand consciousness in a scientific way, you should be able, via your accurate theory, to turn people into p-zombies and nonperson cognitive processes (primitive nonconscious AIs) into conscious persons.
