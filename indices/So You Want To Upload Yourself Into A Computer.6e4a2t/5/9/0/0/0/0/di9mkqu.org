I'm saying that essentially you can see the sensation of consciousness on a really accurate fMRI if you know where to look, and you could lobotomize it out of people if you were a less-than-ethical neurosurgeon.

The P-Zombie thought experiment is horseshit. Either you can have a materialist theory of mind or you can have P-Zombies. You cannot possibly have both. I've tried twice to enumerate the problems of reconciling both and I can't even come up with a consistent set of base principles.

My solution that there is a sensation of consciousness and no deeper meaning satisfies a /lot/ of constraints:

- It is mechanistic and materialistic (sits in the brain, computed by neurological pathways, obeys the laws of thermodynamics, obeys the laws of information theory.)
- It is evolutionarily plausible (lazy summary of facts in the form of sensation, easy to reason about on a day-to-day basis.)
- It explains why philosophers have yet to arrive at a consensus (they are arguing about empty referents.)
- It provides actionable answers to questions about uploaded consciousness (uploads are ethically persons and should be given rights.)
- It is self-consistent.
- Hopefully it also leaves you less confused.

Consider:

  "What is consciousness? Why am I conscious?"

  "There's a little bundle of neurons in your brain that makes you feel that way, as a way to summarize the gestalt state of having a working brain in an easy-to-reason about manner or something like that. It was probably put there by evolution so you have an easier time introspecting about your own preferences or similar."

  "But it feels like there ought to be more to it!"

  "That's your temporal lobe speaking. Can I interest you in organized religion and body-mind dualism?"

  "But I'm an atheist and materialist!"

  "Just because we know how a rainbow appears doesn't make it less beautiful."

Did you know that humans actually don't have souls, but in the process of scanning a human brain and uploading it into a computer simulation, a soul spontaneously forms in the upload's Pineal gland?
