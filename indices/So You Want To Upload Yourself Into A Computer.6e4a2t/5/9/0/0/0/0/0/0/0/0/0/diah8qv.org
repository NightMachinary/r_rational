  I have a buddy studying TNS/CCS at MIT.

Could you introduce me? I need some major advice on how to get into those programs, having been out of academia a while and lacking an undergrad from their BCS department.

  An AI could have whatever algorithms like... Fast approximate inverse kinematics, and vast neural nets to do sensorymotor effects, and those are fundamentally different from what human brains do!

I quite realize!

  It achieves the same results, sure,
#+end_quote

Currently AI algorithms and models are /vastly inferior/ to what the human brain can do. I'd love to see today's "deep learning" AI designers try to work their way /down/ to using predictive coding, variational inference, and a few pounds of soggy meat to do perceptual inference, active inference, precision-based attention, and motivated behavior in an general embodiment with its own passive dynamics!

  my core thesis is "Consciousness is what some neural algorithm of the human mind feels like from the inside."
#+end_quote

/Some/ neural algorithm, /probably/. It might also be some function of the embodiment deal. Or a perception-versus-action thing. What's interesting is: /what sort/ of algorithm constitutes conscious experience, what is it /necessary/ for, and how does that /differ/ from the rest of the space of ways in which artificial prediction and action agents can be constructed and embodied?

  It can be a fundamentally different system which is still Sapient-level intelligent.
#+end_quote

"Sapient-level intelligent" is an non-quantitative benchmark. It might be better to say, "achieves a human-level benchmark result on predicting its sensory signals." I agree that you could have an AI that ran on different algorithms than our brain does, and achieves better scores at benchmarks for real-time perception and action tasks. Even if something like the free-energy theory or rational-analysis paradigm are correct (which I certainly hope, since I /like/ having normative principles for cognition) at Marr's computational level of analysis, there could be dramatic differences at the algorithmic and implementation levels.

  I don't understand how P-Zombies relate to uploads in most ordinary people's heads.

People have bad intuitions.
