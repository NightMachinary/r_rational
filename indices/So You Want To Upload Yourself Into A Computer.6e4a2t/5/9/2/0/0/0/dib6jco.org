Well, in the short term, sure.

Given a gene mutation which confers a fitness advantage factor of 1 + r, the probability that it will become universal in a sexual population is 1 + 2r (the value of r is very small in almost all cases, and this is a first approximation; it mispredicts for large r in simulations.)

Hence, if a mutation has epsilon fitness benefit, it never becomes universal.

Sensation-of-Consciousness is universal in the sexual population of humans, hence it had positive fitness benefit in our evolutionary ancestry.
