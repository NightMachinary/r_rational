Bleh. Scott Aaronson forgets the manner in which human beings came about. Even if "consciousness" (which I will from now on refuse to ever not put in scare quotes) does amplify microscopic degrees of freedom, it has to do so because Evolution built it so; which means this process must be /highly/ repeatable.

And I really do mean that. It must be beneificial from an evolutionary standpoint and /highly/ repeatable to even arise within the human brain. And also there must be some process which in this amplification differentiates microscopic degrees of freedom from the not insignificant thermal noise at 37 degrees centigrade.

Human brains are not perfect quantum computers. They are messy, hot, slow, and made of emergently grown gloop specified in a data compression format that is A) incomprehensible and B) dependent on environmental factors, and is designed literally by the stupidest system that isn't random chance.

Evolution builds simple systems out of poor building blocks. Like associative socially-argumentative reasoners, and arithmetic. Not devices that almost but not quite breaks the information-theoretical formulation of thermodynamics.

Pull the other one, it posits that the soul sits in the pineal gland.
