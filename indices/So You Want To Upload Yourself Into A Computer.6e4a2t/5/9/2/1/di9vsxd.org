  "this suggests, to be conscious, a physical entity would have to do more than carry out the right sorts of computations. It would have to, as it were, fully participate in the thermodynamic arrow of time: that is, repeatedly take microscopic degrees of freedom that have been unmeasured and unrecorded since the very early universe, and amplify them to macroscopic scale. [...] Such a being also couldn't be instantiated by a lookup table, or by passing slips of paper around, etc."

Cognition /does/ fully participate in the thermodynamic arrow of time. That's entailed by embodied-cognition and predictive-mind theories. It doesn't merely compute in the symbolic sense, it /infers/, and that inference requires taking in low-entropy sense-data and outputting waste heat in the blood.

It's an engine, not a passive object. Maybe you could temporarily stop the engine and transplant it to some other car, but you couldn't yank it out in the middle of the highway without stuff going severely wrong.
