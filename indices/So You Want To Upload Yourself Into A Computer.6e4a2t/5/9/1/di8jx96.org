Did I not /already/ sufficiently define it?

Conciousness: The result of physical law operating on a specific structure of matter. I tacitly assume that the structure is the entire brain because this seems to me to require less assumptions than any theory of a specific mechanism. If you want a more specific definition, you won't find one from me because I don't believe that any more specific definition is warranted, except perhaps "maybe the claustrum is important", given electrostimulation of said region *seems* to shut concioussness off.

The "seems" is important, since, experimentally, there's no effective way (at present!) to determine the difference between lack of any conciousness, and concioussness segregated across submodules, all modules cut off from global influence and memory transcription of any kind. Personally, I believe the latter case is more likely.

Defining conciousness as a feeling still leaves open the question of why feelings are experienced. In fact, it's one of those weird definitions that cuts a term in half, gives one half the same word as before but a meaning that escapes the thing meant by most users, and and the other half a different word from what users of the old term would expect, but means the majority of what they wish to express.

I don't think that defining it in that way is particularly useful.
