  We'd have to try taking out the original, putting in the synthetic one, and then removing that one and replacing it with the original. And we'd have to try it on you.

Why would we have to try it on me specifically? Why not somebody who has had a brain scan before and whose damaged claustrum has placed them in a persistent vegetative state?

But sure, if I was the best or only candidate and the procedure would actually be medically useful (in efficacy, need, and availability), I'd let them try it on me if I thought it was reasonably likely to succeed.

  The question is not whether consciousness is necessary for all aspects of cognition, but which aspects require it, and what the mind can suffice with in its absence.

A lot of sources on the internet equivocate between p-zombie consciousness (i.e. the subjective experience of qualia) and "awake vs. unconscious" consciousness.

I think that being awake is necessary for many aspects of cognition, but I see no reason for this to be a difficult thing to simulate. And in the case of the woman in the link, it seems likely that stimulating the claustrum caused her to lose this form of consciousness.

Notably, she did not appear to be a p-zombie, and I'd be very interested to hear of any research which somehow discovered a portion of the brain that controlled whether or not you were a p-zombie. Given that nobody has yet made any testable predictions for p-zombie status (indeed, the nature of the concept means testable predictions are actually logically impossible), I'm not holding my breath.

My belief is that p-zombies are a meaningless concept. Anything that is able to imitate consciousness is conscious. The inverse is not necessarily true; something could be conscious in a way we are not able to observe (though we'd have no way of knowing).

So I think that if you manage to make an upload which adequately imitates a person, you've just created a consciousness. If it doesn't adequately imitate humans, you may have made a flawed consciousness or no consciousness at all (with no real way of testing which is which).

Concerning ourselves with a concept which we can't actually measure over the ones we can seems utterly pointless.
