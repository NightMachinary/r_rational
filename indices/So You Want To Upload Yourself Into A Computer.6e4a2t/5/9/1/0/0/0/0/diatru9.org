  Why would we have to try it on me specifically? Why not somebody who has had a brain scan before and whose damaged claustrum has placed them in a persistent vegetative state?

Because the return of normal /behavior/ doesn't indicate normal consciousness /until/ we know the causal link between consciousness and behavior. That's what we have to establish by experiment, so we can't actually assume it.

Also, you can't tell other people are conscious by direct evidence ("shallow" inference), just conscious inference ("deep" inference).

  Notably, she did not appear to be a p-zombie

Yeah, that was pretty neat. So that's pretty clear that consciousness is causally related to other functions and even behavior. Epiphenomenal p-zombies really are nonsense, which is nice to know.

  Anything that is able to imitate consciousness is conscious.

I dunno about that. I tend to think that, for instance, a superintelligent AI (or other sufficiently powerful Thingamy) could make a meat-puppet act conscious without its actually having a mind. I mean, we already basically do it with cartoons, right? Or hell, with chatbots. We /know/ ELIZA has no mind in there whatsoever, but people still start attributing feelings and experiences to it based on intuition when they weren't told how the program works.
