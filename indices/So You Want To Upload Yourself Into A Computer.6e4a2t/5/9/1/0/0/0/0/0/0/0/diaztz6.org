True, but isn't the question whether it's possible for things that aren't flesh-and-blood humans to be conscious?

If the AI is sufficiently good at imitating consciousness that we can't tell the difference, its model of consciousness is as good as our own. At that point, if we want to reject it we have to abandon any pretence of having a fair test and just outright say that only flesh-and-blood humans can be conscious.

That's really the crux of my position. If consciousness is testable, anything that passes the test is conscious. If consciousness is not testable, we have no reason to believe that anything is or is not conscious, so why bother?
