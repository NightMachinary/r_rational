  Either consciousness is a necessary precondition for important things like thought, emotion, memory, etc. in which case the presence of any of those things implies consciousness, or it isn't a necessary precondition and we have no particular reason to care.

There is a difference between a conscious being experiencing feelings and emotions and a software no more sentient than an excel sheet just displaying emotions as part of its programming.

I /enjoy/ the feeling of consciousness. Which means my upload would too. Uploading without conclusive, objective, testable, proof that consciousness survives upload would be against my upload's interests, and as such unethical for me to do.
