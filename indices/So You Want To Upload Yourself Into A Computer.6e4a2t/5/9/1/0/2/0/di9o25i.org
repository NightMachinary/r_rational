  There is a difference between a conscious being experiencing feelings and emotions and a software no more sentient than an excel sheet just displaying emotions as part of its programming.

Right, but how do I know that you're not just a piece of software no more sentient than an excel spreadsheet? How do /you/ know that you aren't?

You can say to yourself, "I think therefore I am." or "I feel conscious.", but so would a program that duplicates your thought processes. Not only could an external observer not differentiate between conscious!you and unconscious!you, neither could either version of you. All you can do is assume that you are conscious, exactly as a p-zombie version of you would (although the latter would somehow behave as if it had this thought process without actually having the thought process).

Consciousness (of the p-zombie sort, not the "awake vs. asleep" sort) has no testable predictions. That's kinda the problem with it. People talk about whether animals are truly conscious or not, as if it would make a difference if they were.

  I enjoy the feeling of consciousness. Which means my upload would too.

If your upload isn't capable of genuinely feeling emotion, what's the problem? Tautologically, it couldn't feel bad about its inability to feel emotion. Why would that be any different than creating any other program?
