  Have you verified your own trillions of simulated chemical reactions against those of you from one microsecond ago, or five minutes ago, or ten years ago?
#+end_quote

Irrelevant. Me today is not an artifical construct made to mimic me yesterday.

#+begin_quote
  It raises the question about why your standards are so much higher for a digital version of yourself.
#+end_quote

Because an artifical version of myself is a difference in kind, not in scale.

  Basically, if you actually need to analyse each individual simulated chemical reaction in order to say that something is not you, that thing is you.

  I get that it's because you want to be sure your upload is a copy of you, but I'd argue that if your upload passes a KilotonDefenestrator version of the Turing test, they're closer to current you than 90% of your past selves. You don't seem worried by the fact that in ten years you'll be a radically different person, yet you're not taking steps to verify that you're not diverging.

I don't care if my copy is an turing-complete entity or not. I want it to have the same scope of capabilities, including emotions and illusion of consciousness, as me. Because I enjoy those things, and it would be unethical to create a sentient copy of me without those things. It would be like intentionally fathering a child with handicaps, while somehow knowing that the child doesn't want those handicaps.

  It'd be like if there was a weather model that had never made a single false prediction over a million years of operation, then you found one line of input that differed by a single bit and said, "Aha! It's not a model of the weather at all, it's modelling something that just happens to be completely indistinguishable from the weather."
#+end_quote

I am not interested in something that is identical to me /to an outside observer/. I want to be sure that my copys /internal/ experience is also identical to my internal experience. Otherwise, from my perspective, it is a failed copy.

#+begin_quote
  TL;DR: If your upload is indistinguishable from present!you in a Turing test scenario, any test sufficient to discover divergence from present!you would also disqualify the vast majority of your past and future selves.

I feel like we are talking about different things. I am a different person than past!me because I have accumulated more memories and experiences, new connections in my brain etc, to have changed opinions and tastes. An upload that, due to the experience of being uploaded, would wildly diverge in taste and opinions, would be an instance of me. No argument there. However, if the uploaded version of me loses the ability to have emotions, or loses the illusion of consciousness, then that is a entirely different order of difference. Comparing the two makes no sense to me.

Blatantly exaggerated to illustrate my point, it is like you are making the argument that since I have grown with one kilo since five years ago, removing one kilo of brain matter would make no difference, and I should be ok with someone doing that to me. Technically, I am 90% KilotonDefenestrator "weight complete", but that only captures one aspect of the changes.
