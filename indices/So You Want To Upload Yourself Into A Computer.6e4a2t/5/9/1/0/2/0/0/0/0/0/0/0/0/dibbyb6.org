  Right, but if you asked your upload and it said "Yeah, I'm definitely conscious.", how would you know if it wasn't?
#+end_quote

That's exactly my point. Until there is a way to verify that I will not upload. Asking an upload is not good enough, because the (by me) desired features are not about how things appear to outside observers.

  And if you do somehow determine that your upload perfectly emulates you without emotions and consciousness, what exactly are emotions and consciousness doing in you that they aren't in your upload?
#+end_quote

An emulation without emotions and consciousness is per definition not a perfect emulation, so it would be of no use to me.

  It would be like if I removed internal combustion from a car engine, yet it still ran like normal. Either the engine didn't need internal combustion to function, or I didn't really remove it.

This is essentially the argument that any object identical to outside observers is identical.

That is, a software that is comprehensibly proven to *not* be conscious, self aware, etc. would be perfectly fine according to you as long as it can fake being those things good enough to fool outside observers.

I enjoy my current existence, illusionay or not, and I want the same for my digital instance.

You want to sell me a car. It looks like a car, and when I ask about it you show me the car moving on a highway, parking, etc. But you won't let me look inside the car. Your argument is that it doesn't matter if the seats are comfortable, or the AC works, because from the outside it clearly is a car, and that is all that matters to other people on the road. As the driver, that's not my main concern.
