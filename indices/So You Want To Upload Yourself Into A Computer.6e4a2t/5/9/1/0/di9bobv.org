The thing that confuses me about your position is your insistence that consciousness is a physical phenomenon.

Take the claustrum for instance. You say the claustrum may be involved, and it does look like it may be. But what if you created a synthetic claustrum, attaching the artificial neurons to the surrounding tissue in exactly the same way as the original?

If that was too much, what if you replaced one neuron, or a small cluster? Clearly the fact that your brain is constantly changing doesn't affect your experience of consciousness, so the phenomenon must be able to tolerate a degree of divergence.

And if you physically simulated the brain, including the claustrum, would that not give rise to a simulated consciousness? If not, why not?

To me, the most telling detail about the deep brain stimulation study (assuming you mean [[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329762-700-consciousness-on-off-switch-discovered-deep-in-brain/#.U7dJq_ldWiV][this one]]) is that when the claustrum was stimulated and the patient lost consciousness, neither she nor any observers believed that she was conscious during that period (the patient didn't even remember it happening).

In fact, had the patient wrongly appeared (to her own perception and that of any observers) to be conscious, nobody would ever have known she wasn't actually conscious. Whether or not consciousness is tied to the appearance of consciousness, we are completely unable to experimentally separate the two.

You might argue that you consciousness implies a loss of memory, but that's not something that has been proven, nor could it be proven in the absence of a coherent, predictive definition. The converse is not true in any case; anterograde amnesiacs are no less conscious despite not forming new long-term memories.

Ultimately, I don't get the point of it. Either consciousness is a necessary precondition for important things like thought, emotion, memory, etc. in which case the presence of any of those things implies consciousness, or it isn't a necessary precondition and we have no particular reason to care.
