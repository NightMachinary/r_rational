Thank you for the hilarious answer.

My fear is that I upload and my copy "just goes through the motions" without actually getting to enjoy anything.

It will say it is happy when asked, but there is no one there to enjoy all the cool stuff it goes out to do. Lights are on, but no one is home. Since the copy is me, and I would be horrified if I wasn't there to enjoy shit, I don't want to risk inflicting that on my copy.

As for actually "moving" my consciousness into a computer, I don't think that is possible. It would have to be me creating a copy much like a father lives on through his children.

I think of myself as a chemical process that it sometimes aware of itself. /Maybe/ replacing a neuron at a time (at the rate that the brain normally adapts to changes) with functionally identical synthetic (hardware) neurons could work. The chemical process (physical really) is maintained and is no more unnatural than losing a few brain cells after a wild weekend.

Destructive upload is off the table, naturally. As is half-brain. One is death and the other is massive brain damage.
