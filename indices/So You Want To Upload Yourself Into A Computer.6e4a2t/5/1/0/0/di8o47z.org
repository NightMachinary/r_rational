I wasn't referring to an specific one just the reality of them in general.

I agree that we don't know hence why I question you making decisions on assumptions that memory means consciousness. That's quite an assumption to make, after all if you're wrong you're being murdered each night and doing nothing about it.

Regarding your last paragraph I completely disagree.

What do I know? I know that when I sleep and when I wake up there is no continual experience. Not even the illusion of such. Ignoring for a minute justnowism and all that kind of stuff. It might as you say be the case that I'm conscious the entire time and simply forget, which to be honest sounds pretty horrifying. Sleep paralysis is never described positively and I can only imagine it being worse during surgery or whatever.

I am not bothered by sleeping, if I die when I go to sleep then it's a form of death I am OK with.

Let's go one further. What if someone destroyed me right now, completely annihilated me. Then after a nanosecond or less I was identically replaced. The universe might have a smallest unit of time in which case that's what's happening every tick or it might be continuous. Either way I don't have the same problem with my identity failing to renew for just one nanosecond and my identity being permanently unable to renew. Like from physical murder.
