So, as I understand your viewpoint, you're saying that if you put on a Magic Helmet that reads your brain state and instantiates that brain-state as software, then that uploaded self isn't you.

Fair enough. I can't argue that.

But, I would like to put forward the proposal that - whether or not it is you - the upload is still a /person/. The upload does not know what it feels like to be a CPU, because the upload is, itself, not a CPU. But the upload /does/ know what it feels like to be software, that merely runs on a CPU. (I guess one could see the upload as your child, with your memories).
