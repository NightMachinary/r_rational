It's a bit more subtle. I define the utility of actions that cause me to die as having disutility equal to the sum of all other values. I can't be certain that easy or low-hanging upload technologies don't kill me. So I pick my notions of identity to reflect that uncertainty from the conservative perspective of "guilty until proven innocent".

I agree that there are excellent moral reasons to treat uploads as people, of course. Even if it turns out that low-hangingtype uploads really aren't concious, it's just /better/ to be guilty of being overpolite to something incapable of being offended as opposed to enslaving ten billion sapients because you thought they couldn't feel.

I don't think, though, that we should just accept that an upload on a non 1:1 substrate is actually concious on principle. Because if not, then uploading people is /at best/ an action that creates highly-detailed records that could be used as the basis of a concious substrate waaaaay down the line. At worst? Cheerful anthropocide.
