  You seem to believe there is some sort of "consciousness organ", or specific part of the brain that makes you able to experience qualia or not.

  This is not supported by Neuroscience or any of our best guesses about the nature of consciousness.

Interesting.

Generally I'd assume that, given some feature of the human mind, that there'd be a set or system of neurons that enables it. Is this not the case with consciousness? Then what exactly does our sense that we are conscious measure?
