a "set or system of neurons" possibly, but this doesn't mean it's a static, identifiable peice that can be cut off from the rest of the brain.

The phenomena of consciousness is necessarily entangled with a slew of functions in the brain and nervous system.

if you believe software can be conscious, then you already accept that consciousness is not a specific physical organ, but a state in a complex network.

Imagine it as a video game running on a computer. Where does the game itself reside? Well, there's game data being recalled from the hard drive, a save file tracking progress, a processor crunching through the code, bits being pulled into and out of memory, a video card processing graphics, a sound card processing audio, the monitor and speakers outputting these, a keyboard and mouse receiving inputs -- all are parts of the experience and identity of the "game", but physically you can't point to any specific bits flipping or electricity running through circuits and say "that's the essence of the game." The game is the sum of all this activity.

you can close the game, and the circuitry stops working, or you can remove components of the computer and it will be unable to run the game, but that doesn't mean that component IS the game.

If you believe software such as this can be conscious, then consciousness cannot be something you can turn on and off without impacting the rest of the system. It IS the system.

I remain skeptical that software can house consciousness (not disbelieving, just skeptical) but I agree with the deeper implication that consciousness is a /property/ of certain matter, not the matter itself. And, by extension, that consciousness is a spectrum, not a binary switch can be turned on and off without impacting the wider system.

I'm curious where you believe consciousness resides -- you've stated that the ability to reason is separate from consciousness, but that senses are somehow tied to it.

What components of the brain are inextricable from consciousness, and which are superfluous in your opinion?
