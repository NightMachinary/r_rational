It depends on what seeing across "space or time" even means. Like - can they see their immediate future? How far ahead can they see their future, if so? How does that gel with their actions taken as a result of their seeing the future changing the future that they would see? If they can see and comprehend and understand every molecule in the entire universe simultaneously throughout all of space and time from now until the eventual heat-death of the universe as the last particles eventually decay into nothing, and also all the possible different futures that could arise from every permutation of their own actions simultaneously, then pretty much every approach one might consider is doomed. The difference between that godlike omniscience and complete apprehension of every future, and the sort of cognition that could plausibly fit inside a single human mind - in short, their limitations - is going to define how you approach this problem.

For example, if the person in question can 'see' exactly but not more than 24 hours into their own future from their own perspective and they couldn't do a [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes/][Black Pill Infinite Future Info Relay thing]], then an attack that would reliably effect them 25+ hours from the attack becoming unstoppable would be an approach that might have merit. If they're doing a Coil-style A/B testing of the future out to infinite time but with limited practical branching points, you have to take a totally different approach.

The second part is what you want in terms of 'defeating' them - do you need them dead? imprisoned and ineffective? merely set back in some way on some goal of theirs? If your terminal value is 'stop their scheme to take over the world', then that's different than if your terminal value is 'have this person actually die'. It also matters if your values in this scenario include any other goals such as your own survival or well-being.
