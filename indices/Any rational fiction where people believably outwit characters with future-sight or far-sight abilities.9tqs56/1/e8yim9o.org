There is a pretty interesting contrast in how this was handled in /Worm/ and /A Practical Guide to Evil/.

In Worm, they had very reliable information about the ways their opponents power worked. Coil used his power to predict the short term outcomes of choices and choose the most beneficial of two options. It allowed him to always know whether to attack or bide his time, when his enemies would attack, ect. So they lay the groundwork very very slowly and very very patiently, working against him in countless subtle ways aimed at depleting or subverting his resources so that by the time the confrontation came his ability wouldn't be relevant as he lacked the resources to act on the information it gave him.

In /A Practical Guide to Evil/, the situation is the opposite. They know very little about their opponent, only that they are called "The Skein of Fate" and that they can "read stories". In order to win against someone who gets to skip as far ahead in the book as he likes before deciding what to do, we got the kind of overly aggressive self mutilating insanity that is the hallmark of plans made by Catherine Foundling.

A series of conditional orders was prepared. If Y has happened then open X kind of thing. Some written down, others stored as sealed memories. Then she had the parties /memories erased/ so that people wouldn't be able to predict their own actions. As conditions were met, orders would be acted upon or memories regained. Then the party separated, so that they would be acting independently and less able to influence each other. The goal was to create as much chaos and as many unpredictable elements as possible. When your opponent knows whatever you plan, throw so many plans at him that he can't keep track. Just overwhelm him with bullshit, set everything on fire and bullrush through.
