tl;dr - Once or twice a day you write down the most important predictions you have, then look at the note that future-self left for you less than 24 hours ahead.

Even if you don't think of that trick, for a poison that takes 48 hours to take effect, you'll start acting differently 24 hours before it takes effect because you'll suddenly know about it, and 24 hours before than you'll notice your reactions to the information, and so on.
