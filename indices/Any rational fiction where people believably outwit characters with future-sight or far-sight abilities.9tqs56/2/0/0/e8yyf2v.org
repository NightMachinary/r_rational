As someone who trains MMA (with a crew of guys who fight amateur), having even a half-second glimpse into the future movements of an opponent would be a /monumental/ advantage. You would know what was a feint and what was a real attack, you would know the angles, you wouldn't be surprised by a trick move, or need to worry about not being quick enough to spot something incoming.

People who fight aren't deciding on their actions at the last moment. There is a lot of thinking happening. You notice someone drops their lead hand after a jab, so you leave a hole in your guard to bait the jab, then slip and hit them with a hard right. That's all premeditated. When you get good, you no longer consciously have to process a lot of things, but you're still thinking and making decisions, you just delegate that thinking to lower levels of your mind.

In Mistborn, the precognition is powerful for combat applications. I think three seconds is more than adequate in a fight between skilled opponents. If there is anything about the scenarios that stretched my suspension of disbelief, it was the way Vin overcame it by not making any decision at all until her opponent was committed to his action. I think the consequence of her strategy should more realistically have been a dead Vin.
