I don't know if that's how I would describe Vin's action, what she does is let her reflexes make an attack without really considering it, thus giving her openent a snapshot of the future in which she makes that attack, but she is also watching for the move he makes in retaliation, using him to read the future, when she see it she changes her action, making two possible futures occur at the same time.

It's worth mentioning that atium is almost like a drug, it makes you feel godly and all powerful (which makes sense as it is technically part of a god), so it leads it's using to overcommit and make mistakes in ways they normally wouldn't simply due to the absolute certainty that their action is correct.

Vin won the fight through playing on this and through no small amount of luck as well.
