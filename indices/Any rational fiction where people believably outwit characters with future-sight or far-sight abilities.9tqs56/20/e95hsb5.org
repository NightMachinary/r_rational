The most central problem with being a precog is that you do not know at which level you are playing against yourself.

You cannot know whether what you saw was you acting out the future, you reacting out against the future, or you reacting against your reaction to the future, etc.

In typical tropes, you see this a lot in all kinds of self-realizing prophecies, where protagonists use foreknowledge to take measures against something bad happening, only to have their actions become part of the bad thing happening.

That is why the better rational precog makes zero assumptions and instead follows gut feelings or some unique absolute objective, rather than act relative to circumstances.
