Fair enough. Wildbow is a lot of things as an author, but hopeful and light are definitely not two of them. From what I have read here on Reddit, there are a surprising number of people who drop it after the first arc or two thinking it's going to be teenage Mary Sue type fiction, but you obvious got far enough in to make an informed decision. It's a great read but it's definitely not for everybody.

i do think that that part of the story is probably the darkest part of the whole thing if that helps. oh, and if the doom and gloom feel isn't doing it for you, don't even both starting Pact.
