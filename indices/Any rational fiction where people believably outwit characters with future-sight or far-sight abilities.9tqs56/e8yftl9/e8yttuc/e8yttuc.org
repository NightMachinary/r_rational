I just found [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/5zfdns/worm_showerthoughts/dexweow/][this comment]] on how the scene you're talking about played out from the POV of the precog. It's fucking horrifying:

That final Coil scene, when he is held down at gunpoint while the Undersiders have a nice long chat about the moral implications of murder and what it means to be a villain?

He tried to escape a hundred times. He grabbed for the gun and got shot. He jumped and got shot. He tried to talk, bluff his way out, and Tattletale told Taylor to shoot him. He crawled and got shot. He ran and got shot. He tried to twist so the bullet only hit his shoulder, but the second bullet got his head. He ran and got shot. He reached for the gun and got shot. He reached for the gun and got shot. He reached for the gun and got shot. One time he managed to disarm Tay Tay and got killed by Grue. He ran the other way and got shot.

Every second he tried something new, he got killed, and he split the timeline again, to try the impossible. Until the bitter end. And nobody knew, not even Tattletale stopped to think about it.
