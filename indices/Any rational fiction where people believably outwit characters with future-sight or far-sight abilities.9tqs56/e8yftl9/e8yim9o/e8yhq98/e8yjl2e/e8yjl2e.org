I always hated the mistborn pregoc. Any half decent sword fighter reacts to their opponents movements faster than a few seconds. It's one thing to dodge arrows or something, but unless the power is somehow fixing the future in place, there's no way a person's actions are fixed 3 seconds from now is basically any fight.
