  I don't see how Atium can have such a fundamental flaw

You mean you expect a power derived from mainlining the body of a dark god bent on the destruction of the world to be a flawless advantage? Ruin would never make things so easy for anyone.

Furthermore, there were already built-in weaknesses to Atium, most notably Electrum. Allomancy is the power of Preservation, so he got to mold how all the other metals worked. Ruin only got Atium and its alloys. Preservation, as usual, cheated and built in ways of circumventing his opponent. It was never a flawless advantage.
