Quote out of context much? The full sentence you are responding to was " I just don't see how Atium can have such a fundamental flaw *and also operate as it does in every other scene*." The meaning of the quoted part completely changes with that omission.

Contrary to your implication, I'm not some Atium fanboy who gets off imagining it to be ridiculously overpowered. I am noting a contradiction in how Atium is portrayed. It is a continuity problem in the magic system from the top magic system author.
