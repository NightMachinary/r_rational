Never read mistborn, but I think I could get behind that strategy if it came as the result of preparation and months of practicing this odd style of fighting (and relying on the fact that the precog relies on their powers too much and isn't a good fighter otherwise). Maybe it still wouldn't be realistic at all, but I would be able to suspend my disbelief as a reader.
