All right, here's an alternative explanation.

Both of them were Ruin agents at that point. Vin had her earring in, what's-his-face was spiked. Ruin had little overt control over Vin, but he could still influence things and plant ideas into her mind.

Therefore, Ruin had ultimate control over who won that fight. Who's he going to save? The Fated Hero, who both Preservation and Ruin held sway over, who Ruin has been plotting to subvert into an agent of destruction for literally a thousand years? Or the madman with daddy issues. trying to tear down all of that work out of jealousy. Vin is just more useful to Ruin, and therefore he ensured she won.
