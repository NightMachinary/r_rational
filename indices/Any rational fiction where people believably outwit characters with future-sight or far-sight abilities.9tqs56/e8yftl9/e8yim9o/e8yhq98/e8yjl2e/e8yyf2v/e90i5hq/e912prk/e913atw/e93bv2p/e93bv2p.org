Since Atium mistings are a late phenomenon in the first Mistborn series, anyone burning Atium would also have access to pewter and tin. Vin's situation was not unique in any way.

Not that this really matters, but your reference to cognitive dissonance misunderstands what it is. Cognitive dissonance is what happens when, on reflection, someone has to reconcile two contradictory beliefs. This psychological phenomenon does not involve being shocked or confused at any level, nor does it imply slowed reaction time. I get what you meant, but you should have just written that he was shocked.

Your point that no one would share this particular trick is valid.

I just don't see how Atium can have such a fundamental flaw and also operate as it does in every other scene. If you're fighting someone, you are reacting to them. I mean, it's not like they were shadow boxing by themselves and a Mistborn happened upon them. Everything their opponents do is predicated on them being there and doing things. This is such a fundamental contradiction that I cannot accept it. Either Atium makes someone capable of predicting the actions of opponents (who are lacking Atium) or they can only predict actions they did not themselves influence, which is pretty useless in a fight.
