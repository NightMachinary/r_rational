It's a while since I read it, but in Mistborn, Atium let's you see a short distance into the future of what your opponent will do.

[[http://mistborn.wikia.com/wiki/Atium]]

If two people burn atium, then both see a sea of possibilities as both their actions change as the other might respond to the changes so it effectively cancels out.

In the book the heroine doesn't plan her moves, but reacts to where her Atium burning opponent is attacking based on seeing she /will/ /be/ thereby making her actions a function of his actions which nullifies his predictions of her actions.

It's clever, and I don't have the passage to hand, but I seem to remember it feeling believable when I read it.
