The classic science fiction short story /Minority Report/ involves this as a major plot element. It's also in the movie but I think the short story, while maybe not being rational in and of itself, would be nevertheless interesting to the sort of people who hang out on [[/r/rational]] as the ending is really neat (and naturally different to the movie's ending).
