I once wrote a fanfic that included a section where the Evil Leaper (from /Quantum Leap/) Leaped into one of the villains - with no sign of Samuel Beckett to counteract her. So, the villain had the advantage of access to news reports and official records of the future (which could only change as a result of her own actions), while the heroes had no future knowledge at all. The heroes were, however, familiar with her capabilities (due to a previous encounter with Dr. Beckett).

So the heroes put in place no less than four separate plans to stop her plans, in different corners of the city. (Fortunately, revealing certain information was enough). Any one of them would easily work if she didn't stop it, and all four were ready to go on the same evening... then they kept an eye on /her/ location, running with whichever plan was /furthest/ from her. The result was that, simply by moving across the city, she stopped whichever plan she was headed towards and triggered a different one in a different part of the city instead... and, future knowledge or not, she couldn't be in four places at once.
