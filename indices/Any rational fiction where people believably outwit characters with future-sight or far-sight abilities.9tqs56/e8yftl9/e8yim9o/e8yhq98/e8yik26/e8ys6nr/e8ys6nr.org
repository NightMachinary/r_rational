I can think of two instances of this in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][Worth the Candle]]. These summaries should be fairly spoiler free:

1. Revision mages can revise actions after the fact --- basically a painful form of precognition. The solution isn't very interesting or long, though. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/27276423][Chapter 33, two thirds of the way down the page.]]
2. Unicorns are not your friends. Unfortunately, they are precogs. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/27684774][Chapter 40.]]
