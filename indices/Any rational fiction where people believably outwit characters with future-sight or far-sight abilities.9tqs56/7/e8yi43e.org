Well, assuming the precog's reflexes aren't similarly enhanced, a straight fight is likely an option. Don't have to do something they can't predict, just do things so quickly that their reflexes can't keep up. Not exactly "outwitting them", though.

This also depends on the exact nature of their powers. If they see from their own perspective, then a sneak attack might work. They'd see their vision go dark ahead of time, but not know where the attack came from. And if you used something where they can't escape in time with however far ahead their precognition is, say, a bomb, you could guarantee their death.

On the opposite end of the scale, if they're omniscient and are intelligent enough to handle all of that information, you're pretty much fucked.
