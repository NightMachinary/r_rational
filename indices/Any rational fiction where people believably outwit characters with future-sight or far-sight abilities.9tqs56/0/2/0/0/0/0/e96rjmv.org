To add another opinion. I have probably read about 80% of Worm. But near the end it was increasingly getting more and more of a drag, and I never managed to finish it.

The thing is just too damn long. It goes on forever. The plots starts to repeat, the characters are stuck without growth. Villain that ought to be killed off are kept around for chapter after long-winded chapter.

The thing is about as long as the entire Wheel of Time series, which most people agree on being waaaay too long. And Wheel of Time has a ton more characters and a ton more things happening along the way.

In Dutch we have a saying: "Schrijven is schrappen", which means something like "Writing is scrapping" (though in Dutch it alliterates). The hard part of writing a story is often not putting the words on paper, but condensing the story into the best possible version of itself. To remove all the fat until you're left with the best possible story.

Wildbow is an imaginative writer, he's clearly very good at creating interesting characters and setting up a good plot. But he needs to learn to write more concisely. Or perhaps he just needs a good editor.

Worm should honestly be at least 75% shorter.
