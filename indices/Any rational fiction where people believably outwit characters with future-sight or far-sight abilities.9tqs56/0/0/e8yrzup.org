Another instance of that happens at the end of Worm.

Scion also has the Path to Victory power, he used his to find a future where he sees his partner again, but when he gets there, he only finds the dead flesh garden left behind by Cauldron.

Also, this hasn't been confirmed by the author, but it makes sense: The defeat of Scion. I am fairly certain Scion could have used his power to escape the mental torment, and in fact, tried to do so. He asked his Path to Victory power for a way to stop the pain. His power extrapolated Scion's mental development, and concluded he would never move on from Eden. So it looked for alternate ways to stop him hurting, and arrived at one simple answer: "Hold still"
