Taylor had a deadman's switch with info about him set up, and she was only going to disarm it after he let her talk to Lisa. That's why he gave up his safe timeline and committed to being there; so he could have one timeline where he didn't let them talk, and another where he allowed it. We don't know what happened in the timeline where he didn't bring Lisa, but I assume details on everything he did and owns was broadcast across the entire US.
