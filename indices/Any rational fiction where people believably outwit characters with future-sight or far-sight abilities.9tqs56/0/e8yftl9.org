There's a sequence around the midpoint of [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][Worm]] that I think fits that description but I'm not sure how to say more without spoilers.

In a more general sense though I'm not sure what "crazy advantage" implies. In general, the best way to believably beat a precog IS having a significant advantage, either in planning the engagement or combat power, otherwise the precog "ought" to win every time.
