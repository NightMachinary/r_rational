I still disagree, she is definitely burning pewter and tin in this scene, both of which would give her a decent boost to her reaction time, not as much of a boost as Atium would, but still a boost, and with her opponents mind overwhelmed with the cognitive dissonance of the impossibility she had just enough luck to win.

I won't say it was 100% skill or would work every time, just that it makes sense that it would in that exact situation with that specific opponent. Vin comments on the possibility of others knowing the trick by saying it isn't the kind of technique a Mistborn would ever share as it would possibly negate their greatest advantage. From more personal conjecture, Mistborn are basically magical super assassins, anyone trying to spread the knowledge would likely find a obsidian knife in their throat.
