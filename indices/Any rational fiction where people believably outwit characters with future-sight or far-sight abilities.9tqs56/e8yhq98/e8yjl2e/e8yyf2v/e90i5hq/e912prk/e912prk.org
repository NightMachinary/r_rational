Given what we know about Atium, human reaction time isn't fast enough for Vin's ploy to ever work. The average human reaction time to visual stimulus is 0.25 seconds. That isn't enough of a time window against an experienced opponent. And if it is enough for some reason . . . well, then this should be a well-known hack for fighting someone burning Atium. It seems to be an example of the "Rule of Cool" being prioritized over the consistency of a magic system.
