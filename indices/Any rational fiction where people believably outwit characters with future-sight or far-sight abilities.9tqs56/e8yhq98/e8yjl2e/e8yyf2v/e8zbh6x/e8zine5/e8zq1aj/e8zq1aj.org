ah well, I still think it could potentially be done in an interesting way! If I were doing it, I would have a bunch of philosophy about humans' inability to generate unbiased random numbers and training methods to overcome that...

also, I think there was something similar in the Fairy Tail anime (which is crap btw). It was a similar thing, the character decides to start making 'random moves' (or 'unplanned moves' or something) on the spot and it just works.
