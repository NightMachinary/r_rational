I can't remember where I read this, but I read a rational/rational-adjacent short story once in a D&D-style universe where the main character stole an artifact letting them see something like 10 minutes into the future. They used the power to steal a ton of other powerful artifacts, but it turned out that the original owner of the precog artifact had anticipated this, and had set up a time-locked vault to seal just after the end of the precognition window.
