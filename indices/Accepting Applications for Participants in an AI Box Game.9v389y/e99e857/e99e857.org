I'd love to play gatekeeper (whereas I don't see myself having any chance as the AI because I'm not terribly persuasive). I'm a biochemistry student in my early 20's.\\
I have never played one of these before, but have read quite possibly the majority of transcripts which can be found online (I did actually see one once where the AI won, but it wasn't terribly satisfying because it seemed like the gatekeeper was a pushover, and parts of the logs were missing).\\
While I don't think superhumanly intelligent AGI can hope to be boxed, I think human level AI quite possibly could (though I don't think you could reliably know whether an AGI was within the safe limits of intelligence) with the right captors.

I've read *all* of /The Sequences/ and read /Superintelligence/.
