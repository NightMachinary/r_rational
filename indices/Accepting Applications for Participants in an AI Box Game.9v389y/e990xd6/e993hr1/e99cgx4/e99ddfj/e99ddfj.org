I'm not sure if that tactic was ever used in the first place. It's something that people proposed as a strategy for Eliezer to have used and I suspect that this never happened in the first place and that Eliezer won the hard way of actually convincing the Gatekeeper to let him out.

Don't worry, I plan on winning the hard way instead of using a metagame tactic like what you mentioned. Besides, I /really/ doubt that my experiment will impact any funding of AI safety research in any way.
