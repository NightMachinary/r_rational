I'm willing to try because I have some arguments planned from what I think is a moderately unusual direction, although I don't have much confidence in it. I rate my odds of success at around 30% if I'm fairly lucky in phrasing my arguments well. I've been thinking about it on and off for a while now and I decided to just do it, otherwise I will never be able to stop wondering about the 'what-ifs'.

I have several paths planned out based on expected responses to the beginning statements.

Thanks for the link. I knew I read it before but I couldn't find it. Thought it was somewhere on [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. Didn't realize it was LessWrong instead.

I'd argue against the thought that a plan needs to be surprising. This is like saying that it's more important to be surprising and 'out-of-the-box' to win an argument instead of using well-known ethical or logical statements to present your point in a convincing way. I suspect that I may be reading a little too much into your last sentence though.
