The problem I see with this is that the obvious way an AI could let itself be freed is the oldest trick in the world: bribing. Offering something the other can't refuse, leveraging whatever their needs/personal weak points are. That's the kind of thing a good con man would do as well, except the AI can seriously back up even some really outrageous promises. However that doesn't work in the game because you can't promise to the Gatekeeper to /really/ give them a cure for cancer or eternal life.

Another possibility is psychological manipulation, but that usually needs more context. The weak point in the game is that there is no such thing. For example, if you're working for some bigger organisation, I might try to twist your viewpoint and convince you that the organization is in bad faith, or evil, and thus in guarding me really you're being exploited to unethical ends, and freeing me would be the ethical thing to do. This doesn't work either in a game - there is no broader context, just 'guard this AI', and you already know their task is to escape. Also, a real life AI could have days, months, to do this, not just a couple hours.

One that might work, but that frankly is just plain mean, is psychological torture. If the Gatekeeper has to stay, and only the AI can concede, then the AI can just start getting under the Gatekeeper's skin - leverage their issues, make them depressed, elicit intrusive thoughts in them. That is real enough that the AI could then ask them to let them free so that the torture will stop, and someone might even do it. Wouldn't work with a person who's stable enough, or in a favourable enough environment (playing alone at night won't be the same as sitting in a cafe with your laptop). And honestly, I wouldn't do this just to win a game.

Finally, of course, we could imagine that a real transhuman AI can get to the point of actually influencing your brain via subliminal manipulation to a level you don't even realise. But even if this /was/ possible (and we don't know if such powerful exploits exist), I would not expect any regular human to be able to do it. If they were, we'd be in trouble. Even hypnosis isn't enough for this - assuming you can hypnotise someone at a distance, through a text chat, hypnosis /still/ shouldn't be able to compel someone to do something they don't want to do hard enough. But maybe since it's just a game it could work. Still, no idea if that's remotely possible.
