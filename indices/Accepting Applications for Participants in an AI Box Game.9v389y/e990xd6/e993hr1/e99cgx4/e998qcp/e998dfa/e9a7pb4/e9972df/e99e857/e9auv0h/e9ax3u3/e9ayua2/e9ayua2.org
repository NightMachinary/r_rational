Well, you got the bare bones of my character+setting proposal. This partially breaks the premise of the game: I'm not making a single decisive release decision, but I would need to do some thinking before coming up with a character that is willing to enter a situation where such a decision can be made. My proposal is trivial to play for me, because I'm basically playing an idealized version of myself (idealized because I can only guess how I would respond to e.g. credible threats of torture).

I'm also up for playing at a different time / date, possibly after your first round if you want to play AI twice.

I would prefer to play before you post results of other games, because I'm bad at observing spoiler tags. I don't think I can reasonably play AI in the setting I proposed.

I could DM as an AI/EM facing a turing tester, though: During hypothetical development of EM technology, you would need to regression test that your emulation did not turn into a hostile AI-like thing; my counterpart would then play a real human lay jury member judging a release-candidate.
