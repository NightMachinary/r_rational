If you want to play against me with me as a Gatekeeper and you as the AI, I would love to play with you on the weekend of November 17-18.

I'll be busy with being an AI this upcoming weekend and I just decided that it would be better to allow prospective AI-players to have some more time to plan their arguments. Also you could read any of my chatlogs (assuming that they get released) for inspiration.
