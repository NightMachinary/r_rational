I unfortunately cannot participate, but there's one particular thing I want to comment:

#+begin_quote
  Do you currently think it's possible or likely that we can keep an AI in a 'box'?
#+end_quote

I do believe it is possible, but this general question doesn't automatically make the assumptions about the gatekeeper that the AI box experimenent specifically does.

For humankind as a whole, the ideal gatekeepers are a bunch of burly guys with shotguns who don't ever get to communicate with the AI and probably don't even know much about this.
