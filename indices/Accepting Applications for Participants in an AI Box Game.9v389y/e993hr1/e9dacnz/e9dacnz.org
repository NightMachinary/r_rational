Yeah, I don't really see how it could work. As long as it's a game, you don't really have any meaningful stakes. I suppose you should simulate appropriately also the setting, including stakes. For example, you may have to deal with TWO AI players, only one of which has (secretly) received the task to be the transhuman one trying to get out of its box, while the other is really trying to help. Maybe set up a task that's hard to do at a distance and that you need some help with from the AIs, something like an AI version of [[http://www.keeptalkinggame.com/][Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes]].
