Looks like you're hurting for AIs, so I'll throw my hat into the ring. I have a few ideas that I find convincing.

I'm a researcher in my mid-20s. I think AI boxing is unlikely to work IRL, though the conditions of the game are obviously a good deal stricter. As elsewhere, arms race considerations make things worse (gotta leverage your AI to beat those Outgroupers!)

I've read a lot of the sequences, and a reasonable amount of other AI safety and AI strategy stuff.
