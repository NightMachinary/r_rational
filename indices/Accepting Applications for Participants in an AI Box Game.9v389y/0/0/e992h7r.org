I plan on posting transcripts, but I don't want to commit ahead of time to doing so. Since the logs will have the thoughts of two people, I'll ask after the game if they are fine with me sharing the logs online. Then it will be posted sometime on Monday with my afterthoughts on the game.

If you really want to play, then when you aren't so busy, you could ask me and I might say yes then.

Also, while I agree the game isn't a useful analogue, its purpose is to demonstrate that if someone with human-level intellect and knowledge can convince another person to open the box, then it can be taken that a superhuman-level intellect should be, at minimum, capable of the same rhetorical feat.
