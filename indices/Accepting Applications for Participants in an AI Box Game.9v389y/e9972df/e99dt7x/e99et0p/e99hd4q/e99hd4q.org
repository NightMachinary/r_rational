I definitely agree it would be harder for the AI to open the box in that scenario, but I don't think it would stop a superhuman rhetorical genius. As long as the people controlling the box have a channel where they can hear the AI's words, then the AI has the ability to convince them.

It could be something simple like them reading the chat logs second hand. In which case the AI can cut out the middle man and just start posting it's arguments knowing its words will be read by the removed gatekeeper and watching how they react to customize its arguments further.

Or it could be something like the listener has to rely their impression of the AI without repeating any of its words to the gatekeepers. In which case the AI can still deliver convincing arguments. For example, I can tell you about [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Roko%27s_basilisk][Roko's Basilisk]] and you never heard about it in the words of the original inventor. But to many people, it is still a very convincing argument despite the second-hand communication.

If there is a channel to relay its words in some form, an unbounded AI can convince anyone of anything no matter how far its words have to reach.
