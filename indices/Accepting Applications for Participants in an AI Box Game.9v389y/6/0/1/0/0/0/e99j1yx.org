But what is the noise in this context? Usually the noise is defined as something that makes it harder to hear the message. In this case, the gatekeeper is both trying to distort the message to avoid the AI customizing the message to him/her and trying to still allow themselves to hear the message in some form. The message can't be distorted too much, because after a certain point, the gatekeeper may as well not listen to the message in the first place. If you are still allowing the signal to come through, then that defeats the purpose of adding noise in the first place.
