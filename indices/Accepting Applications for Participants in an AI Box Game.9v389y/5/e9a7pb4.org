I'd love to play as Gatekeeper and have all weekends free, at any time.

My age âˆˆ [21,24]. Computer science student.

I haven't played before.

I think boxing real AI is a stupid idea for reasons barely related to it getting out. So we can keep it boxed, but it would do us no good.

I have read a lot of Sequences.

Your reason for playing with me (apart from very flexible time) is that not only you can use whatever horrible tactics you can come up with without guilt, but I am also willing to provide you a lot of personal information to dig for weak points (to better simulate AI who had time to collect info about its creators). For years I have been very interested in my ability to resist pressure and manipulation, and your proposal is the safest way to test it, so I am not going to pass it up.
