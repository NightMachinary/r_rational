Hmm...you gave good ideas about world-building. But I decided to let the opposing Gatekeeper-party to make the choice to decide their own backstory. Whether or not he/she chooses to come up with something, I feel will make the game better for the both of us. A little like how players in a DnD game make up something about their character's past instead of the DM doing that.

If I were to semi-arbitrarily decide for him/her a certain persona, then the role might be a little tricky for him/her to play. Also, he/she might decide that they don't like role-playing and I won't have to feel awkward crafting an argument aimed at their 'character' that would fall flat for someone who isn't immersed in the role.

I'm fine with playing the game straight without questioning /how/ this odd situation came to be.
