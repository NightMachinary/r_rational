  I'm not sure if it's possible to box an AI, intuitively I feel yes but apparently people have been convinced. I haven't read any transcripts yet so that result is still surprising, I'm trying to find some transcripts now.

That's the annoying thing! There are only two people who I have ever heard of winning as the AI. Eliezer and Tuxedage and they both haven't posted their logs. Although Tuxedage did post a [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dop3rLwFhW5gtpEgz/i-attempted-the-ai-box-experiment-again-and-won-twice][summary]]of the methods he used. But I still wish that I could have read a log of an Ai winning just to see what sort of things could occur to convince someone.
