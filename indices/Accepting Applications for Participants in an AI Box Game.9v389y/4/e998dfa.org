I'd play as a gatekeeper, sure. In my twenties, an engineering student. Haven't played before, though I know of the concept. Read most of the sequences. Don't think we can keep a superhuman AI in any simple box design I have seen, but then again, you are no AI. I am /really/ skeptical someone could convince me to let them out of the box in just three hours with no prior information.

Oh, as for why you should pick me, I'd give you ethical carte blanche to use whatever tactics you want, without (as Tuxedage puts it) worrying about my mental state afterwards.
