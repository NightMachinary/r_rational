Reddit ate my previous in depth reply (and twice at that). T_T

That said I really appreciate the feedback and would try to address your concerns.

  There are two things that make a conflict interesting: stakes, and the possibility of failure.

  Writing a story where a character is playing a game of solitaire on his computer as a moment to indicate boredom, or preoccupation, or some other character beat, is fine, but I wouldn't want to write a whole story about someone playing a game of solitaire unless there was something more at stake beyond having to press F2 to start a new game if he loses.

  Your story doesn't do anything to establish what's at stake in this tournament. Near the end, there's something about scrutiny, and about notoriety, for having won this round, but not much else. You don't tell us what he's had to go through to get into this tournament; you don't tell us what he stands to win if he succeeds, or lose if he fails. As such, we don't have much investment in whether he wins or loses.

There's a cash prize, a very lucrative job offer (and the connections therein), and because the tournament would be his first debut, his public first impression. I intended to highlight the different stakes over the course of the story, but I agree that I should have made it more explicit in this part.

  As for the latter element of tension... When you showcase the main character's power, whatever tension is in the story (in spite of the stakes being unclear) is lost, as the possibility of failure is thrown out the window. Mercifully (and, honestly, thank you for this: I've read stories that go on and on in endless detail about how a character with no possibility of failure won, and won, and won), you keep the description of the second and third rounds short once it's clear that he will win. Now, maybe there's some limitation to your character's power that you haven't explained yet, but it looks like a guaranteed win against any opponent, which makes it difficult to keep tension, and therefore the reader's interest. Your character is Superman in a boxing ring against a human who has no idea what's about to hit him.

Yeah, there was no real possibility of the MC losing this particular match. Future matches would probably be more interesting, and there may be more tension. That said, the protag would most likely end up winning the tournament (unless I missed something when I was working out how different abilities interact), and his power would look unbeatable to the viewers.

One thing I would do for future matches is to not drag out the match any more than is necessary. Once I've explained and demonstrated the core strategy the MC is using there's really no point in going over the other three battles.

How do you suggest I create tension (or otherwise make the story more interesting/engaging) when the protag's victory is a foregone conclusion?

  In addition, you are putting yourself at a bit of a disadvantage here, as someone posted the rock-paper-scissors manga a couple of weeks back, and that was excellent (especially in terms of what I've described your story as lacking: stakes worth playing for, and giving every character a chance to fail). Posting this now, you're kind of inviting comparison, and, because of the extremely high quality of what you're being compared to, it's not flattering for your story.

Oh, this doesn't hold a candle to that. It's not meant to be another reimagination of that concept. Honestly, this story started from a conversation I had when I was trying to reason around how different abilities interacted with each other (particularly time rewind and true precognition). I found Rock Paper Scissors a convenient vehicle to provide an adversarial framework for reasoning about the interactions of those abilities. Once I had sufficiently worked out how the interactions played out, I decided to write a story about it (I had already created the plot for the final battle in my discussion of said interactions).

So it's more to illustrate something about the setting I have, perhaps enlighten readers on the kinds of strategies one might pursue with timelooping (I intend to eventually turn my story into a quest once I'm done setting the world) and perhaps a little intellectual masturbation (just a little at most).
