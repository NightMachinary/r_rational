There are two things that make a conflict interesting: stakes, and the possibility of failure.

Writing a story where a character is playing a game of solitaire on his computer as a moment to indicate boredom, or preoccupation, or some other character beat, is fine, but I wouldn't want to write a whole story about someone playing a game of solitaire unless there was something more at stake beyond having to press F2 to start a new game if he loses.

Your story doesn't do anything to establish what's at stake in this tournament. Near the end, there's something about scrutiny, and about notoriety, for having won this round, but not much else. You don't tell us what he's had to go through to get into this tournament; you don't tell us what he stands to win if he succeeds, or lose if he fails. As such, we don't have much investment in whether he wins or loses.

As for the latter element of tension... When you showcase the main character's power, whatever tension is in the story (in spite of the stakes being unclear) is lost, as the possibility of failure is thrown out the window. Mercifully (and, honestly, thank you for this: I've read stories that go on and on in endless detail about how a character with no possibility of failure won, and won, and won), you keep the description of the second and third rounds short once it's clear that he will win. Now, maybe there's some limitation to your character's power that you haven't explained yet, but it looks like a guaranteed win against any opponent, which makes it difficult to keep tension, and therefore the reader's interest. Your character is Superman in a boxing ring against a human who has no idea what's about to hit him.

In addition, you are putting yourself at a bit of a disadvantage here, as someone posted the rock-paper-scissors manga a couple of weeks back, and that was excellent (especially in terms of what I've described your story as lacking: stakes worth playing for, and giving every character a chance to fail). Posting this now, you're kind of inviting comparison, and, because of the extremely high quality of what you're being compared to, it's not flattering for your story.
