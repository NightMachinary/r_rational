  How do you suggest I create tension (or otherwise make the story more interesting/engaging) when the protag's victory is a foregone conclusion?

I can think of a few ways.

First, by coming up with novel ways that the opponents could use to win. For instance, in the manga, it looks like Muscle Dude has no chance to win even a single round, but then he "throws rock" in such a way that the guy he's playing against is punched across the arena. It's cute, it's clever, it's unexpected, and it makes sense within the world. And then, with the reader off-guard and actually believing in the possibility of a Muscle victory, the inevitable conclusion that Muscle loses feels more earned.

Obviously your story can't work that way, with the contestants across the room from each other, but playing against, say, a telepath, could result in a stalemate: the telepath will win, but the MC will revert it and change his strategy, but the telepath will know the new strategy and keep winning, and it keeps getting reverted. One character or the other would have to /let/ the other win.

Another option would be to introduce a disincentive to winning. As the bookies start setting the odds in your character's favor, perhaps your character is... /gently encouraged/... to take a dive in the third round.

Or something resulting from his victory (e.g. applause becoming too loud for the arena and it collapses, killing a bunch of people) is impossible to bear, so he has to find a way to win without the bad thing occurring.

Or someone finds a way to cheat and turn off his power.

Or another character really /needs/ to win and manages to reach enough behind the asshole and gain enough of the MC's sympathy so that he actually considers losing.

The fact that the main character is predestined to win isn't a problem: no one walked into, say, /Captain America: The First Avenger/ expecting a HYDRA victory. However, the movie still works; it still has tension. Why? Because, /from the main character's perspective/, he is never guaranteed victory until the very end, and because he had to make sacrifices along the way.

You may not want to use any of the above ideas (or, at least, not without scrubbing the serial numbers off a bit), but I hope I've given you some ideas about keeping the story interesting without compromising the match-ups you've got planned.
