Aah thanks very much. I added two paragraphs that explained as much of the MC's motivations as could be sensibly conveyed in that part:

  I breathed out as I climbed onto the stage. I frowned. I shouldn't be nervous. Everything I knew about my opponent suggested that this match was mine for the taking. Even the 100 Sira* I had riding on the outcome of this match shouldn't be making me nervous. One advantage of being the underdog was that the market odds on me winning were very much in my favour (1:9) and if I had to pick between a lottery of 9:1 odds on my victory or 1:9 on my defeat, I'd almost certainly take the former. So why was I still nervous? I'd be walking out of here 900 Sira richer and advance in the tournament.

  Delphi Logistics were hosting their annual Rock, Paper, Scissors tournament, and in marked contrast to the norm for such events, Delphi's tournament was exclusively for metahumans. The grand prize of 100,000 Sira and a lucrative job offer for the winner was very tempting, but it wasn't the main reason I showed up. Delphi's status as one of the world's largest corporations by market capitalisation, and (according to my sources) their Syndicate backing were far more alluring (especially the latter). Seeking out the Syndicate was a Sisyphean task that's as likely to kill you as hired (and I'd know), this job was going to be my in.
