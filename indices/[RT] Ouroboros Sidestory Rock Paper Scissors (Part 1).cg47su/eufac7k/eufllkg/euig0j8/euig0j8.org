  There's a cash prize, a very lucrative job offer (and the connections therein), and because the tournament would be his first debut, his public first impression. I intended to highlight the different stakes over the course of the story, but I agree that I should have made it more explicit in this part.

Sorry, I should have been more clear about what I meant. I don't care about what the winner gets; I care about why the character wants to get those things. Now, you might not want to tip your hand just yet about your character's full motivation for participating, but you should at least be dropping hints about which of those stakes the character /really/ cares about, and that there's a reason beyond the obvious that he wants those things.

I mean, sure, he could want the money and the job just to live on, but that's rather banal (unless you want to go into some detail illustrating his life in poverty, for the sake of pathos). He could want the money and influence to take over the world... but that's a bit clich√©. You should want the reader to want your character to win (or to /not/ win; either way, there's tension), and if he's just doing this as a way to kill time on a Sunday and buy a thirty-fifth yacht, the reader probably won't care.

Going back to the manga again, it's no coincidence (narratively) that the two characters who had the most compelling reasons to win were the two who ended up in the finals. No one would have cared if the final match was between the billionaire and the Muscle Guy; their reasons for competing are boring. On the other hand, both finalists had stakes that went beyond the competition, that they cared deeply about, and that made the story mean something to the reader.
