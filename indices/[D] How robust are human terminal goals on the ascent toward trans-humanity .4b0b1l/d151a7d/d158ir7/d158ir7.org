Sorry for being unclear. I was wondering how plausible a certain fictional scenario is: a male protagonist has what he considers his core values acquired through nature or nuture. To himself, his values feel right. Then, he gets augmented with the ability to scrutinize his feelings more deeply (read only access), and starts perceiving his "core" feelings as a composite of more basic drives. His original values no longer seem so... sublime. Reasonable ? Laughable ? I'm not sure. For example, understanding the evolutionary roots of love doesn't make one stop loving his family. On the other hand, there may be no evolutionary defenses against trans-human self insight.
