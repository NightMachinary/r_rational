  It may be the case that with enough self-insight, you realize that much of what we call morality is merely an extension of the desire to conform.

Yes, that /is/ why people consider it "decent and moral" to wear pants in public. It /is/ a conformity thing.

  For example, Emily's core values include the protection of conscious life, but upon augmented introspection, she realizes that a collection of atoms acting one way is not fundamentally different from or more meaningful than atoms acting in another way.
#+end_quote

That doesn't sound like augmented introspection. That sounds like artificially-installed nihilism.

  Is self-insight always, necessarily, a good thingTM?

Yes, more knowledge is always helpful for making decisions that are better in-tune with reality.
