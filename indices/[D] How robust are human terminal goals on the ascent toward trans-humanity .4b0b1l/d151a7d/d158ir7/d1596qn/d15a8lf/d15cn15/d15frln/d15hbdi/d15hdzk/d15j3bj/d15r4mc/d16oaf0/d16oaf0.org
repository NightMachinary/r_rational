  I would agree that it is desirable that we maintain our social fictions surrounding wireheading and nihilism, though.

And why is this desirable for you? Not that it shouldn't be but this terminal value of not /actually/ devolving to one of the binary states of wireheading and nihilism must come from somewhere, no? Or do you think that this is only your own self-protecting delusion and the only reason you are not in favor of wireheading/nihilism is that you have yet to achieve overcoming your own very powerful biases surrounding it?
