#+end_quote

Except that Dr. Manhattan was psychologically and scientifically unrealistic. The differences between a live human being, a dead human being, and a merely brain-dead human being are /very/ palpable and scientifically detectable. There does not exist a level of Deep Truth at which these differences disappear, only levels of Deep Truth to which the merely ordinary, everyday truths are reducible.

Would they? Even rats don't seem to actually prefer opiates or wireheading if they're offered a desirable alternative.
