Wireheading is certainly a failure mode in that it becomes the only remaining terminal goal of the participant, and so prevents the accomplishment of anything that isn't wireheading. The wired stimulation of pleasure centers is so much stronger that the normal pleasurable feedback of biologically- and socially-necessary processes like eating, drinking, and hygiene are no longer motivational. There is nothing left but The Button, and, shortly after, a dehydrated, urine-soaked corpse.

Scott's article was discussing it not just as a possible failure mode of all reinforcement-learning-, reward-function-based minds but as one that a self-modifying, superintelligent AI might be /particularly/ prone to. If that AI's reward function is such that it could be maximized by conversion of the local biosphere into computronium or paperclips or grey goo or self-replicating probes--and that doesn't seem terribly unlikely--then that seems like it would be pretty bad, even though it's really "just" wireheading.

Kind of like hardcore drug addiction, in a post-scarcity society humans wireheading might not actually be the worst thing ever (although still extremely selfish and self-indulgent), but, short of that, it's a real drain on society.

Either way, to anybody with goals other than wired-self-stimulation of one's own pleasure centers, wireheading is suboptimal. People tend to will toward generalization of their own beliefs ("everybody should believe and think and act the way I do"), so anybody who isn't doing it already is probably going to oppose it as a valid terminal goal for others by default. Everybody who is doing it already isn't going to make any noise one way or the other except /clickclickclickclickclickclickclickclickclickclickclickclick/.

Anybody with any sort of teleological beliefs or ethics is also going to look down on it. That teleology doesn't even have to be religious; it's not hard to think of potential purposes for a human life that are more noble---or even just less all-encompassingly self-centered---than spending it doing nothing but stimulating one's own pleasure center with an electrode. Even if the actual, biological reason anybody does any of those other things is really just to stimulate that pleasure center, albeit less efficiently.

Heck, I think even a consequentialist doing the math on "greatest pleasure for the most people" is going to come up with something other than "everybody wirehead, starting right now" as the optimal answer, even if that same consequentialist might not be so opposed to digitization of all existing sentient minds, virtual wireheading, and conversion of the solar system into computronium to maximize the number of duplicate minds that can virtually wirehead simultaneously.

Until we hit post-scarcity and have benevolent AI gods to make sure we don't die while we're all wireheading, everybody going on as normal and not wireheading will likely result in greater net pleasure than everybody wireheading for a few days or weeks before the extinction of the human race.
