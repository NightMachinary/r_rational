Not sure if the use of the word "good" was irony, though the TM implies you're aware of it.

This is the Dr. Manhattan problem, right? The question becomes relevant if some humans are ascending and others aren't. If the only individuals "left" are ones following this path, though, then it seems more severe than, but ultimately similar to, our species' moral development thus far. We largely toned down our enslaving, raping, and murdering of one another; if we discover that other things we thought were true aren't, we'll change again/more.

I would wager some terminal goals are more robust than others. If you gave cavemen heroin, they'd probably go nuts for it and see nothing wrong with it; our distaste for wireheading comes with knowledge and perspective, and allows us to look at it and say, /kinda pathetic, huh? Maybe we can get happiness that's more justified and legitimate and "real" some other way./ Similarly, a lot of our current sources of happiness may become more transparently trivial or mechanistic, and lose some of their charm. But I would expect values like curiosity to retain their allure, and values like kindness to shift in justification but remain relatively strong/popular (swapping good feels for decision theory, for example).
