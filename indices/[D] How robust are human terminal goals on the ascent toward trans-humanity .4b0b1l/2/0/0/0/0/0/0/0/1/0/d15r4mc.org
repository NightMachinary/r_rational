I didn't mean the last part of what I said. I should have said only "there is just wireheading and nihilism". Any points that appear to exist between the two positions are due to human cognitive failings. The only reason we haven't all wireheaded ourselves already is technological limitations. Even with our current tech level, most people's free time is spent in escapism through fiction, drinking alcohol, or getting endorphin rushes from exercise, competition, and sex.

I even think the inevitability of wireheading might be a good explanation for Fermi's Paradox.

I would agree that it is desirable that we maintain our social fictions surrounding wireheading and nihilism, though. But that's why efforts to improve human rationality to transhuman extents make me so nervous. I think they will undermine a lot of the meaning in people's worldviews, including my own. At the same time, doing nothing and refusing to push our limits also seems intolerable to me. So it's a bit of an unwinnable situation.
