Nothing per se. I was just wondering if augmented self-insight might plausibly cause divergence from core values that exist before the augmentation. For example, if a male protagonist gets superhuman insight into his deeply cherished feelings of gallantry towards females, and then realizes his gallantry to be nothing more than sublimated physical attraction, might he not simply lose interest in being 'gallant' ?
