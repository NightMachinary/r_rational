  what are your sources on climate change and calling runaway scenarios "bogus"?
#+end_quote

Too many models have been wrong. Not being a climate scientist, I have to take the predictions and see if they come to pass. Every time they don't, my confidence in the next decreases.

Also, controls theory. Take the temperature data, remove the labels, show it to a controls engineer, and ask them what it looks like. I've done this, and the answer I received was "ringing around a new setpoint".

And finally, doom-mongering. Doomsayers have been predicting the end of the world since the beginning of the world. They always have reasons, and they sometimes sound reasonable. Sometimes it actually happens (when reducing the scale of "the world" to something more localized). Climate scientists that advocate for policies are not doing science: they are doomsayers.

So yes, I have lots of reasons to doubt the runaway scenarios. Gasoline is not $15/gallon, California, New York, and Florida have not fallen into the sea, and the polar bears are not extinct. And I have no reason to believe that the cause for the previous outlandish predictions has gone away.
