Its not fine. But the specific scenario I see a lot "And then everyone starves to death", basically cannot happen, because it presumes no response to a deteriorating situation at all, and learned helplessness is not /that/ powerful. You would need a "and then, global thermo-nuclear war" in there somewhere.
