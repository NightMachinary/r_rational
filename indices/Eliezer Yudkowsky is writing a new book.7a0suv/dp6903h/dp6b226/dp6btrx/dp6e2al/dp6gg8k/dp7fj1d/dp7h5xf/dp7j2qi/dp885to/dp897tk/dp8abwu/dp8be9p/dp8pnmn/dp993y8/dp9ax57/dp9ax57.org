  If synthetic intelligence is possible, we would expect, as [[/u/GaBeRockKing][u/GaBeRockKing]] has been arguing, that they would be the dominant form of life. Since I find that I am a meat-form intelligence and not a synthetic intelligence, I must consider that either synthetic minds are rare throughout all of time and space (relative to expectations); or else that most synthetic minds begin existence as a meat-form intelligence

I explained this before: evolution is great for finding local maxima, not so much for finding absolute maxima. Take the human larynx, for example. Sure, it's passable, but compared to the range of sound a cheap modern speaker can make, is completely inadequate. But there's no evolutionary mechanism for humans to suddenly develop electronic larynxes-- evolution is stuck tweaking hundreds of millions of years old tech.

And it's not uncommon to find evolutionary dead ends, where a species hyperoptimizes for some local maximum, then goes extinct because an invasive species optimized for some better local maximum comes in and messes them up.

It's a misapplication of the anthropic principle to ask why we haven't been replaces by nonbiological brains yet, because the answer is that only recently have the conditions become favorable for the emergence of mechanical minds.

It's like asking "well if humans are so great, then why weren't they around for the first billion years of evolution on earth? Obviously, humans can't exist becase they haven't existed yet."
