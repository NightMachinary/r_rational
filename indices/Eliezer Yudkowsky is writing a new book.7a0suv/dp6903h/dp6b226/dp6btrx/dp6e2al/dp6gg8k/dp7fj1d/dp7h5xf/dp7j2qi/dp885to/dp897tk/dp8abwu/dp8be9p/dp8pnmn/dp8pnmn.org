  No, we don't. We know that meat-form intelligence works. We don't know anything else that can work.

Yes but you need some reason for asuming that meat form intelligence is the only thing that can work, you can't just assume anything we don't know how to do yet is impossible until otherwise proven , and its a really weird claim that the way evolution found is either the only way to do it or the best way to do it ( This almost never happens because evolution is like a hill climbing algorithm ) .Can you explain your specific reasons why do you think this is the case with intelligence?.
