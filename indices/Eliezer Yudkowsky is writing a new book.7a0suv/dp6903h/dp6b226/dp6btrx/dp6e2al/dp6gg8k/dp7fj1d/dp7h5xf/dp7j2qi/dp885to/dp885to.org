This is going to seem like a cop-out, but to boil it down, the reason I'm so confident that we can get computers of the same processing power and density of the humans brain is because we already have them. The human brain is a 1 to 1 emulation of the human brain. The sounds tautological (and it is) but I very much doubt meat brains are the most efficient possible computing substrate. They're /good/ sure, and they do what we need them to do, but as a fundamental design constraint they're forced to be built using biological processes. A computer has far more options (although not all of them are necessarily cost efficient).

Maybe the brain is somehow a near-ideal substrate, but it's nearly inconceivable that it's impossible to improve on it. Maybe the factor of improvement we can get on it will be low, but as long as there /is/ potential for improvement, and our biological science keeps advancing, there's no reason to suspect we /wouldn't/ have plentiful EMs.

Quite frankly, it seems like wishful thinking to hope that EMs won't dominate the world given enough time.

  These two things do not offset one another. The base of the exponent and the scalar in front of it are not equivalent parts of the calculation. Given an equation: ke^{rt,} the k and r terms have completely different impacts on the behavior of the function.

As an addendum, the i7-4790k was considered the best "bang for your buck" chip at the time. When it got released it was on the latest architecture and printing process (although it was quad core instead of 8/16 core and it didn't have the highest clock speeds), but I did my calculation ~2 years after it got made. That made it a solid basis for comparison. It would be a pain to find my old calculation, but I'd be happy to do it if you gave me your best estimate for the total processing power of the human mind in terms of flops (I saw that it was about 10^{16} flops, but I could be wrong) and your timeframe for when an AI-induced technological revolution that would result in the majority of the planet dead would happen.

Obviously the architecture of a CPU and the architecture of the brain are different, but judging by how slow neurons are to transmit signals, it's not inconceivable that some multi-cpu arrangement could simulate humans in at least near-real-time.

edit: taking my figures (I'll wait for yours) since the 4790k runs at 43.98 GFLOPS, and since the doubling in processing power is a discrete rather than continuous process, 10^{16} = 2^{x} * 43.98, so x~=21. Which means that it'll take twenty-one doubling periods to get to the rough processing power of a human mind, which means you can set the doubling period to be up to 4 years and still get desktop CPUs matching human brain power by the end of the century. Since the doubling period has been, so far, roughly 2 years, and since server farms would be more than happy to emulate humans (for a price) I can pretty confidently predict that EMs will start popping up well before the end of the century.
