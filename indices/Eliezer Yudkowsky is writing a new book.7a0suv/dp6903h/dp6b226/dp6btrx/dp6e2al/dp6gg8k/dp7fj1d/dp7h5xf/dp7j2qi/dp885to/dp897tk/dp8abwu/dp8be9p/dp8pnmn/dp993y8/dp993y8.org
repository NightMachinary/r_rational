These are good points, and I have to admit I go back and forth on the issue, depending on how cynical I am at the time. I'll just give one argument right now that is likely to appeal to the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] community: the anthropic principle.

If synthetic intelligence is possible, we would expect, as [[/u/GaBeRockKing][u/GaBeRockKing]] has been arguing, that they would be the dominant form of life. Since I find that I am a meat-form intelligence and not a synthetic intelligence, I must consider that either synthetic minds are rare throughout all of time and space (relative to expectations); or else that most synthetic minds begin existence as a meat-form intelligence.

Alternatively, perhaps I am a synthetic intelligence that thinks it is a meat-form intelligence. This would indicate that the universe as I know it is probably a simulation of some sort: in that case, I don't know the rules, can't know the rules, and speculation is pointless.
