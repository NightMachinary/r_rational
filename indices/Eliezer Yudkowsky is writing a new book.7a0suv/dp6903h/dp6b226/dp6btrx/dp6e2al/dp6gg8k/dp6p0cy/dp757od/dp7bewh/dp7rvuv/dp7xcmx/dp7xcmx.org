We aren't talking about what has already happened, though there's plenty of president for suffering of the poor during economic disruption. I am talking about a specific trend we can see presently. Within our lifetimes general doctors, lawyers, accountants, simple IT jobs, and many other white collar careers will slowly disappear. Once we get to AI that can effectively outperform humans labor loses its value. This process started with the industrial revolution yes, and there's been a period of recovery and growth, to but that doesn't mean it's over or that the trend of automation is a fiction.
