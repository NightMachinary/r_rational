  You are obsessed with derailing on this hokey EM thing.

You're the one who started talking about some post-doomsday agrarian society. I just made a more likely prediction. Maybe it isn't the /most/ likely, but it's certaintly more likely than what you proposed.

  If you insist, honestly that future is wildly improbable. Why should a GAI controlled by a technocracy bother emulating billions of people at all? There's 0 incentive for that scenario to even exist.

If there's going to be a GAI that takes total control, neither UBI or agrarian communes are going to stop it from paperclipping the planet.
