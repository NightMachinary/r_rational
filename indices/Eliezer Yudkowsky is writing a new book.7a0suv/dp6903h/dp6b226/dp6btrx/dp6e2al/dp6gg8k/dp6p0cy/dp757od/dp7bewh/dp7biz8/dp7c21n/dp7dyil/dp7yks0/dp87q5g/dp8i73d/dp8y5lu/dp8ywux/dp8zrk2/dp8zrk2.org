  And I'm saying the possibility of future Ems has Zero bearing on the current value of living people. It's irrelevant. Yet you raised it as some sort of counter argument, as if the solution to "lots of people suffer and die" is "instantiate more artificial minds."

Luckily, I'm talking about a time where EMs will be the preponderance of living people. Your value system is fucked up if you think the lives of mere billions will outweight the lives of trillions or even quadrillions.
