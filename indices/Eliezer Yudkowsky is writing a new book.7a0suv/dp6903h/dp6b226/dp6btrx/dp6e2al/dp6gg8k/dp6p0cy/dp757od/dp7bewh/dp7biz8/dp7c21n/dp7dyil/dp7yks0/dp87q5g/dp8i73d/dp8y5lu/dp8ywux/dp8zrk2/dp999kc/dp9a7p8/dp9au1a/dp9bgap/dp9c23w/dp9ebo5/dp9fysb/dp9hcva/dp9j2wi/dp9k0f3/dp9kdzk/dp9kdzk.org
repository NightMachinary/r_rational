Are you suggesting we'd have EM /without/ GAI? because that's just plain silly.

there is literally nothing likely about a society with billions of EMs. It's a tremendous waste of resources for no purpose whatsoever.

and obviously you could have GAI without a paperclip scenario.

regardless, you still seem to be having trouble with the idea that the future can be made up of more than one moment in time. UBI is important PRIOR to a full AI singularity, but DURING the period while weak AI automation is playing havoc with the economy -- ie. soon.
