  But the people are fine.

It looks that way to the winners after the fact, but ask the actual workers during the industrial revolution, or farmers during the dustbowl if they were fine.

The vast majority of people in the world DO live in poverty. So many Western "rationalists" have this glaring bias of prosperity due to having been raised in luxury, failing to see that their entire civilization is based on the brutal exploitation of cheap labor in other societies.

Would you be ok living like a factory worker in China? Because that's a real world scenario. Middle class western suburbia is the fantasy, and it's eroding fast.

once software comes for the most common white collar jobs, the west is going to have a rude awakening. Suddenly we are going to have to live like the rest of the world, the sorry sots we've been looking down on and telling ourselves would be fine if they just got their shit together.

And yes, the cycle WILL be different -- because when you start talking AI and full automation, you aren't just changing the relationship between labor and capital, you are breaking it. A fully automated industry doesn't need labor at all. the market for it disappears. this is an entirely new animal, and most people aren't going to be /fine./
