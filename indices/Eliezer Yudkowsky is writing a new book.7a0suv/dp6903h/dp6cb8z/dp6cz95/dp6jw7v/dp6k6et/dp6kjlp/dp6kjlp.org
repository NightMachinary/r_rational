You have to write =¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯= for it to show as ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. The first backslash escapes the second backslash, making it visible, and the third backslash escapes the underscores, which would otherwise just create italics around the face part:

| Input          | Output     |
|----------------+------------|
| =¯\_(ツ)_/¯=   | ¯_(ツ)_/¯  |
| =¯\\_(ツ)_/¯=  | ¯\/(ツ)//¯ |
| =¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯= | ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ |
