I may be projecting a little. I don't see "hope the people in charge are sane" as a solution, and hope that's not where he's going with this. Isn't this sort of thing already apparent to people inside the system? If knowledge of a problem was enough I would think even blind attempts to fix a poorly defined problem would eventually help.
