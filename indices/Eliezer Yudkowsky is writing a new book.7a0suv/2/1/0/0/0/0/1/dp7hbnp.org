  1) Climage Change

  This is a big problem

Unlikely. Changes are likely to be slow enough for the economies to adapt to in real time. My priors suggest that models saying otherwise are bogus.

  2) Resource consumption
#+end_quote

You do realize we're currently trying to bootstrap a sustainable economy by exploiting the existing non-resources, right? This is something that always needed to happen. As non-renewable resources are exhausted, the economy will naturally shift to using the now-cheaper renewable options.

  3) Economic inequality and the AI revolution

  the outcome of this is widespread unemployment and poverty
#+end_quote

Unlikely. Much has been written on this topic. What happened to all the weavers and bakers and blacksmiths? The fact that blue-collar workers in first-world countries use technology on a continual basis kinda means what it means to be part of the "masses" has changed dramatically. Expect more of the same in the future.

As you say, and I agree, the most likely outcome will be a guaranteed minimum income. Since we already have various welfare and social security programs, replacing these programs with a UBI will be pretty straightforward. This is already being discussed at all levels. I think it's still a bit early, but we'll see. This will probably be paired with various forms of population control.

The real trick will be to modernize those parts of the world that are resistant to modernization.
