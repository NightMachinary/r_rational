There are three major factors I'm considering when predicting future collapse (unless major changes to our civilization occur)

1) Climate Change

This is a big problem. Pretty much all scientists agree major problems are in store, yet governments and industry are not responding quickly enough. There will be disruption to our food supply and environmental stability unless drastic changes occur, which appears unlikely.

2) Resource consumption

The world is already over consuming both renewable and non-renewable natural resources. As india and china continue to industrialize, this is expected to increase.

Global consumption behaviors will have to change dramatically to reach equalibrium. With population continuing to rise, this means restricted access to goods overall.

3) Economic inequality and the AI revolution

It doesn't matter if we are wealthy if most people don't have access to that wealth. Inequality in wealth distribution is growing dramatically. The most likely outcome of the coming AI revolution is a dramatic shift in power away from the labor class and toward the capital class. When automation reaches the remaining blue and white collar jobs and human labor is devalued, the current economic system of producer-consumer breaks down. The capital class will for the first time not need the masses at all. Without policy intervention, the outcome of this is widespread unemployment and poverty. Surviving this for most people, unless some sort of UBI system is established, will come down to building small self-sustained agro communities, as I suggested above.
