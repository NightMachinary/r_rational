... right! Because computers don't need anything to run. They can be made arbitrarily small, run arbitrarily fast, give off no waste heat, and don't require electricity. Let's see... use the waste heat to power a small steam generator, and use the electricity from that to power the computer! Genius!

In case I wasn't clear enough, I'm mocking you.

In terms of memory storage, human bodies may not be particularly efficient. But that's fine, because they are not primarily static storage mediums, but dynamic systems. Emulating complex systems is usually harder than just letting them run. There are some exceptions: systems that are difficult to observe, very large (or small) systems, or systems that are prohibitively expensive (or dangerous) to run. Humans are basically the opposite of all those.

Scifi writers have been talking about emulated minds for generations. We're a little closer than we once were, but not significantly. In recent years we've seen emulation of a simple multi-cellular lifeform, but that's about it (if I remember correctly, it was something like a roundworm, which has approximately 300 neurons). Wikipedia tells me the human brain has 86 billion neurons, and 10^{14} synapses. If each synapse contains a little over one byte of data, that's going to be on the order of 1 petabyte of storage space needed just to emulate a brain. And of course, brains are not particularly fast. Axons don't propagate electrical impulses at the rate of, say, copper, so computations are on the high-Âµs to low-ms range. But the emulation has to do all this in parallel. Computers are nowhere close to being able to do this. It is, in fact, beyond the theoretical limits of CPU design. You would have to design a custom ASIC capable of running all the calculations in parallel... something like a brain.

Perhaps if everyone were willing to live in extremely slow-motion, emulation could be worthwhile. But it's still not going to be cheaper.
