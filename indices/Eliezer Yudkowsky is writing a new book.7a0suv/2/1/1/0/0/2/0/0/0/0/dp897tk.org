  The human brain is a 1 to 1 emulation of the human brain. The sounds tautological (and it is) but I very much doubt meat brains are the more efficient possible computing substrate.

That's fair, but it's not the whole story.

  Maybe the brain is somehow a near-ideal substrate,

It /is/ an ideal substrate. It is the only system capable of perfectly emulating a brain at full speed.

Maybe that's a cop-out, too, but you need the other half in order to keep this sort of argument in balance. And to be fair, emulating a brain doesn't mean emulating all the chemical processes in detail. They can probably be simplified with no noticeable impact in performance.

I'm not arguing that a person can't be emulated in hardware. I'm not even arguing that it can't be done at full-speed. But to think it can be done at full speed on general purpose computing hardware? That's ludicrous. You'll need specialized hardware, specially prepared for the intense multi-tasking operations that are called for. Brains of metal and stone.

Some back-of-the-envelope calculations: 2^{47} synapses, with an update period of 1ms. Call it 2^{50} updates per second. Each update requires multiple calculations. Let's call it 2^{52} flops. This would require around a hundred thousand modern CPUs just to perform the calculations. And we don't have the means with today's technology to handle the shared cache between those processors.

Oh, and my timeframe for an AI-induced technological revolution? I don't think it will happen. I doubt very much that AGI is more than a failed dream.
