  ...What? Did you lose brain cells during this conversation? I think you might be broken.
#+end_quote

So humans /aren't/ human-created general intelligences? Color me surprised.

#+begin_quote
  No. That's all you. Everything is intrinsically connected. Start changing the body, and the brain changes, too. Change something in the brain, and the body changes. You can't have it halfway.

  A slightly different autonomic response system might not change who you think you are, but it will change what you are. Pull out enough "useless" stuff, and eventually you'll have a machine that thinks it's you while actually being something else entirely. Probably a p-zombie.
#+end_quote

P-zombies don't exist. If something /thinks/ its sapient, then it is. Now, that's not to say that sufficiently invasive procedures would be enough to effectively count the prior me as "killed" and the modified person as a new person, but the threshold for that has to be considerably higher than your envisioning, or puberty would kill the original person and replace them with a new one. The same goes for stuff like nootropic drugs, brain damage, and even just the effects of aging.

  What do you think slowing down is? You see a car slowing as it approaches a stop sign. You think to yourself: "That car has been going pretty fast for quite some time; I don't think it's really gonna stop; it'll probably just roll through."
#+end_quote

I know as well as anyone that all exponential curves will eventually turn logistic, but there's just no evidence that the computing power curve will stop being exponential /before/ technology surpasses the human mind. Again, it's wishful thinking to believe the human brain is as good as it gets.

  One word: Latency. Did you know that throwing more processors at a real-time problem doesn't actually make it easier?
#+end_quote

So what if they have latency? The nervous system triggers along snail-slow chemical paths. Fiber optic busses will be, quite literally, a lightspeed improvement on what our biology is capable of. Latency is hardly insurmountable.

#+begin_quote
  Here's an actual engineer telling you it is insurmountable. I've explained how to handle it: Specialized systems.
#+end_quote

"This thing is insurmountable, which means we need to surmount it with specialized systems." ?????

You're contradicting yourself.

#+begin_quote
  No, we don't. We know that meat-form intelligence works. We don't know anything else that can work. Maybe we can simulate a human brain. If we can (and that's a big if), it would be strong evidence that AGI is possible.
#+end_quote

We will be able to simulate a human brain. That's literally what I've been arguing this entire time. Maybe not at 100% accuracy, but we don't /need/ 100% accuracy for the simulation to still be a person. The human brain is special because it's better than everything that's come before, not because of some inherent quality that's impossible to replicate.

#+begin_quote
  No, I don't. And I don't really care about what OP wrote. That guy's probably a moron anyways. What I am discussing is the concept of emulated minds and that even though they are a perfectly nice fictional concept, they are not one that works out in the real world. We can revisit the topic in twenty or thirty years, and see if any advancements have proven one of us right or wrong.
#+end_quote

Ok then. Just remember, though: everyone who's previously doubted the ability of computers to keep getting faster has been proven wrong. That doesn't /necessarily/ mean they won't be, but making decisions that bet on the human mind remaining the king of the hill in any particular domain have tended to be proven wrong so far.
