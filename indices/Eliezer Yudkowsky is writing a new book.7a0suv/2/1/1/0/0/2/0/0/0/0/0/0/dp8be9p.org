  Also, AGIs exist now. We call them "humans".

...What? Did you lose brain cells during this conversation? I think you might be broken.

  There's a bunch of stuff in my brain that I need, but isn't exactly me.
#+end_quote

No. That's all you. Everything is intrinsically connected. Start changing the body, and the brain changes, too. Change something in the brain, and the body changes. You can't have it halfway.

A slightly different autonomic response system might not change who you think you are, but it will change what you are. Pull out enough "useless" stuff, and eventually you'll have a machine that thinks it's you while actually being something else entirely. Probably a p-zombie.

  and the process shows no signs of stopping (even if it does show signs of slowing down.)
#+end_quote

What do you think slowing down is? You see a car slowing as it approaches a stop sign. You think to yourself: "That car has been going pretty fast for quite some time; I don't think it's really gonna stop; it'll probably just roll through."

Improvements can reach an upper limit without ever "stopping". f(x) = x/(x+1) never stops increasing. Not hard to see that it will never reach 1.

One word: Latency. Did you know that throwing more processors at a real-time problem doesn't actually make it easier?

  shared cache

  that's an engineering issue I'm more than confident will eventually be fixed
#+end_quote

Here's an actual engineer telling you it is insurmountable. I've explained how to handle it: Specialized systems.

#+begin_quote
  we know that AGI is possible and because of evolution
#+end_quote

No, we don't. We know that meat-form intelligence works. We don't know anything else that can work. Maybe we can simulate a human brain. If we can (and that's a big /if/), it would be strong evidence that AGI is possible.

  Then do you believe the majority of people will die in a techno-revolution without the use of AI?
#+end_quote

No, I don't. And I don't really care about what OP wrote. That guy's probably a moron anyways. What I am discussing is the concept of emulated minds and that even though they are a perfectly nice fictional concept, they are not one that works out in the real world. We can revisit the topic in twenty or thirty years, and see if any advancements have proven one of us right or wrong.
