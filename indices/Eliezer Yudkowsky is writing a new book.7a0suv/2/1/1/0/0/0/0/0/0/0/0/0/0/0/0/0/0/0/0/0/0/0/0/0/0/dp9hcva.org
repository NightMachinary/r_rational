This is absolutely not what you said.

  self sustaining mini agricultural communities are probably the only way most of the population survives the coming crash/techno revolution.

That was your first post, which I responded to.

But with reference to your /new/ argument,

#+begin_quote
  Automation will lead to widespread loss of quality of life unless UBI is implemented.

My counter is that, as a proportion of a population, regular humans will be negligible compared to EMs and AIs. Therefore it would be /un/-utilitarian to consider their preferences over the preferences of EMs and AIs. So because energy is a finite, nonexcludable resource, and since, per person, EMs will require less energy than regular humans, the only moral option is to favor EMs, as opposed to regular humans, because resources allocated towards the benefit of EMs result in more preferences being satisfied than resources allocated towards the benefits of humans.

With regards to your first post, I was railing against the statement "most of the population" you included in your first post, because it implies (incorrectly) that the regular humans are going to be the part of the population that matters.

It's not a fun thing to realize, considering we /are/ regular humans, but using a general utilitarian argument, when utilitarianism would judge against you, just makes you fish in a barrel.

Of course, any deontological view you have about the issue (ex. EMs aren't morally relevant because I define "morally relevant" as only including humans) remains correct internally, but you'll have a hard time getting the EMs to agree with it.
