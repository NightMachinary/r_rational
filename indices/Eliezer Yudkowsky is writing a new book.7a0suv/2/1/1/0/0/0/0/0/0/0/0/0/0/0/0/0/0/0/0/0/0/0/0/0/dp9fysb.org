no, you are randomly changing the subject! You flip flop between saying you aren't even talking about the same topic, and then saying Ems are your answer to poverty.

My assertions:

Automation will lead to widespread loss of quality of life unless UBI is implemented.

Your response: EMs will exist someday so who cares?

If you have some OTHER response to the problem of poverty caused by the loss of value for human labor, lets hear it.

If your only response is that EMs might exist some day so poverty doesn't matter, then yes, your utility function is fucked up.
