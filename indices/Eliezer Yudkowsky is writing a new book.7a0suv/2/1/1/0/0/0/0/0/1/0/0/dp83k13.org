I'm confused. You don't see how periods of economic disruption are followed by periods of recovery? Yes, automation disrupts economies and industries. But the /people/ are fine. So what if there are no accountants in 30 years. Does that mean all the accountants will be in abject poverty? Not likely.

It sounds to me like your saying that even though this cycle has happened before, for some reason this time it will be different. That sounds suspicious to me. You sound like a Marxist.
