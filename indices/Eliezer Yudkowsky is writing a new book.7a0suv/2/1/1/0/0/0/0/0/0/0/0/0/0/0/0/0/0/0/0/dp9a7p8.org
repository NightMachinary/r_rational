  We were discussing the problem of economic decline causing suffering for lots of people. for some reason you keep indicating this isn't a problem, and you keep bringing up EMs. Are you just changing the subject, or is there a relationship?

You evidently were, but I wasn't. I was countering the thread op's premise that the only way to survive the majority of people dying in a technological revolution would be through substinence agriculture. My position is that his point was a nonstarter since a technological revolution capable of such widespread murder would also have the majority of people as EMs anyways.
