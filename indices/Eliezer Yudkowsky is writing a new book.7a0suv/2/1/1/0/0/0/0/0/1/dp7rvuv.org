  I'm talking about the much slower but just as devistating process of economic decline and widespread poverty that will accompany the automation of larger and larger % of the workforce, in conjunction with the further concentration of wealth into the hands of the super rich.

It's absurd to argue a point that has already been proven false. The history of the twentieth century demonstrates the opposite. You can argue that the particulars of the future are different, but then you need to look at specific reasons instead of making generalized assertions.
