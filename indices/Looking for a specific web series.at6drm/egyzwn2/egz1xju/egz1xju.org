Rational? Sorta. There are people who have the power to kill monsters and take a bit of their powers. They use this by giving them good weapons, training them, and killing weak monsters that are deemed safe by scarier people. There are a lot of weird physics and it frequently feels like things are being invented as it goes. There are a lot of plans, pressures, factions and secrets. To the point that almost nothing is not indicitive of a larger thing. The main character is very "Chosen one"

It is fairly good. I quit reading when I caught up as I have a hard time reading things as released, but want to go back and re-read it. Lots of magic school and monster of the week early on.

Decently long, still in progress.

Still in progress.

All in all, I enjoy it and would recommend. It seems like the set up for a tabletop game that I would love to play. Not amazing, but definitely above average.
