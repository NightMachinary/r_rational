I read up to... book 21 or so, I think? I enjoyed it, though I'd say it's more rational-adjacent than purely rational, though it's been long enough since I went through it that I don't recall exactly why that is. It also feels very "fast." There's little downtime between big plot twists or action sequences. There is also some REALLY unsettling violence in it. Like, I'm not one to get squeamish about writing generally, but there were a few scenes that really stuck with me in how horrifying they were. All that being said, I really enjoyed the plot and the worldbuilding. I should go back and reread it sometime, but I'll probably wait until it's finished.
