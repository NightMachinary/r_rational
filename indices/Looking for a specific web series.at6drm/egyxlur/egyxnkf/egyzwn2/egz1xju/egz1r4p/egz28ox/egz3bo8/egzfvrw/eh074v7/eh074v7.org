Personally, The Gods Are Bastards is among my top fiction online, ranking up there with A Practical guide to Evil, HPMOR, and Worm.

Well thought out plots, great writing, serious challenges faced, real-world issues discussed (though I do think it's slightly preachy, but really toned down - comes up more in comments), and an amazing backstory and twist halfway through.
