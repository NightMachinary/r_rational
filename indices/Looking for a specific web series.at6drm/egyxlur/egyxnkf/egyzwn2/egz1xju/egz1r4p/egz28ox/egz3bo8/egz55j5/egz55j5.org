  It seemed to have gone on hiatus somewhere along last summer though, so I dont know what its current status is.

It wasn't really a hiatus; the author ended the 14th book in August 2018 and began posting the 15th in December 2018. But during that time he kept publishing side chapters regularly, as part of the rewards promised for his Kickstarter funders. If you take a look at the bonus chapters at the bottom of the table of contents, 28 - 59 were all published during that time.

Book 15 is still having chapters posted regularly these days.

I'm curious, how far did you get in the series?
