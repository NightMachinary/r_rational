It's not over yet lol... it's in the last arc or two, I think.

I thought it was good, read it twice. Quite a lot going on.

I'd say it's definitely at least not irrational? Probably doesn't stand up to the standard of some of the folks around here, but I thought The Gods are Bastards was pretty rational too, and that's a contentious one, so my opinion is questionable.

Maybe wait a month or two for it to wrap up? I definitely wouldn't recommend it as a serial... Easy to forget who's who with all the characters and plot running around.
