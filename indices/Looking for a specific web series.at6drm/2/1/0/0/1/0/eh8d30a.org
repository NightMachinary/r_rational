I dont know, Its been a while since I've read it but I distinctly remember myself getting annoyed whenever Trissiny would go on one of her feminist rants - that's the most "in your face" SJW stuff i can point out off the top of my head.

It has a bit of a SJWy feel in general though, with no true positive (straight) masculine character - Toby is gay pacifist, Gabriel is kindof a dork although he grows throughout the book - Darling is the closest to a positive masculine archetype, but he's morally gray and kinda sociopathic so not a good example.

Most of the main characters are (strong and independent) women, while a (villain) character who exhibits masculine traits and traditionalist views is so grossly caricaturised that there is nothing redeeming about him (Shook).

These things bother me, because as a male reader I like having a character to insert myself into, which was sorely lacking in Tgab.
