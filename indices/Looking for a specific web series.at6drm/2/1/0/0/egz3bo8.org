Not op but I can tell you a bit about Gods are bastards:

All in all it was an entertaining read, although i did stop on the middle of reading it and then picked it up again. It seemed to have gone on hiatus somewhere along last summer though, so I dont know what its current status is.

Things I liked:

- good worldbuilding and magic system
- interesting plot

Things I didn't like:

- characterisation and telling instead of showing: characters are often described one way and then shown as the complete opposite

- a lot of in your face Social justice undertones - which can bother you if you don't agree with them (like in my case)

- lack of a positive male lead i could empathise with and use to immerse myself further into the story (totally subjective)

Now it may seem like the story has more cons than pros, but that's just because these are the glaring flaws that stood out to me. The story was still a very enjoyable read and I would recommend it if you like fantasy novels.
