Yeah, I mean, surely just duplicating yourself and continuing to hold hands you should be able to get more done to alleviate poverty and misery than all this. If you are willing to literally kill yourself and feed yourself to people then you could think of any number of things like: hard physical labor that might injure yourself (carrying hundreds of pounds of water to people who need it), taking care of sick and diseased that most people would avoid, or just working really really hard and whenever your other you gets tired or hungry make a new one - labor that doesn't need to drink, eat, sleep, and never gets tired seems pretty valuable.

If you absolutely must die, might as well die in a way that preserves your organs and flood the donor market. Or even donate blood/marrow/kidneys and take the money to buy food for the starving - though it might be difficult to do that with the hand holding thing. Could simply claim it was for moral support or some such, though that wouldn't fly for kidney donation for obvious reasons.
