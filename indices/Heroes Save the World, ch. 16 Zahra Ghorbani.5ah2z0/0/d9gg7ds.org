Was she raised homeless? I'm somewhat confused because my understanding of Tehran was that it was roughly equivalent (economically, at least) to an American metropolitan city, where I'd be thoroughly shocked to find someone (with applied knowledge of chemistry) willing to repeatedly commit suicide and subject themselves and those who they claim to be helping to participating in cannibalism.

Assuming other things (not just the body, but clothing as well?) are duplicated along with the person, any number of other uses could be found. What happens when something copied with the body is dropped?

If only the body is copied, there are still other possibilities. What happens when the copy picks up/eats/etc something and then dematerializes? Could be used as a form of 100% safe nuclear waste disposal, perhaps?

Hell, even without all of that, being able to reliably produce identical medical experiment subjects/cadavers should be worth more than enough money to be able to simply buy the food that she is wanting to provide, while having none of the risks associated with violating such a massive taboo as cannibalism.
