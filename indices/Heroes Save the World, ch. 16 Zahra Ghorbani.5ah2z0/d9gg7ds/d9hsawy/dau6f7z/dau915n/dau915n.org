No.

  Even if it doesn't, there are some pretty expensive pieces of clothing in the world. In theory she should be able to work herself up to them by buying something and then selling a few dozen copies of it.

This would work, though. Zahra might have thought of it, in which case you can safely assume that she's saving up her doubles' clothes to resell them later so that she can get enough money to buy better clothes (she'll probably sell them in bulk, because that's probably less likely to make people suspicious than selling the same set of clothing again and again over a period of time). In the meantime, though, she's still got to kill herself, because the clothing only stays if Zahra-2 is dead.

Thank you for reading! I'm glad that you're enjoying the story!
