Like [[/u/tk17studios]] and [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5627803/chapters/12963046][r!animorphs]] (which you must read, if you've somehow found this fic but not that one), I can't say how that I know how this story is going to end. Events that are a few chapters way get put under the lens to a degree that they don't suffer when they're further out and more nebulous, and very tiny details have a way of overturning all of my earlier projections about how a given course of events was going to turn out.

Plans never survive contact with the enemy and, it appears, they don't fare much better against characters (especially when there are as many as I'm keeping track of--instead of one plan getting sent off the rails, it might be the plans of half a dozen or more characters).
