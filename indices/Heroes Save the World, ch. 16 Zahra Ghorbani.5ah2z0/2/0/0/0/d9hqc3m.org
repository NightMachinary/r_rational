Cyanide can be destroyed by heat, [[http://www.onlineresearchjournals.org/JBFSR/pdf/2013/jan/Onyeike%20et%20al..pdf][as described in this paper]]. So long as her second self is cooked, the cyanide won't be a problem.

In addition, if the above were not true, then either the cyanide would be concentrated in certain parts of her body or be distributed equally. If the former, then you could simply avoid those organs, and if the latter then it would only be a problem if one person ate the whole body in a short period of time. This was my original plan as I started thinking about how to capitalize on Zahra's power in her current circumstances, but it turns out that cyanide is pretty convenient, right down to apricots being really common in Iran.
