I don't think it was especially unclear, other than a mental block that some readers might have against even considering cannibalism. I don't think I have any advice on making it clearer - my comments on the actual actions are elsewhere in the thread, and anything more blatant seems like it would be less fitting with the rest of the writing style, other than maybe something at the very end.
