He's had his first checkup with the pediatrician and is doing well (he's a week old today). He's passed all his tests and doesn't cry much. Sleep isn't too big of an issue, since my wife and I can tag-team it and he goes to bed quickly. Plus he's a newborn, so doesn't do much more than sleep and eat anyway, which means there's lots of downtime for me (some of which is being sucked up by XCOM 2, which I'm near the end of).

I've had no grand epiphanies thus far, though I do feel some mental changes that are probably hormonal instead of grounded in practical reality, meaning mostly anxiety and love, though the former is fading somewhat now.
