At Universal Studios. Theme parks are the great religious temples of modern secular capitalism, and by God am I glad that they exist to enrich our culture. In no way can I walk through these gates as an Effective Altruist. So to hell with EA! Create a lavish dreamscape in physical space via a massive influx of corporate energy.

To clarify, yes, I am saying that my commitment to libertarianism is so strong that this sort of decadent who-even-knows-how-many-millions-of-dollars entertainment enterprise is not outweighed in my mind by the counterfactual wherein it went to helping the poor instead. Balloons! Roller coasters! Paying people to walk around in costumes! Enough buildings for an early city! The humanity is staggering! This is my CEV as a locus. May the coming AI tile the world in this shit.
