I would not reccommend it since it is obviously a negative experience and not even that special to be honest. However /personally/ sleeping under extra warm covers seems to increase my chances of dreaming, and even more so having nightmares. Might be a safe alternative to try instead of more serious ways to put the stress on your body that seems to be a factor.
