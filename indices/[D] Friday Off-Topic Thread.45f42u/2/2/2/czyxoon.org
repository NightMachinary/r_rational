I used to get it as a child. It wasn't traumatic or anything --while it was truly overwhelming terror and not even the fun kind, just heartfast helplessness, it doesn't have any staying power-- but I would third the anti-recommendation because it was unpleasant and I do not see any obvious way in which it would enrich your life. There are far more interesting experiences you could strive to attain with the same effort.
