I want to contradict the last 3 posters. It is an interesting experience, and while yes it can be frightening or disturbing, there is absolutely nothing that will actually harm you. I think there is something to be said for being able to acknowledge fear and other powerful emotions without allowing them to override your behavior; i.e. understanding that what you are experiencing is essentially just an alert signal, and it isn't itself something that must be avoided. If you can find a safe way to practice that skill, I say go for it.

That may not be your motivation, but regardless, the worst that can happen is a few moments of gripping terror, and possibly hallucinating a malevolent demonic entity that wants to devour your soul and/or drag you into the fiery pits of hell. Much more entertaining than horror movies imo.

I experienced lots of this while experimenting with lucid dreaming. In particular I was practicing maintaining consciousness while falling asleep. I would set a timer for an alarm in like 25 mins or so that would wake me up if I actually fell asleep without maintaining consciousness, and repeat about 4-5 times. Only tried it when I could sleep in the next day of course, so not actually depriving myself of sleep. YMMV but maybe something to try.
