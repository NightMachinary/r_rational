I have a German friend who just automagically doesn't need more than six hours of sleep. I wish I had that. I can make do with less sleep for one day if absolutely necessary, but in the long run my body seems to rebel if I go below eight hours a day. Do you do anything special to keep the hours down, or do you just Tell yourself that loud alarm will sound in 6.5 hours and deal with it?
