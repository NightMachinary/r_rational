A couple of reasons I'm against that.

I was brought up in an environment where popping pills was only considered in the case of something serious. It probably sounds ridiculous but I find it hard to even take paracetamol when I legitimately have a bad headache. But this is a mental barrier I really need to get past.

The other reason is it requires a prescription... doesn't it?
