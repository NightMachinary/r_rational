Software solutions will not work; I don't have admin permissions on the Windows/Mac machines I actually do have access to.

Why is the industry's solution to everything just to paper over real problems with yet more leaky abstractions? The entire idea of a software market breaks down when you have support requirements dependent on massive idiot duopolies like this.

I wish making new platforms wasn't so hard, expensive, and goddamn pointless. But when you have new platforms that /necessitate/ dependencies for new software, you get n:n, and n:n:n, and that's never good. That's what POSIX was for, but /nobody fucking uses it./ I hate technology.

Is there some way to engender a market of new platforms that themselves engender markets of software without spiraling into combinatorial explosion? Lowering the cost of platform development is obviously necessary. But in a way that encourages or standardizes platform designs that minimize support complexity?
