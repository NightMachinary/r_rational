  Why is the industry's solution to everything just to paper over real problems with yet more leaky abstractions? The entire idea of a software market breaks down when you have support requirements dependent on massive idiot duopolies like this.

Because industry is often built around enterprise clients, who are willing to maintain an office-wide monoculture, and wanted to move everything onto "the cloud" for safe-keeping anyway, since that was a massive improvement on paying their in-house IT departments to develop in-house solutions.

We are not the end customers of most of the computing industry, not since a combination of open-source competition and cheap, effective piracy cut down on the profit margins from shrink-wrapped software.
