If you are desperate to cut down on your sleep and you can set your own work hours, then there is a well-supported method which allows you to only sleep for 2 hours out of a 24 hour period.

It's called the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep][Uberman Sleep]]. It involves sleeping for exactly 20 minutes every 4 hours on the dot. I know one person who did this for a year, but you *have* to keep to this sleep schedule. If you sleep at the wrong time or for too long, or even just skip a nap, you will find it impossibly difficult to get back on track. However, while transitioning may take a few weeks of exhaustion, you will be alert and focused during your waking hours.

EDIT: I probably should be clear about the one person I know who did this. He claimed to have done so and sounded truthful, but he was only someone I met twice so I don't know how trustworthy he was. In addition, there is a lot of articles online that say how it doesn't work while others claim it's success. [[https://www.supermemo.com/en/articles/polyphasic][Here's]] an article which argues against it in a fair and calm manner.
