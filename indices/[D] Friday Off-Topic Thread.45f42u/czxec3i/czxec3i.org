An experiment on myself to cut down on sleep to 5 hours a day ended with my experiencing sleep paralysis for about 90 seconds. Luckily enough there was no [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis#Classification]['intruder']], so to speak. But the rest of the symptoms were there the main one being a mild feeling of terror that this is how paralytics feel all the time.

Needless to say, I'm back to my normal schedule of a healthy 6.5-7 hours of sleep a night.
