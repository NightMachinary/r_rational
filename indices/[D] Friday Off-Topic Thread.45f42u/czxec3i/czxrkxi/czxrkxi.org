I wanted to get a sleep paralysis experience ever since I've learned about the phenomenon! Unfortunately, my body doesn't work well with sleep deprivation (e.g. shaking hands, pain in extremities, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploding_head_syndrome][exploding head syndrome,]] etc).

Are there any other ways to increase the chance of it happening, maybe someone knows?
