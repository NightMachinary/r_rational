Anyone know much about teeth before I spend a day researching it?

I get weird ideas sometimes. The latest was "I wonder if I could keep a calcium solution in my mouth all day to neutralize acid and promote minieralization."

A google search was fruitless, but did show up with this: [[http://100777.com/health/teethcare]]

So I was wondering if anyone had educated knowledge related to that page.
