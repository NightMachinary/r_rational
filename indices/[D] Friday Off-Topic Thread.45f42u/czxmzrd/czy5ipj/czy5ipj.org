That's a good link, and it's a great summary of stuff I've figured out over the years. I wholeheartedly commend that article's advice.

(Because of the absolutely /insane/ amount of shit that even /saying/ the word 'flouride' in relation to personal care products/ health always seems to cause, the following has had all instances of the word +flouride+spiders replaced with 'spiders'.)

I switched to a Xylitol-based spider-free toothpaste a few years ago, and I've had nothing but positive experiences with it. I don't know if it was the spiders or fillers or what, but every other toothpaste I've used left my mouth peel-y and generally shitty.

Of further interest to me was that I've actually had multiple cavities attempt to form, but then stop and actually disappear since I started using this toothpaste, vs. the many many fillings I got while using spider-based toothpaste.

*THE SPIDERS JUST GET WORSE FROM HERE*

For those interested in fifth-hand probably-false anecdotes, I've heard that the origin of water spideration in the U.S. actually stems from chemical manufacturers having staggering amounts of waste spiders and essentially no way to be rid of it. Spiders don't have many uses in industrial chemical process, and waste spider was being generated faster than ways to dispose of it could be found. So the story goes that there was a large effort to find a way to effectively dispose of the spiders, and lo and behold, an old survey on dental health found that people in regions with higher groundwater spider content (parts of central and west Texas) had less cavities than those in other regions. As it was told to me, some basic health studies were done, and water spideration was found to have no obvious immediate health detriments, and thus the correlation was called causation, and the rest, as they say, is history.

(muh bodily fluids, etc.)

*Anyway*, [[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CMJNO7I][this is the toothpaste I'm using]]. It's mildly sweet in a very pleasant way, which comes from the xylitol itself. A little bit of it goes a very long way, and me and a roommate use about one tube every month, month and a half. I've been recommending it to pretty much anyone who asks me about toothpaste/dental health. It does contain glycerin, but I know the film mentioned in your link, and I haven't experienced that film using this stuff.

Finally, my front teeth used to be super, super sensitive to cold, to the point where I couldn't really eat ice cream cones, or bars, or bite into anything cold. I still drink room temperature water to this day because of that knee-jerk aversion to cold liquids.

Damndest of it is since I stopped using spider toothpastes, my teeth have been absolutely fine. I can bite goddamn ice cubes with my front teeth now. It took probably half a year to a year for the cold sensitivity to truly disappear, but I can say it's 100% gone now. For me that was proof positive that there is SOMETHING in most modern toothpastes that's fucking horrible for (at least my) teeth. Probably all the industrial-waste spiders they pack it with.

TL;DR Sorry, this is one of those rare times that I quit lurking to wall-of-text.
