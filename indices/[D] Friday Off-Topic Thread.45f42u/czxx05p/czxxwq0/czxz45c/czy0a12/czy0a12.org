Hmm, not having admin permissions makes things pretty hard. The real moral of the story here might be to only use linux. This has never failed me, except all the times I run into problems. I just use linux machines and send info to a linux box with all the stuff. This means I have to do some funny contortions at times (like writing resumes; I have to do all mine in LaTeX) to make it work. Don't get me started on finagling a blu-ray drive to work properly with blu-ray DRM on a linux box!

If you don't have admin permissions, you'll be stuck with FAT32 or Dropbox or something AFAIK. I feel like there should be a way to send backups over FTP Even without admin permission, maybe using time machine to aim at a remote drive, for example??? But hopefully someone with more know-how and experience with these things will come with a better suggestion than I have.
