Privacy (without encryption) and off-network reliability are both plusses, but those are mostly in addition to increased storage space for a one-time fee. I have 2.8G of free Dropbox space; I got 62GB (57.75 GiB, those cheap bastards) of USB space for ~30 dollars, most of which was in gift cards. While it isn't 1TB, it also doesn't cost 10 dollars a month to sustain. I expect this purchase to last years like my smaller USB sticks, unless manufacturing has gotten significantly shittier.
