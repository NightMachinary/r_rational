Something I just found: [[https://09cd64678bddc0198cca7fef0df8ce7b359fff2d.googledrive.com/host/0B3Z9sXPTD9rpN2owNGdVWmdFWXM/agp.html][The All-Guardsman Party]]. It's a well-written and very funny write up of a Warhammer 40k campaign. I went in knowing nothing at all about W40k and I was fine. The first chapter is fun but not funny, the following ones had me cracking up. If you want to skip the first chapter it boils down to "we role-played a regiment being wiped out" (I don't consider it a spoiler because it's clear in the first couple paragraphs.)
