*Seeking info: Blockchains and bitcoins*

I'm noodling with the idea of a protagonist setting up a new blockchain and bitcoin-like currency, to have something cash-like to start a prediction market with. Anyone know enough on the topic to recommend one style of blockchain over another, or clever tricks that could be applied to the design; or know a subreddit, reference, third-party, or other thingummy that might help?
