That is, indeed, the goal. And alternatives to prediction markets, such as the Delphi method ( [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_method]] ), will be considered, and possibly even experimented with.

That's been on my to-read list for a while, but you've just convinced me to move it to the top of the pile. :)

That said, my protagonist is going to have at least one major difficulty applying what you describe: The only people he has to draw on are himself, and copies of himself. I've already pencilled in a failure of the prediction market due to an overconfident consensus, and attempts to deliberately nudge the copies into different headspaces... and I'm considering more severe, arguably less ethical experimentation later on.
