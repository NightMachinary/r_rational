The prediction market that participated in this competition was DAGGRE by Robin Hanson.

The people behind the competition (IARPA) seem to be prejudiced against betting and crowds of forecasters in favor of experts.

Only paying for participation and not for accuracy was allowed (which is the whole point of a prediction market).

Also everything that can give you an edge in a prediction market (Delphi Method, Insider Knowledge, Superforecasters, etc ...) can be used to gain money by improving the accuracy of the market.
