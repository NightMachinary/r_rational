Are you also interested in designs of the prediction market itself? I'm not really an expert but I have been searching about that recently. The best explanation about market makers I could find was from the Augur project. LMSR (Hansons Algorithm) and an adaption of that. Augur is also interesting in itself because it is decentralised. Harder to shut down for your protagonists enemies (if any).
