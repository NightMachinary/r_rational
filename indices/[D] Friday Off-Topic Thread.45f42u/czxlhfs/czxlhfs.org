Watched Deadpool. 6/10. Bought into the hype and expected snark, sex and violence. Got a normal Hollwood movie with a few extra broken limbs and sex jokes. The fourth wall jokes were mostly disappointing. Deadpool pointing out that the studio couldn't afford 'real' x-men as sidekicks was about as good as it got.

Luke warm recommendation. If you wanna go to the movies, see something else or be drunk.
