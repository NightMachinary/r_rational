I enjoyed the silly jokes because that's what I was expecting from the movie based on its trailers.

What was disappointing though was Deadpool freaking out about how he /looks/ and not getting back in touch with his girlfriend right after his escape. It's just that, their meeting scene made me evaluate both of them as people who wouldn't care about someone's looks that much and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralistic_ignorance][would expect the same attitude from their partner]] as well.

But the scenarists made getting to that level of trust the whole point of the movie and the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop][credit-roll aesop,]] reducing the film for many to a one-time watch thing --- if even that.

Similarly, for a character that's supposed to be both [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy][genre savvy]] and [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness][medium aware,]] the blundered nightclub protection scene was horrible as well.
