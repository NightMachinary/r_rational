I have read the book and can recommend it. Solid advice on how to improve forecasts.

The thing to keep in mind is I think that Tetlock tries to improve the accuracy of the US intelligence community and not accuracy in general. That probably involves a lot of politics. Prediction markets are still the best bet IMHO (pun intended).

In case you haven't seen it yet here are two articles on slatestarcodex about this book.
