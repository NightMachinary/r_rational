I think this ties into my theory that a human utopia would ultimately resemble a Massive Multiplayer Role Playing Game in design. Which honestly DO take after theme parks in over all design.

Also don't underestimate how much high end infrastructure engineering goes into designing the 'path' of a theme park.

The biggest complaints I actually have for theme parks is that they don't have as much lavish awesome attention to detail as they COULD have.

But ya if the same degree of engineering and aesthetic mood improving experience went into every city street and every suburb as goes into disneyland and theme park experiences the world would probably have happier people in it.
