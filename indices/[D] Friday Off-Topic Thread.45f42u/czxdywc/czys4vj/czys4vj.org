  The humanity is staggering! This is my CEV as a locus. May the coming AI tile the world in this shit.

/Shit/ it is. It's a nonstop sensory overload of duplicitous sell-you-stuff bullshit, and it drives me mad every time I expose myself.

And I really, really love waterslides and rollercoasters and even those low-key rides where you get strapped into a chair that swings around an elliptical centrifugal arc /and it's like your flying/. Oh, and the actual centrifuges where you defy gravity temporarily because you're pressed too hard against the walls.

But seriously, I will march a horde of Orks at any attempt to tile the universe in the capitalist bullshit associated with current theme parks, and then I will rebuild them as glorious socialist theme parks, where you don't have to Adult so damn hard your whole time there and can actually relax and enjoy it.

Won't it just be nicer when the only cosplayers are the people who /want/ to cosplay, as whatever they like? When you don't have to shlep a 5kg bag of sandwiches and water bottles around /all damn day/ because there's actually affordable or free supplies for keeping yourself going /available/ instead of having unhealthy, bad-tasting, overexpensive crap pushed on you? When the games aren't rigged? When cheap souvenirs aren't being pushed?

But anyway, yeah, army of Orks. WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH! Because that is how I react to being told that the future should be tiled in the lowest dreck of late-capitalism.
