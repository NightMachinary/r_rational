Sure, an AI could persuade me to exit the box, but I imagine that it's more "months of manipulation" than "a half-hour conversation". This is drawn from my own experiences of watching anyone try to persuade anyone of anything.

(Then again, thinking of this I've just realised that there's a whole bunch of stuff that triggers me and if I was somehow compelled to be in a chatroom with someone they could totally just hammer on those triggers until I free the AI just to get them to shut up. I now realise why people talk about AI boxing being so emotionally draining and relationship hurting and dark arts and stuff.)
