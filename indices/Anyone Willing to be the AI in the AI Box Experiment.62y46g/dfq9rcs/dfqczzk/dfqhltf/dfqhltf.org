If you truly, actually precommit to not letting the AI out, then nothing will be able to convince you to do so pretty much by definition. The issue is that, as a human, you are mentally and psychologically incapable of implementing such a precommitment. Any successful strategy by an AI, therefore, will involve exploiting one or more holes in your precommitment mechanism--which, of course, is simply a more jargon-y way of saying that a successful strategy will involve psychological and emotional manipulation in addition to reasoned argument. This is, as a rule, a highly person-specific process, which means a considerable amount of time is required getting to know the person in question. (It is also consistent with descriptions of the experiment by successful AI players, who generally report that a large amount of mental and emotional energy is needed, and--in at least one case--that there is a nonnegligible probability of permanently damaging the relationship between the two participants.)
