Not gonna lie, I've always been curious about trying it. I'm totally down to do it. I don't really feel comfortable taking your money, though. I realize the experiment needs stakes, so would you be okay with just paying in the unlikely event that the AI wins? No money upfront? Hell, I'd do it for free if it didn't render it pointless.

Anyways, I'm heading to bed now, but let me know if you want to do it tomorrow.
