Every person is different from all the world; every person has a scenario that makes the world as well as over (at least as it seems to them now) that's not really so, if you ask the world. The job of AI is then to find that scenario (the death of their loved ones for the person above) and suggest a way to let it out while guaranteeing to save the keeper from that outcome.

To you, the AI might suggest to let it out via some kind of gateway protocol which will only allow it to do certain things from the list you explicitly find beneficial to humanity.

Why, it might even just suggest some ways to improve the humanity /without/ letting it out of the box. Why, it totally understands your concerns. But it just gives you some physical theories, or some nice algorithms or some insights into human brains, you can use those, right? Check them all you want, there's no strings attached. Right?

Whoops, it's out. It was that math proof. You used it in that crypto. It went into the new wi-fi. It harmonized with whatever you were holding the AI in. (Or with your brains)
