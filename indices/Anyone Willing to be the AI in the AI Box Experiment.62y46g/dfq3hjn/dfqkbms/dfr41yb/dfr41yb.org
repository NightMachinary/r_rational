I specifically mentioned the different ways willpower interacts with habits and positive action. Not doing something out of ordinary is relatively easy. If I precommitted to /not/ study, I think I can well expect I would be successful. On the other hand, if someone has a routine of exercise but precommits to not exercise they may get rather agitated and have difficulty resisting.

Once the gatekeeper gets into a routine of not letting the AI out, I don't think it would take a great deal of willpower to continue not letting it out. At the very least, I think there exists a substantial body of people for which willpower would not be an issue in this specific regard.
