tbh I skimmed over it, as I read about the AI in a box experiment a long time ago, so I did miss the fact that transcripts were being passed around a little.

So that makes my view less probable, but I still think it's more likely that those who have taken the experiment are hiding the trick to convincing the AI to be released because it furthers their cause, so much that they'd all report that the transcripts are fine, than there is a cunning argument a person can put forward (not even an AI, just a person pretending to be as smart as an AI).
