I find that a pretty BS reason for not publishing the transcripts. Wouldn't it be better for us to build up a list of successful AI winning strategies, so we could be mentally better prepared to deal with them?

Also, I actually always thought that the reasons most transcripts stayed private was that they involved the AI blackmailing the Gatekeeper with private stuff that should */never/* be publicly released.
