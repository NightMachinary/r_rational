It's very easy to assume you will be rational sitting in comfort thinking about it theoretically. yet the fact remains several people who are well informed about AI issues and consider themselves rationalists lost to a human even after claiming they didn't think they could be beaten.

The whole point of emotional lines of attack is that they make us irrational. You can't imagine yourself succumbing because you aren't in that state of mind.

Anyone who was PERFECTLY rational would literally be ruling the planet. The information and means are all available to understand what avenues lead to power and pursue them relentlessly. The fact that no one has done this shows we are all susceptible to human foibles.
