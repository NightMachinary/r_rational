Just because you can't think of a line that leads to it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

Here's an interesting fact - when I tell "rational" people about this they assume they cannot lose. But when I told my wife about the experiment - a performer, actress, studied cold reading, good with people, high emotional intelligence- she immediately believed it could be done, and laughed that anyone thought themselves invincible.

Engineers see themselves as rational machines and are blind to their emotional biases and vulnerabilities. Thinking you don't just means you're more ignorant of them.
