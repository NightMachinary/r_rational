Since I've heard that the tactics used to win in the past have often been emotionally abusive and sort of "evil" I'm curious what those might be like, in fact to someone like me who wants to become emotionally tougher it is actually an appeal to playing gatekeeper (I would have no chance of winning as an AI I just lack the social skills).

I'd be curious the correlation between people who can do well as a gatekeeper against competent AI parties, and people who can successfully run the gauntlet (basically a bunch of extremely disturbing videos that you have to sit through for an hour or two, occasionally clicking Next to go to the next video).\\
Most people can't seem to pass the gauntlet so that makes me think most people couldn't succeed as gatekeeper against a good enough AI player, of course I did pass it so that also makes me somewhat more confident of my chances.

They seem fairly analogous because in both cases all you have to do is endure psychological discomfort for a relatively short period of time, with a minimal required level of interaction.
