yeah, i'm having a hard time believing EY really did that... and the unreleased script is medium evidence supporting my view. the fact that he won't repeat the game is also evidence against it really happening the way he says.

the way HPMOR was written (let's be honest, the themes and values are dear to most of us, but the literary quality isn't there and the ending sucked) doesn't suggest the author is such a genius.

also, it is standard practice in a scientific experiment to release the raw data, not just the result, therefor I oppose the naming of this game as an "experiment" unless you intend to give us the script when you are done...

what I'm leading to is simply: please try not to worship EY too much, I believe he lies to inflate his ego...

let's go: crucify me for criticizing your idol!
