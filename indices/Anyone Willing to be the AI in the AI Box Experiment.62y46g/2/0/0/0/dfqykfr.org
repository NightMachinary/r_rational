Regarding the peer review papers... [[https://intelligence.org/all-publications/]] I'll admit it's not much compared to another organization that publishes papers to make money, but it's still a fair amount.

The similarities to a cult are there. Especially the big one: promises to save humanity. The problem with that theory is the sequences make sense. And by sense I mean actual scientific sense backed up by sources. I'm still wary about donating to MIRI though since he hasn't released a progress bar on how they're going with the AI research.
