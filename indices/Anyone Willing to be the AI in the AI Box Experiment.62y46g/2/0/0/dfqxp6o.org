*pleased by the lack of crucifiction so far"

By "not repeating" the experiment i really meant "won't do it again" so we cann't see for ourselves (i promess i'm not moving the goalpost, i didn't realise i was unclear ) He apparently won once or twice (unprovable since we have no script) attributable to connivance or even just a fluke, then stopped before his success rate droped too low... (His excuse that he didn't like what it was making him into seems a bit far fetched)

I have read lots of fiction... I mean sure, hpmor is better than many FANfiction (which are usually written by teenager) but it doesn't compare to actual published book (which to be fair are proofread by the editor). I guess my main beef is the whole clumsy storyline for the second half which is just HP going full-on Slytherin with Voldi (i interpret this as immature, thinking he's so much smarter than everyone else. Ruthless =/= clever) (still more and better than anything i ever wrote, but one doesn't have to be a good cook to be a food-critic).

Thank you for the script, even if the prisonner lost. hopefully we could get a few more tries to see if we can replicate his result. I doubt it since prisonner escaping by talking to their jailer are unheard of (except in movies like the last sherlock) and prisonner usually know their jailer much better and have a very long time to convince them...

Reguarding the lying, i'll admit i don't have much evidence : only that he is just a selftaught blogger (and a fanfiction author) that calls himself AI researcher despite having no peer reviewed papers, encourages people to donate as much as they can (justified by his fearmongering about AI) to his fondation despite it having made little meaningfull contribution to the field of AI. To me the similarities with religious crook are striking enough that i am unlikely to ever trust him, hence why i wrote "i believe he lies" and not just "he lies".
