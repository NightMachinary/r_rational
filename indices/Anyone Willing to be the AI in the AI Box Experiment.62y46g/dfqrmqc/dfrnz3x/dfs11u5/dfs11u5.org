The whole using IRL blackmail on the gatekeeper doesn't really hold up very well as explanation. You really think not a single gatekeeper refused to cave in, then released the transcripts and called the cops should they try to follow through on their threats?

Weasel words don't help your position, where did you hear this and from who?

As for blackmail supposedly related to "sensitive and private matters" how exactly do you propose that works in practice? I mean they only have access to information about the person they can find online, and they generally agree to take part in the experiment before there would be time for the AI party to ensure they have good dirt. Also what about people who play gatekeeper multiple times and lose one of those times (but go on to play more in the future), why would somebody continue playing if they knew they were likely to suffer serious IRL consequences?\\
Plus as I said before you really shouldn't expect everyone to cooperate so blackmail will guarantee that some people would release their transcripts and refuse to cooperate. I mean especially since banks already have antifraud measures, so they probably can't steal all your money, and do you really want to assume that most of these gatekeepers have extremely good dirt?

Also this makes no sense from the AI parties perspective, since there is usually very little if any money riding on things. I mean are most of these winners really willing to put themselves at the serious risk required of of blackmail? I mean they ought to expect to have to actually do something to make the other party take the threat seriously, so they can't just be all talk.
