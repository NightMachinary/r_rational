Yeah, actual real-life blackmail to try to win the game would be stupid, and that wasn't what I was trying to suggest. But we can't ignore the possibility that it's something a boxed AI might try in reality.

  Holding the planet hostage won't work, because the person playing the AI doesn't have the power to do so. The AI only wins if the Gatekeeper says the AI wins, not if it destroys the world. The gatekeeper can simply let the world be destroyed, and still win.

That's true; but having the Gatekeeper win in the ruins of a destroyed world feels like a rather pyrrhic victory to me.

...besides, you never know, it just might work.
