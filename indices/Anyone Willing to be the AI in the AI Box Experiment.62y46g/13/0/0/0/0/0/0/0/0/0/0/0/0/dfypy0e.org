Yes, I get your basic point. You're trying to control the AI be preventing it from gaining sufficient information to be truly harmful.

However, you must give it /some/ information to get anything useful out of it. This leaves you with a delicate tightrope to walk - you can't give it too much information, you can't give it too little information. Worse yet, the AI is (probably a good deal) more intelligent than you - it can make deductions that you wouldn't expect, and may very well come up with a proof of the existence of rice pudding before you even send it the first byte, or extrapolate humanity from the DNA in a cancer cell. You /will/ be giving it more information than you think you are giving it, that's almost inevitable; so how can you be sure you don't give it /too/ much?
