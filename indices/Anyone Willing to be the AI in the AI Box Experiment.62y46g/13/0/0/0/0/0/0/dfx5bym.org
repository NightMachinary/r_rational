That just shifts the goalposts. Now, instead of having a virus whose side effects are /immediately/ apparent, the AI merely needs to create a virus whose side effects don't appear until after it has passed all your tests and been released into the wide world out there.

Maybe the side effects only turn up after it's been in contact with the 2019 flu virus - the AI having predicted how the flu would mutate over the next two years?

And it doesn't have to be a virus. The basic principle remains the same - a sufficiently intelligent AI can slip something past all your tests, unless you simply never use /anything/ the AI gives you.
