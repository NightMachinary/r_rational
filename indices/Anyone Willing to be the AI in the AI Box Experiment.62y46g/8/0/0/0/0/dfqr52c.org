Hmm I'm thinking maybe somebody should make a AI box arrangement thread, maybe it should go in the monday general rationality thread, but since it's likely to be an RP thing it's sort of rational fiction (or any transcripts would be) so maybe you could also justify it getting its own post.

The last thing I can find with people arranging AI box experiments is several years old so I think it would be nice to get another one.\\
Anyway I really want to either see some logs where the AI wins (especially one's where the gatekeeper was pretty sure they couldn't be convinced by a human) or if that fails it may actually be easier to take part in a AI box experiment.
