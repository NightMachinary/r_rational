What a great chapter. Ram tests the limits of his power and gets what he wants. Even if he cooperates from here on out, or if he gets overruled from time to time, he has set a precedent.

Ram is clearly brave, fairly cunning, and a solid tactician. He has what it takes to rule the realm, and I think we could see him become a young Napoleon, Alexander, or a corpse.
