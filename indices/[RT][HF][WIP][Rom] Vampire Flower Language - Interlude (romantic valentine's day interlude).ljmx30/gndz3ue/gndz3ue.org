There's a question mark because it's maybe not the type of romance people were hoping for?

This interlude is thanks to a discussion with [[/u/ccc_037]] who constantly chided me to include more senses than just sight in my writing. As a result, I thought about how humans and vampires might seem different in terms of different senses. This interlude echos a scene in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13710744/chapters/46647706][Chapter 5]].
