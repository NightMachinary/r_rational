Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts, it means a lot.

  I find myself inferring and guessing facts about the greater vampire society based off the snippets we get from william and the interlude characters

oh goodness that's such a wonderful thing!! I am so eager to hear your guesses, but regardless I'm glad the writing is making you think about them!

  Not enough thoughtful, emotionally mature relationships
#+end_quote

Let me tell you, I wanted so badly to write a romance where there's conflict/etc but where the characters are being emotionally mature and making honest attempts to communicate well.

I also wanted to write something a bit different than the usual [[/r/rational]] fare, something in a genre more traditionally associated with women rather than the sci fi/fantasy/superhero stuff.

  Keep up the good work, I'm eagerly awaiting more chapters!

Thank you! Unless the story undergoes sudden and huge expansion in number of chapters (I realised the other day that instead of two chapters worth of content remaining, there's three), it'll be finished about six months from now. I hope the ending is worthy of the emotional energy people seem to be investing into it!
