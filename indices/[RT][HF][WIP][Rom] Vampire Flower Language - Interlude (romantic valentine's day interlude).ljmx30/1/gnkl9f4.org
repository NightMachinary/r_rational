Just picked up and caught up with this story in the past day or so, and I love it so far. You've captured my favorite thing about mysteries in literature, where I find myself inferring and guessing facts about the greater vampire society based off the snippets we get from william and the interlude characters. I ALSO am a big fan of the romance, it's affirming as all hell. Not enough thoughtful, emotionally mature relationships in this particular genre, so finding one in VFL (that's the main thread of the story, no less!) made me smile ðŸ˜Š.

Keep up the good work, I'm eagerly awaiting more chapters!
