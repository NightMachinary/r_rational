Ehh... I think it's feasible; the juicy andalite brain is possibly so much beyond our own wetware that it could come up with a better way to manipulate.

I'd also add that they'd leave the "brain controlling slug" part out of the first contact materials. Maybe have hork bajir controllers pose as the visitors.

There's plenty of good ideas in this thread so this one may not be the best, but I think it's not quite as pathetic as you make it out to be.
