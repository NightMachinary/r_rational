The thing is, they maybe could afford to lie about this stuff if they didn't already have enemies who know the truth, and if the lies weren't so easy to disprove. As is, proving that the yeerks are out to get us is trivial.

Like, let's say the yeerks want to only show Hork Bajiirs as their public side. They leave out the whole "mind-control slug" part, and say they're a bunch or tree dwellers who escaped to space when the Andalites destroyed their homeworld with a quantum virus. Everyone is a bit suspicious, but a priori believes them.

The very next thing that will happen is the american president will show up and say "No, the aliens are trying to fool us. They're actually mind-control slugs who are nested in the brains of the tree-dwellers, against their will." Even if the "against their will" part is hard to prove, the "mind-control slug" part is super-easy: just demand that the yeerks send, let's say, twenty hork-bajiirs, and keep them in secure containment for three days, the watch what happens. The yeerks will probably refuse, and cite some reasons, like, maybe the tree dwellers need to feed in conditions only available in the mothership.

So the world leaders say, "Fine, this is somewhat suspicious, but then just let us send our own investigators in your mothership to follow randomly selected Hork-Bajiirs around, and observe their feeding process". The yeerks might invent something, like the ship is not hospitable to humans, and the authorities might ask them to submit to other tests (like putting non-reproducible seals around the hork-bajiir's ears, or asking for human probes to be allowed in the mothership), but my point is that the world leaders would /ask/ those questions, and would never trust the aliens until they had disproved those claims, and they would look for threachery in the answers the aliens give and the tests they would accept.

Because, again, the concept of aliens pretending to be friendly but actually being hostile is /super obvious/ and basically as old as the concept of aliens and everyone would be thinking about it. If the yeerks went public and tried to appear friendly, everyone would be looking for signs of deception and betrayal, especially after the meteor strike, and especially since the yeerks would refuse falsifications tests like quarantine or MRI scans.
