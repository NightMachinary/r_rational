In V3's shoes, I would go the KGB and psychological route... Open war would be avoided at all costs. Certainly flattening a country with plausible denial wouldn't be out of the question, but it's still a last resort. Get into influential organizations and roles, as well as numerous people on the ground.

Reduce the number of controllers in America specifically, leaving specialized task forces to counter the efforts of the kids, but move the base of operations to North Korea. America is still under the effects of the 'drug war' during this time, and the majority of the public agrees with the stance. V3, by taking over organizations like SWAT or NatGuard, can take kids out via bureacracy and some 'accidents' during 'drug raids'. No need to make everyone a controller to fight the Animorphs.

Then, while using the 'drug war' as pretense for fighting the kids, I would begin focusing on NK, and once again, no need to get EVERYONE as a controller. Just enough people, say 1/3-2/3 to keep the rest under control until more resources become available.

From NK, I would begin moving to China and South Korea. V3 could even start playing the fool in America so the Animorphs are distracted while his main focus becomes communist and socialist countries. Even instigating a war between NK and SK would not be out of the question.
