Hong Kong would be harder to go without noticing, because it's not under as much control by the communist government of China, therefore I would suggest NK or mainlaind China. North Korea would give a good start for sheer numbers, good control of information. In modern america, (even 1990's) it would be extremely difficult to keep things quiet forever without launching into some kind of war.

If you can land in China or other communist countries, they would make the best places, IMO.

Additionally, If you can build a second pool, you could be keeping the kids in America occupied with a residual force there, but focusing on other countries.

The kids wouldn't be able to infiltrate as easily due to the 2 hour limits of transformations, and when they de-morph, they would stick out like sore thumbs.

I can see few downsides to going to more controlled countries.
