You know what, NK would be absolutely insane if V3 targeted that. Infest Kim Jong-il (who was leading NK at the time) and have him tell every NK citizen to stick their heads in this lovely pool over here. And they'd /probably do it without question/.

Not to mention, V3 would be able to do so many things out in the open behind NK's borders...Screw HK, go NK! Bonus is that all those conspiracy theories about what really goes on in NK just gets that much crazier.
