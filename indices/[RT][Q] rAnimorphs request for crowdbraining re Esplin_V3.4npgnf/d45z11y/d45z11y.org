Let's see. If I were V3...I would go with a change up to the slow infiltration, because V1 is probably breathing down my neck. From my analysis of human society, I'd move international and pick a highly populated location such as Hong Kong. Why?

- Island of huge economic importance.

- Tons of hosts (according to wiki, /7.03 million/ in 2009)

- A subway system, already underground, that would allow me to bring in hosts literally by the trainful.

- Due to the size of the island, every human is in very short range of the pool and doesn't even require a car to get there, due to public transit.

- Extremely defensible, I'd just have to park a perimeter of Bug fighters around the coast and laugh. Nuking the island would create tidal waves that would threaten every single coast connected to the Pacific, not to mention that I could hold that entire island at ransom at risk of destabilizing the global economy.
