Visser Three has clones, but the clones can't morph. Also, they're clones of his Yeerk, not of the Yeerk-Andalite combo, and they're not even properly clones of his Yeerk so much as blank templates that respond to Z-space signals a la the morphing tech.

The way this played in my mind is, V3's been doing as much research as he could into reverse engineering the morphing. He hasn't managed to recreate the nanotech, nor has he been able to figure out what kind of processing is going on behind the scenes in Seerow's version. What he /has/ been able to do is isolate external, visible things, like registering that there is Yeerk tissue inside of a morph, and that there is a unique Z-space frequency involved in the connection between the real body and the construct.

Based off that, he's been able to get blank template Yeerks that'll respond to his own thoughts. He doesn't have any processors to run them, so he brute-forces it using Alloran's attention-splitting Andalite brain.
