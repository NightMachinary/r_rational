I think the importance of the human population is dwarfed by the importance of the Escafil device, and that everything he does should be aimed at the latter. Yeerks munchkining morphing en masse would be ludicrously OP.

Although, I am confused how Visser has clones without also allowing similar OP consequences to result.

I think the conflict feels a little artificial given that the Yeerks have so much more power still. You should give the Animorphs access to Visser's brain somehow so they can start doing bold important things.
