Supply lines are the biggest concern. Yeerks are kandrona-limited. The system of rotating through Yeerks in stasis is clever, but limited by the need to restock.

That necessitates bi-directional transfer, which is by no means easy (try getting 10 stasis tubes through airport security). If you have a way to facilitate that process you can more easily decouple your controllers from the pool.

Spread out enough and no resistance, however numerous, would be able to stop the Yeerks covertly. Even if they made 100 new Animorphs a day and each Animorph checked 100 unique Yeerk candidates a day, they'd only be able to vet ~56,000,000 people before the backup fleet arrived. There's no way that the scale would be anywhere near that without some tech breakthrough for the resistance, yet even that figure wouldn't be enough.

Unfortunately I don't have any great ideas on that front. Perhaps convert people in charge of some real-world supply lines (e.g. freight, airlines) and use them to assist in shipping Yeerks. Seems vulnerable, however; even one controller being morphed that had a memory of opening a package labelled "Ye. Erk Shipping Co." would tear down the whole enterprise.

Second issue: for the Animorphs, being able to mass produce the Andalite ear condoms is crucial. V3 should expect them to attempt to push that process along, which means that he may need to prioritise capturing people with such implants alive in order to potentially subvert them (or simply preventing the research, though that is a less desirable outcome). If he manages that, then the Animorphs essentially have no win condition short of utterly obliterating the Yeerks too quickly for them to bombard the planet; destroying the pools then may save humanity from enslavement, but there's always meteors. By contrast, with uncompromised Yeerk-protection the devices can be distributed to operatives who can hand them out as soon as the mass destruction threat is neutralised.

Does V3 know the Animorphs can read the minds of their morphs? If so, he's aware that every high-profile controller is at risk of discovery. It may not be likely, but it's a possibility that increases with their apparent strategic importance. So he would probably devote some of his Yeerks to roles that don't appear quite as important, but could get close to key targets.

Ideas for hosts:

- Famous journalists, of the sort that might be able to get a meeting with an eminent politician or CEO if needed.
- Surgeons at world-class hospitals (or at a local hospital; if a particular target is needed, you could always just stage an assault to injure them).
- Escorts for the rich and powerful, who additionally may know crucial secrets (or have ordinary human leverage over their clients; you don't need a Yeerk if all you need is to partially control somebody).
- Intelligent but not world-famous scientists and engineers, because being able to apply their minds to Yeerk tech could make up for the low number of Naharan hosts.
- The intelligence operation in some random country with no other connection to the invasion. Leverage their connections and spying capabilities to pinpoint the resistance. May even be impossible for the Animorphs to know, though the question of how to turn these people into controllers with no infrastructure and without leaving a trail is harder.

Obviously these are most useful if the supply problem can be solved, but could retain some utility even with a more clumsy solution (like flying a private plane loaded with stasis tubes once every month).
