This suggests that maybe the yeerks going public and 'transparently benevolent' might actually be a very very effective strategy.

Effectively completely switch gears, be completely open and give the human scientists around the globe some distant astronomical object/event to confirm stuff.

The yeerks are symbiotic, they are stuck in a war of attrition, their enemies the andalites have already made at least ONE attempt in destroying the earth.

Hell maybe even swing the asteroid impact as an andalite attack.

For bonus points spin some press that andalite bandits may be subverting other earth countries now that their space war has been lost.

Yeerks come off as magnanimous, also being OPEN about the fact yeerks need hosts, being polite, asking for volunteers, opening up borders and trade with any nations.

Essentially if visser 3 swings the effort to be completely the good guy and can win over or at the very least destabalize the unity of humanity he will go a long way. Focusing on reinforcing and supporting the nations with the greatest suffering/need with 'miracle technology'.

those nations also happen to be the largest populations on earth too.
