I've always enjoyed stories that explore this alternative method of invasion. I don't feel it works in this story, though, for a few reasons:

- Andalite arrogance, Alloran would never think of it, and V3 does rely on his host to do a fair amount of scheming.

- V3 is also probably equally arrogant. I'd say this idea would be more in line with V1's style of thinking, as an alternative to The Sharing.
