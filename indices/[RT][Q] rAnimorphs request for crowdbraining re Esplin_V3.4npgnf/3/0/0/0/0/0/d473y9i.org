Yeah, but all you have to do to disprove that claim is follow a Controller around to a pool. The thing is, even is a government believes the yeerks (different countries may have different reactions, after all), they still won't be allowed to walk around without massive oversight.

And there are already people who know they're there, who witnessed the invasion, and can give their own negative account of the invasion. The word of an animorph or an ex-controller isn't proof of anything, but will certainly give wordwide governments cause to distrust.
