"Do the yeerks continue their secret invasion when discovered by enemies that are willing to work in secret?" is something I've been wondering about for years (did I mention I really wish there were more good Animorphs fanfiction out there?).

Basically the invasion is a negative sum game with a sum very close to zero. For every human on earth, there are three outcomes: free (bad for yeerks, good for humans), controlled (the opposite), or dead. The last one is bad for humans, but slightly better than controlled, and bad for yeerks but slightly better than free since they're somewhat spiteful.

So yeerks and human cannot expect to cooperate, and in the absence of a common threat (like Andalites about to purge everything), everything that's good for humans is roughly as bad for yeerks. Which means that, one side can only decide to keep the secrecy if they are highly confident it will benefit them more than their enemy. But if they're confident it benefits them, then the other side can deduce from this confidence that the secrecy harms them, and so will break the secrecy themselves. This is especially true because, even if each side decides they can profit from the secrecy, both can deduce from the other's silence that they might have advantages they don't know about, which means the safe path is to go public anyway.

To summarize, both sides can only maintain secrecy if, [A], they're really confident that the secrecy doesn't benefit one side more than the other AND that the other side will have come to the same conclusion (and are reasonably confident the other side doesn't have secret weapons), [B], they're both really confident they secret advantages are stronger than their opponent's secret advantage. Not sure how B would work, actually, since if you're super confident then your enemy should be super worried, and if they're confident anyway then you should be super super worried, etc... Then again, having a good model of these problems is hard.

Anyway, not sure any of this is relevant. It only takes one person with a phone camera getting a good look of the spaceship for everything to snowball. I don't think the crash could reliably be covered up from the public.
