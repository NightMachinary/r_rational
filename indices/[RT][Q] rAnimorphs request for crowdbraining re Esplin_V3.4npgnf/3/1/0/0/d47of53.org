  Game theory and infinite recursion aside, the keeping the invasion secret probably advantages the yeerks, so the government will go public; the only interest in keeping the public in the dark about the yeerks was to lure Visser 3 into a false sense of security (as opposed to scanning the planets for xenotech labs and hidden military bases). That ship has now sailed, and keeping the public in the dark will only make yeerk operations easier.

/Unless/ the Yeerk response to the secret being out is (expected to be) a scorched-earth "flatten half the humans and Control the rest" operation using overwhelming force. This would be second prize for the Yeerks (getting /all/ the human hosts with an intact infrastructure is by far the best result for them) but an absolutely terrible result for the humans; if we assume that that /is/ the Yeerk backup plan, then there is good reason for humans in the know to at least maintain most of the masquerade.
