I'd be manufacturing those portable yeerk emergency infestation thingies as quickly as possible and doing a blitz infestation of as much of the population as possible while still keeping it a secret. Infestation is a pretty perfect crime, literally all you need is no witnesses for the actual infestation. I don't see how the humans would figure it out quickly.

After that...depending on the degree to which human military resistance is a threat, I guess the Europe, UK, USA population is too low to be worth the effort of putting up with their more technologically advanced warfare. So... you might just do away with them from space once the secret is out - Asia and Africa alone will yield a cool 5 billion hosts.

The human population has historically been able to double in 20 years even without actively trying to reproduce quickly. The world record for most children birthed is 69, I'm sure technological assistance could increase that. So I don't see it as crucial to grab all 7 billion hosts.

Yeerks have superior technology and don't suffer from coordination problems the way humanity, I'm not sure I see the use of saving Earth's tech infrastructure.
