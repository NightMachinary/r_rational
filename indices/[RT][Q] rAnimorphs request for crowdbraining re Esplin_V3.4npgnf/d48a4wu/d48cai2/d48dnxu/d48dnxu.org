Hmm, I mean even without the high-tech stasis devices and weapons, if you are willing to work with the 3 day constraint I imagine a taser and a yeerk in a tupperware box would accomplish much the same thing in terms of blitz infestations. You could easily get families and roommates and such while they are sleeping, any close friends you spend one on one time with, ambush people who are walking alone at night, break into houses and infest everyone and if anyone asks questions it was a robbery, arrange one on one meetings with every member of an organization / school / work / prison etc. Anyone who ever goes to the hospital. Infestations can spread through the social network very, very rapidly if you remove the "get them to the pool" constraint.

Hmm...well I imagine that even given nothing but human technological know-how and human resources, rebuilding human-level infrastructure is a cinch if you don't have to worry about human coordination problems, but this should not necessarily be assumed. (And I guess I'm assuming the Yeerk hivemind is excused from coordination problems due to being a hivemind but this may also not be true)

  not well-understood by the Yeerk population as a whole.

Oh, I thought they had a hivemind where they shared experience and knowledge from their hosts?
