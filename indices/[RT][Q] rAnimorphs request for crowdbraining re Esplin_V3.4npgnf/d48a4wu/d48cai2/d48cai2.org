Good points, with one caveat---

This hasn't been made clear in r!Animorphs yet, but it's true in canon and probably true here: the Yeerk homeworld is fully blockaded, and most of the other planets they've taken or attacked are embroiled in open warfare. They don't have any strongholds where materiel is being produced en masse, and much of their technology is stolen and not well-understood by the Yeerk population as a whole.

In general, the Yeerks are something like a medieval town that got transplanted into the space age three years ago. They've updated and they're learning, and they benefit from being able to easily share expertise, but they've still got a ways to go.
