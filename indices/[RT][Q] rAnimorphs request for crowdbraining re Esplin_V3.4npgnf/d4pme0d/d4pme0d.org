So it's occurred to me that he must already have a response protocol in place for Bug fighter crashes or similar displays of alien tech in a semi-populated area without a big controller presence.

My first thought was send a bunch of other cloaked fighters to drop off a team of infested cops or soldiers dressed in the uniforms of the most important and intimidating agency that could plausibly be on site, quickly set up a hologram over the site, and infest any witnesses/ first responders as necessary.

Now with the pool lost, they've got no particular attachment to any geographical location, and they want to step up the pace of things.

Why not use the crashed fighter as an opportunity to make a bold roll of the dice, and respond to the potential contact between the resistance and the USGOV?

Say the crash was a Russian (or alien possibly, as per the other comments here, but this is even higher stakes) aircraft or similar, and start infesting everyone who comes to investigate. Get them to put the word up the chain of command, and you'll soon have serious inroads into all sorts of Washington power structures, move fast, take a few more risks, and he can own the government in weeks or less.
