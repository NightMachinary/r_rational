  The backup location won't be somewhere completely isolated like North Korea or deep in Africa, because they still want to prepare to take over the infrastructure of the major nations. Depending on his paranoia, he could conceivably move operations to a similar town in Russia or China though, rather than staying in America.

Agreed on the isolated takeover part. A town or even a country that's cut off and a pariah at that is of little use to Esplin, except as a distraction - which would still be a good thing.

If you use controllers to spark major conflicts across the world, that would also help to distract the US military and the US government from taking action on their own soil. It'll also draw the attention of the Animorphs away from their primary goals. A few controllers in, say, North Korea could order them to fire their nukes or invade the South. Given that Saddam is still around, he could also be used to screw around in the Middle East. I'm actually surprised that the Visser hasn't been doing this - using rogue nations and terrorist organizations to stir up the world.
