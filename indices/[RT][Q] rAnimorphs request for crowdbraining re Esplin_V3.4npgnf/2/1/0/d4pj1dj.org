Yup. From chapter 6, when he was pondering the reported advances in morphing technology from Cassie's escape from the vehicle:

  Esplin scanned the report again, taking separate note of each development.

  One---the Andalites had successfully replaced a human girl, with mimicry on par with that of a Yeerk. Conclusion: someone else in the Andalite chain of command had discovered Alloran's little back door.

The implication being that Visser Three's host Alloran, an Andalite genius, knew of this prior to being taken as a host. However he apparently didn't widely spread the information. Presumably because of the Andalite taboo on the subject. Or, if Alloran kept such an incredibly valuable military secret to himself just for personal gain, then perhaps that would tell us unexpected things about his character.
