Let's try to infer the goals of both the Yeerks in general and Visser Three specifically, and then see what he might do to further those goals.

Firstly, from the Yeerk perspective, they've won the war with Earth. This isn't a true military conflict. It's a covert mission to preserve idiots from accidentally destroying resources that are rightfully already theirs. If the Yeerks were losing the war with the Andalites badly and just wanted to rapidly take as many hosts as possible off-world, it would be trivial for them to do so. Even disregarding the Pool ship's weapons or shields, the asteroid incident demonstrates the overwhelming military power that a spacefaring race holds over the Earth. The Yeerks could easily destroy Earth's militaries, satellites, roads, and other infrastructure. Then they could land cloaked ships and forcibly conquer many isolated small towns to gather however many hosts they needed with no organized resistance.

But they haven't done this. Their chosen approach demonstrates that they aren't seeking a quick snatch-and-grab. Rather, they want to take the earth's population, infrastructure, and military organization largely intact. Earth will be their ultimate secret weapon. Think of the classic example of America rapidly converting its economy during World War II to massively produce a new military superpower - the Yeerks will do this to the whole planet, under unified governance. They will convert the industrial base and infrastructure to take advantage of their advanced alien technology on their new incredibly-populous controller world, and develop a military-industrial machine without known equal. Then they will crush the Andalites under an unstoppable tide of new mass-produced Yeerk military forces.

As far as the Yeerks know, the Andalite military in general either doesn't know about, or doesn't consider seriously the threat of the Yeerk operations on Earth. If the Yeerks thought otherwise, their approach would be very different. Meanwhile, to the Yeerks, this is potentially a strategic masterstroke that will win them the war. Assuming that this much from canon remains accurate, the operations on Leera are under the command of Visser Four. That means that the operations on Earth are considered their single most important theatre of war at present - Earth is their best bet for the industrial powerhouse they want.

So Visser Three certainly cannot turn the war hot. If that was ever on the table, there would have been little point in wiping the evidence of the infiltration with the asteroid. The only circumstances under which he will turn the war hot is if he believes that directly striking earth's militaries will cause the least damage to infrastructure - i.e. if he believes that a global scale nuclear war is unavoidably imminent without his direct intervention.

I'll guess that if this operation went well, perhaps a promotion to Visser Two might have been on the table. But he always wanted more, and thought it was within his grasp when he deduced the morphing cube was still available. He made the choice to prioritize the overall mission over his personal goal, knowing the cube might be destroyed by the asteroid. Without the cube, his asteroid strike would have solved almost all of his problems. He might have gotten chewed out for the delay involved from it being necessary, but he'd probably retain command of the invasion due to his foresight in having the contingency ready. He could resume infiltrating almost anywhere else in the world. If any of the morph-capable resistance survived, it would have been a handful at most, and it would have been vanishingly unlikely that they could even find the new invasion point. His mission could proceed as planned, with the unfortunate setback of time and his secret displeasure at losing the chance at the cube.

But the cube did survive. Once Visser Three realizes what is happening, he is actually in quite the bind. Because now there is a new budding resistance, multiplying the morph-capable opposition, and as he knows, that tool comes with both infiltration and counter-infiltration tools that rival the Yeerks' own. He would really like to keep the continued existence of the cube secret, even once he realizes it survived the asteroid. He also wants to keep secret the fact that morphing can be used to read the memories of the person you morph into. This secret gives him a great deal of hidden personal power of his own, since the other Yeerks in high command don't realize how he can gather some of his info. It's also a strategic military secret of great importance, since he doesn't want it to leak to the Andalite forces, who apparently largely don't realize that capability exists due to their taboo of morphing sentient beings.

He is going to have to weigh things very carefully. How likely to succeed is his strategy of pursuing the cube in secret? How likely is it that he would get caught by Vissers One or Two checking up on him, which would likely mean his death sentence for hiding something that important? Is it even possible for him to orchestrate his military forces against the budding morph-capable resistance without revealing the key details that only he knows among the Yeerks?

So that's mostly about the goals and considerations of both the Yeerks in general and Visser Three specifically. What he presumably planned to do was restart the infiltration in a backup location, annoyed at the setbacks and the difficulty in accounting for himself to his higher-ups. The backup location won't be somewhere completely isolated like North Korea or deep in Africa, because they still want to prepare to take over the infrastructure of the major nations. Depending on his paranoia, he could conceivably move operations to a similar town in Russia or China though, rather than staying in America.

He might also hedge his bets about possible survivors by spreading rumours in human news media about some new drug known to cause crazy paranoid hallucinations. Or maybe the Yeerks can just create such a drug and get its recipe spread around a little to help cover their tracks. Depending on his estimation of human psychology, he might even have considered trying something from the storyline of Stargate SG-1 with "Wormhole Extreme" - using some infiltrators to launch a TV series with roughly similar plot to the actual invasion as another means of dismissing any rumours that do manage to get out there.

But now the Bug Fighter crashes in Washington. This alone doesn't reveal the new budding resistance, but covering it up will be /very/ hard, and suspicious. He doesn't have enough people in Washington to do something like successfully cover it up as a failed military test plane. Most likely he'll need to incinerate the area with other Bug Fighters and try to cover it up as a gas leak/explosion, and then hope that nothing escaped onto YouTube or got radioed in to the Pentagon. In such close temporal proximity to the asteroid, an event like this would certainly be treated as highly suspicious, and thoroughly investigated as a possible covert attack by a foreign power. Trying to prevent any evidence from leaking will be a problem. He'll likely infest Jeremiah during the cover-up process and discover the real extent of his problems. The Animorphs are /recruiting/.

Now they're in a spy-counterspy situation, where both sides want to uncover the other without being discovered themselves. The Yeerks are in a better position to try to use advanced scanners or similar for detection, but it's still very risky. The only thing Visser Three might be more worried about than exposure is if he misjudged and there are one or more real Andalites still on the ground. If they can manage to call in their own reinforcements and turn Earth into a hot war, the Yeerk high command will be extremely displeased. He may have concerns about scanning for communications signals or trying to jam them.

Munchkining: Depending how much he was able to pick up from telepathic contact with the Chee, he may attempt to capture and forcibly subvert them and their technology, realizing that they cannot violently resist him. Since they can see active morphs plain as day, this would be a huge boon to his efforts, though no longer a decisive one with morphing now proliferating.
