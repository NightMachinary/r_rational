I think you're on the right track there. Originally it's better for the Yeerks to be infiltrating under peace to reduce the extent to which the humans' guards are up. But if they're going to suspect something anyway, better for them to suspect the wrong thing. Even a comparatively large-scale war is acceptable to the Yeerks so long as they can avoid a major nuclear exchange. If it's feasible with Yeerk technology, they would definitely like to locate and disable Earth's nuclear arsenal to avoid damage to their desired infrastructure.

Regarding the crashed Bug Fighter cover-up, misinformation and misdirection are the way to go, likely with a layered approach. Trying to prevent any evidence from leaking may now be impossible, but planting misleading evidence could be almost as good.

1) The explosion was a gas leak.

2) The explosion was a botched Russian attack on Jeremiah, likely for whatever secret information he was bringing to President Tyegi.

3) The crashed fighter was an ultra-secret Russian prototype, at least 2 generations beyond anything previously suspected to exist. Its capabilities threaten to overturn MAD doctrine, making it paramount to avoid nuclear exchanges and focus all intelligence resources on Russia.

4) The crashed Russian fighter is based on reverse-engineered alien tech from an old crash on Russian soil, ala folk tales of Roswell.

5) The alien tech also provides select Russian spies the capability to shapeshift! Fortunately this tech has the side effect of inducing crazed paranoid delusions, making it easier to identify the "Russian" spies (Animorphs spreading word of the Yeerks).

6) A "blood test" to detect the Russian shapeshifters is discovered, making it mandatory for senior military and intelligence officials to be "tested" (infested). This might be too risky...

7) The Russians have actually received the tech from their allies, the evil space-communist Andalites who have already tried to destroy the Earth at least once. The valiant freedom-loving democratic Yeerks oppose them however.

Combining a number of ideas from the thread for this. The goal of course would be to actually enact as few layers as possible, but to prepare for all eventualities. If necessary, attacks on one country by another can be staged via cloaked Bug Fighters to escalate matters.
