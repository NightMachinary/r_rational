Does V3 have any idea how the war with the Andalites is going? That's going to be an important factor on whether not we should wait for reinforcements or just cut our losses now to gain a still-sizeable number of capable hosts.

Also, we only have a single pool available right? Can we use the skills of the Naharan hosts to build more? Or if not, turn some of the Human scientists/engineers so that we can build more? Multiple infiltration points would be a lot more useful since we wouldn't be restricted to a single country. Alternatively, switching to somewhere like Europe where there are a lot of densely-packed countries that are easy to travel across, or a country like China or India with a much larger population, may be more useful
