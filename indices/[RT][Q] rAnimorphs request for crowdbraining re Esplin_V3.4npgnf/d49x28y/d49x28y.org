If there's any way to pass the meteor strike off as NOT HIS ORDER/FAULT, he's going to want to do it, as I doubt the higher-ups would approve of (a) killing a whole bunch of his own soldiers and (b) letting things get to the point that it was necessary.

A story like "pool was attacked by Andalite resistance, we subdued them, they called an asteroid down as a last-ditch suicidal measure", if plausible, might work. Visser Three values his freedom, and if an investigation results in something as minor as increased oversight, that's probably a loss for him considering his secret goals. On top of the continued invasion, he's going to make keeping his autonomy privileges a priority.
