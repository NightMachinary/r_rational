Makes it harder to trace, but pushes the cost up. And /harder/ to trace is not /impossible/ to trace - especially if it's a passing Andalite ship that's doing the listening. Yes, it's terribly unlikely to be traced; but it's /also/ terribly unlikely that a victim the Yeerks intend to assimilate - that they know will be there, that they are prepared for - will ever manage to damage the ship to the point where it can't even send a distress call.

The question is, which of the two outcomes is /more/ unlikely, and if the signal trace is more unlikely, then is the minor difference in probability sufficient to justify the cost of the stealth data sensor?
