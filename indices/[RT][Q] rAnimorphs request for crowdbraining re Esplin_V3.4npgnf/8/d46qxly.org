Esplin knows the bug fighter was brought down by enemy action (it was cut in half), so Esplin also knows that at least one of the animorphs is in Washington, and so escaped the blast.

I'd first try and deal with the immediate problem of the crashed bug fighter. At this point, too many people have seen it to cover up the crash, so the best thing to do would be to disguise it. Blowing up the house with another bug fighter would be the first step, then mobilizing the controllers in Washington for damage control. These are all temporary solutions though, the leakage of information's been too great. The bug fighter's the immediate problem, and unfortunately Esplin has already used up one asteroid and it would be highly suspicious if another one just flattened Washington DC.

I agree with some of the other posters here - I'd start planning for an open invasion. Turning a lot more asteroids into kinetic kill vehicles to add to my existing stock (there's no way I would have turned just one asteroid into a kill vehicle, and you did say I've been busy), for a start. I'd be conservative with my remaining bug fighters, because I'm not sure what brought it down. This would hamper me greatly. Depending on how strong the shield on my pool ship is I would decloak and start glassing human Capitals and military installations, then broadcast a demand for surrender. If I can overawe the humans with my military might I could get collaborators who I would infest and start to expand ground operations with. With no need for secrecy I could demand humans either get infested or die, and given the human desire for self-preservation I think many humans would take infestation over death.
