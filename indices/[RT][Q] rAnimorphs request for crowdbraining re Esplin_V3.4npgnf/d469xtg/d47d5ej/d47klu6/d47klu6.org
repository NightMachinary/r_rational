Well, more like you keep secrecy only if you predict that you will win by keeping secrecy, taking into account that the other made the same analysis and predicted they would win, even though /they/ took your analysis into account, etc. Kind of like the "blue-eyed islanders" problem (google it).

Game theory and infinite recursion aside, the keeping the invasion secret probably advantages the yeerks, so the government will go public; the only interest in keeping the public in the dark about the yeerks was to lure Visser 3 into a false sense of security (as opposed to scanning the planets for xenotech labs and hidden military bases). That ship has now sailed, and keeping the public in the dark will only make yeerk operations easier.
