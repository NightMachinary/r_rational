For the record, I think crowdsourcing should be used sparingly, if at all, on stories like this. Something we think of might completely derail your story, even if it's over a small detail that we wouldn't have noticed if you'd just written the story as you envision it. I also enjoy not knowing what's going to happen, so I probably won't participate in future threads of this type.

THAT SAID, here are my immediate thoughts on Visser Three's possible strategies.

V3 is facing a constrained optimization problem in an uncertain environment. He faces a trade-off between slow invasion, which could get him more hosts but leaves time for things to go wrong, and rapid invasion, which could get him fewer hosts but perhaps too fast for anyone to stop him completely. His decision will depend on whether he believes there is any significant resistance remaining. Based on what happened in the last chapter, he will conclude that some of the resistance likely survived, and is possibly attempting to mobilize the United States against an invasion. Slow invasion is not likely to work a second time - it will probably just end up being open war anyway. So V3 will cut his losses and get bolder. Even if he just gets 1 or 2 billion out of the 7 billion humans and kills the rest, he might consider that a victory. (After all, he can just breed more people).

If V3 was OK with killing thousands of yeerks, he should be perfectly OK with killing thousands more by sending them on potentially suicidal missions. For example, he could get together the 12 remaining bug fighters and attempt a rapid hostile takeover of an entire town in a single day (I say "town" rather than "city" because a city has too many people to infest that quickly, and utter chaos would ensue). Now, these yeerks will all die unless they build a pool, so they would use the temporary surge of manpower to rapidly construct a pool over the next three days. If it takes longer, let the yeerks die or take them back to the mother ship, and swap in others.

During this time, the outside world would notice something wrong, but if V3 acts strategically, it won't matter. The bug fighters and the mothership should be able to repel any initial force that people send against the town. V3 can buy himself more time by sending yeerks on suicide missions to infest world leaders, who can then divert external help from the town, at least for a day or two. (He can infest news stations too, and spread confusion and lies about what is happening). If V3 takes a bigger risk and invades a town with a military base, he can use the might of a human military to take nearby towns by force and construct pools in them as well. If he also strategically does this on the soil of a country not so friendly with the United States, like Russia, it will be rather awkward and difficult for the U.S. to mobilize an immediate strike response, for fear of sparking a war.

With any luck, this strategy will allow V3 to establish a sizeable presence on earth while all the human governments are too confused to do anything about it. If he can maintain this presence for five months, the other pool ships will arrive and solidify his victory.

Problems with this plan. 1) If a yeerk pool cannot be constructed in anything close to 3 days, even with a whole town of workers, then this plan will fail from the very beginning. 2) If yeerks are not willing to go on suicide missions, this could hamper the plans significantly. 3) V3 would need to find a way to stop humans from using nuclear weapons once they realize what's happening. 4) V3 might not have the resources to do a rapid take-over of a whole town. The requirements might exceed the limits of how many yeerks can be brought down from the mothership in a short period of time. 5) The plan is a gamble that humans cannot effectively mobilize in a short period of time.

If V3 decides that immediate hostile takeover is too risky, he can fall back on a slightly slower strategy, though still faster than before. Infest a rich person and purchase a location on which a pool can be covertly constructed. Once it's done, bring a bunch of yeerks down from the mothership into the pool, and /then/ do a rapid takeover of a town - or city, this time.

Anyway, this is getting long, so I'll end my stream of thoughts here.
