  Esplin knows the bug fighter was brought down by enemy action (it was cut in half), so Esplin also knows that at least one of the animorphs is in Washington, and so escaped the blast.

No... Esplin knows that at least one /dracon beam/ is in Washington. For all he knows, it /could/ have been mailed to the military all on its own; the bug fighter could have picked up Jeremiah, and then he paniced and shot it down before he was infested.

Esplin will no doubt /plan/ for the idea that an Animorph is out there, but he can't be certain of even that much.
