Leaving a highly traceable wireless data signal? Doesn't that break the purpose of the cloaking field?

(Having said that, having the fighter /record/ abductions and keeping the recording in a well-hidden on-board black-box may very well have been done - it might even have been set to broadcast immediately if the cloaking field were ever bought down).
