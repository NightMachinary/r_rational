So far there are a lot of things suggesting that Visser 3 should go hot. But I still think that it would be a disaster, giving humans a unifying force would be terrible, he needs to divide humanity. Some suggested operational strategies are good but I think the most destabilizing action to his enemies would be the overt peace route along side covert invasion.

Good press will prevent his enemies from acting directly against him.

Naturally this means he needs to scape goat the andalites hard for everything they are worth.

Or judging by the psych profile of humans, maybe scape goat one of the less 'photogenic' populations of controllers, such as the taxxons?
