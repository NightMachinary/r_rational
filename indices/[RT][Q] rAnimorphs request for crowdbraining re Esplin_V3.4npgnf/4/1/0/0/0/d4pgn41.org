The problem is that a controlled NK isn't much more dangerous than status-quo NK. If they started industrialising, that would show up on satellite, and +the whole country could be nuked.+ I'm sure the Yeerks have ballistic missile defences....

Hmm.... Still hard for the Yeerks to get the rest of the world from that base without open war depleting a lot of population and infrastructure. It's a step they could definitely achieve, but it leads nowhere.
