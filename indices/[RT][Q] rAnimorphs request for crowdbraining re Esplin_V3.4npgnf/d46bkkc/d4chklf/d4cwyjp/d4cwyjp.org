No he could not. The USA aren't the only country with anti-espionage protocols, and "Aliens show up with gifts but they're secretly planning to take everything from you" is not a concept foreign to world leaders (or to anyone with any knowledge of colonisation history, for that matter).

Winning a propaganda war is nowhere near an easy task when you show up right after a suspicious meteor strike that killed 600'000+ people, and you're LITERAL SLUGS that take control of people's brains. Lie, okay, people as large groups can be fickle and all. But, again, sentient slugs that control people's brains. There's a difference between "fickle" and "The-Simpsons-level-stupid".
