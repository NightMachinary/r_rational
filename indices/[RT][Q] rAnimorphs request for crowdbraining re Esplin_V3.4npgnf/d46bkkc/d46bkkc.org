Let's, see, what should Visser 3 do?

Well, that depends on what he's concerned about. I see five obvious sources of concern for him:

- How is the war with Andalites going?

- When is his next report to his superiors due? They might not be impressed by the whole "killed the immense majority of his hosts plus however many yeerks" thing.

- What is the american military up to? His safest move is to assume they're either informed of the alien invasion or soon will be. From there, nothing prevents them from contacting every world-leader/military force/intelligence agency in the world and inform them of the situation. The meteor strike means they won't even have to provide any proof to get those militaries to prepare hard. Taking this into account, Visser 3 should probably start planning an open invasion, with the assumption that every military in the world will start mobilizing at most a week from now.

- Did some Animorphs survive the asteroid? If he has a few biologists left (or if one of his mooks knows the ancient skill of looking things up on wikipedia), he could learn about the snipe morph, and decide that some of them survived.

- How is the morale of the troops? That one strikes me as extremely important. Visser 3 just killed most of his underlings for a tactical advantage. If I were a controller, this would be the point my host starts asking me questions like "Why are you follwing his orders again?", and I wouldn't have very good answers. The coalescions themselves probably aren't very happy with the Visser either. And as FMA taught us, officers in the field aren't immune to the mysterious "three bullets in your back while you're sleeping" disease. Visser 3 should start preparing against potential coups, assassination attempts and coat turning.

As for munchkining:

- Take a disposable yet sentient subject (probably an uncontrolled human, or a clone, or a nothlit visserbot). Lock it in a room with everyone whose loyalty you want to test. Expose everyone in the room to a visserbot morphed into a nothlit leeran (one with no sensitive intel). Isolate the disposable subject, morph into a leeran next to it, then dispose of it. Congratulations, you have bypassed the restrictions of the leeran morph!
