As you point out, a planet is a shitty place to create a civilization. Even if everything goes well and sentient life evolves, it's still just a thin film of fragile biomass that's stuck in a gravity well with a miniscule amount of matter and energy to work with. If I was an Elder God from Beyond the Void, and I wanted to make a matter-based civilization (for whatever reason), I'd do it in a universe where /all/ the matter was fit for life, like a universe-sized flat grassy plain. For instance, your suggestion that the gods are farming humans for art is a nice idea, but but you'd get a lot more art if you created art-producers that could thrive anywhere in the world you created. That is, if the earth is just a farm to gods, then it's a spectacularly inefficient one.

But I'm not giving up yet, because I like this prompt.

Maybe the gods have a different understanding of space and time. Our human perception of time as linear and one-directional probably has more to do with the stuff that we're made of, rather than how the universe actually /is./ Kurt Vonnegut messed around with this idea a little bit in the Sirens of Titan and Slaughterhouse Five. The Tralfamadorians perceive all of time at once and have no sensation of change; they see their whole lives as a single complex experience. A consequence is that they don't care how long it takes to do something; they are happy to influence humans over periods of thousands of years just for stupid petty bullshit. A race like that wouldn't care if their human-farm was inefficient as long as it produced the desired results /eventually./

Another possibility is that our universe is a work of art made by the gods. I wouldn't expect aliens to understand our art very well. What we humans consider aesthetically satisfying has a lot to do with particular aspects of our minds, not external reality. An intelligent alien could maybe understand why we make art-- that is, they could figure out that certain modules of our brains are drawn to particular configurations of landscapes, even if those landscapes are painted instead of real-- but I wouldn't expect them to appreciate art. Likewise, I wouldn't expect to be able to appreciate an alien's art. So maybe the gods built our universe as a monument or a narrative or a statement. It might not be /for/ anything, it's just an expression of things that they like. The fact that the artwork contains sentient beings is just a little added adornment.

Your suggestion of atonement for a past sin is interesting. Maybe the gods previously made a universe that was full of sentient beings, but it turns out that you're not supposed to do that. They were reprimanded by their supervisor and told to make a safer, more stable, more predictable universe that only contains a few sentient beings. It does kinda seem like our universe was built to keep us from causing any trouble-- for instance, there's a hard speed limit that stops us from rushing out and getting to know any other sentients. The gods were allowed to include humans in the universe only if they agreed to keep them locked away in a gravity well. I like this version because it includes a conflict between gods that like humans and gods that don't. That conflict could feed an interesting story.

I like to work on sci-fi stories from time to time, and I like the trope of the story's central conflict being a part of some larger struggle between cosmic good and evil. But, like you've observed, it's hard to think of a cosmic struggle that makes any sense that produces a relatable world. It's fun to brainstorm about though.
