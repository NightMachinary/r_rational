So I'm currently running five-ish concurrent games of [[http://www.speciesgame.com/][/Species/]] that I skip between on a whim. It's basically an evolution sandbox.

One of my games is almost completely habitable, with fertile fields across the whole map. That one keeps hitting the population cap. Another's mostly water with some islands. Two of the islands are uninhabited now; I'm seeing if I can't encourage the survivors to ford the ocean, just for kicks. I've got a world that's basically a ring, where populations aren't separated by insurmountable barriers, just by distance, without shortcuts. It's interesting how the different set-ups can lead to different patterns of speciation.

One game had a few distinct continents, connected by isthmuses. It ended up being dominated by stupid-looking things that only survived due to quirks in the physics engine. That wasn't interesting to me, so I ended that world, freeing up resources to dedicate to the more interesting ones. I mean, I want to see the wild designs evolution can come up with. I discover something new every few in-game hours, it's great! But the solution space the game allows isn't quite the solution space I enjoy seeing explored.
