I'll throw you a short conceit I never made use of: the gods care, but don't notice (yet).

That is, Someone built a star system or a whole universe as a fun little science experiment, and implanted some kind of spell/satellite/device/subroutine designed to notify Them if sapient life developed so that they can uplift it. However, They live on long-since-immortal timespans, and it could take millenia between the Hey God People Have Developed alarm-clock "ringing", and Their actually showing up to meet the people.

As to "why", the simple answer is: because Nature. Such beings could create anything in accordance with their own preferences, but they couldn't /actually/ random-generate life-forms /without/ their own aesthetics interfering (in the same way that if I generate random numbers according to a nonuniform distribution, my preference in distribution has interfered with the randomness). So they set up a more-or-less random material area and set evolution going, allowing the random processes of Nature to determine what they get.

They weren't even planning for a civilization, they just left an alarm-clock in place (monoliths from /2001/?) to notify them in the unlikely case that such a thing happens.

Or, another one: your "gods" /hate/ life and try to destroy it at every opportunity, but in a wide universe (or set of universes), /it just keeps happening/ despite Them, as a simple, built-in fact of nature that even They can't fully suppress without destroying Themselves. You may remember this idea from [[#s][TTGL]].
