Isn't that basically what most religions teach already? You have this immortal soul and this whole "life" part of your immortal existence is basically just a flash in the pan. You're going to be "dead" forever and this whole life thing is only going to last 50 years, give or take 50 -- that's nothing compared to infinity. Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, Jewish, Muslim, I think that takes care of the major religions in the world, they all say that a focus on this mortal phase of "being" isn't worthwhile, that the true focus should be on the immortal being, on what happens next and where we'll be going next.
