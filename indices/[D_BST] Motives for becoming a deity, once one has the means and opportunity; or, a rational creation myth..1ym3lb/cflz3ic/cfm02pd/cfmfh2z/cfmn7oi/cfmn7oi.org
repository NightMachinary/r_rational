That's not actually theologically true, at least for several cases.

- Hinduism varies in its approach to "this life", since it believes in reincarnation.

- Buddhism varies too, but overall is about trying to escape sapient existence altogether, by /not even getting reincarnated/.

- Islam is, I would say, the most evenly divided. Certain branches are /dangerously/ deathist, but the Sharia also gives quite a lot of attention to common ethical and social questions of "this life" with much more reasonable and complex answers than "kill/die".

- Christianity is the /most/ deathist, but Catholicism, say, can vary towards being as "lifeist" as Islam at times.

- Judaism, in all varieties except the /very/ Haredi is, to my knowledge, the most "lifeist", probably because the very concept of an afterlife was a late addition. Even with several afterlife legends added on, Jewish religious sages tend to say that [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/xp/seduced_by_imagination/][focusing on the afterlife distracts you from /real/ life.]]
