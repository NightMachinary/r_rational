With a sufficient level of power, one could easily have us BE immortal. If I was sufficiently powerful, one of the first things I would do would be run a massive simulation of everything that happened up to the point where I made everyone immortal, and copy out everyone right before they died. No one would notice inside the simulation (since that would prevent me from properly copying people out after that due to disruption), but everyone would actually be immortal.
