Science.

Assume that the god-things evolved in our universe, were originally mortal, and later became immortal and nigh-omnipotent. In other words, assume that real physics is real, and the gods aren't magical beings with no beginning or end.

The gods may well have evolved on a planet themselves, and they want to run some experiments about other ways their evolution could have gone, much like we study apes living in the ancestral environment.

They may have multiple experiments running at once, some in stars, some on neutron stars, some in free space, some on the accretion disk of a black hole. We happen to be one of the ones running on a planet. If this model is true and you do want to say that the gods created the whole universe, then the speed of light limit is the equivalent of the walls of the petri dish: it's there to keep the experiments from mixing.
