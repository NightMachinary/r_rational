But we haven't defined God yet. If he's like Arthur C. Clarke posited (sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic), then why couldn't he be of the same species that we are? Anyway, let me be more general then. Why do some carpenters enjoy making things like fine furniture? Why does anyone go to the trouble of creating anything? Why then go the trouble of creating one or more civilizations? Perhaps so that a person can look back and say, "I was the start of that. I made that." But why would God want to look back on anything and say something like that? Well, why does anyone want to create anything? Why would the state of being (from our point of view) omnipotent and omniscient preclude someone from continuing to harbor a desire to create something that could literally outlive them? Even if God couldn't ever die, or has transcended to a state where death as we know it would be a meaningless distinction, why would the desire to create and make something suddenly go away? Even so, if you know that the ant farm you were making could someday create spaceships, travel to new ant farms and eventually become, well, you, wouldn't that be fun? Although I'm reminded of that old science fiction story about the guy who decided to do just that, only he led the "ants" to have rather cruel short lives and when they finally branched out they weren't too happy with the God they found. I can't remember who wrote that story, though.
