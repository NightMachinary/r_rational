I think it is possible for alien plans to be incomprehensible to us. The problem is that it is hard to write that story, because, buy definition, you can't comprehend your characters :p

Also, its possible that your aliens are comprehensible, in principal, but your characters lack the information / senses to interact with them meaningfuly.
