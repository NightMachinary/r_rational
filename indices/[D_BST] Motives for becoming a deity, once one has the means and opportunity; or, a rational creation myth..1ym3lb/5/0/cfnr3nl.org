Because everyone knows rape is worse than getting tortured or having your stuff stolen. Don't agree? Consider, any time any comic makes a joke about rape, or some idiot spouts off about something stupid concerning rape, it turns into a front page feature headline news story and tons of people get upset about it. If a comic makes a joke about getting tortured or open theft or whatever, or some idiot says something stupid about any of that, people just laugh.
