Art, commerce, industry.

We have plenty of games today which have level-builders. We even have games which are world-builders. High-level entities might build planets and/or life because they're interested in the natural version, because their friends are into it, because there's a fashion for planet-building, because there's an art contest, because it's calming/distracting/enjoyable, for therapy, to show off to the grandkids, to have something to do in between their day job, or because it /is/ their day job - planets might be useful for anything from stage props to corporate lobby art to collector's items to just something to flog on cosmic eBay.

Perhaps planet/life creation is a larger market, whether a mainstream one or niche, like potted plants or landscaping. Or a government project (via pressure groups or core policy) to increase the amount of life/civilization in the galaxy - the equivalent of eco-management or parks/recreation.

Perhaps it's actually a side-effect of some industrial process or practice. Maybe fiddling with spacetime or gravity loops or certain particles or the structure of probability in order to produce some desired item or service also has the side-effect of making star/planet creation much more likely. For all we know, what we perceive as galaxies are actually waste heaps.
