I didn't even make that connection, but yeah! I read 'Strata' a long time ago, and I don't remember it very well, but I think there's a scene where the characters discuss how a flat shape would be superior to a planet for most purposes. The trick is getting gravity to behave properly. Anyway, Pratchett reworked most of the elements in that book into the discworld series, so, yes, like the Great A'Tuin.
