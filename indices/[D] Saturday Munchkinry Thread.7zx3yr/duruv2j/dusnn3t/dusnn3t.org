The obvious solution here is to learn to get very used to the mental car alarm and use the somewhat pitiful binary data outputted by the ball to transcribe the message that is specified to contain the best possible course of action according to some criteria for how much past you would have liked the outcome.

Or perhaps instead ask for the message that will lead to the best outcome (from your perspective) due to the butterfly effect. In this scenario it's possible you may not even end up /doing anything/ and instead just looking at the message will be sufficient to cause a FAI to arise by chance in a botnet/supercomputer due to cosmic rays randomly flipping bits. Actually I would feel confident that this is /by definition/ the best thing you could ask the 8-ball for at least from the perspective of your utility function.

So depending on what the best course of action ends up being you might end up either laboriously coding a seed FAI/botnet that will instantiate a singularity. Or likely you may end up taking some course of action which results in you becoming extremely rich and powerful and then hiring researchers who miraculously seem to have insights on how to progress in AGI/AI alignment nearly constantly such that they get decades of intellectual work done in only months.\\
Though as previously stated it may be even more likely that by exploiting the butterfly effect the way the message leads to a singularity will look like fate manipulation or supernatural tampering.
