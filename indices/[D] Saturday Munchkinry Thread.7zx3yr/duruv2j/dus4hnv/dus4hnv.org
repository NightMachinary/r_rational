The chaos god is just begging for you to ask it "is the answer to this question some form of 'no'?".

SOP here is to ask it questions in the form "is the nth bit of the best answer to question x that is at most 100 bytes long, enconded using this specific huffman code, a 1?", but the throughput of the thing is vague.

What does it mean for a prediction to have a great benefit? Does knowing the nth bit of the answer to some question a great benefit? If it is, we're very limited to what we can ask.
