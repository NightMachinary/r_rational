  How could I "balance" the most OP creatures to still be incredibly powerful, and proportionally more powerful than less-OP creatures, but not completely break the setting? (As an allowance to sanity, the genie has "fuzzy logic" abilities, akin to a DM house ruling stuff)

Step one is to ban any creature that has time-travel as an ability, because that's an instant balance breaker: the first person to activate a time travel ability can just go back in time and kills all the puny other humans before they transform into OP creatures. This ban also rules out all kinds of gods, genies, and reality warpers.

After that most creatures are okay really. For every creature that can only be killed with attack method X, there's another creature with an attack method that always kills absolutely anything. It's like when the unstoppable force hits the immovable object. Just create a massive magical explosion that hurts both sides whenever that happens.

Once you have that, the smart people will choose dimensional sliding creatures so they can get the hell out of our universe that has suddenly become full of horrible creatures like [[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/d/d1/Justice_League_Adventures_Vol_1_5.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100812070042][star conquerers]] and [[https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80419/1901472-sun_eater.jpg][sun eaters]] (the two most overpowered things I can think of, but there are surely other more OP ones).

Anyone foolish enough to choose something as puny as a werewolf, or really any creature that can't escape Earth, is going to find themselves without an Earth to stand on. Anyone choosing creatures that can escape Earth but not the Milky Way will likely die from collateral damage soon after, unless they are one of the big players that are throwing stars around.
