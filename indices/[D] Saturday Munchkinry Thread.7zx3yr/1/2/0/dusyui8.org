Nah, time travel isn't so bad if you establish rules for it.

You can state that it's a "Many Worlds" universe or somesuch. Time travel just sends you into an alternate timeline where you can make all the changes you want, but since /you/ are from another one, you can't create paradoxes. From your enemy's perspective, you basically just erase yourself from existence.

Alternatively, you can state that the timeline is self-repairing, and will prevent you from changing any of the /causes/ who's effects you've already interacted with. On the 'nice' end, luck will conspire to keep you from changing any part that affects your history. On the 'mean' end, it will actively seek to kill you by having 'completely random' events take you down--IE: You and another time traveler unwittingly choose the same time and space and kill each other on arrival.
