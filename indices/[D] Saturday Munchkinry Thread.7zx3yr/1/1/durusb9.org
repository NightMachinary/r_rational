  What are the most OP creatures you can think of to pick, especially considering that other people will also be picking OP creatures?
#+end_quote

In rough order of power:

- An unbound genie, to grant arbitrarily powerful wishes.

- Time travellers.

- Power copiers, especially if they can keep multiple sets at once.

- Some types of Hydra, or other adaptive regenerators.

- Hecatoncheires, Eldrazi (from Magic the Gathering), Balrogs (or other maiar, from Lord of the Rings), other epic-level creatures.

- Exponentially breeding monsters, chain-summoning ones, infection/converting ones, etc.

  How could I "balance" the most OP creatures to still be incredibly powerful, and proportionally more powerful than less-OP creatures, but not completely break the setting? (As an allowance to sanity, the genie has "fuzzy logic" abilities, akin to a DM house ruling stuff)
#+end_quote

You have 1-3 words to describe your creature. After that, the genie may ask clarifying questions, or may give you some powers that match your description.

For example, "Tarrasque" may get the powers from [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/tarrasque.htm][D&D 3.5]], [[http://5e.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/tarrasque.htm][D&D 5e]], or [[http://starcraft.wikia.com/wiki/Torrasque_(StarCraft_II)][Starcraft]]. All of them are large, powerful beasts that are difficult to kill, but they have wildly different power levels.

"Dragon" may get the genie to ask questions, like "what type" or "from which stories", and then proceed from there.
