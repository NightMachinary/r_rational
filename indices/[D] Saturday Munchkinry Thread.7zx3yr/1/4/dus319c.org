/(This sounds familiar. I think I've read a CYOA like it once)/

Anyway, here are three cheat-answers:

Algorithm 1: the person sifts through [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/forum/t-761338/scp-object-classifications][SCP Object Classifications]] from top to bottom, picks what they like.

Algorithm 2: the person sifts through TVTrope's [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfVillainThreat][Sliding Scale of Villain Threat]] from bottom to top, picks what they like.

Algorithm 3: the person wiki-walks through [[http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Main_Categories][Powerlisting Wikia's power categories,]] picks what power they like, then picks a creature with that power they like. Examples: [[http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Omnipotent_Powers][Omnipotent Powers,]] [[http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Omniverse_powers][Omniverse powers,]] [[http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Meta_Powers][Meta Powers,]] etc.

  the genie will scale the offensive and defensive abilities of every creature to asymptotically approach the power of a nuclear bomb [..] So without warning, virtually everything is still vulnerable to an ICBM strike.

There are plenty of creatures the mechanics of powers of which don't exactly translate well into a simple blow up harder \ block harder mindset. This includes time travel, reality warping, memetics \ [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/antimemetics-division-hub][anti-memetics,]] power-stealing, meta-powers, etc.

  How could I "balance" the most OP creatures
#+end_quote

Add a “power conversion efficiency factor” which determines how efficiently will be the power conversion between the creature's fictional self and the person who chose it as their donor. Add some of the following sub-factors to influence \ calculate how high this conversion factor will be on individual case-by-case basis:

- the more attention (stored knowledge in their minds, daily thoughts, etc) is allocated to this fictional creature by sophonts IRL worldwide, the higher;

- the more would this creature's powers in the hands of the choosing person break the “average suspension of disbelief” of sophonts IRL worldwide, the lower;

- the more [[https://youtu.be/L7jClyinERY?t=204][self-contradictory]] the nature of this creature and \ or its power, the lower;

- the better the choosing person understands the nature of their donor creature \ its power, the higher;

- the more people choose that creature (or, alternatively, a creature with similar powers) as their donor, the more that power gets divided among these people, the lower becomes the conversion factor;

- the genie warns about one or more of the above-mentioned limitations only after a person makes their final choice --- or doesn't warn at all. This one would be counter-productive if this is intended as a CYOA or something similar to a CYOA, in my opinion.
