  (This sounds familiar. I think I've read a CYOA like it once)
#+end_quote

There are a lot of CYOAs featuring transhuman elements that I've gained inspiration from, but none (that I'm aware of) predicate on everyone else on the planet recieving the same CYOA, likely because of the same balancing issues I'm having.

  Anyway, here are three cheat-answers:

These are some really good heuristics! For reference, "phoning a friend" would be banned, so no individual could just browse the web for the most OP option, but with 7 billion people there's a 0% chance /nobody/ would be a truly effective munchkin, so seeing the worst-case scenarios is useful.

  There are plenty of creatures the mechanics of powers of which don't exactly translate well into a simple blow up harder \ block harder mindset.
#+end_quote

I have this gut feeling that most creature that rely on having an ability that's sufficiently bullshit rather than sufficiently powerful would usually get countered by some other (combination of) creature(s), but I can't say for certain whether offense is usually greater than defense across fiction.

#+begin_quote
  Add a “power conversion efficiency factor” which determines how efficiently will be the power conversion between the creature's fictional self and the person who chose it as their donor.
#+end_quote

Some sort of power scaling needs to exist, definitely. The trick is setting it up so regular people are completely unnaffected (I choose dragons because dragons are cool! What kind of dragons? I dunno, the kind that fly and breath fire), savvy powergamers recieve some nerfs (what do you mean, I'm not completely invulnerable to fire as a chromatic dragon? Well I guess massive defense is good enough...), and absolute gamebreakers recieve significant nerfs (I should literally control the entire universe! The fact that I can only affect tectonic events on one continent is an insult) while still rewarding people for making smart character creation decisions.

#+begin_quote
  the genie warns about one or more of the above-mentioned limitations only after a person makes their final choice --- or doesn't warn at all. This one would be counter-productive if this is intended as a CYOA or something similar to a CYOA, in my opinion.
#+end_quote

I actually like the "uncertaintly" element of some CYOAs, so this isn't really a drawback.
