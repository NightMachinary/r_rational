The tactics you used could be useful, but they would be difficult to translate into crunch-- how could a DM predict the chances of any particular creature getting picked? There are too many unknowns to implement those specific suggestions as stated without resorting to dm fiat anyways.

That's why I'd prefer power scaling based off an established higher bound of some sort, potentially based on the heuristics you provided. You can solidly place a specific option on a scale against other options, and then finangle with world details to mke sure that, despite that, you can still tell the scale of story you want to tell.
