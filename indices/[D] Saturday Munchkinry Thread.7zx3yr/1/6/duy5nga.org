My first go-to choice for an immensely powerful non-humanoid fictional character is [[http://villains.wikia.com/wiki/Discord_(My_Little_Pony)][Discord]] - basically, Q in the shape of a mad taxidermist's mishmash of creatures.

The power to directly edit reality around me is - well, pretty hard to beat. The requirement to remain off-beat and chaotic (or fade into nothingness) will be easily met in this suddenly chaotic world, and the ability to literally remove (at least some of) other people's powers will only help (though other people might object to that one).
