  Okay, what counts as a creature? Inheritance cycle dragons are people.

I'm thinking something along the lines of "non-humanoid, organic being". So you get plenty of sapient "creatures". But I'm having trouble identifying the fuzzy logic I'm using to determine what exactly a creature is. Given any specific example, I can easily say whether it is/isn't a creature, but I can't do that in the abstract.

They seem a little UP honestly, compared to some of the stuff available. You'd be able to build all sorts of cool stuff, but assuming society doesn't immediately break down, you'd have all sorts of mind readers/regenerators/breath weapon havers/ clairvoyants to stop you from having your way with the planet's natural resources.
