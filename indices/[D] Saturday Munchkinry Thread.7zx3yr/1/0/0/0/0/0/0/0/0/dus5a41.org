  I just need to make remote-controlled knife missiles and/or eDust

Those would be terrifying tools against "ordinary" (i.e., only slightly superhuman) humans, but wouldn't be enough to take care of all the other powergamers intent on stopping anyone (who isn't them) from taking over the world. Still useful abilities of course, but you'd need to moderate your ambitions of world conquest, which would be enough for an RP.

  And either I lack the knowledge of how to use my drone body so completely that I die instantly, or I understand effectors well enough to use them to examine my own systems and reverse-engineer them.

Here it would be the in-between option. You'd have a human body (plus any self-modification and special body-related abilities), so lack of knowledge wouldn't kill you. On the flipside, while you would eventually be able to reverse-engineer your own abilities, sincr you still have a human body, it would take time and effort, leaving you vulnerable to the intervention of other parties.

It sounds like you'd still very much be on the "op" end of the scale, but definitely a doable opponent for PCs.

  The Horta is the silicon-based lifeform seen in Star Trek TOS episode 1x26, The Devil in the Dark. Maybe "being" is the best word, if spirits are valid choices and I can get away with a drone.

I think "being" is a little too permissive, because it lets past all manner of AI and robot, plus stuff like golems and genius loci. It's annoying having to split hairs like this, but I think it would be a bit arbitrary for the genie to examine everything case-by-case...
