  Ha. By the way, over what period of time may I use 2x1015 J? Per second? A 2 Petawatt CREWS would solve just about every problem solvable with firepower.

For as long as you'd be able to mantain your original maximum acceleration.

That being said, from the feedback I've gotten, I'm getting the impression that my current ruleset is thoroughly unsalvageable. I'll incorporate the feedback into whatever version 2 of the ruleset looks like, so thank you, and everyone else who replied ([[/u/ShiranaiWakaranai]] , [[/u/vakusdrake]] , [[/u/ulyssessword]], [[/u/ulyssessword]], and [[/u/OutOfNiceUsernames]]). Currently my thinking is to make my own, much more limited CYOA with a far more constrained set of powers.
