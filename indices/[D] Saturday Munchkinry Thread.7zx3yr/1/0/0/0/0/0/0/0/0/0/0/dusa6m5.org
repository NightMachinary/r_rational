  Step 1 of course is to begin accelerating upward at 10g as soon as possible after receiving powers. Step 2, to be completed within 6.9 seconds, is to see if I can dispose of the mach 2 speed limit by reconceptualizing my frame of reference, because speed limits other than c don't really make sense. We're all moving much faster than 686m/s, relative to the sun. World optimization is like step 1000 or something.

Welp, back to the drawing board.

  Okay, I'm confused as to how these granted abilities work. Suppose I'd chosen eagle. Would I get wings, or would I just be able to fly while fully humanoid? That is, what is an "ability" vs a feature that makes that ability possible? Because I assumed not understanding my effectors would mean that my antimatter core would lose containment.

Before I answer this, I'm going to clarify that I'm making it up as I go along-- when you ask me a question, I don't have an answer prepared, I just try to generate one based off my previous statements that I think would make the most sense. So if my answers seem tailored towards mitigating unbalanced builds, that's because they are!

Anyways you can get any and all specific features of your chosen creature (so if you chose eagle, you could get good eyesight, smell, and the ability to track small creatures at long distances) but because you're not /actually/ the chosen creature, you can't necessarily do all the things that creature can do, because your body geometry is fundamentally different, and you're still "you" mentally, although you may have gotten some tweaks that make you less "you" than you were previously. So in this example, choosing "eagle" wouldn't give you the ability to fly because even if you had wings, you'd be too large to fly with them. If you had chosen something like "dragon" who obviously flagrantly violate the square/cube law, then you'd have the same mechanism they use to fly.

There's an inherent fuzzyness to this question because I'm not making this a maximum-transhumanism setting, so there needs to be a balance between the fact that obviously straight humans wouldn't be able to do all the neat stuff that magical creatures could, and that the full turn-into-a-magical-creature regimen would replace you with a completely different being that shares some of your mental patterns.

  Why spirits but not golems? I'm still not clear on what the dividing line is supposed to be.

To clarify, being a spirit is not /sufficient/ to qualify, but being a spirit doesn't disbarr something that would otherwise be a creature from qualifying, and typically makes things less-humanoid than they'd otherwise be.

Golems, meanwhile, are purely constructs. They're not really "creatures" or "beasts" or any of those other, related words.
