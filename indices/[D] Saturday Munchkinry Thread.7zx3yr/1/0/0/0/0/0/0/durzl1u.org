  My mind is stored behind very, very aggressive firewalls (and also probably in another dimension). Fields protect me from damn near anything, I can Displace myself out of danger, I can see basically the whole solar system at once FTL, and I can bootstrap more tools from raw materials with my effectors and Culture knowledge. Also, who needs the planet's resources? I can just eat the moon or the asteroid belt or something. EDIT: I also cap out all your energy/acceleration/speed/brainpower limits. And technically can do mindreading/control too, also with effectors, it's just Not Done.

I'm not seeing those specific abilities for drone on their wiki, but at the same time, I can easily see creatures having that ability existing, so I won't gainsay you.

Can you think of a way for the genie to nerf creatures in the weight class of swarm drones without having to go in and give out unique nerfs?

I think the largest parts of what make them so broke is their self-replication and instinctual knowledge (as you wouldn't be nearly so threatening if you couldn't properly manipulate your fields and your firewalls) so maybe a ban on self-replication outside of normal human sexual intercourse (or technology assisted human intercourse), and removing all instinctual knowledge (with the justification that such a knowledge dump would be like replacing you with another person) thus forcing everyone to learn about their new abilities through practice (albeit aided by instincts that can't be called "knowledge" and any brain mechanism boosts)?

That of course still leaves really high potential with the FTL capability, shapeshifting, mental defenses, displacement, etc. But doesn't make you broke straight off the bat, allowing people to come up with countermeasures.

  EDIT: Also, "organic" is meaningless. What about the Horta?

The what?

I'd "living" is better than "organic", but that would exclude stuff like hellhounds and spirits that I think should be fair game, so I don't know.
