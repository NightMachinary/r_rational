  I'm not seeing those specific abilities for drone on their wiki, but at the same time, I can easily see creatures having that ability existing, so I won't gainsay you.

Fields, Displacers, and Effectors are basically the core Culture toolkit, and SC agents are equipped as thoroughly as the Minds can manage. Displacements are generally done by the local Mind when possible, but I'm pretty sure I remember drones displacing themselves and their knife missiles around. Even if I can't displace myself, I can just use CREWS (extremely OP Culture-tech lasers) to interdict anything coming at me, or even disassemble munitions in flight with effectors.

  I think the largest parts of what make them so broke is their self-replication and instinctual knowledge (as you wouldn't be nearly so threatening if you couldn't properly manipulate your fields and your firewalls) so maybe a ban on self-replication outside of normal human sexual intercourse (or technology assisted human intercourse), and removing all instinctual knowledge (with the justification that such a knowledge dump would be like replacing you with another person) thus forcing everyone to learn about their new abilities through practice (albeit aided by instincts that can't be called "knowledge" and any brain mechanism boosts)?

I don't need to self-replicate, I just need to make remote-controlled knife missiles and/or eDust. And either I lack the knowledge of how to use my drone body so completely that I die instantly, or I understand effectors well enough to use them to examine my own systems and reverse-engineer them. Culture people are much, much more in control of their own minds than we're used to, and that's even more true for the synthetic ones.

  The what?

  I'd "living" is better than "organic", but that would exclude stuff like hellhounds and spirits that I think should be fair game, so I don't know.

The Horta is the silicon-based lifeform seen in Star Trek TOS episode 1x26, The Devil in the Dark. Maybe "being" is the best word, if spirits are valid choices and I can get away with a drone.
