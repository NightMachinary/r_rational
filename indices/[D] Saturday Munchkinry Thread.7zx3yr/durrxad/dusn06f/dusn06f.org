Given your response to buckykat that:

  I think the largest parts of what make them so broke is their self-replication and instinctual knowledge (as you wouldn't be nearly so threatening if you couldn't properly manipulate your fields and your firewalls) so maybe a ban on self-replication outside of normal human sexual intercourse (or technology assisted human intercourse), and removing all instinctual knowledge (with the justification that such a knowledge dump would be like replacing you with another person) thus forcing everyone to learn about their new abilities through practice (albeit aided by instincts that can't be called "knowledge" and any brain mechanism boosts)?

This opens up the opportunity to pick godlike beings who would otherwise be off the table for any reasonable person because of how much you'd lose your identity.\\
So with the stipulation that you keep your personality and gain no new knowledge in place I will simply pick Azathoth. Or any of the number of other gods conceived of which aren't humanoid.

Alternatively I could pick the enhanced humans from some fiction I previously wrote. These enhanced humans would by themselves not really be that impressive (basically they're just peak human in every regard with a few extra goodies) however they also have cellular machinery which will construct nanobots to kick off the creation of a FAI and a singularity should they ever find themselves in a pre singularity world.\\
Of course I couldn't pick the enhanced /humans/ because of the "no humanoids clause" however there are equivalent versions of many other animals. So I could turn into a warbird which has human level intelligence, and then pretty rapidly when the nanobot triggered singularity gets afoot I can get my body changed back to human (or just upload).
