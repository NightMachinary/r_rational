#+begin_quote
  An unbound genie, to grant arbitrarily powerful wishes.
#+end_quote

For the record, I don't consider an arabian djinn a "creature" but since there are plenty of other creatures that grant wishes, that can slide.

#+begin_quote
  Time travellers.
#+end_quote

I'm not actually aware of any creatures that willingly timetravel. I'm sure there /are/ some, but I can't think of any.

#+begin_quote
  Power copiers, especially if they can keep multiple sets at once.
#+end_quote

Power copiers would definitely be powerful, but I'm not actually aware of any that can arbitrarily copy every type of power and ability.

#+begin_quote
  Some types of Hydra, or other adaptive regenerators.
#+end_quote

I actually think regenerators wouldn't be /that/ much of a threat, because there would be so many out-of-context powers running around, guaranteeing someone would be able to no-sell anything but the highest tiers of regeneration (ignoring grey goo, that is.) Certainly still incredibly dangerous, but with the relatively low probability for any single person to specifically pick the most broken regenerator tin order to kill bunches of people, they would actually make interesting challenges that destabalize regions, but aren't threats to the world as a whole.

#+begin_quote
  Hecatoncheires, Eldrazi (from Magic the Gathering), Balrogs (or other maiar, from Lord of the Rings), other epic-level creatures.
#+end_quote

These are definitely good ones. I failed to consider card-game monsters, and they get very, very nasty.

#+begin_quote
  Exponentially breeding monsters, chain-summoning ones, infection/converting ones, etc.
#+end_quote

Yep, grey goo would be very nasty (and not covered under my edit.)

#+begin_quote
  You have 1-3 words to describe your creature. After that, the genie may ask clarifying questions, or may give you some powers that match your description.
#+end_quote

Actually, independent of balancing, this seems like a pretty good idea regardless.

#+begin_quote
  For example, "Tarrasque" may get the powers from D&D 3.5, D&D 5e, or Starcraft. All of them are large, powerful beasts that are difficult to kill, but they have wildly different power levels.
#+end_quote

Yeah, I've definitely been looking for an organic way for the genie to pick the "least worldbreaking" version of a worldbreaker, and this seems like a good one.

--------------

How about this for a better restriction on creature picking/power granting:

"Pick a class of creature from either the natural world or published fiction that has previously had members of that class killed by the actions of mortals. You will gain powers of the same type, and of proportional magnitude, of those possessed by the creature you pick."

With the genie then either asking questions clarify what exactly they mean by, say "3.5e tarrasque" (e.x. from which novel?), and picking a representative example to base powers off intended to balance creature choices using fuzzy DM logic.

So if you pick a wish-granter, for example, your power to grant wishes is limited, and you can grant them at a limited rate. If you have regeneration, it's slowed down. Self-replication only happens so fast, and is dependent of food intake, mind reading only shows you a bit of a mind at a time, and so on and so forth. And the "killed by mortals" restriction sections off a vast quantity of the truly broken monsters.
