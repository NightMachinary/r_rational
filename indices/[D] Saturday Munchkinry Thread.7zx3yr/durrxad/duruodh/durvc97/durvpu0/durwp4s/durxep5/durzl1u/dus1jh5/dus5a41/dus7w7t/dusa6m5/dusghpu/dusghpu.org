  Welp, back to the drawing board.

Ha. By the way, over what period of time may I use 2x10^{15} J? Per second? A 2 Petawatt CREWS would solve just about every problem solvable with firepower.

  Before I answer this, I'm going to clarify that I'm making it up as I go along-- when you ask me a question, I don't have an answer prepared, I just try to generate one based off my previous statements that I think would make the most sense. So if my answers seem tailored towards mitigating unbalanced builds, that's because they are!

Sure, such is the way of this thread.

  Anyways you can get any and all specific features of your chosen creature (so if you chose eagle, you could get good eyesight, smell, and the ability to track small creatures at long distances) but because you're not actually the chosen creature, you can't necessarily do all the things that creature can do, because your body geometry is fundamentally different, and you're still "you" mentally, although you may have gotten some tweaks that make you less "you" than you were previously. So in this example, choosing "eagle" wouldn't give you the ability to fly because even if you had wings, you'd be too large to fly with them. If you had chosen something like "dragon" who obviously flagrantly violate the square/cube law, then you'd have the same mechanism they use to fly.

Still confused. Do I get eagle vision because my eyes become eagle-eye-shaped, or is the genie continuously intercepting my human eyeballs' vision stream and upgrading it before it hits my brain?

  There's an inherent fuzzyness to this question because I'm not making this a maximum-transhumanism setting, so there needs to be a balance between the fact that obviously straight humans wouldn't be able to do all the neat stuff that magical creatures could, and that the full turn-into-a-magical-creature regimen would replace you with a completely different being that shares some of your mental patterns.

Every setting is a maximum-transhumanism setting if your players are ambitious.

  To clarify, being a spirit is not sufficient to qualify, but being a spirit doesn't disbarr something that would otherwise be a creature from qualifying, and typically makes things less-humanoid than they'd otherwise be.

  Golems, meanwhile, are purely constructs. They're not really "creatures" or "beasts" or any of those other, related words.

Sure, golems are creatures. Or at least, if they're not, then neither are many, many created beings in fiction, such as Tolkien's Dwarves, being made of earth by AulÃ«. The artificial/natural dichotomy is nonsense which only becomes more nonsensical in being connected to the multiverse of fiction.
