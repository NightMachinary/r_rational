  Those would be terrifying tools against "ordinary" (i.e., only slightly superhuman) humans, but wouldn't be enough to take care of all the other powergamers intent on stopping anyone (who isn't them) from taking over the world. Still useful abilities of course, but you'd need to moderate your ambitions of world conquest, which would be enough for an RP.

Step 1 of course is to begin accelerating upward at 10g as soon as possible after receiving powers. Step 2, to be completed within 6.9 seconds, is to see if I can dispose of the mach 2 speed limit by reconceptualizing my frame of reference, because speed limits other than c don't really make sense. We're all moving much faster than 686m/s, relative to the sun. World optimization is like step 1000 or something.

  Here it would be the in-between option. You'd have a human body (plus any self-modification and special body-related abilities), so lack of knowledge wouldn't kill you. On the flipside, while you would eventually be able to reverse-engineer your own abilities, sincr you still have a human body, it would take time and effort, leaving you vulnerable to the intervention of other parties.

Okay, I'm confused as to how these granted abilities work. Suppose I'd chosen eagle. Would I get wings, or would I just be able to fly while fully humanoid? That is, what is an "ability" vs a feature that makes that ability possible? Because I assumed not understanding my effectors would mean that my antimatter core would lose containment.

  I think "being" is a little too permissive, because it lets past all manner of AI and robot, plus stuff like golems and genius loci. It's annoying having to split hairs like this, but I think it would be a bit arbitrary for the genie to examine everything case-by-case...

Why spirits but not golems? I'm still not clear on what the dividing line is supposed to be.
