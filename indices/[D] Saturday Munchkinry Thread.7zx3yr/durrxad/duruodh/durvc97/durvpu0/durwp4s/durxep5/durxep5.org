My mind is stored behind very, very aggressive firewalls (and also probably in another dimension). Fields protect me from damn near anything, I can Displace myself out of danger, I can see basically the whole solar system at once FTL, and I can bootstrap more tools from raw materials with my effectors and Culture knowledge. Also, who needs the planet's resources? I can just eat the moon or the asteroid belt or something. EDIT: I also cap out all your energy/acceleration/speed/brainpower limits. And technically can do mindreading/control too, also with effectors, it's just Not Done.

I would have said Mind, but your restrictions would cripple that down to drone anyway.

EDIT: Also, "organic" is meaningless. What about the Horta?
