edit: it looks like this isn't going to work regardless of how I tweak the ruleset.

tl;dr: *What are the most powerful mythological or fictional creatures that you can think of?* Note that creatures shouldn't be humanoid (in their true form), and there should be more than one of them in any given work.

--------------

So I'm working on creating the ruleset of what has a low chance of turning into a freeform RP.

During "character creation" so to speak, a genie appears to every person on the planet and let them pick /any/ real, mythological, or fictional (but not imaginary) type of creature and get their abilities (from the mundane to the magical). Now, I figure a majority of people would either dismiss the genie (getting no powers), pick some regular animal (say, cats) and get some relatively unimpressive powers (nightvision, better smell, better able to survive falls, etc.) But some subset of the population is inevitably going to pick magical or fictional creatures, and some of those creatures would be very, very OP.

Now, a certain amount of OPness is expected, and even welcome; it's more wish-fulfilment-y to have characters with neat superpowers. But while a lot of possible choices exist on the same "power scale" so to speak (for example, most kinds of werewolves are less powerful than most kinds of dragon, but by the same token most kinds of dragons are still killable by most kinds of werewolf), you have creatures that are explicitly designed to be ridiculously OP, to the point where if a person with bad intentions picks them, they're extinction-level events (or at least still incredibly dangerous.)

So,

- What are the most OP creatures you can think of to pick, especially considering that other people will also be picking OP creatures?
- How could I "balance" the most OP creatures to still be incredibly powerful, and proportionally more powerful than less-OP creatures, but not completely break the setting? (As an allowance to sanity, the genie has "fuzzy logic" abilities, akin to a DM house ruling stuff)

Some examples of creatures I consider powerful, but balanced:

Inheritance cycle dragons (mindreading is nasty good, but they're still very vulnerable to ordinary weaponry), Nemean lions (high tier invulnerability is great, but still have exploitable weak spots), most non-legendary pokemon, 5e Tarrasque

Some examples of creatures I consider unbalanced:

3.5e Tarrasque, legendary pokemon, anything that has to be killed with a special, magic weapon that obviously wouldn't exist in the real world, Naruto tailed beasts

+edit: actually, I think I've come up with a possible, partial, solution. Namely, that the genie will scale the offensive and defensive abilities of every creature to asymptotically approach the power of a nuclear bomb (say, 500 kT), and the maximum speed to be mach 2, and the maximum acceleration to be 10 gravities, and the maximum mental processing speed to be 4x human average. If you have less than than, say, 90% of an amount, abilities are virtually unchanged. Approaching or exceeding a bound places you on a logistic curve, with the "meeting" point being the optimal choice of creature for each category. So without warning, virtually everything is still vulnerable to an ICBM strike.+
