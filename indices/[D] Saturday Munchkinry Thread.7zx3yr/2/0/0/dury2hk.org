I know, that's why I left it vague and wrote it that way, keyword there being "knowing". If I try to predict if I will succeed at stealing a car I want I know I am harming the owner, and also probably indirectly harming the owner's friends and family that might rely on the car or might be harmed by the misery of the car's owner. But if try to predict whether a possible future investment will benefit me, I don't really know if that would harm someone else, directly or indirectly...

Everything can be constructed to cause indirect harm, but as long as you don't do it, then it's fine. It's like a genie that only will try to screw you with the methods you can come up with, but if you can't come up with any then your wish is granted without consequences.
