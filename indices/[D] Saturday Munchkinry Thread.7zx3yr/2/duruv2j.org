Under the whim of some chaotic god whose name you don't know how to properly pronounce, you are given the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball][Magic 8 Ball]] of Power and Happiness. Unlike the more traditional ones this 8ball only has a decahedron inside with only 5 positive and 5 negative answers. The instructions that came with the 8ball tell you that it will only work under specific conditions, however the result will always be 100% accurate.

The conditions are:

- Your questions must always be asked with good "intent" behind them. If you try to make a prediction knowing that someone will be harmed by it, even if not directly, the chaotic god will smite a relative or a loved one.

- The questions must always be asked with the purpose of either conquering a country/the world, or reaching true happiness. Otherwise you won't get an answer at all.

- Within the span of 10 predictions, one of them must always be done with the intent of amusing the chaotic god. The counter resets every 10 predictions so it doesn't matter if it is the fourth or the eleventh one, but it must be done. Otherwise...

Some attributes of the 8ball to keep in mind:

- The card with the instructions/conditions/attributes is the "key" of the Magic 8 ball. The ball itself won't work unless the owner is the one asking the question and the card is within 5m of the ball and the owner.

- Every time you touch it, it releases a randomly disgusting and intense smell that can last from 10 minutes to 3 hours.

- Whenever you activate it, it will try to taunt you by laughing like a madman or crying like a baby.

- Predictions that result in the user being miserable lower the above effects, while predictions that greatly benefit the user will make the item temporarily unusable and generate a very strong but short ranged AoE mental attack that lasts for 6 hours (basically a car alarm in your head or [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nYKgkFvMM][this]])

- Ignoring the 8ball and therefore boring a chaotic god, is NOT a good idea. However, you can gift it to someone else as long as these two requirements are fulfilled: 1) You have to bathe the 8ball in your blood and clean it with your tongue. 2) You recognize the person you will gift it to as someone who is more fucked up than you are, and is even less qualified than you are to use it.

How would you take advantage of such a powerful yet obnoxious item? What kind of questions or "predictions" would you make?" would you even try? how long do you think it'll take until you get sick of it and try to give it away? are you willing to pay the price? or would you rather come with a way to bypass its obnoxiousness?
