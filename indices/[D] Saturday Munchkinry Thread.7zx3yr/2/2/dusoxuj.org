- To deal with the smell problem, keep the ball in contact with your skin at all times.

- Ask "will the Powerball lottery jackpot at X date be 500,000,000 or greater?"

- If yes, use standard binary hacking methods to get the correct ticket. We choose not to win the lottery every week because that would become suspicious.

- Amusement questions could be things like, "If I begin doing jumping-jacks on the sidewalk right now, would the jackpot on X date be higher?" or other completely random actions. We might get something good at random, but hopefully the God will be amused by a slew of creative and stupid questions.

- Once we win the lottery, we use the ball to predict market crashes so we can gobble up collapsed stocks like candy. We become the most successful hedge-fund manager ever, and our ball-required eccentricities get ignored by everyone. Use our newfound superwealth to politically conquer the United States and instantiate sensible reform.

- Hand the ball off to some random. Give them pointers in its use.
