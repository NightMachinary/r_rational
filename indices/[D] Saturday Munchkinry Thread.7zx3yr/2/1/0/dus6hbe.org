  What does it mean for a prediction to have a great benefit? Does knowing the nth bit of the answer to some question a great benefit? If it is, we're very limited to what we can ask.

It's just a limit to not let you go overboard as soon as you get the item, if you ask the ball if there's a way for you to become inmortal or stop a loved one's deadly disease, and the result ends up being yes...

But even then, the "mental attack" is just some stupid loud noise in your mind, which you can easily avoid if you just get outside the ball's range (or throw it away) and simply wait until it stops to pick it up again, which is 6 hours of waiting until you can use it again...

It might seem silly and a very low price to pay for an object that is OP, but every single aspect of the ball combined can eat away at a person's sanity, unless you somehow manage to get past that.
