Something that really should have occurred to me as soon as Riddle revealed his sabotage of Milo's Amulets of Protection from Evil: all of the Amulets from before Milo's possession are clean. He only needs to borrow one, keep the other person under heavy protection long enough to create another clean one, and then he's effectively safe even if Riddle can re-possess him.

Of course, with trust in Milo eroded, he might have a hard time convincing any of his party to let him borrow theirs, never mind the possibility that Riddle might actively interfere in this sot of thing from a distance.
