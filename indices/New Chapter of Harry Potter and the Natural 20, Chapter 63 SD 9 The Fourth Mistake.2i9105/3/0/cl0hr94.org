Nope. As per the text of the class, "When a new rainbow servant level is gained, the character gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in whatever spellcasting class in which she could cast 3rd-level arcane spells before she added the prestige class." The table indicates otherwise, but that's a mistake--text takes precedence.
