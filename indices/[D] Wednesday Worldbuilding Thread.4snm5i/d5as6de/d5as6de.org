Random world-building exercise! What would happen to society, if some arbitrarily chosen animal species developed human-level intelligence and can "magically" speak the human language?

You can decide how the species got their intelligence, but communication has to be easy to perform so it's not very easy to deny evidence of intelligent animals.

For coolness: octopi, horses, and dogs

For horror: cows and chicken

For the creep factor: plants and bacteria
