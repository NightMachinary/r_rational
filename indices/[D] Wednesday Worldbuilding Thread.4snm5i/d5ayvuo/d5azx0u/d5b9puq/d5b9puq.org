Some of the special moves need resources that are unlimited in the pokemon video game, but would be more limited in a rational game. All the water based attacks, for example, depend either on available water sources external to the pokemon, or the pokemon having a large internal supply of water. Flame attacks actually need something that burns, so the pokemon is limited by some internal supply of oil or gas. Etc.

So in general, the physical moves are easier to use multiple times in a single battle.
