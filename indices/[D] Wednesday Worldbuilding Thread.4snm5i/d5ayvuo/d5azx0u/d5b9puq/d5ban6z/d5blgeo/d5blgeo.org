So Psycho Cut is actually a move I feel like was poorly designed: its intention, flavor-wise, appears to be a move that shoulder operate by the same rules as Psyshock, a Special attack that deals Physical damage (uses the opponent's Defense instead of Special Defense).

But I agree that only certain special moves would need a more limiting resource, and that psychic attacks in general wouldn't be as limited as water attacks. The way to make this more balanced might be to allow resource-dependent pokemon to use significantly less Endurance for their special attacks, since they're using their "Resource" as well. Alternatively, when in an environment that allows them to recharge their limiting resource, they can recharge Endurance as well.

As an example, in the recent chapter Misty's starmie using the nearby water to use a Surf attack on the alakazam. Normally such an attack of that power might use, say, 30 Endurance. With mechanics (A) the attack only uses 15 Endurance, because it requires Starmie to also use her interior water supply *or* have water nearby to use, while with mechanics (B) it only used a net of 5 Endurance instead of the usual 30 because Starmie gained 25 Endurance by dipping into the water and sucking a bunch of it up.

*Pros and Cons of (A):*

*Pro* - More flexibility, realism, and ability to fine-tune balance and allow player ingenuity.

*Cons* - Requires a separate resource to be tracked for a multitude of pokemon. Blastoise might have water reserves of 100, while Squirtle has 20 and Starmie has 40. This can be annoying to keep track of, and the recharge rate should also be different.

*Pros and Cons of (B):*

*Pro* - Much more streamlined and mechanics-light.

*Cons* - Not quite as realistic, has some weird alternative interactions where a pokemon can now do more physical attacks after drinking in water, or even use other non-water special attacks since they all use Endurance.

As a final note, [[/u/ketura]], just wanted to say this is a really neat idea, and let me know if there's anything I can do to help with it :) I've designed a couple games myself, so I know how daunting some of the fine-tuning can be. In my head I see this working more easily as a tabletop RPG than a video game, but no reason it can't work as both with enough time and effort in coding.
