That could be handwaved, something something mental exertion blah blah. But you're right, and it doesn't help that any type move can be Special. What does it mean to have a Special Fighting move? Hmm, maybe like a chi move, I guess, could be draining. Special Rock? Tearing bits of yourself off, and so more demanding? I don't know if one could go down the list and justify why all 18 special types require more immediate exertion than their Physical counterparts, but I'd rather not go that route anyway.

It feels inherently un-rational to try and force them all to fit into two moulds of fast, automated, long-term-demanding moves on the one hand and slow, manual, short-term-demanding moves on the other. I don't particularly know how to solve it without handwaving and making it gamey. An obvious step is to make automated and aimed attacks not directly tied to the phys-spec spectrum. Another step would be to label something as "resource-intensive" vs "cantrip", with water gun in the former and karate chop in the latter. With Special-Physical as a third axis, plus type, that's essentially four separate axes that all moves would have to be divided into.

But then we get into DF-style complexity, and then do we have a game or a simulation? The line's a fine one.
