First off, the move "cooldown" resets faster, so repeated karate chops hit harder than repeated flamethrowers, making special much more risk-reward at close range...miss that hit and your opponent's gonna trade a lot better. Also since the moves recharge faster, the depleted endurance hit from the physical moves themselves won't be as much a factor in the formula, so I would tweak it to balance out. I imagine both physical and special as having the same dps (and endurance drain) on average, with special having powerful single strikes and physical being a lot of weaker quick ones (with outliers, of course). Physical wins the short-term endurance trade by ending the match, special wins the long-term one of they can line something up. Though physical would also encourage repeated move usage, pushing their max endurance higher faster in the long run.

Not to mention that this would follow gen iv's concept of phys/spec being intrinsic to the move itself, so no reason to not have both. Softening the 4 move restriction helps too. I really don't want hyperspecialized two or three move combos, one or two hit KOs would be all but nonexistant (i hope) and type advantage wouldn't be quite the catch-all it is now.

Also, in my head, special moves mostly have to be aimed, whereas physical operate more on an automated sentry mode. Vine whip will just hit if the opponent enters the sphere of influence (modified by accuracy) making agility the real trick, but hydro pump will need to be directed at the spot you /hope/ your opponent will be at, making positioning the emphasis. (Maybe that's too gamey? No /fundamental/ reason that you have to tell your retarded Kadabra how to land a mental AoE attack but your Snorlax just /knows/ how to flail his body across the battlefield with impunity. At the same time, good luck coming up with an interface to aim punches that's not just as gimmicky.)

A few things I didn't mention at all (but underlines most of this, I just realized): I would experiment with both sides taking turns simultaneously, in a pseudo-turn-based style. I expect the hit percentages to be similar to XCOM. /Landing/ the hit is almost more important than which hit was used, with different moves enabling different ranges, AoE, positioning, or whatnot. Tell your blastoise to charge, tackle, sidestep, headbutt, then hydro pump at the spot you hope the other guy's sitting stunned in, and then start running again towards the hex you just knocked him in to body slam. I imagine the throwaway early moves like tackle, quick attack, gust, etc, having very important utility in combining movement with attacking, with higher level stuff being more damage focused, including mostly special moves. Switching would be nerfed significantly, needing the same time delay as Origin of Species, giving up X ticks in the process.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I expect someone with 4-6 trained special moves is going to get shrekked by someone with a more flexible kit and a finisher or so.

Sorry for the wall of text, you gave me a lot to think about. It's definitely shaky right now, it's the sort of thing that would just need to be playtested ruthlessly.
