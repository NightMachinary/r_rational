So I'm in the middle of brainstorming the mechanics of turning [[/u/DaystarEld]] 's rational pokemon into a video game. I might toy around with making at least a small slice of such a game if I can convince myself that it works well enough, but I probably won't. How would you rational-ize a game in general? Specifically, how would one do it for pokemon?
