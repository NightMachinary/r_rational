Ha, maybe. If game deepness is an axis, with canon pokemon on one end and dwarf fortress is on the other, I guess this theoretical game would be about...an inch from canon pokemon.

But yeah, DF and Nethack are never too far from my mind when considering game design, for reasons that you're probably already familiar with. Having a system that's approachable on the one hand and yet complex enough for emergent auto-drunken cats on the other is the goal. Just maybe a smidgen more approachable than DF itself.
