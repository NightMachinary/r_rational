Some good points, especially re:world impacting gameplay. I suppose I instinctively restricted myself to something that I could feasibly implement; a deeper, more rational battle system is potentially very satisying while still actually being achievable. I love the idea of tracking individual pokemon, attracting local fauna, tracking injuries, environmental traps, and arduous journeys, but by the time I would have such a system, I'd have made the Witchermon, and that's just not realistically achievable. Though now I reeeeeeally want to play such a thing.

(Not to mention my skill set: I'm a programmer and an alright animator, but standard art is right out, so my mind is already automatically filtering scopes that can't be covered by just those two skills.)
