Right, "rational" game systems to me are more proof of concept of how bad reality actually is than the contrary, they are not the best abstraction in gameplay terms and more importantly I think an implementation like you explained above would be completely different from Pokemon and best explored like such, don't constrain yourself with it.

My other point though, is that the portrait of the world expands on certain abstractions which go much further and can be implemented to have consequences on gameplay.

Injuries have a certain permanence and weight, even potions take time to recover the health and serve as more temporary aids than 100% recovery items. Travels are long and resources more scarce, each player character should only be able to walk certain distances daily. Money is far tighter and grinding is not really such an available solution, bringing with it a greater risk while also a lesser reward.

You can avoid or pursue Pokemon so you see them on the overworld, you can use environment means to capture above your level and you have situations where you can do nothing other than run. Damage is also persistent on wild Pokemon and interacting with one can give way to other getting near.

There are a lot of additions made to the fic which help ground it and which can have certainly a lot of impact on the end game result, the most direct method of interaction(in other words, the battles) need not necessarily be it.

Although now I have ideas of doing a small game to explore that, shame.
