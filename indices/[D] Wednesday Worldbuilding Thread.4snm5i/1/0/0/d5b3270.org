A little of column A, a lot of column B. I'm definitely more concerned with game mechanics; how the world operates is 80% a story matter and is thus solved by getting a competent rational writer. Building a "rational" game system is more tricky in it needing to be fun and usable while at the same time not being irrational. Though since I'm not even sure what it /means/ to have a "rational game", that makes it all the trickier.
