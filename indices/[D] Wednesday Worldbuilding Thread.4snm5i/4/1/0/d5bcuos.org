/How do doppleg√§ngers work? Do parallel universes have a single point of divergence where their history splits off from ours, or were they always different? In either case, how come the protagonist's mother fell in love with the same man and conceived an apparently identical child, and the same question for all their ancestors going back to the point of divergence, when there's otherwise significant differences in their lives (people who died in one world and lived in the other)?/

It's not a parallel version of Earth. It's an entirely different planet named Gaia, with apparently the same species who has arisen on that planet, with an entirely different history filled with entirely different nations and culture that managed to nonetheless resonate with ours. What's the term for it? Convergent?

Regarding the existence of droppleganger? He built a device to transport him to personally relevant situation in the right dimension. This only works for him, and no one else. Is that sufficient rationalization? How could I even start when the world in question is not even some alternate version of Earth?

/Tell me more about the protagonist's personality. He spent a fortune on a transporter that he didn't think would work. He worries about the fate of his mother's alternate, but not of his own alternate or any of his mother's friends. When going into unexplored territory, he takes a gun, not a camera. All these choices are building up a picture of his personality, but your summary doesn't have a lot of details. Can you just tell me the sort of personality you're trying to give him?/

I didn't give much thought, unfortunately. I was focused entirely on his mother. Anyway, he can only fit in one other person. If there's any dear friends of his mother, he would have to prioritize his mom over them.

Personality-wise? I think of him skeptical, paranoid anti-government computer nerd. He doesn't trust people, frequently thinking about how organization large and small fail.

/There's a war on. A man shows up out of the blue with no local currency, no papers, a concealed weapon, and very strange behaviour. The correct conclusion from this evidence is that he is an enemy spy. How does he make it 24 hours without attracting the police's attention?/

An enemy spy? That would not be the conclusion I make. A spy blend in with his surrounding. He does not. He's suspicious in all the wrong way.

Anyway, he made 24 hours because he stopped wearing strange clothes when he sold jewelries to a pawn shop and brought himself clothes to blend in a little better. The pawn shop might report him, but they might not. They're probably a disreputable operation. He probably got ripped off too.

Also, while there's a war going on, people are not necessarily assuming an invasion or is all that prepared to resist, because they didn't think they'll be a target. They're a 'neutral' country.
