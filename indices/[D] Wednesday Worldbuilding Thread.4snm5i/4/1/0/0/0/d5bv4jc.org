/That works, I suppose. It redirects those questions to the dimensional travel machine, which is already granted suspension of disbelief. But it's not ideal. It still leaves too many questions about how the machine works and why it was designed that way./

Sorry if it wasn't clear, but it's more about him than the machine. Only he can do the kind of navigation that he's doing to reach distant dimension. Anyone can use the machine, but then they have no idea of where they're jumping in.

He doesn't know either, but there's some kind of power guiding him in constructing a theory of trans-dimensional travel, the machine thereafter, and navigation.

/The simplest possibility is just leaving it unexplained and inexplicable. First line of the story: One day, Jacques Moyen found an interdimensional portal in his living room./

No, that wouldn't be an option at all. I am starting with this story since it's the simplest and most limited that I can think of. I want to keep scope creep to a minimal so I can focus on writing a good story.

However, as soon we move beyond that, it is always my intention to build on the implication of multi-dimensional travel. It must involves government, researchers, and people.

/You're right and I'm wrong about the spy thing. He'll probably be fine for a while./

I agreed that he will probably be fine. Still, it's a good idea to examine why he might be fine.

Anyway, in the larger society, people meet very strange customers all the time. The question is whether or not it arouse suspicion by shopkeepers. Pawn shop do not want to buy stolen merchandise unless they are a fence.

Even if they're a fence, they're not going to take stolen property from someone they don't know.

So, they might not accept gold jewelries from a stranger if they cannot somehow validate a person's story. He might not get arrested, but he won't have local currencies to spend, either.

Our intrepid traveler have no form of identification that is acceptable to pawnshops. The only thing he can rely on is the credibility of his story.

The current solution I have in mind is a lie detector. Our pawnshop keeper is very good is detecting thieves and people on the run from the law, and that's all he care about.

If you have better solution, feel free to offer one.
