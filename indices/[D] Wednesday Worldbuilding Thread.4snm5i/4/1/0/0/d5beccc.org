  Regarding the existence of droppleganger? He built a device to transport him to personally relevant situation in the right dimension. This only works for him, and no one else. Is that sufficient rationalization? How could I even start when the world in question is not even some alternate version of Earth?

That works, I suppose. It redirects those questions to the dimensional travel machine, which is already granted suspension of disbelief. But it's not ideal. It still leaves too many questions about how the machine works and why it was designed that way.

At this point the dimensional travel machine /being a machine/ is raising more questions than it answers. Machines have to be researched, designed, built, etc. and that's getting in the way of the story you want to tell, which is about the protagonist's relationship with his mother. Have you considered making the dimensional travel not come from a machine?

The simplest possibility is just leaving it unexplained and inexplicable. First line of the story: /One day, Jacques Moyen found an interdimensional portal in his living room./

And then you get straight to the main plot. You don't have to explain where it came from or how it works, unless it contributes to the story you want to tell. If you do explain it, there are other explanations than "a machine the protagonist invented" that you should also look at.

You're right and I'm wrong about the spy thing. He'll probably be fine for a while.
