Critiquing from a rational perspective (I'd give different advice if I saw this post in [[/r/writing]] or [[/r/scifiwriting]]).

How do doppleg√§ngers work? Do parallel universes have a single point of divergence where their history splits off from ours, or were they always different? In either case, how come the protagonist's mother fell in love with the same man and conceived an apparently identical child, and the same question for all their ancestors going back to the point of divergence, when there's otherwise significant differences in their lives (people who died in one world and lived in the other)?

Tell me more about the protagonist's personality. He spent a fortune on a transporter that he didn't think would work. He worries about the fate of his mother's alternate, but not of his own alternate or any of his mother's friends. When going into unexplored territory, he takes a gun, not a camera. All these choices are building up a picture of his personality, but your summary doesn't have a lot of details. Can you just tell me the sort of personality you're trying to give him?

There's a war on. A man shows up out of the blue with no local currency, no papers, a concealed weapon, and very strange behaviour. The correct conclusion from this evidence is that /he is an enemy spy/. How does he make it 24 hours without attracting the police's attention?
