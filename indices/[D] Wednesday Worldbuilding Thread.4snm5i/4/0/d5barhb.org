pet peeve here: why does he just /happen/ to meet his mother?

The portal device doesn't break SOD because it's the story's entire premise. Fantasy setting rarely break my SOD because the entire point is that they're fantastical-- sure, they're not /realistic/ but if they were, why would I be reading the story? But you've already established the premise, so everything after that should come around for a reason. Maybe your protagonist gets some lucky breaks, but seeing his mother's doppelganger, out of billions of possible randoms?

Your story isn't impossible to write, but that should be addressed, first and foremost.
