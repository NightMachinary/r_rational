If she was doing a lot of stuff to maintain her health and appearance... I would assume she was just aging really well and using diet, exercise, and make-up effectively. Occasionally I might make comments on it, but she could deflect them by saying stuff along the lines of, "oh your grandmother aged really well also". This would work okay probably all the way up until I started getting into middle age myself. Even then, if she gradually used makeup to make herself look older, it might be a while before I got really suspicious.
