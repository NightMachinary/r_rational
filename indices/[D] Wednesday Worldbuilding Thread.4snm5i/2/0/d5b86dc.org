This is an interesting question. The majority of a spear is wood, with just a tiny sliver of metal at the end. And I wonder how needed the spearhead really is if metal is too rare to make full armor. Plus there are other things you could stick at the end, such as obsidian or even just stone. Or maybe glass or harder woods such as ironwood. Or just sharpen and burn the end.

Horseshoes are one thing I don't think you could replace, though Wikipedia says that there were straight alternatives sort of like sandals made of rawhide that the Romans used anyway.

Gold is obviously worthless for anything that needs to be hard. Silver was used for lots of things, and I wonder if it couldn't replace bronze in a pinch, albeit at a much steeper rarity. Iron only came after bronze, with its primary advantage that it only needs a single ore and not two to forge. Speaking of which, remove copper and you lose bronze, and tin was rare as it was, making up like 15% of the bronze blend.

So to answer your question, I think iron could disappear with the least amount of impact to a Roman-era civilization, assuming you just coped with bronze. Assuming you went with zero metals, gold would probably be missed the least, what with it just being a currency and all. Clubs would never come into it, with spears being so much easier to wield and impacted less than swords.
