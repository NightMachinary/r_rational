Not "world-building" per se, but here's a way to make this semi-viable:

Let's say, five years from now, we get machine learning down well enough to apply it efficiently to translation algorithms. Pretty soon, we have excellent translations from even languages as disparate as chinese and english, or portuguese and hindu, or whatever.

Then, some bright researcher decides to apply this to elephants/dolphins.

It turns out that it actually works reasonably well, and bam-- it turns out humans aren't so alone after all.
