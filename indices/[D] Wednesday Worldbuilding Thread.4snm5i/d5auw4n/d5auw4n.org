I got a story in my head sketched out for the first arc of my multiverse story I wanted to do. I scoped it all the way down to one other world and to a single arc in the story.

The first arc explore about what would you do if you encounter your own mother in another reality, especially one that is alive?

The setting is WW2 era analogue planet named Gaia, a world that is very much like ours, except with different countries, geography, and world history. It nonetheless still managed to resonate with us, as there are many analogue in their world history to ours.

Anyway, the traveler found himself in a country on the verge of war. A nation had already capitulated, and there's already a flood of people trying to flee or emigrate. He encountered a doppelganger of his deceased mother, complete with a son who looked very much like him. The complication is that she's a member of a persecuted religious minority, a religion that proclaimed a belief in one god, unlike others that were still very much polytheistic. He became convinced that his mother were in grave danger.

Of course, the traveler arrived in a fantastical machine from a fantastical world with knowledge of a world war and an equally unbelievable holocaust. How could he convince her to flee with him in a strange machine?

Anyway, below is a summary of the plot so to speak. I wrote it out in one sitting so it's going to be absolute crap, but I find it really helpful to get all out so that I can improve upon it.

*pre-alpha plot below*

Our trans-dimensional traveler managed to invent a machine to travel between one universe to another. Unfortunately, it costs a gobble of money and expertise to make and had numerous limitations that boiled down to him being able to make only one journey in a span of twenty four hours. How he got this money? A hard drive full of cash, essentially.

He was certain that it's baloney of an idea(due to physicists rejecting it out of hand as crackpottery and his own skepticalism), but he tried it anyway.

Lo and behold. He jumped to a different dimension, but not without some preparation, such as gold jewelries and a concealed weapon.

He waltzed into town, casually sold his jewelries to whatever pawnshop nearby, and acquired clothing to blend in.

Then he meet what looked like his mom. His mother passed away years ago. Immediately, he got hugged by this woman.

It turned out that she think he's her son, and that she was really relieved to see him back.

Along the way, he seen hint of the trouble to come. People are leaving, newspapers talking about an invasion and capitulation of a country, a people being exiled or rounded up.

Confused, our intrepid traveler journeyed home to this woman's abode.

The woman wanted to know why our protagonist went away to fight in a civil war halfway around for Republican Amerika(I haven't much details on this world other than it's in an equivalent of WW2).

Drama ensues. The traveler realized that this woman is a droppleganger. How should he proceed? Do he take the place of his son? Can he convince her that he's like his son?

He couldn't answer the question about why he's fighting in a country so far away. Instead, he tried to tell the truth.

The mother did not take this as truth as it's obviously fantastical. So he tried a different tack, telling her that he isn't who she think he is. She's unconvinced, especially after doing rapid fire questioning that only her son would know.

Feeling guilty about taking somebody's place, he ran out, find a hotel room so he can think about things some more. It is this time around that he overheard a conversation about people leaving. He decided to join in, ask questions, some of which were very basic, but which were answered(in condescending ways).

It is this conversation when he realized that this person he met earlier could be in danger.

He went to bed, then woke up to the sounds of buzzing planes. People were shouting about an invasion.

Our traveler immediately realized that his mother could be in danger once again. So he made pace for his mother's abode.

Once there, he tried to convince his mother leaving, but she was in denial, reasoning that there were no way to go. Frustrated, he forcefully grabbed her hand and made way for the machine.

Along the way, she tried to protest and argued against leaving, but elected not to put up any resistance. He tried to answer her questions as best he could, but all that was making the mother thinking he's deluded.

Finally, they arrived at the machine, but she was arguing with him as to if she should enter the machine.

A plane screeched by, crashing into the ground, momentarily distracting his mother.

He lead his mother once again into the machine, and then jumped just as another plane was about to crash into the ground.

*End*

Once the arc concluded, we could explore the implication of someone who is very much like your mother staying with you, but is from another place altogether in a time period not so dissimilar to world war two.
