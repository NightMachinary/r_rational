I was thinking it would be neat if they at least showed someone with a pet dodo or something.

I feel like this is sort of a general problem to making sequels to shows with a sci-fi premise like that. If Jurassic Park or Tron or War Games happened twenty years ago, our world would be massively different. Any sequel would be less of a rehash of the old movie but happening now, and more an exploration of the world that was started in the earlier movie.
