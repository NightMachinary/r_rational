It's NSFW, but not particularly explicit. Generally the NSFW parts boil down to "then they had sex" (or "then they wanted to have sex over the Internet, so here's a detailed explanation of the technology that could go in to making that work. Then they had sex over the internet").

Edit: I think this quote perfectly sums up the book.
