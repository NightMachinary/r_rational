I think that's what drew me. That it reminded me of HPMOR: part Socratic dialogue, part mad science brainstorm. (If you've read the Girl Genius webcomic, it too has a conversational style to it, with this mad-bent momentum that builds to super-transhumanism.)

This conversational style is not the polished experience we expect of classic [Hugo & Nebula] Sci-did, but it provides us the immersion of someone ratchet deep in the mental machinery of breaking humanity through the transhumanism, AGI, and post-scarcity boundaries.
