  If you've read the Girl Genius webcomic, it too has a conversational style to it

I do enjoy Girl Genius. But the thing is, a comic is pictures and dialogue. So, when a webcomic is conversational in style, what has a conversational style /is its dialogue/.

A written work's dialogue can be just as conversational as a webcomic's, and so the SSaFR dialogue is fine. It's everything /else/ that feels off. It's the conversational /narration/ that's irking me.
