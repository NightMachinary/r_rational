There's a fair amount of meat left on the bone with this episode, and it's likely that we'll do a follow-up on it at some point in the future, covering stuff like:

- Intersectionality (almost no one is a central example of a group, and is rarely defined by only their (willing or unwilling) membership to a single group, we might get to this in a future episode on sex and gender in fiction instead)
- Default frames
- Racism and other bigotry as "cartoonish" (something that I've seen a lot lately, and want to talk about, e.g. why people have this view, what you can do with writing to avoid it)
- Bad tropes and things to avoid
- Writing with history in mind

If there's anything that you'd like us to talk about that we didn't cover in this episode, let us know here.

(We've already recorded an episode about species.)
