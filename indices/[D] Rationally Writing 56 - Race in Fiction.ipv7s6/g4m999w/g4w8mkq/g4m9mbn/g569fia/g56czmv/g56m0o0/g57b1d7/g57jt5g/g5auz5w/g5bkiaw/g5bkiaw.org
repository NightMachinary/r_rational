I get what you're saying, and I definitely think that "post-racial wonderland" can definitely be that, depending on how it's written. Sometimes "post-racial wonderland" means that everyone has conformed to whiteness, with all traces of culture and style ripped out, and the white racial frame completely dominating, with racial concerns erased from the picture.

And even if the intent is to posit a fictional world where everyone is colorblind, where there is no discrimination, bigotry, or prejudice, there are problems with that too, partly because it's a fantasy that pretends problems don't exist, partly because it will necessarily mean at least /some/ erasure of minority races, since discrimination, bigotry, and prejudice are one of the defining features of that experience.

And yeah, one of the failure modes of writing "the other" is to pour the non-other into their skin, or if you're attempting the post-racial wonderland, to have it be majority white, or inside the white frame. Sometimes achieving that wonderland happens by just stripping out things like heritage and culture, leaving only phenotypes. All you have is the default frame ... which is white.

I do think there's some merit to a media crit idea of a post-racial wonderland though, in the sense of writing about race in such a way that you pretend to the audience that the social construct of race either doesn't exist or doesn't matter. There are problems with it, both from a theoretical perspective and an as-used-in-practice perspective, but it's something that people do make attempts at.

(This is one of the reasons that 'default frame' is on the docket for a follow-up, because I think it's a complicated thing.)
