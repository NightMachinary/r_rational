There are definitely situations like that, probably even most of them, but I think the default example I'd go with is Star Trek. Race exists, but in basically every appreciable sense, just doesn't matter. There are of course periphery factors like "how many of the main characters are white" that usually come as a result of the time period or social norms the show arises from, but it was explicitly modeling a world in which humanity is post-racial, and they did a lot to show that both in-universe and through the writing and casting of the show.
