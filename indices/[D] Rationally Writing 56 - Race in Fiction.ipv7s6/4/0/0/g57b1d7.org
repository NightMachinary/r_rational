For what it was, Star Trek was a very progressive show. Having the first black woman portrayed in a professional type job was huge. But I don't think I've ever seen Uhura interact with another black person. I definitely haven't seen her drop the "act this way or the cops will shoot you" act, even behind closed doors. She has to fit perfectly into this "white person" box, and any aspects of her racial identity that don't fit don't have a place in this supposed wonderland.

Where any person does display traits of their ethnicity or race in their actions or behaviors, such as Scotty's accent, it's often there to create comedic relief rather than to create a feeling of racial diversity or inclusiveness. Maybe there was something different in those episodes I didn't get to see, but from the more general theme I doubt it.

Again, not dissing Star Trek. It was a great show and very progressive for its time. If that's the best example of a "post racial wonderland" then it shows that wonderland is pretty much always a "white man's wonderland" in everything but name.
