I think we're actually getting away from my point. The question of what makes up the default culture is kind of central to it.

Race is brought up every time there is an opportunity for someone to behave in a way that does or does not match their cultural values and upbringing, whether one likes it or not, and whether one notices or not. You'll notice more often when you're familiar with the relevant cultures, and another person will notice the ones they're familiar with. And that's ok (if I'd been close to more Asian kids when I was into star trek would the first thing I remembered been the fact that there are like 5 asian people in all of Starfleet even though most people on real earth are asian? Maybe so. Others certainly have and it's a good point.)

Think about what it means when a character in a diverse cast always chooses to go against what a reasonable person with a matching background would expect. There are lots of reasons this might happen, and if it's an MC subverting expectations in a particular way or with a particular pattern it may even be a statement. Next, think about what it means when /every/ such character in such a cast subverts similar expectations by similar people, relevant to their own background. Finally think about what it means when every such character in such a cast does that, /except the British wealthy class ones./

The first is a rebel and understandable, but maybe not relevant to a discussion about how groups are represented overall. The second is an attempt at such a wonderland, if a bit jarring at first, and likely to upset people before they get what's going on. But it's a clear attempt. The third is a clear message by whoever made that call, that "this is not for you."

Now, everyone has their unconscious biases. The default culture will end up being whatever the author, editor, writers, or whoever don't think to question. Unfortunately, this eliminates the possibility of the second scenario above, and attempting it leads to the third scenario. Thus a post-racial wonderland where race doesn't matter is impossible to put into your writing, unless it's only a wonderland for a certain group or demographic.

As an aside, the opposite approach may make great alien worlds or feel of unfamiliarity. Start with a list of all racial and cultural identities, and roll a d10000 for each aspect of world building. Cabbage based staple foods, rickshaws for public transport, teepee based architecture, Traditional southern USA clothing, and so on, in the same place, is just familiar enough to make the combination seem even more strange and unfamiliar than if you'd just made stuff up.
