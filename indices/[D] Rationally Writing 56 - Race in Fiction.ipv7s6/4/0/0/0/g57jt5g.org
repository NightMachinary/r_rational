Ahh I see your point better now. I think that opens a different can of worms up though, like our brief discussion of the phrase "acting white." A lot of black people don't actually identify with the sort of behavior that others might intrinsically associate with them, and it's hard to make any sort of judgement call on that sort of thing /for/ other people. Did it bother you that Sulu didn't "act Asian" or talk to other Asian characters? If not, why not?

To be clear, I think both equality /and/ diversity as its own metric are good to maximize, so I don't disagree with you in principle. But when it specifically comes to far-future, ostensibly post-racial societies, the lack of identifiable modern earth cultures is often a feature, not a bug.

(There's another potential problem buried in there, where "white culture" is treated as the "default," but I think you get what I mean?)
