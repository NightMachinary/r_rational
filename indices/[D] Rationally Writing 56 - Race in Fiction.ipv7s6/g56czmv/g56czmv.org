I think you guys are wrong about the "post-racial wonderland" approach. Race is brought up all the time, just not in a way people of the target demographic are likely to notice. Any character who's of any other demographic is just forced into the same box to force a particular impression, but it's going to be a different impression for the target demographic vs those who notice. It's more of a "white man's wonderland."
