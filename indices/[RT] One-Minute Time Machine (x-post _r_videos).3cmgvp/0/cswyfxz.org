Seems like a subclass of the teleporter problem; if "you" die and are reconstituted elsewhere, does this matter? I mean, given my beliefs on the matter, I'm pressing that button all day long. (Though this short raises a lot of questions, like why this guy's first thought was that he should use the button to seduce this random woman. Or how anyone knows about the parallel worlds. Or where this time machine came from.)
