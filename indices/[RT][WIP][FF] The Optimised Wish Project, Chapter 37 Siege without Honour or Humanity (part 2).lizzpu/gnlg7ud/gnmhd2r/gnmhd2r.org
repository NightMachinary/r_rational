Fair worry. The limits will be soon shown but here they are:

For Chiaotzu, same as canon, he must stand still, can only use it on one target at a time and can't be someone stronger than himself - it's a telekinetic lock, not mind control, and can be overcome by brute strength. For Flute it's one target at a time and needs some degree of continuity. Not constant eye contact, but if he gets too far from the target for too long, or loses consciousness, the control is broken.
