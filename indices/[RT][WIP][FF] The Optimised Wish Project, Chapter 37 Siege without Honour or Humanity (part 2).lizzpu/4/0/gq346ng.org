That /is/ a good point I guess. I suppose I thought of it more as a symbolic and political gesture. While Red was incompetent, he was also without any doubt the 'legitimate' owner of the Red Ribbon, descending from the original one. Since after all it's basically a private enterprise. Black is much more capable, but also not related to the family. In fact, in the end, even within the "loyalist" side of the Ribbon we see how his authority ends up being undermined and disobeyed because some will see him as not especially superior to them, someone who simply landed in that position due to being closest to it when Red was shot. Though of course that's not true, he's plenty deserving of it. But yes, basically removing Red removes the /one/ clear source of authority within the Ribbon, as well as giving a huge morale boost to the Instruments themselves who feel like they have destroyed their ties to the organisation and struck a blow against its weakness. Might not be the most practical action to take, though; in some ways it might have made things even easier for them if they did not have to contend with a smart commander (but then again, in that scenario, General Copper's own little mutiny likely wouldn't have happened).
