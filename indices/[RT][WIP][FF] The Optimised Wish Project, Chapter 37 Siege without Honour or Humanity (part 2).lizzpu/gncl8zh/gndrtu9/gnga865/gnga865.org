I actually tried to research whether that specific move would work or just blow up the grenade sooner. My best guess was in the end that it should work: the grenade works by having a detonator and fuse as a kernel inside a powder chamber (well, most common grenades do). So depressurizing the powder and separating it from the fuse that quickly should in theory defuse it or cause it to fizzle. It's of course something absolutely crazy to do in any real life scenario, since no one has that kind of strength or industrial tools conveniently at hand and ready for use when a grenade is tossed at them, so in the end I couldn't find any real answer. Scientific rigor would demand an experiment, common sense says this is probably as good a guess as I need for a Dragon Ball fanfiction.
