My understanding is that this is how the RR characters would go about rationally trying to take down a DB-tier martial artist, and just ki-biting the grenade to uselessness is totally something Toriyama would have had Tien do. As that doesn't contradict the way feats work in this fic, why not?

If he'd stabbed-and-blasted it with his tongue, that would have been a callback to Tao's lick-of-death, but I assume training for that ability necessarily involves this as well.
