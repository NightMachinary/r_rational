I can't say I'm surprised that this is ending in Piccolo being released, but it was still a fun road getting to this point. I'm curious to see how Piccolo is in this fic, since if I recall the original was basically a Saturday morning cartoon villain who did evil for the sake of being evil. I can't imagine the author is going to stick with that original characterization given the tone of this fic.
