If the Son of Katatsu was mostly a good person, the evil he cast of might not be very substantial. Some animal instincts, selfish impulses and uncouth desires maybe - only the scraps of a person, not a full personality. That would explain how he functions as a cartoonish villain, since there really isn't much depth to him as a person.

I also gives him plenty of room to grow into a more complex and nuanced version of himself later on. That very well might make him more of a good person, as happened in canon, but not necessarily. If he was conscious in the prison, he might have grown and evolved in entirely new twisted ways.
