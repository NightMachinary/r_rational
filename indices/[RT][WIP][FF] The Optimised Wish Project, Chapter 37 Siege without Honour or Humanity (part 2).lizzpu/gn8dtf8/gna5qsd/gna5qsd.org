To be fair, original Piccolo was literally evil made flesh. More interesting, I think, would be to consider exactly what kinds of evil the Son of Katatsu had to cast off to become Kami. It isn't strange for people to have feelings and temptations that conflict with the core of who they want to be, sometimes with a reasonable explanation behind them, others with mere carnality or consequence of chemical wonkiness. What in the world was going through proto-Kami's mind, that he was willing and able to take on the role of Earth's Kami, but that his ejected evil became Piccolo?

Original Piccolo seeking power, and pragmatically killing off his biggest threats, I can see coming from Kami. What about the support for anarchy and generalized violence and destruction? There's a solid core there, maybe, but it's, as you say, too cartoonish to trace back conceptually. Given how Shenlong and Enma have been depicted, I am certainly interested to see how Kami is characterized, here, and in a sense, Piccolo should be a hint at pre-ascension Kami.
