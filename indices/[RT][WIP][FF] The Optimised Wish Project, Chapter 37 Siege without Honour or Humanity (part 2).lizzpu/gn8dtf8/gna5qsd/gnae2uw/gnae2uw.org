The idea of "the guy who became guardian of earth cast off all his evil and it became a person of its own" is a really interesting premise for a character, definitely. What sort of mindset would a person like Piccolo actually have? If he has all of Kami's memories up to the split, what does he think of them? Does he think of himself as Kami's cast-off junk, or is he convinced that Kami is the junk? There's plenty to explore there, especially after Piccolo has been active for long enough to diverge more thoroughly from his original state.
