1. No, powers like these are inherently tied to the body and its ability to manipulate, shape and project ki/magic. The soul alone can't use them, so the dead don't possess them. Also, the King of All - or his equivalent in the alternative continuity of this fic - has power on a completely different level. Divine ki in general is a different thing from the stuff normal mortals wield, this applies also to the Kais. It's like having admin privileges. See how in Dragon Ball Super even Goku in his SSJ3 form couldn't lay a finger on Beerus. It's not just a quantitative difference, but a qualitative one - at least that's how I interpret it. I know that in canon this does not apply to the Kais, apparently, but here I invoke my power to retcon whatever the fuck I want when I think it doesn't make sense.

2. No, neither of them. Chiaotzu's control would be broken by sheer power. With Flute the ki gap is also just too big. Consider that magic and ki are two sides of the same coin, ki used for fighting is just a more raw, unpolished form of it that simply strengthens or destroys instead of achieving subtler effects. But you can still use it to shield yourself from magic effects if you have enough of it. It's inefficient so you must vastly outstrip the "attacking" force but it's possible. Frieza wouldn't be turned into a carrot by the rabbit dude who died in chapter 3 either.
