1. An organization/sorting system. Ideally, tags associated with each and every photograph, and the ability to comb through it all so that I can quickly find (for example) a diagram showing different cuts of meat.
2. Pictures of text. This might be cheating, but it simplifies life immensely, especially if I can overlay text onto pictures. Pictures of people would have their biographical information. If my tagging system works, I would be able to search "female" "blonde" "work" in order to figure out who I was talking to (along with personal interests, etc.). Much more useful if I have contextual facial recognition built in, and if I can do this on the fly without vocalizing.
3. Instructions for things I might need to do. Diagrams of which fork goes with which course. How to tie a tie. First aid. How to change a tire. How to survive in the woods. Identification guide for mushrooms. Etc. Works a lot better with the tagging system, or if I can have distinct (well-organized) folders.
4. A detailed map of the city I live in, along with all other places that I have been known to go.
5. Depending on space available, a collection of paintings and artwork to look at in my leisure time. If I can have (zoomable) pictures of text, probably some books to read too.

Some of these functions are duplicated by having a simple smartphone, and some are only worthwhile depending on the interface available to me.
