  Storage space of say a standard cheap pendrive.

So, maybe 32 gigabytes.

#+begin_quote
  No indexing issues.

By which you mean the storage system comes with a good indexing system? I can insert images along with some metadata and throw that all together into Lucene or something else running in my brain? Well then... /cracks knuckles/

I insert 1px images with interesting data as metadata. Specifically, I have one field as a Wikipedia article title, and I have another field as that Wikipedia article's full text. With the space limitations, I can store a good chunk of Wikipedia, though not the full thing. The issue is the lack of a UI to read that index.

But for the most part, I have a phone, so I don't really need anything like what you're describing. The lower latency would be nice, but it's only pictures, not interactive, and not /that/ much storage.
