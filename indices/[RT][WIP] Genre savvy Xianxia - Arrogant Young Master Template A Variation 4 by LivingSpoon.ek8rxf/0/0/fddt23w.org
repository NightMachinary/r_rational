Curiously (after reading through the 35 available chapters) I had the opposite impression; it starts fairly generic as oh-no-I've-transmigrated-with-a-system-as-the-cannon-fodder-so-I-have-to-suck-up-to-the-MC ('The Scum Villain's Self-Saving System', 'The Price of Confessing To The Wrong Female Protagonist', 'There's a Pit in My Senior Martial Brother's Brain'), but later seems to start unfolding in larger, more unorthadox ways.

As others note, the beneficial coincidences do feel quite contrived, to the degree of of (remembering a different story) 'huh, I have zero fighting ability yet always trip in exactly the right way to KO the expert fighting me' contrivance. That said, that in itself doesn't exceed the degree of transmigration stories in which a desperate-for-survival transmigrator is misunderstood as self-sacrificing.

The 'right, respond to suspicious threats with INCREDIBLE FORCE' was extremely refreshing, as I don't believe I've seen it often, if at all--it's an appropriate which can only be taken narratively because there are so many threats, so many pieces in play.

If the protagonist can accomplish far-reaching plans and the actions and motivations of the characters can hang together plausibly, I look forward to seeing how the world's events develop. If instead it collapses from the author being crushed by the complexity, then less so.

The strung-along-by-the-system state is a limiting factor for the protagonist, almost forced to expend resources as soon as he gets them--though if he can get a firmer foundation in the doing, then all the better. He does however seem to suffer from the common system-blindness, in that he doesn't seem to question much "Wait, systems actually exist? Who made them, what do they want, how much does this real one have to do with amateur-novelists' depictions of them and what's the connection?".

...hmm, what other thoughts... pretty much just 'after reading the available 35 chapters all at once, I've found the chapters humorous and refreshing'.

Hmm, I'm considering now that most (translated) stories on these lines have been 'premise...so that romance-fluff story!' in some way, where all the interesting context and humour is for the sake of being the backdrop to the inter-character emotions. I feel that few stories have the interesting world and the changes to it as a result of the protagonist's actions as the main focus. <contemplation of Lord of the Mysteries and Master of Gu>

Edit: Attempting further introspection, even while I enjoy the two just above, they are also cases of protagonists being plunked down in a situation and going step by step according to the provided rules, if sometimes in ingenious ways. Stories with systems don't affect this, just making the paths of progression more exclusive. Perhaps what I thirst for is someone 'changing the game', deliberately going laterally in ways that take people completely by surprise and end up working better than the alternative, the protagonist outwitting the setting rather than clearing it on its terms. Hmm. Granted, I do derive pleasure from Peggy Sue foreknowledge stories where the story shows you the dominos, shows you how they're going to fall, and then shows you the protagonist shifting a few dominos directions and falling gloriously in a completely counter outcome. There overall the power is still handed-on-a-plate, yet the microcosm smashing is pleasant... hm. Boring though when it's raw combat power rather than a-little-knowlege-which-can-be-exploited which is handed on a plate, though.
