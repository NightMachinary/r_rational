  "Wait, systems actually exist? Who made them, what do they want, how much does this real one have to do with amateur-novelists' depictions of them and what's the connection?".

Is there a ratfic specifically about this? Like, to an even greater degree than /Worth the Candle/ is?

Ideally, it'd have a setting where /creating new, visitable sibling universes with their own internal civilizations that think of their location as "reality"/ is itself a formal, rule-based magic system of the setting, one which isn't "hidden behind the curtain of mysticism" when it's used, but rather described explicitly (hopefully in the way that e.g. the first chapter of Greg Egan's /Diaspora/ describes explicitly the birth of a posthuman em.) And also ideally, the MC would eventually explore+exploit this magic system. (E.g. "what you'd assume would happen after the end of the movie /The Thirteenth Floor/, if the protagonist of that film were rational.")
