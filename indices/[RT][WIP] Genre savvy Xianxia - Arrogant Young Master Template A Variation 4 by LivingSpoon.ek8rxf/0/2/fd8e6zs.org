The MC certainly skips a few beats, but I think the author has maintained the integrity of his setting's rules in the misunderstandings he allows the MC to develop despite the MC's genre savvyness, as they are owed to issues stemming from the MC's lacking perspective as a transmigrator as opposed to the self-awareness of a reality-nativity (and this is largely addressed in the story, as compared to some authors half-assing it and leaving this up to the readers' inferences and interpretations).
