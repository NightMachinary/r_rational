Good reasonably self consistent worldbuilding, characters generally think and plan and have complex motivations, the main character thinks things through in a semi rational way, the reasons behind things are explored, for example the nationalism, there's definitely a lot of it but it's discussed and treated less of a good thing and more of an unfortunate consequence of how the universe exists. Actually I quite like the discussion of nationalism through the dark forest metaphor and why villains happen without resorting to some people just being inherently bad. perhaps not rational but far more so than most works featured on this sub. There's also the "munchkining", there's no separation between science and the spiritual aspects of cultivation, for example going from refinement to building stage used to require taking an incredibly difficult to come by pill and the success rate was below 5% and mostly based on luck but in the modern day the process has been studied extensively with statistics, tests and specialized facilities instead of caves. A series of artworks and music are played to help the prospective building cultivator get into the optimal state of mind as again determent by centuries of research.
