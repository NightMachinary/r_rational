This story has really great trope navigation. The reasoning of the MC and side character is often explained (unusual bordering on impossible for a Xianxia). The MC carefully uses his resources and does not allow for loose ends or escalations of conflicts.

The MC has a lot of resources at his disposal and is liberal in using them to avoid any trope/templates that he might run into, even taking matters into his own hands when he can't risk other not understanding a situation as gravely as he would in light of a trope/template.

[[/spoiler][At some point, he drags away his minions to educate them in the ways of anamolies (Main Characters).]]
