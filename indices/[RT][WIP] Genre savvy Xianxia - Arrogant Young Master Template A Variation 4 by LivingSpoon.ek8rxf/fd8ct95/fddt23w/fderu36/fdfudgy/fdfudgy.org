Without judging whether something is ratfic or not:

For characters actively creating new worlds like that (but only in the backstory), the Myst computer games is the one example that comes to mind. The differences in philosophical stances is also amusing to me. "No, no. Always remember, we're not creating worlds, we're just /linking/ to them." "Oh, come on! With a few words we can make massive changes to those worlds that astound the inhabitants, plus mine always collapse shortly after I write the book rather than before! We obviously have creative control here!".

For one of my more fondly-remembered moments, 'Kumo desu ga, nanika?' ("So I'm a spider, so what?"). "Ahhh! I spent so much time trying to survive within the system... I never thought to ask /why there's a system in the first place!/ <horrifying secrets of the world and its history learned all at once>" I don't remember which chapter it was in, but there's a moment of it in the anime PV at [[https://youtube.com/watch?v=lwk3Q8QpRWg][youtube.com/watch?v=lwk3Q8QpRWg]] .

More generally, in the fast-transmigration genre there are quite a lot of stories in which many 'worlds' exist, each unknowing about other worlds, and the 'host' to a system travels between them, spending a short time or a full lifetime in each one, each world having several chapters of the overall story. The host uses the knowledge or power of the host and/or system to enact major changes to each story to accomplish the desired objective, depending on the type of system. The different types of systems and objectives and how they react or refer to each other can be fun.

Continuing the last paragraph, in 'Sinister Ex-Girlfriend' the protagonist tries to destroy worlds (planes) by ripping apart the male lead female lead couple through tests of their true feelings while the antagonist side tries to save them; in a lot or most stories the host's role is to fix the future regrets of the person whose body they took; there's a certain nice story which at first glance looks like certain other stories ("Make the one who wronged the original body fall in love with you, then die for them so that they feel greatest regret for having wronged you!") which has a neat subversion ("Oh, hey, it turns out that the person who created the systems is harvesting energy from the negative feelings of the original bodies as they watch themselves do loving things with the ones they most hate and then kill themselves. When I destroy the wronging-one's life directly to make them feel regret, I complete the terms of the mission /and/ the original body gets to be back in control of their body and live happily with their family afterwards.") Only, almost every (though not quite every) fast-transmigration story I've read so far seems to get quickly derailed by a same-partner-in-each-world romance storyline which takes most of the effort and interestingness out of the worlds themselves.
