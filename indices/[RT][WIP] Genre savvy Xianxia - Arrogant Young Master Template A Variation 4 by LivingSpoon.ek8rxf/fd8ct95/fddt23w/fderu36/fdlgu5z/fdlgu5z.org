There's two stories I know of that /sort of/ does this, but it's not a focus of either one:

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/factory-isolation-si-multicross.30535/][Factory Isolation]] - It's a Self-Insert fanfiction where the protagonist is on a desolate alien world with a device based on the game [[https://factorio.com/][Factorio]]. After figuring out his long-term survival plan, he decides to build a colony and rule over them as an emperor. His ability to travel to other worlds include fictional worlds, but I don't think he ever exploited that ability to the fullest.

[[https://www.amazon.com/Sunset-Book-Nightlord-Garon-Whited-ebook/dp/B00NMMPRU6][The Nightlord Series]] - A series is about a vampire, wizard, king that I'm following avidly. Eric, the protagonist, is a specialist in gate-magic and it's barely mentioned in the earlier books, but in the last two books, he begins to exploit the searching function of the spell and the time-independent aspect of the spell to find exactly (or almost) what he needs. There were two interesting usages that I remember.

Need an incredibly rare metal? No problem, once I find a world with it, I can create multiple timelines of that world and re-retrieve the metal as many time as needed. Need to go back in time? No problem, I'll connect the 'end' of the gate to it's 'beginning' and travel back to when it was first built. Use only in case of apocalyptic god. I expect the next book to involve even more gate shenanigans
