I know it's what you asked, but "it gets better" or "it gets worse" seem like really unhelpful answers to me because Luminosity has some pretty distinct stylistic choices, and people who dislike them will say "it gets worse" when they read more, while people who like them will say "it gets better".

Despite the fact that it's been out for ages, I only read Luminosity recently (having watched the first Twilight movie for comparison's sake). Maybe it was discussed to death in the past, but nowadays the most it gets is an offhand mention in a recommendation thread or reading list every now and then.

For me, Luminosity (intentionally or not) averts or deconstructs many rational fiction tropes. Despite what appears to be a slow start and some meandering sections in the middle - this never really becomes an action-driven story - I think it's got some pretty strong economy of narrative, with all of Meyer's characters and worldbuilding having important roles to play in the themes Alicorn presents. It's about the conflict between wanting to do what's right for the world and what's right for yourself and the people you love; it's about the conflict between Bella's introspection and the strongly interpersonal interactions she has to navigate throughout the story. Twilight is generally pretty bad, but it's one of those stories that's frustrating because it feels like it's just a few tweaks away from being a really good and interesting one - and for me, that's Luminosity.

Luminosity doesn't really show its hand until very near the end, I think. So, basically, if there's things about the story that are bothering you at 5% of the way in, they're unlikely to have gone by 95%. Unless you really, really like Luminosity, I wouldn't recommend continuing through into Radiance.
