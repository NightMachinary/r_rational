  My definition of contentiousness of consciousness includes having your memories and thought processes unaltered. So this doesn't really meet those qualifications. Your memories and thought processes are being altered every moment by your experiences and environment. The person you are right now is not identical to the person you were 20 seconds ago. They share most of their identity but not all of it.

I don't get what you mean about proving a copy is the same as the original. Identity is a human social construct not something present in nature. The copy shares almost all of its charachteristics with the original. The only actual differences would be the location where the copy is, the matter it is composed of, and how it was made.

The location doesn't matter for identity purposes. You are still you if you are teleported.

The matter it is composed of doesn't matter. You are still you if your cells die and are replaced by new ones.

The origin doesn't matter because it is easy to imagine scenarios where the Me I am right now would consider the copy more Me than the original even if the original diverged because of natural processes e.g if the original body got brain damaged, addicted to drugs, brainwashed by a cult etc whereas the copy didn't.
