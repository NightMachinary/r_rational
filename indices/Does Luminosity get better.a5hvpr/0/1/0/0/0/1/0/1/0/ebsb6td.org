  If I gradually altered your brain one neuron at a time until your brain had the memories and personality of adolf hitler then the person afterwards would not be you regardless of whether or not your brain stayed conscious throughout.

I think you're altering the perameters of the problem with this statement. In the hypothetical situation described above, your personality would be completely intact and unchained from how it was when you were in your original body. Everything would function exactly the same and you would have the same memories. The only difference would be that your thought process is run by a computer instead of your brain.

  if there was a system that somehow destroyed my brain and then healed it to exactly the same state as before then the person afterwards would be me in all important respects nevermind the temporary loss of consciousness.

I have a thought experiment for you as well. If someone didn't destroy your brain, but instead "froze time" then made a complete copy of your body and brain would you consider the copy to be the exact same person as you?

If you were put in separate but identical rooms and told by an identical recording that "Only one of you may leave alive" would you think there was no consequences to you being the person who died, since technically having a clone of yourself means that in all important respects you'd still be alive?

Edit: for the sake of clarity, let's say the recording that you review states that pressing the button will kill you, but not your perfect copy. In your case the recording is telling the truth, but in the clone's case this is a lie as it will not be killed regardless. Neither of you are aware of that. There is a mechanism that you can activate which will carry out the destruction of yourself painlessly. But if you never press the button to kill yourself, you and your clone will be fed and allowed to live in the boring room for the rest of your lives.

Also let's assume that your experiences within the two seperate rooms are 100% identical. Meaning since you're the same person with the same memories/body and you're in the the exact same situation, you'll make the exact same movements and come to the exact same conclusions. (if you push the kill button, then the other version of you is pushing the kill button at the exact same time. If you trip over your feet and fall, so is the other version of yourself). For the sake of this experiment ignore the fact that it's likely physically impossible to create a situation 100% identical.

Edit2: Also the video states that if you and your clone both press the button at the same time, one of you will be chosen at random. So you don't have to worry about the possibility of both you and your clone dying.
