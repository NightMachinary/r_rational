If I can choose a upload means for myself, it would be the one-neuron-at-a-time approach. I actually envision at least a two-step process, where the first round of replacements are artificial neurons which can interoperate with biological ones, but also have high-speed electronic signalling protocols too. These artificial neurons would be the same size as biological ones, and by default would not operate any faster.

Then, when the first round is complete, you'd then convert over to electronic signaling.

At that point (assuming things are stable), the first round neurons could be replaced with an only-electronic version which would then be much more compact.

After the second round of replacements is done, it would be much easier to run at a higher signalling speed.
