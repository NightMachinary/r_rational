I felt as you did, but eventually gave in in a moment of not being able to find something I really wanted to read instead and I ended up really liking Friendship is Optimal. Liking or knowing anything about My Little Pony is not at all necessary.

For the record, what I know of MLP comes entirely from watching it some with my daughter and wanting to be conversant with her about something she was really into at the time. Unfortunately, it turns out that MLP is actually on the intellectual end of the spectrum as far as shows with 6yo girls in their target demographic go---I wish she was still into it, because then I wouldn't have to make it through another episode of Glitter Force.
