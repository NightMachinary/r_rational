You're right, it's not a perfect analogy. But the analogy isn't so much important as the concept of your thought process being on standby vs. actually completely stopping.

That's all I'm saying. I think there is a difference between brain death and something like going to sleep.

Also to comment on what you said earlier: "that thing is what you copy, not just the thoughts and memories".

I think this statement is actually incorrect. Because if someone created a perfect clone of me without harming my original body in any way, I wouldn't expect to be both experiencing my own life and that of the clone at the same time.

I wouldn't have access to the experiences that the clone would have access to if we did different things. (For example, If the clone went to the store and I stayed home, I wouldn't expect to have memories of the clone buying milk). For all intents and purposes we would be considered two separate entities.

I don't see why that would change if my original body ceased to exist during the copying process.
