I don't think these brief interruptions are the same thing as say brain death.

I think of it in the same way as a multi-threaded computer program.

The program may be constantly putting processes on standby, stopping them and waiting for interrupts, but that doesn't mean the processes have been killed. Everything is still running until the program is closed or crashed.
