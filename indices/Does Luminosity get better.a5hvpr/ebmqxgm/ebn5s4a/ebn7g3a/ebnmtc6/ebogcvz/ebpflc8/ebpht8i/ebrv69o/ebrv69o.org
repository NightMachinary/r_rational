If I gradually altered your brain one neuron at a time until your brain had the memories and personality of adolf hitler then the person afterwards would not be you regardless of whether or not your brain stayed conscious throughout.

Thought experiment: You and some random person are both in different booths and are having your minds gradually swapped in the process described above. At the beginning of the process you get to choose whether at the end the person in the booth you are standing in gets an additional 10 million dollars or the person in the other booth.

Identity consists of your (socially) important characteristics. e.g in rhw case of people it is your ideas memories, values, ideals, behaviour and so on. It is also a spectrum based on degree of similarity rather than a binary. I share more of my identity with the person I was yesterday than the person I was six years ago but not all of it because every conscious moment parts of my identity change.

If there was a system that somehow destroyed my brain and then healed it to exactly the same state as before then the person afterwards would be me in all important respects nevermind the temporary loss of consciousness.
