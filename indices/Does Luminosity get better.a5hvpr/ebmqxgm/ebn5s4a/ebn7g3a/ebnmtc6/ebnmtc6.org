Yes, Friendship is Optimal is kind of horrifying to me in multiple ways. (As intended by the author, I think).

Those of us who upload (or whatever it exactly ends up being) will be faced with many temptations to alter one's own mind after it becomes easy and convenient to do so.

I could easily see myself starting down that path, and ending up totally different in a short amount of time. If at all possible, I'll likely make at least one copy of myself, one of which is allowed to optimize, and another which will try to stay as human and unaltered as possible for as long as possible.

I still expect values drift and significant disagreements with myself, but I hope my optimized version will retain at least a little nostalgia and sympathy for my human version.

BTW, [[/u/GlueBoy]], I'm totally not a fan of ponies. Not even slightly.
