I agree, but I would recommend OP keep reading a bit more. It's hard to say if reading 5% of the story is enough to know for sure if it's your thing or not. It's possible that OP hasn't reached a part that's actually demonstrative of the story yet.

I really enjoyed Luminosity + Radiance, but I don't really recall the beats or the details of my experience of reading it. I do remember feeling really weirded out about reading a twilight fanfiction, even more so than an HP ff, but I managed to get through it and was glad I did.

I drew the line at ponies though. Could not muster up enough will to do /that/.
