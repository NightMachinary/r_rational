I'm assuming you're talking about [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal][Friendship is Optimal.]] I felt the same way as you at first, but honestly, it's one of my favorite stories now. If anything the questions posed by it are more interesting for someone who doesn't like MLP than someone who does.
