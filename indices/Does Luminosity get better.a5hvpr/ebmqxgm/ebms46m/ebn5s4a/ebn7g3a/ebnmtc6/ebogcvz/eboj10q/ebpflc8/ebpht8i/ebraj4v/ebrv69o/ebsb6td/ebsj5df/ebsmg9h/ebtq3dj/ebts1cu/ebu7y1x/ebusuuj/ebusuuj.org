I think I do understand where you're coming from. You're saying basically that each and every change in experience is more or less the death of the person you previously were.

But I would argue that from experience, it never feels like the you from a second ago is different from the you of right now. It feels like a continuous thing, even if it is constantly changing. And I don't think death is necessarily defined as "the end of a person as they previously were", but more as "The end of a person's ability to continuously change".

  Both the mind in the original body and the mind in the clone are different people after the duplication but they are both equally descended from the mind in the original before the duplication.

I admit I have no idea what would occur in this situation. I imagine realistically any process that attempted to do this would result in brain death. But if you could hypothetically do this without meaningfully ceasing brain function... then I'm not sure what the result would be (from a personal experience standpoint).

I guess the main difference in our thought processes is that you believe the temporary lapses in conciousness and changes overtime are more or less the same thing as a death of an individual perspective.

Whereas I believe that the perspective persists throughout all those changes, only ceasing to exist when the person's thought processes have fully stopped. Things like going to sleep are more like how a computer pauses a process, or runs it in the background, while other processes take priority. The process is never completely gone, just on standby. You could copy that process and run it on another system, sure. But it wouldn't be that same process, even if it behaved the exact same way.

I'm not sure how either of us could actually convince the other of the opposite point of view.

I think from a practical point of view... it probably will never matter in our lifetimes who is right and who is wrong. I enjoyed having this conversation, but I don't think I have anything more useful to add.
