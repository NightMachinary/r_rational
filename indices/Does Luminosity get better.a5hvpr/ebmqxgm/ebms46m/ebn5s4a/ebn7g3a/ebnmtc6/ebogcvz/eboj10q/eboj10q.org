So in The *Quantum Thief* the idea of a Marovic upload is presented: One neuron at a time neurons are replaced with a non-bolocial processor, until the product is software running on a standardized processor that due to the ubiquity of the processing substrate (I'massumina lot of out of band processing for analysis and modelling here that is implied but not explicitly stated). The idea being to make a .flakk or vector art ("loss-less" analog representations of sound or shape respectively, as equations stored in digital media) of from as high a resolution of a scan.

If it's all just physics , and we understand all of the physics involved, the question is not if uploading is like dying, but how many nights sleep uploading is different from the you that uploaded<chose to be a software instead of a meat robot>, and if the divergence is significant along "choices" you might makes ( recently posted a thread on Watt's Sunflower series, lets not get into the physics Tarpit *Hotshot* makes cross-pollinating free-will and the analytic ability of the subconscious).
