It's a little different, depending on the method of uploading used.

I would say that we aren't necessarily our bodies, but our stream of consciousness which (we're pretty sure) is a result of the neurons firing off in certain patterns in our brains. It doesn't matter that cells in our body are dying and being replaced daily so long as that stream of consciousness stays consistent. Yes that stream of consciousness gets interrupted with things like sleep, but this isn't a permanent interruption like death.

Now if an upload method basically just analyzes our brain and the patterns of neurons firing in them, then destroys the brain after it's done analyzing it, I would argue that's more or less the same thing as just killing a person and cloning them.

Because your stream of consciousness is copied and then terminated. It would be basically the same thing as copying and pasting a file, then deleting the original.

If the method was similar to what [[/u/Empiricist_or_not]] described, then the question becomes more interesting. Because in that case you're not necessarily destroying the original stream of consciousness, but instead replacing the hardware that the consciousness runs on bit by bit while there's no neuro-activity in the places that are being destroyed/replaced.

There is never a point where there's both you and a copy of you simultaneously existing and there's never a point where you completely cease to exist either.
