I'll try to be as obvious as I can since I don't think you have fully understood my position. Each perspective / moment of consciousness your body has is destroyed in moments. Your body is repeatedly destroyed and replaced by a slightly different copy through a process called time. Mental continuity is an illusion. You can't perceive the past or future only the present, you can't know that e.g Last Thursdayism is incorrect.

Both the mind in the original body and the mind in the clone are different people after the duplication but they are both equally descended from the mind in the original before the duplication.

Consider the scenario where half of your brain and body is cut into two groups. Each half then has the other half copied onto them so there are two people. Which would you be?

If qualia exists in a meaningful sense then it would be something experienced / observed by every computational process though obviously non-human processes would not experience qualia in the same way we do.
