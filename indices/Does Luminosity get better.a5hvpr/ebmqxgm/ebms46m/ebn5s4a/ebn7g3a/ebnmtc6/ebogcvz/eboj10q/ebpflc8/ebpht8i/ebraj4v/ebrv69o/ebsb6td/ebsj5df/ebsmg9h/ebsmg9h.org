  The argument was that if continuity of consciousness is what determines identity then you can be Adolf Hitler. You being Adolf Hitler is absurd so continutity of consciousness can't be what determines identity.

My definition of contentiousness of consciousness includes having your memories and thought processes unaltered. So this doesn't really meet those qualifications.

  Consider an alternate scenario. i'm living my life when I get a magic button. I know that pressing it will annihilate my body. It will then spawn a copy of me that shares my values but is significantly smarter, healthier and wiser. I don't have to press it but I would anyway.

That's interesting. At least you're consistant in your beliefs.

I guess I just don't agree with the idea that a copy is the same as the original, since there doesn't seem to be any concrete way to prove that it's actually you. I suppose it's equally impossible to prove that a copy isn't the same thing as you before the two versions diverge. But I always like erring on the side of caution.
