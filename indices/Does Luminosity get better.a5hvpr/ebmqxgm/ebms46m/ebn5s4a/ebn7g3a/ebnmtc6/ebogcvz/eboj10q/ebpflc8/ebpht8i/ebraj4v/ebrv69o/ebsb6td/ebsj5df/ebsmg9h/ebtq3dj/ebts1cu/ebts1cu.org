I'm not sure exactly how to explain it. But at least from a purely empirical point of view, it feels like I am the presence or perspective (Or whatever you want to call it) that is experiencing my consciousness.

It feels as if my thoughts aren't just some bit of information that exists in the universe, but instead is something intensely personal that only I can experience.

If you create a perfect clone of me and didn't kill either of us, I wouldn't expect that to change. My perspective would still be only of this original mind and body. I wouldn't expect to be both experiencing my own thoughts and the thoughts of my perfect clone (which would quickly diverge and differentiate themselves from my own thoughts due to differences in experiences).

In that sense, I believe that we are separate consciousnesses/perspectives. Because we can diverge and experience different things.

Whereas any changes that happen to me alone, even something huge (like my right brain being disconnected from my left brain due to some accident) would still be viewed from this same perspective. I would still be the person experiencing that wildly altered consciousness.

I have no way to prove that my observed feelings on this are accurate. Perhaps we are just only information, instead of observers of that information. In which case, you're 100% correct.

But I would fear that creating a clone of myself and then dying would be killing the perspective through which I've viewed myself throughout my life. And perhaps you've studied things that I'm unaware of, or maybe my theory is based in more mysticism than I'd like to admit, but I've never seen any evidence which proves or disproves this idea. And until I do see evidence that's contrary to what I observe and feel, I won't take any risks that might unnecessarily end my perspective/POV/Consciousness/whatever would be a good way to describe the poorly explained concept I'm trying to get across.
