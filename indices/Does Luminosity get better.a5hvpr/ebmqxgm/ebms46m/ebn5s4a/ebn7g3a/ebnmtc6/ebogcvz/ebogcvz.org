I'm still not 100% convinced that uploading isn't the equivalent of dying and then a clone of yourself living in your place.

It's basically the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletransportation_paradox][Teleportation Pardaox]] but strictly for brains.

But I think if I could get past that dilemma, I'd probably be okay with the world overall. I mean I'd be bummed out that I'd have to be pony at first. And I would hope that I wouldn't need to significantly modify myself to achieve the happiness that I'd be guided to. But overall it's better deal than oblivion... I'm assuming.
