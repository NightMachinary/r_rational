Of course I changed the parameters. What would be the point of parroting your words back at you?

The argument was that if continuity of consciousness is what determines identity then you can be Adolf Hitler. You being Adolf Hitler is absurd so continutity of consciousness can't be what determines identity.

In your time frozen copies example both copies would be equally me at the moment of duplication. After that each would begin to diverge from the person I was before the split at different rates depending on their experiences.

I press the button. I would press the button if I knew it killed the copy. I would also press the button if I knew it killed the original. Both the original and the clone value each other the same because we are identical in all important respects.Each cares about the other for the same reason I would care more about a person that shared my values than a person that opposed them. There isn't any particular reason to prefer a particular version other than maybe some kind of irrational selfishness. Whatever version gets out is likely to achieve at least twice as much personal utility as both of me could achieve in the box.

Consider an alternate scenario. i'm living my life when I get a magic button. I know that pressing it will annhilate my body. It will then spawn a copy of me that shares my values but is significantly smarter, healthier and wiser. I don't have to press it but I would anyway.
