This.

I'm not suggesting you quit. There's a section about two-thirds of the way in that is deeply satisfying (for me), but the rest was either a slog or I enjoyed character development.

I also re-read the Twilight series basically simultaneously so that may have helped me have a higher opinion of Luminosity.
