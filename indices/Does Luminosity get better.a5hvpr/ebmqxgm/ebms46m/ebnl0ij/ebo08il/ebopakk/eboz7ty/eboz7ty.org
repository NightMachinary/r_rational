Yes.

(Sorry, that was irresistible. The Twilight series by Stephanie Meyer was downright painful for me to read. I devoured it. But I would call the books terrible. I do prefer to not bash on Twilight tho, because something about it clearly worked for me. Luminosity gets more leeway because it's not published by a publishing house, so I can't expect editing for things like pacing. And the MC is no longer painfully whiny. So I like Luminosity better. )

Edit: I realized my response was ambiguous again and added to it.
