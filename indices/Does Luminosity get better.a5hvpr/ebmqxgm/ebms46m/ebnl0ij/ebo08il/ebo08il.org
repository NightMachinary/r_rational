Re-read twilight, you mean?

I'd hoped that I was needlessly harsh in my initial opinion. Alas, I was right.

Also I was hoping to deconstruct what made me actually buy the whole series and devour it, given my really harsh opinion. I've read better books that I've cared less about. This series went viral.

Edit: tweaked phrasing.
