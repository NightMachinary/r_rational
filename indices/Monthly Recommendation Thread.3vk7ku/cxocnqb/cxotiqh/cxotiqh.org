If you enjoy The Three Musketeers, I recommend checking out Steven Brust's The Phoenix Guard (and sequels). The style of these books is very unique and I don't recommend buying them all before you've at least started the first - it's very much a divisive style of writing, and you may be best served by getting The Phoenix Guards from a library or something. Some people hate the style, I personally love it.

Nonetheless, Brust's five book series starting with The Phoenix Guards, continued in Five Hundred Years After, and then finished in the Viscount of Adrilankha Trilogy, is a wonderful homage to Dumas' work, within a neatly detailed fantasy universe. It's sort of "The Three Musketeers as Elves in a Fantasy World", but that doesn't really do the books justice.
