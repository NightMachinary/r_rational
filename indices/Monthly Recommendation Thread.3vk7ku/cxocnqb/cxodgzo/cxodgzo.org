  Atlas Shrugged (original fiction; not free[13] ): Unproductive people line their own pockets with the work of productive people. When the productive people start to disappear mysteriously, the country slowly crumbles into a tear-jerking apocalypse... (Even if you don't agree with the author's views [I don't], you can always just assume that it's set in an alternate universe where they're correct.)

Isn't that... kinda... godawful? Like, ideology /aside/, which is /already/ a pretty big aside, I'd always heard Ayn Rand has a tendency to do things like /stop in the middle of the plot for an Author Tract-y ideological speech/.

  Quite tear-jerking--I've read it only twice.

Wait, hold on, I thought you were a sociopath.
