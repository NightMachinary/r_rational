  Being clever is doing the unexpected even against an opponent who tries to expect everything, and adapting quickly when an opponent does the same.

Xanatos Gambits are /not realistic./ That's exactly what I'm talking about when I say Death Note is unbelievable. Xanatos Gambits account for precisely the contingencies the author selects as a combinatorially simple set and no more. Depending on improbable character behavior that /just happens to occur/ is /stupid,/ not intelligent. Death Note plans are clairvoyant. Liar Game plans are not.

  The characters are seemingly able to keep track of an unlimited amount of numbers and payoff charts in their heads

Are they? I don't remember that being the case.

  Yet they don't explore more than one or two possibilities, usually go for the first viable idea they can come up with without probing it for flaws, take ages to figure out a simple deception, and throw good money after bad until they're broke.

You mean realistic human behavior? There are only a few smart players in Liar Game to begin with; and the winnowing process that would funnel smart and manipulative people to later levels of the game /does happen./ The asshole kid and the old cult leader show up later, not sooner, and the revival rounds weaken the selection pressure to begin with.

But even without any of that, beyond the simple game theory itself, actually figuring things out is /hard./ There's crowd psychology, alliances, betrayals, and private signaling. Finding out that there's something you're missing is costly. Finding out what the hell it /is/ is hard. /That/ is realistic.

You're trying to have it both ways, but they're either too smart or too stupid. Which is it?

At this point I would reread Death Note and Liar Game, but <too busy>.
