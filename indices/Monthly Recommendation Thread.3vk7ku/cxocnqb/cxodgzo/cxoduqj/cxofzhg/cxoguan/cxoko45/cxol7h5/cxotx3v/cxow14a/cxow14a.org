Just putting this here for anyone who might want to read [[http://www.shigabooks.com/?page=001][Demon]]:

- It's pretty gory for a cartoon-like art style and the fact that everything is in a cartoon style is the only thing saving the comic from being too disgusting to read. Instead of being creeped out, I just go okay, it's supposed to be a gross scene here.

- I don't actually care about Jason himself, because he's so incredibly sociopathic and the author prefers to draw about what Jason is doing to make use of his abilities rather than spend anytime on his developing psychology to make it either more interesting to read about Jason himself or to develop reader sympathy for him. As a result, I couldn't care less if Jason dies and if the story switched to another character. The comic's only saved by the fact that the real-life puzzles Jason solves are so interesting to guess at and read about, which all requires Jason to be a mass-murdering sociopath.

The above points aren't meant to be a list of good or bad points, but rather the way this webcomic is so uniquely different from anything else I've read before.

Also, as a warning, don't try to look up any information about the webcomic. It's because the story involves slow revealing fundamental rules behind the world as part of it's puzzling theme and knowing anything will ruin the experience if you want to try to figure out things. The summary on TV Tropes doesn't reveal too much, but it ruins the the very first puzzle in the story which is the hardest and most interesting puzzle IMHO.
