Liar Game's (and Fleep's) "intelligent" characters cross a line. They no longer feel like geniuses, but instead like mouthpieces of a reasonably smart author who has no time limit and full access to pen and paper and to the internet. I wouldn't be awed by them in real life because they wouldn't /exist/ in real life. For all that Light Yagami may be dumber, as a character he does a better job of displaying intelligence.

(I'm glad that the field of rationalfics is growing, as it often offers the best of both worlds.)
