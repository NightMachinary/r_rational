First of all, I love grimdark fiction. Second, I like realism. (The same factors which contributed to my love for Worm). Other than District 9 and Roadside Picnic, I can't think of a single book or movie that has portrayed what I think would happen 'if aliens visited Earth'.

The universe is vast and we are but a speck and all that. Most mainstream fiction with aliens shows humans winning or in a position of prominent power, which just doesn't sound all that realistic to me.
