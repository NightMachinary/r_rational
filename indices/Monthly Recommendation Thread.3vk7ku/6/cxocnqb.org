Some books:

- /Time Braid/ ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][fanfiction of /Naruto/; free]]): Sakura is trapped in a time loop, and gradually becomes more powerful to defeat an enemy who's trapped in a similar loop. Definitely my favorite book of all time--I've read it on six separate occasions since discovering it shortly before its completion in 2011. Previously discussed [[http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/28n846/rt_naruto_time_braid_groundhog_day_fanfiction/][here]].

- /Background Pony/ ([[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/19198][fanfiction of /Friendship Is Magic/; free]]): Lyra Heartstrings has been cursed by Nightmare Moon to be forgotten, within minutes or hours, by all who see her. She searches for a way to break the curse, while starving for companionship. Quite tear-jerking--I've read it only twice.

- /The Three Musketeers/ ([[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1257][original fiction; free]]): A young Frenchman from the countryside goes to Paris to become a Musketeer in the service of King Louis XIII. Wonderful swashbuckling action (and humor!)--I've read it four times. (There are several sequels, but Project Gutenberg's free translations of them [[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1259][1]] [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2609][2]] [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2681][3]] [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2710][4]] [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2759][5]]] aren't the best, unfortunately, and they aren't quite as interesting as the first book in any event--I've read the first sequel twice, and the others only once.)

- /Sailor Nothing/ ([[http://stefangagne.com/sailornothing][original fiction; free]]): A maybe-rational [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl][magical-girl]] story. Previously discussed [[http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/37k3vf/dcrt_sailor_nothing_same_author_as_floating_point/][here]].

- /Atlas Shrugged/ ([[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/662][original fiction; not free]]): Unproductive people line their own pockets with the work of productive people. When the productive people start to disappear mysteriously, the country slowly crumbles into a tear-jerking apocalypse... (Even if you don't agree with the author's views [I don't], you can always just assume that it's set in an alternate universe where they're correct.)

Some television series:

- /Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals/ ([[http://www.hulu.com/naruto-spin-off-rock-lee-and-his-ninja-pals][anime; free]]): This is a ludicrously-comedic spin-off of /Naruto: Shippuuden/, based on a manga not written/drawn by Kishimoto. Rock Lee is the protagonist, Tenten is the "straight man", and Neji is generally the butt of jokes. It's probably the funniest show I've ever watched--beyond even /The Three Stooges/ and /Laurel and Hardy/. I haven't yet bothered to re-watch it, though.

- /Mobile Fighter G Gundam/ ([[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam][anime; not free]]): Domon Kasshu is the young martial artist chosen to represent the space colony of Neo-Japan in the annual Gundam Fight tournament that decides which space colony will rule Earth for the next year. He also has a secret mission--to find the experimental Devil Gundam that has fallen to Earth, before it awakens... See also /Gundam Build Fighters/ ([[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJV1h9xQ7Hx-0WipavLDd3mFSLJL1r2XQ][free for now, but maybe not in the future]]--/G Gundam/ used to be on this official Gundam channel, but was removed), which is a more recent show that runs along similar lines. /[[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJV1h9xQ7Hx9RWqvcTplORDorYTHsWnEp][Build Fighters Try]]/ isn't as good, unfortunately.
