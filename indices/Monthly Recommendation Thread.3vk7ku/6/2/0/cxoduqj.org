  Isn't that... kinda... godawful?

As far as I can recall, there's only one speech--and it's near the end of the book and easily-skippable.

  Wait, hold on, I thought you were a sociopath.

But it's so horribly, disgustingly /wasteful!/ How /absolutely ridiculous/ is it for tons upon tons of Minnesota grain to rot, causing widespread famine and riots, because corrupt politicians want to use the grain cars to transport fruit from California? It's as if these people are rage-quitting a game of /+Europa Universalis 4+/ /Victoria 2/ by destroying the country intentionally! Who would be dumb enough to do that on purpose?! Watching idiots destroy the USA in /Atlas Shrugged/ was as nausea-inducing and heart-rending as seeing =dice= used as a singular pronoun in /The Waves Arisen/.

In any event, please remember that, though [[http://i.imgur.com/VCZSnwZ.png][I've /been called/ sociopathic by several people]] ([[http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3o3wv0/d_friday_offtopic_thread/cvuh4tk?context=9][including you]]), I certainly haven't been /officially diagnosed/--and have never, I think, represented myself in that light.
