Oh, you were referring to /Background Pony/, not to /Atlas Shrugged/. Well, sure, I'll admit that--I find it much easier to put myself in the shoes of James Taggart or of Yagami Light than to commiserate with "Friend" Six.

But what reasons for disliking Lyra or Dagny could I even have? I could scold Lyra for wasting time in helping random townsfolk when she should be researching her curse, /maybe/--but that's a very mild aspersion. (It's pretty rare that I dislike a protagonist enough to stop reading a story. I think that's happened /once,/ but I can't remember which story caused it.) How can I resent a fictional character's being outside my control when it's existing only in my imagination?
