I never read/saw (is it a show, movie, book, what is it?) Liar's Game, but I never found Light to be dumb. Yes, he threw away advantages sometimes, but he didn't really need them. Whenever he did something stupid (outside of a fit of rage), he calculated the risk and, IMO, he was right that he didn't need the advantages.
