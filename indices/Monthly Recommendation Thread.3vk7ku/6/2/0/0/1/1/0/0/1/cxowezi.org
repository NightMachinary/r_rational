  If by mouthpieces you mean that they talk a lot, yeah, they kind of have to so the reader will understand what's going on. Death Note was the same way. Otherwise I'm not sure what you're talking about.

Not that. It's difficult to express. Second try, apologies for the rambling:

The characters are seemingly able to keep track of an unlimited amount of numbers and payoff charts in their heads, and can instantly jump to the conclusion of a multi-step argument that I have to read twice (and slowly). Yet they don't explore more than one or two possibilities, usually go for the first viable idea they can come up with without probing it for flaws, take ages to figure out a simple deception, and throw good money after bad until they're broke. They will outsmart and out-outsmart and out-out-outsmart each other like racers on a track, with plans remaining perfectly predictable from the start even after so many levels of meta.

This is what it looks like (I feel) when an author comes up with a problem, works at it a bit with pen and paper, comes up with a solution, and then makes their characters act out the steps of that solution (and the dead ends along the way) in nice dramatic chunks.

(This is a generalization. There are counter-examples.)

In contrast, in e.g. HPMOR (or IIRC in Death Note, but it's been a while), characters think /wide/ much more than /deep/. Being clever is doing the unexpected even against an opponent who tries to expect everything, and adapting quickly when an opponent does the same. Which can happen simultaneously, since everyone's racing on different tracks.

So yes, the characters of Liar Game are smart, because they can come up with and keep track of very complicated plans that work. But they're not smart the way real-life smart people are smart.

  Demon is a worthwhile read.
#+end_quote

I have read Demon and quite like some of the bits (the Fleep-like parts with the scientific method, and the Meanwhile-like parts where the plot throws massive surprises and all the characters just roll with it). But it also has bits I dislike (some of the plot, most of the action scenes) and bits I /strongly/ dislike (yes, most of the "semen shiv" category), so I can't find it in my heart to recommend it.
