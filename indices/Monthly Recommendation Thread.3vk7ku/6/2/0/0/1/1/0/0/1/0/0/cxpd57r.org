  Xanatos Gambits are not realistic.

Not familiar with the term, but looking at the TVTropes page, doesn't it describe Liar Game plans? I think that's what I was complaining about in "/They will outsmart and out-outsmart and out-out-outsmart each other like racers on a track, with plans remaining perfectly predictable from the start even after so many levels of meta./"

  You're trying to have it both ways, but they're either too smart or too stupid.

That's precisely the point I'm trying to make. They're very smart in a specific and unrealistic way.

  At this point I would reread Death Note and Liar Game, but <too busy>.

Yeah, same here. I was going to go through Liar Game and pull out citations, but then remembered it's 200 chapters :-/ I'll stop there I think. Sorry I couldn't express myself better.
