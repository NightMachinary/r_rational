I feel the exact opposite. Death Note's gambits /would not work/ in real life. I find Liar Game much more plausible. If by mouthpieces you mean that they talk a lot, yeah, they kind of have to so the reader will understand what's going on. Death Note was the same way. Otherwise I'm not sure what you're talking about.

Fleep /is/ just some math problems in graphic novel format, but Demon is much less reliant on numerical trivia. I think. I don't remember exactly how he decided on the semen shiv. But I hope that just the words "semen shiv" will convince you that Demon is a worthwhile read.
