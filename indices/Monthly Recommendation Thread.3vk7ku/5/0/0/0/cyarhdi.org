Thanks a lot for mentioning A Political Perspective, I just had a great binge! I agree that the evil council with real power is usually overdone and done badly, but I think the story hits the nail right on the head. It makes presents a compelling reason to have one in the forst place and the consequences of the premise all make sense. As an added bonus, the characterization is practically a work of art.
