Well, a demonstration is that there are many "self-promoting" posts with plenty of upvotes. This means that people are happy that the posts exist, if not directly proving them to be "worth recommending". Generally, I think you have to do some amount of self-promotion when you start writing, or you won't have any audience at all (and thus nobody to do the recommending for you).
