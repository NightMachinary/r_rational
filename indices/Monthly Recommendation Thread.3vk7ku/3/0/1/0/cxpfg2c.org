It'd basically be spam. A recommendation thread essentially sorts for the best of the best, stuff that is good enough that people have heard of it and want you to have heard of it. This gives you information on how good they are.

Self-recs sort for whatever writers happen to be online at the minute and want more readers. The only information you get from that is 'this story exists', which is less useful. As reader I'd much prefer to get only the former type of information. As a writer, I can just post stuff in the rest of the subreddit like normal.
