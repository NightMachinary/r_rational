[[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]] is a web serial about a mage trapped in a time loop. The main character isn't a complete optimizer, but he's pretty solid, and it's a hard fantasy with coherent rules.

Brandon Sanderson writes some excellent hard fantasy as well. If you're not familiar with his work, I recommend [[http://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Kindle-Single-Brandon-Sanderson-ebook/dp/B00UZSTXL4/][Perfect State]] or [[http://www.amazon.com/Emperors-Soul-Hugo-Award-Winner/dp/1616960922/][The Emperor's Soul]] as good short-length introductions to his work.

Rokka no Yuusha is an excellent hard fantasy anime/light novel series. Each arc is basically a self-contained, solvable mystery.

Log Horizon is a solid "trapped in a MMO" style of anime/light novel series with a decent optimizer protagonist. Season 1 is much stronger than Season 2, imo, and he misses some clear game breakers, but I still consider it the pinnacle of the genre.

What are the rules on self-promotion in this thread? I'm asking for...science. ^{_^}
