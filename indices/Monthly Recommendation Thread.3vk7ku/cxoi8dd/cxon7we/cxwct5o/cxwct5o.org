It's part of the reason that I'm more hopeful about the planned /The Lies We Tell/ sequel, which is shaping up to be more of a Cold War between Malkuth and Jaune. Following the proxies and side characters to get a more human perspective on what's going on in the setting will probably help curtail the rampiness of a story that includes the Gamer power.
