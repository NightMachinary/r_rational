I recommend The Games We Play by Ryuugi.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/rwby-the-gamer-the-games-we-play-disk-five.341621/]]

It's a crossover between RWBY and The Gamer, but goes very far in its own direction.

I don't want to spoil anything, but its very action-filled, the main character is very rational, the worldbuilding is original but simultaneously derivative of basically all of mythology (which is basically my favorite thing ever), and the action sequences are top-notch.

You can also tell the writer draws a lot from Worm in how powers work, but he's original regardless.
