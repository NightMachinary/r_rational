I like it, but I have to admit that I've started reading it more than once now and I've always gotten exhausted by the story and stopped. Only picking it up again half a year later to then kind of lapse again after a couple dozen chapters.

It is /very/ action-filled. Overly so in my opinion. Most action scenes should by shortened by half and I wouldn't complain if they were cut down to 1/4 the length they are now. Exposition and grinding scenes are also too long in my opinion. This is one of those fanfics that would really benefit from an editor going through it and cutting out half or more.

Still, if sheer length does not bother you, it's pretty great. I'm probably going to pick up reading again in the near future and see how far I'll get this time.
