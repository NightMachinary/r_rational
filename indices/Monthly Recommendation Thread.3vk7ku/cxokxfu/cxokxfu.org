[[http://myanimelist.net/manga/1649/Liar_Game][/Liar Game/]] is a manga about game theory, deception, and individual and crowd psychology. It's very shounen about non-shounen subject matter such as auction poker and 24-shot Russian roulette.

The Watson character with a trusting heart is given a hundred million yen in a box and told to trick someone out of their box, as the other tries to trick her out of hers. Her target tricks her in a heartbeat and she's left a hundred million yen in (completely illegal) debt. She goes to a famed con artist who is being released, the didactic Holmes character, and pleads with him to save her. They have many fun adventures trying to get to the top of the Liar Game.

The ending is not satisfactory compared to the rest of the story, but the rest of the story is worth it. Fukunaga is top trap.
