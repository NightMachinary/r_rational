TV Show:\\
/Boardwalk Empire/\\
I have never seen this show being discussed on reddit and I can't figure out why. It features a Prohibition era setting loaded with period detail. Super violent and grey morals, in typical HBO fashion. Produced by Martin Scorsese and written by Terence Winter, the same combo that made the excellent /The Wolf of Wall Street/

Book:\\
/Roadside Picnic/ by Arkady Strugatsky\\
Great sci-fi which has inspired video games and even a movie from Tarkovsky. The book perfectly captures one of my favorite themes, how, compared to the rest of the universe, irrelevant humanity is.
