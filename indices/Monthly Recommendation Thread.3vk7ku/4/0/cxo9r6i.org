Characters are frequently irrational (as in "I pick up the idiot ball", not "I am a damaged person who makes credibly bad decisions" - though there's plenty of that too), which gets pretty infuriating around the end of the season.

I still enjoyed it a lot though.

It's a very post-Watchmen show, where characters are not defined by their superpowers, and their problems do not come in convenient punchable-monster packages.
