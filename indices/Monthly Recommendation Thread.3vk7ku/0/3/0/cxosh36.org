I think the author is running a long-running experiment in serial escalation. I'm enjoying it so far, but its true you can only read about how this new attack/defense/skill is even more hilariously metaphysically superior to the last variation before it gets a bit tiresome.

I think Jaune's new skills have been continually interesting, especially the flavor text and the metaphysical implications of them, but his enemies, especially the most recent one (starts with a G, I'd rather not spoil too much), are not as interesting as previous 'minibosses'.
