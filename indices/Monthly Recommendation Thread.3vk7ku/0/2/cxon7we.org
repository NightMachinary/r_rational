I've been reading it but recently I've had trouble caring about what happens.

The worldbuilding is superb and the characters are written well enough. It's just that the plot itself seems like it's not going anywhere.

The antagonist is... well, to quote someone from higher up in the thread:

"It's a very post-Watchmen show, where characters are not defined by their superpowers, and their problems do not come in convenient punchable-monster packages."

This is the opposite of that. Malkuth is the very DEFINITION of 'all the problems in this story come in a conveniently punchable monster package'.

All the problems the protagonist has stem from Malkuth and can be trivially solved if Malkuth is removed from the equation, and as a result all the glorious worldbuilding and rationality is directed pretty much only at that one goal. The protagonist HAS no issues they NEED to face because of the nature of their existence, so all the smartness is directed at external rather than internal issues.

And even that wouldn't be so bad if Jaune NEEDED anybody else for anything, ever. Again, by virtue of his nature, he can do ANYTHING better than anybody else could.

Ryuugi has spent entire chapters on acknowledging and addressing these issues from Jaune's perspective, and even so it still isn't enough. Jaune has no equals save Malkuth, and that's a BIG problem from a narrative perspective.

Anyways, that's my two cents on it. Still worth a read, but don't anticipate a story that's good on every count. TGWP is a good reference for 'how to worldbuild a sophisticated setting', but that's about it, in my opinion.
