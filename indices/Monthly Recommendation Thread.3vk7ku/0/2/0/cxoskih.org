I agree that Malkuth as the enemy and Jaune's continual growth render all other enemies basically meaningless and easily solvable in comparison.

At this point in time, for example, Jaune could pretty trivially force the Kingdoms to be better to Faunus through sheer influence/power.

Which makes previous conflict rather unimportant in comparison.

But its rare that a story takes the question of omnipotence (relative to most of the setting) and what and how to use it seriously, and I think that's the direction TGWP will go in.

Given the backstory of Jaune's previous reincarnation's original death/hubris, this could be a productive theme.
