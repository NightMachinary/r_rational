Agreed. Partly its the serial update nature of it, partly the source material (The Gamer) being filled with grinding, and part of it just first draft wonkiness.

Ryuugi could definitely trim a lot of the exposition and grinding. I like the skill descriptions because they're good flavor text, so I personally wouldn't cut those.

I think Ryuugi does awesome fight scenes, definitely among the best I've read, but they have started to feel repetitive (especially the last fight.)
