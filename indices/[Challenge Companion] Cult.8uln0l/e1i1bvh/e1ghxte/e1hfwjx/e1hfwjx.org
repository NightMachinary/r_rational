There was a fair bit of cult exploration in the Dune sequels. Both through the specific cult of Muad'Dib, and also the more general stuff created by the Bene Gesserit.

The muad'dib cult was interesting, exploring some of the pitfalls of following a messiah, and following it's inevitable downfall. I found it an interesting idea, the active cultivation of cults by groups like the Missionaria Protectiva, through the sowing of prophecies to be made use of by agents in need.
