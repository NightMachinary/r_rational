Cult writing is really hard, basically for the Moldbug reason.

To paraphrase, I want to talk to a chick still in its shell about the egg. I talk about a white thing, thin and fragile, that I can shatter at will.

He doesn't know anything about that. He says the word I am using refers to the Wall Of The World, the absolute limit of all experience and possibility, the Pressure That Grows.

Similarly, if I am writing about a cult, I am not doing so to a cult audience. (The cult, of course, doesn't see itself as such, it is simply the only group that sees the World-As-It-Is) So it is going to feel cheap and silly, like watching a magic trick from behind.

It's like writing about a character with a compulsion or whatever. You can be like "Now they must wash their hands ten thousand times", and the reader is like..."Ok, I guess I can imagine what it would be like to do that", but what you want to get across is what it would be like to /have/ to do that.

To grok a cult, or other worldview, I think one must be a participant. Outsiders can only be given the whole picture, and the magic trick lies in what is omitted.

Maybe the way to properly write a Cult would be to write a fantasy novel kind of story, with a miraculous world latent with purpose serving as the setting, only to reveal the true (utterly mundane) outside POV at the end. "The City and The City" does something like this.
