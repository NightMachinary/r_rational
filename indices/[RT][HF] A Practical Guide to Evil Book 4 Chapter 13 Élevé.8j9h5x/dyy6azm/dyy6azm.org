Something I've been wondering about since the revelations of the last chapter: given that sappers are taught the spreads for goblinfire on various types of ground (with magically significant numbers in it), and that keeping notes on demons affects the surroundings, is diabolically charged alchemy the reason the sappers are typically perceived as mad, or the demonic essence is diluted enough to be safe in that regard?
