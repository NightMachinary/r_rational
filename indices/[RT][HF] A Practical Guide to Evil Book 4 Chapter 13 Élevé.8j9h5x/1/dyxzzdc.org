The Saint might outfight Cat, but Cat out-sassed her through and through, still greeting Cat with the finger-through-the-neck salute is so hilarious.

The insult Ping-Pong between Cat and Malanza was great, hopefully she lives to tell the tale.

Cat right now is reminding me of caesar, tring to squeeze every possible advantage of the situation, the crusaders are hungry, without capable middle managment and tired. (edit, looking at the comments in the blog i remembered that the crusaders should not have more than a handful of scry capable mages after zeze did his thing. even more advantages)

will the next battle be the Princes' Graveyard?
