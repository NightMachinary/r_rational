My world faced its end, but I refused to perish with it! So I intercepted a summoning ceremony from another world.

One moment!? My summoner tried to summon a demon? Fuck it, I think it's better to break the contract and do my own thing... or not? Why is Mrs. Sacrifice hugging me? And why am I suddenly a child!?

While not 100% ration all the time I give it >90%. The characters act smart and rarely hold an idiot ball, the few times they do are character trait driven. Quite an enjoyable ride.

You can read this as an ebook/pdf, along with the authors other works (I have not had a chance to read them, so I cant vouch, but Beyound? was quite good) [[http://armaell-library.net/author/andur][here]]
