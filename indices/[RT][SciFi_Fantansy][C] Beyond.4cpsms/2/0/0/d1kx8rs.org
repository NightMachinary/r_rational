I don't mean to say that portal fantasies (even generic ones) are inherently bad, just that the ones specific to that site are. For example, A Hero's War takes a generic concept and diverges from it (multiple people are summoned, the focus is on /technological/ change), while the stories on that site tend to take a generic concept and add even more generic concepts on top of it (monster girls (well, I guess AHW is a little guilty of this)! harem! demon king! wuxia-style magic! you get the point.)
