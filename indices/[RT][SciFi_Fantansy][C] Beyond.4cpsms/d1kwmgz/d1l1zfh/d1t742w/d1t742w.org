Royalroadl tends to gravitate towards lots of video game inserts, and resurrection themes. A lot of the stories are actually pretty decent in terms of storytelling, but the English is frequently poor. I find it very frustrating to read most stories there, as the combination of decent writing fundamentals and poor grammar and word use gives me a headache.

There's a substantial community there, but if you don't write in a fairly shallow band of topics, you won't get much reader input. I probably won't post any more stories there.

Another site that has caught my attention as a writer is [[http://jukepop.com/Home][Jukepop.]] It seems to be a combination of serial webfiction Author self-help site and free readership.

I will freely admit that I have not read a lot there. I'm a little afraid of the site, afraid it might eat all my free time. That said, but with the writing on the wall at Wordpress that they really don't care about what the long prose content creation community wants, I'm definitely going to look hard at Jukepop before I start my next project.

The thing that concerns me most about Jukepop is that they seem to have some sort of publishing limitation on their site. I'm going to have to examine it closely to make sure I don't sign over the rights to my writing in my desire to get away from Wordpress. That said, there are a lot of authors on Jukepop, and I'd think there would be horror stories and whatnot if they really did bad things to writers intellectual property rights.

Jukepop doesn't have a rational fiction section though, nor a rationalist fiction section. Perhaps that might need to change? (Not me! I'm writing decidedly irrational fiction as my next project!)
