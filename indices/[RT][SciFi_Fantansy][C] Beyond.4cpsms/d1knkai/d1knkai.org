Thanks for sharing the story.

+I like stories from the other side of a summoning grid.+ Never mind that, it was only used as character introduction and backstory.

I can't put my finger on what exactly was missing from this story, but in comparison to some other web originals it felt rather bland. I mean, it had its funny or interesting moments, but overall was... lacking, somehow.

Out of the outright negative characteristics there were these annoyingly boring romantic anime parts, the weird power dinamics going on between the genders, and the partially repulsive morality systems of the protagonist in particular and the species in general.
