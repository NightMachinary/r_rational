A simulated me is /definitely/ getting voice-activated internet access. In fact, I'd set up the voice-activated Internet access /before/ copying the simulation.

Hmmm... if the simulated me is designing a robot body, then it doesn't need to be anything like my actual body. I'm thinking a three-wheeled torso will be easier to work with than trying to balance while walking on actual legs.

Does it need to actually be plugged in to draw power, or can it draw power from nearby circuits via induction?
