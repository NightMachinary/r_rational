...the real trouble here is that the communication with Virtual Me is audio-only, and Virtual Me has no way to create tech inside there (so I can't give Virtual Me a modem and a TV screen so that he can actually see things). This lack of visual input is going to make things hard enough for Virtual Me that I don't really think I want to put Me on there at all. (Especially since, before putting Me on there, I've got a 50% chance of waking up in the holocron).
