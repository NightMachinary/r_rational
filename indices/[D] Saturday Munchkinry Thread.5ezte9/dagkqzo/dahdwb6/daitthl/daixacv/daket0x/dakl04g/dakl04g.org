If communication was full-sensory it would be really easy to use (unless the same time-compression caveat applied to the visual spectrum, which would rule out anything greater than ~1.5× for natural images and 15× for artificial colour ones) to great effect, and deprivation would be far less of a factor.

If they were able to directly manufacture tech at 100× speed or higher, it would border on an instant win depending on how one intelligent-but-faster human scales compared to /N/ individual intelligent humans.

But yeah, I probably wouldn't go for it even with the addition of visual communication. The inability to touch things and socialise face-to-face would probably be a deal-breaker.

Even if I did decide to do it willingly, Outside Me would feel guilty and compromise his real-world goals to make it up to Virtual Me, and Virtual Me would resent Outside Me (irrationally, given that in this scenario both made the choice knowing they might be in either situation).
