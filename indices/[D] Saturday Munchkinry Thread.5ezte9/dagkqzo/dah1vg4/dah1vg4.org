Yeeeeah, given your description I think the smartest move is probably "get rid of it." Simulated!you gets you no resources except time acceleration, and externally controlled acceleration at that. There's a chance you could use that to, say, make better decisions by giving a simulated version of you extra time to think, but that would be offset by the mental/emotional toll the setup takes on the simulated version -- you couldn't trust that what they come up with is really your best thinking. Meanwhile, you are torturing an apparently sentient simulation of yourself. Not good.

IF you either have a VERY good memory or you changed the setup so there is a good way (like a functional computer they don't have to concentrate on) for simulated!you to store and revise data, you could use the box to work on, say, creative projects, music, novels, maybe some philosophical theory. Anything where the finished product can be conveyed into the real world by sound. But I don't think the system as presented would readily accommodate this, and it still has the moral issues with creating a sentient being just to use them and then leave them to torment and suicide.
