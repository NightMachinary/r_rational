The peeing, while super weird and embarrassing, is just a sideshow. You're a freaking super-hero... just not an omnipotent one.

The next weekly Munchkinry thread is tomorrow. I recommend you (or I) open this as a reply there:

LOW-END SPEEDSTER: You can - switching on and off at will - move, think, and act at four times speed. From your point of view it is the rest of the world that slows down, so you require none of the concomitant increases in strength and durability that speedsters tend to require and you are otherwise an average human being.

Only your body's living cells are affected, so your clothes, skin, hair and most bodily fluids operate at regular speed other than that the rest of you drags (and pumps) them around. This has some awkward biological effects, digestion for example, that make it difficult and potentially harmful to stay in the state for many hours at a time. In the very long term, you age four times faster while speeding.

Oh, and from your point of view gravity is about four times weaker but all momentum (except your cells') is four times stronger.
