Does "believe a lie" also imply believing all the logical consequences of that lie? Alternately, does it imply "believing the logical consequences of the lie, insofar as the target normally believes in logical consequences of his ideas"? If the latter, note that people are very inconsistent and that by itself could make the power not seem to work at times.

Also, a question a little similar to the logical consequences one: exactly how is the lie fit into the target's preexisting worldview? For instance, what happens if you tell someone "the world is flat" but he already has travelled around the world and knows that when it's day here it's night on the other side. Does he then come up with a whole bunch of rationalizations about how the conspiracy put up a special sunlight filter to make it night in some places and day in others? Or does he just hold the inconsistent belief set "time zones prove the world is round", "there are time zones", and "the world isn't round"?
