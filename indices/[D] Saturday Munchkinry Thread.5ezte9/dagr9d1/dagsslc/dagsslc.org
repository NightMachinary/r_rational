This sounds like code geass towards the end. Not much you can do about it. If you play intelligently with your wording you just win. "Your main goal in life is to produce a utopia and keep me alive and happy" say this to everyone you meet. You're unlikely to get attacked by he other side of the world if you travel and take over world leaders proactively. In addition you lie to yourself so that you are always at least slightly happy. Then you get your utopia set up and tell everyone they are happy. Gg
