You have the ability to make anyone believe any lie you say. You have to be physically present (recordings don't work) and you only have to be understood for it to work. In other words, ear plugs might act as a good defense, but if the victims can read your lips or understands your gestures, the effect will still work. You also have to be careful with what you say because you can't turn it off. You will automatically believe any lie you tell to yourself, so your mental state can deteriorate if you don't use it wisely. Oh, and it doesn't necessarily have to be a lie, only something the user believes to be false.

This is something I'm planning for a villain in future arc of my story. I think it'd be cool to see if you guys come up with cool uses. One more thing, just cause the recipient believes everything you say to them doesn't mean that they'll do what you expect them to. Example: If you tell someone you're attracted to that you're the only person on the planet that will love them, the victim might commit suicide out of despair.

So, there's the obvious "take over the world" plan with this, but what else would you do? Also, how would you beat someone like this?
