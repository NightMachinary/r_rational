Hove you read [[#s][Book Series]]? That series has a similar power, but limited to hearing, can be increased/decreased at will (but not turned off), and also works on statements the speaker believes to be true.

  You also have to be careful with what you say because you can't turn it off. You will automatically believe any lie you tell to yourself...

If you're a government, you can detect them by having checkpoints scattered around that require a person to tell a specific lie to the guard. If the guard believes them, they get arrested, if not, they go free.

As an individual, it would be much, much more difficult. They could persuade you to let them go ("These aren't the droids you're looking for"), but that would run the risk of the speaker believing that nobody was looking for them.
