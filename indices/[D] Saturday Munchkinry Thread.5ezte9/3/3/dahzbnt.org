If the effect works on me, I'll probably quickly become unstable and lose connection with reality. Everyone lies to themselves, but most of us don't believe the self-lies.

In the worst case scenario, imagine this. A remote-controlled robot that is chasing me has me cornered at the top of a tall building. The next building is twenty feet away, and twenty feet down.

I have a choice. Surrender or try to jump to the next building. I'm no athlete but I still say to myself "I can make it."

I just lied to myself, and now I believe it, so I jump. /splat/
