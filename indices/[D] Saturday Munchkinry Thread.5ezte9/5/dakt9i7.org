*What's the best society you can build, using only medieval/renaissance technology?*

You're a member of a spacefaring race, and you have smartphone-equivalents containing enough info to rebuild your society from scratch, the complete history of civilization, etc. Right now your colony has nanofabricators that can build almost anything. FTL tech does not exist, but otherwise pretty much whatever you like.

Miraculously, your values are basically the same as they are in real life, oh 21st-century Redditor.

However, there are alien probes drifting through space that will destroy any colony they find that has modern (Industrial Revolution or later) technology. As such, you need to restructure your society to survive without it.

[They're capable of slagging your planet at /c/ from outside effective sensor range, and are generally more powerful than any defence you could possibly muster (although they /may/ only destroy the offending city, if you're lucky.) They pass by every half-century or so on average.]

The exact definition of "modern technology" is somewhat vague - techniques that /could/ plausibly be used without modern technology but happened to be developed later (like liberal democracy, higher math, or the concept of a "production line") are usually allowed. Technology that isn't widespread or integrated is more likely to be allowed; you can have crude batteries and steam engines around as long as they aren't actually powering anything, for example.
