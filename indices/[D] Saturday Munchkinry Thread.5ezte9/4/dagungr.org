Ok so it's the late 60's and superpowers have recently arisen.\\
You are one of the few genius god tier superhumans and one of only a few that retained interest in affecting the world. You have pretty substantial political influence among the western powers. This is because you can influence people's brains, but not /too/ greatly; as you don't know more about neurology than we do nowadays. Plus you can tell a considerable amount from observing people's brain states with your powers, again limited by knowledge of neurology. In addition you can do things like split your mind into a multitude of copies of yourself and spend months deliberating within your own mind in a simulated environment in order to come to a decision, all in the middle of a conversation.\\
All in all, you could easily become the leader of your home western country and are possibly the most influential political figure in the world.

Now it has recently become clear that level of education (especially regarding logic) and intelligence are extremely strongly correlated with developing superhuman abilities. So given the possession of superhumans is a staggering military advantage (and they can be used for unofficial attacks on the enemy while maintaining plausible deniability), you can probably get western powers to agree to somewhat extreme measures in the name of getting an advantage.

So effectively this question boils down to /how do you rapidly increase the intelligence and sanity waterlevel of western powers, as part of an intelligence military arms race?/\\
Bonus points for info about how that kind of rapid increase in competence would affect a nations culture.
