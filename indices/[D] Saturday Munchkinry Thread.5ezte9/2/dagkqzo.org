You stumble upon a piece of alien technology analogous to a Sith Holocron. With a few hours of dedicated mental effort akin to a trance, you can upload a copy of yourself into the device. This copy cannot be overwritten in the future; once used, the device is locked. You don't have to activate it immediately, if preparing yourself for the copying is important.

Physically, the device is a silvery metal sphere about 15 centimetres in diameter weighing only 10 kg. It seems highly resistant to damage of all kinds. There are buttons on the front that you are able to guess mean "slow down", "pause", and "speed up".

The device simulates you perfectly in a simulated environment, though simulated!you's body does not need sleep, food, or warmth, and cannot suffer damage from age or injury. Simulated!you is capable of sleeping, eating, and feeling warmth if the environment permits, though there are no physiological effects of these. Naturally, this means that you will quickly diverge, especially as the effects of age alter physical!you's body and mind.

The only form of communication to or from the device is auditory. Specifically, the device transmits sound within an order of magnitude of human hearing frequency ranges from its environment to the simulated environment and vice versa. Simulated!you can still only hear what a healthy adult human would be able to hear.

The device consumes 1 kilojoule of energy per simulated second. It will draw power from any connected electrical circuit, taking as much power as physically provided (up to however much it needs). It has no internal battery, and when unpowered it will not simulate any time (but will not lose the data).

Physical!you is able to manipulate the time compression factor. Doing so also compresses the communicated sounds; at N× speed all external sounds are played at 1/N the frequency, and all internal sounds are emitted at N× the frequency.

The simulated environment is by default very bland, though with some effort simulated!you can alter it in an impermanent way. It's sort of like a dream, with details slipping away when not consciously focussed on, only there's no details pulled from the subconscious like in a dream. Importantly, any things created in this way are sensory effects only with no intrinsic behaviour (i.e. an imagined computer only calculates as fast as simulated!you can imagine the answers and update the screen).

You're fairly certain that a prolonged period of time in such an environment with no external communication would be deleterious to your mental health, though the rate of psychological damage would be difficult to determine. The experience would be closer to a sensory deprivation chamber than a deserted island, but what that means depends on you.

The device is very, very illegal to own. You're not even meant to know it exists, and if certain secretive intergovernmental agencies that definitely don't exist were to catch you with it things would not go well for either copy of you.

Theoretically, it doesn't have to be you that claims the device, but there's a lot of risk involved in either selling it or convincing somebody else to upload themselves into the device for your use. You may not even be able to prove it's real.

Lastly, simulated!you is able to erase themselves if they wish. Doing so would not unlock the device for reuse.
