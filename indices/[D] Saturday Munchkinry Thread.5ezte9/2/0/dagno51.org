That's one creative torture box.

It seems kind of hard to use effectively. The one-use limit means you can't get very creative with it, in particular. But mostly, the whole point of Holocrons is that they're loaded with extremely wise and knowledgeable masters, and useful to other people who need their forgotten secrets.

What the box does is give you a personal advisor with a lot of time on their hands (especially with an accelerate function), which is pretty useful on its own. I'd still hesitate to use it, since it apparently means making a copy of yourself that will eventually go insane or commit suicide, and do nothing but serve you in the meantime.
