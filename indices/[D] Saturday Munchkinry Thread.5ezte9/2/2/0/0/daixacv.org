It works through both direct contact, forming holes to accept any power plugs you try to push into it, or through induction within a relatively short range. The induction works much better on thick or looped wires and when perpendicular to the device, so better with purpose-built circuits.

Multiple power sources are accepted simultaneously in parallel, obeying the normal rules of electricity. Note that this means that you could theoretically burn out circuits by setting the time compression too high for them to handle.

In terms of a robot body, you could get even more abstract. Controlling a house or facility would be doable with enough instrumentation. You could even have multiple such bodies scattered throughout the world, controlled remotely. If you had the power and solved the other technical issues, the simulation would be able to make human-quality decisions up to ~1,000Ã— faster than you (and potentially even faster, since it would have more time to focus on raw intellect improvements without physical distractions).
