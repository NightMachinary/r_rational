You are an Aetherborn, a short-lived, genderless, empathic race from the world of Kaladesh, in Magic: The Gathering. You are born a fully-functional adult with a full grasp of language, and you have about two years to live before you crumble to dust. Your resources are as follows:

- Empathy. You can feel the emotions of other nearby sapient beings as if they are your own. This cannot be used directly as a lie detector, but you can use it to extract information from people by asking them questions whose answers might change emotional states significantly.

- You cannot eat and you do not sleep. You can smell.

- You are born into an Aetherborn gang whose function is to create unique experiences for its members and produce enough profit to continue doing so into the future. You do not have any power in this gang currently, but nobody will come after you if you leave unless you try to betray the gang.

- The leader of the gang is known to be able to drain life from other sapients to sustain themself. You do not know how many Aetherborn have this ability, or whether you do.

What do?
