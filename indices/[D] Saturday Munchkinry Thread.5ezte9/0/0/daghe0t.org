Hmmm, my knowledge on MtG is spotty, but using standard fantasy tropes:

Any Always Evil races? Easy way to sustain leader and maybe yourself, to test it on them.

Use Empathy to pick out and only drain bad individuals, if possible and no always evils (and even there to check)

Cities and urbanization are important because way more experiences happen in cities, so work in cities.

Valuable as psychologists/interrogators, make yourself valuable enough to the military any racial prejudice is overcome.
