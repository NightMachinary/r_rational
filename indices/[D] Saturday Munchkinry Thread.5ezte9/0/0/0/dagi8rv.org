There are no Always Evil races on Kaladesh, though the Aetherborn themselves are the closest. They're really just terminally hedonistic party animals, and they don't particularly enjoy hurting others because they have to feel it themselves when they do.

There isn't any obvious racism on Kaladesh. The five sapient species (humans, elves, dwarves, vedalken, aetherborn) generally all get along, at least in the largest city of Ghirapur. The government (Consulate) is fascist, but the 'racial' group it targets is mages. Some factions of the government want to exterminate mages, others just want to control and use them. At this point, there aren't many mages left, at least not openly in Ghirapur.

Gaining access to and draining high-level Consulate officials would be fairly moral due to corruption and moral bankruptcy, but it wouldn't actually fix much because of the well-oiled meritocracy replacing the dead. Also, it's a pretty strong surveillance state, with autonomous spy drones everywhere. You would probably be caught eventually.

There is an underground resistance to the Consulate, but their influence is limited, and not even they see a path to taking down the Consulate.

Technological advancement on Kaladesh is quite high, with autonomous constructs doing a lot of the remaining work. Basically everyone appears to be some kind of inventor, receiving resources from the Consulate.

Actually, now that I think about it, I have no idea how Ghirapur's economy works. Presumably there's some kind of UBI or food welfare in place, because all jobs appear to flow from the Consulate and there just can't be enough of them to feed the entire city through capitalism. Healthcare is similarly unmentioned, though healers are one kind of mage the Consulate leaves alone.
