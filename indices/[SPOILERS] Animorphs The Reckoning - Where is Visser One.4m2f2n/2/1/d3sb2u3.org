  To get to the point, when you say Visser One is Marco's mom you mean that her host body is his mom, right? Or was said body taken over so long ago that it's original personality is pretty much irrelevant to Marco's family?

The first one. There was a one-time villain who was a Controller whose personality started to merge with its host (neither of which was very stable to begin with). She was kind of a complete cartoon supervillain, though, so I don't know if she's going to be included.
