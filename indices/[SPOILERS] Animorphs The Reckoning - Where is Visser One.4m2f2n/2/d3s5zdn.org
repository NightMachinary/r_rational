I haven't read any of the original Animorphs but I don't have a problem reading quasi-spoilers seeing how any or all of it could be subverted in this fanfic. If anything it gives me more context to enjoy the story with.

To get to the point, when you say Visser One is Marco's mom you mean that her /host body/ is his mom, right? Or was said body taken over so long ago that it's original personality is pretty much irrelevant to Marco's family?
