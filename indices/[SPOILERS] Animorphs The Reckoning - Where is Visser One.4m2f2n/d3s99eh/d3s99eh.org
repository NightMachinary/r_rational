Normally I'd say no because it's so improbable that it strains belief, but with godlike beings playing around with probability, it's possible for Marco's mother to also be host to Visser One.

However like you said, the timeline is too tight for it to make much sense. Visser One would still be on Earth and likely to be the one in charge of things rather than Visser Three. Or maybe she got the rank for discovering the human species, but Visser is charged to conduct the invasion due to his greater experience (?).

It's possible for Visser Three to know about Marco and to see the Eva without making the connection if Marco doesn't look too much like his mother (and I expect aliens to be bad at understanding human facial features), and why would Visser One bother with sharing her host's name?
