The whole situation isn't nearly as improbable as it first looks.

Regarding rank, it makes perfect sense that Visser Three, the general in command of deployed troops for a specific operation, isn't the grand commander of their entire military. Visser One had the foresight to see the value of seeking and successfully locating a species and a world with overwhelming strategic importance to their empire. Now she's seen as the one with vision, and is put in charge of making the big strategy decisions overall. Finishing the specifics of the key operation she planned out can be delegated - but still to someone very high up who can be relied upon to do the job well.

It's actually a very rational-setting aspect of the story for the Yeerk Council of Thirteen to recognize the ramifications of Visser One's accomplishment and put her in a position to empower her to do more of the same. It also says (for the humans) very scary things about Yeerk high command's efficiency in meritocratically allocating their people according to their best skills.

Regarding the connection to the protagonists, this too has fewer leaps than it might first look like. Visser One either selected the initial target town for the operation based upon knowledge from her host or (more likely) picked a host to get more specific details after deciding where a good initial location for the invasion would be. So the invasion starts in the town Visser One's host was from, either way. Elfangor's ship crashes nearby because he was hoping to manage to take out their Pool, even if he didn't succeed at that. We already know that the Ellimist has been using his influence to arrange for a very specific group of people to be the ones "randomly" stumbling across Elfangor's ship. If Visser One's host's son lives in the same town that Elfangor's ship crashes in, due to the reasons above, then it's not much extra work for the Ellimist to ensure he's part of the group.
