Since this is an account on which you can be yourself, feel free to engage with the community. If you'd like help or advice for managing and improving your self-esteem (if fictional, you have the tone and diction of someone suffering from low self-esteem down pat), link to this and share what methods you've already tried in overmorrow's off-topic thread. Many here would be happy to talk with you about personal topics that are hard to air elsewhere, and perhaps direct you to or directly become a resource for the recovery, maintenance, and/or furtherance of your positive mental health.

You've already taken the step into the communal pool. If you need guidance on swimming technique, just splash.
