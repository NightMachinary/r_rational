Wait, is this a real life confession? Because if so, then 1. you've got guts 2. it's really well-written. And 3. also kind of off topic, since this thread is for fiction, but I don't think anyone is going to care about that because if you had put it in the off topic thread perhaps a lot of people might have missed it. And seriously, you just did the equivalent of standing on a stage in front of an audience of maybe hundreds of people who you might or might not have even met in real life and pouring your heart out to them. Even if you're standing on that stage with a mask on, it still must have been pretty nerve-wracking for you. It probably would have been nerve wracking for most people in your shoes. If you think that's cowardly, then what do you consider brave?

If it is fictional, then I am very impressed. You really brought the character to life with that monologue, to the point where it's hard to tell that they're not a real person. IF it's not a real person, anyways.
