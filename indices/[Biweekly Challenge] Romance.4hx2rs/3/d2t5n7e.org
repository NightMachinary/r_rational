[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/17K5sC6bVf51QjsCtPSKrSpkRvu89OFvbSZfbmJuj-2o/edit?usp=sharing][Interlude: The Book]] (1949 Words)

A bit of background: This is a future scene in a fanfiction I have started to write. I haven't gotten very far into it yet, and I'm trying to avoid too many spoilers, so the characters are only identified by pronouns here. Two of the main themes of the story are alienation and relationships, and so I thought I'd cut a slice of two of the main character's future as I see it and put it down as an example of how I see them acting.
