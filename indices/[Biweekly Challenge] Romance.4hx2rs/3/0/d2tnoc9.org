Intriguing. (Reincarnation seems to be implied; the association with madness/breakdowns reminds me both of Fantastic Children (which I've watched barely anything of) and Air (which I watched all of). Something to accomplish to break out of a cycle into an able state, the cycle itself made harder due to not being an able state, and the underlying question of 'how did the cycle get started in the first place'... the indication of it as a fanfiction makes me curious in that I don't clearly recall any fictions I've encountered that directly fit the indicated context.)
