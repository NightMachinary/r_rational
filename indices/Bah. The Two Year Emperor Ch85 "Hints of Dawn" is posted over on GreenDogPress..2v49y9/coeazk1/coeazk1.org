Got tired of waiting for Fanfiction.net to get their act together, so I posted it over on GreenDogPress, my vanity publishing shop which I really need to get set up with its domain name and a nicer theme with better organization.

Offtopic: If anyone else has original fiction that they would like to sell, I'm happy to host it on GDP. No charge, no commission, just trying to make people's life easy. You'll just need to get yourself a way to take payment and do delivery -- I suggest signing up for SendOwl and Stripe, but it's up to you.

EDIT: "Read the excerpt" in this case actually means "read the rest of the chapter"
