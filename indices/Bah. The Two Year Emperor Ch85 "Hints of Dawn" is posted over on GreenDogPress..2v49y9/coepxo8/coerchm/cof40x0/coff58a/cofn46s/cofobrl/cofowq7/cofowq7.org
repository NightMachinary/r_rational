Plus there is no way to vary it, say to only use 6 layers if you have 5 opponents, so you are going to be wasting resources everytime it triggers. It also takes the 40 spell slots again to recharge. Effectively countering it would involve a two waved attack, with the second not being sprung until after the first has failed.

Lots of ways to get life redundancy as well, clone spells, contingent true resurrection (There are completely and utterly broken rules in one of the Complete books for /crafting contingent spells/, with no practical limit for number of effects aside from crafting time, xp and money.) even simulacra for a poor man's ice assassin.
