Hmm. Well, you could use nested Contingencies.

Create a Contingency spell that casts a Contingency spell which triggers when someone uses a readied action to perform some offensive action against you, iterate N times. Contingency X triggers, you no longer have an active contingency effect, this casts Contingency X+1 and so on.

Iterate N times, where N is a number sufficiently large that nobody will be able to effectively preempt you, and have the N+1th contingency cast Celerity.
