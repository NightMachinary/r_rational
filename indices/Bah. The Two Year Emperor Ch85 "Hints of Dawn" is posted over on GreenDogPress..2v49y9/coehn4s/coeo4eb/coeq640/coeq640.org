Those reasons make sense but it doesn't change the fact how odd it was that during their third meeting and going through the FLEA and being taken to the drow caverns Ellen didn't even once think to go "hey Suze since you're here would you mind clearing my name since you personally know the emperor of Flobovia and are the one that actually commited the crime I am being charged with". The idea is simple enough that a non enhanced person could have thought about it and going through the FLEA her wisdom and intelligence she should have been smart enough to realize it would have made things easier in the long run even if she didn't plan on going back to Flobovia.
