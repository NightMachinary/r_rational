I just realized something, couldn't Suze just admit to the authorities that she was the one that commited the murder at the FLEA a few chapters back and that Ellen had nothing to do with it. She is death afterall it's not like they can just arrest her, plus she could just resurrect the she killed. You'd think two people with enhanced intelligence could have come up with something so simple.
