You can beat that with multiple attackers. Celerity gives you a readied action, thereby allowing you to preempt the one attacking you. So, the sequence goes:

1. Bob prepares a readied action: "throw dust at BBEG if he casts a spell"
2. Al attacks BBEG with the dust
3. BBEG uses an immediate action to cast Celerity, preempting the attack
4. Bob's readied action preempts the casting of Celerity and he dumps his dust
