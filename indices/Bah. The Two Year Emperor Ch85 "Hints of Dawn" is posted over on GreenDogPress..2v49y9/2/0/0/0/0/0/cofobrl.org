Hm. The [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/contingency.htm][wording on Contingency]] isn't clear on whether Contingency can cast a Contingency. I can support either side of the argument from what I see, and I'm honestly not sure which answer is correct.

Regardless, you need to cast both the Contingency and the other spell at the same time. A FLEA-graduate is probably a Wiz20/Sorc20/Archivist20. Wiz and Sorc can cast the 6th level [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/contingency.htm][Contingency]], archivists cannot. Between your Wiz and Sorc classes you have 40 slots from 6-9th level, all of which can load Contingency. If you wanted to burn your entire high-level spell list for a day you could have an N=40 chain of Contingencies; they would last for 20 days(1) and then you'd have to do it all again. You can't use scrolls to increase N because you [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/scrolls.htm]['activate a scroll']], you don't 'cast a spell from a scroll' and Contingency requires that both spells be /cast/ at the same time. You also can't use [[http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Ring_of_Spell_Storing][Rings of Spell Storing]] because those can't cast 6th level spells. So, at least under 2YE rules, I think you're limited to N=40.

So, as long as you aren't attacked by 41 guys equipped with Dust of Sneezing and Choking, you're fine!

(1) I'm pretty sure that when a spell has a duration of "1 day/level" there is RAW stating that that refers to caster level, not total level. Caster level is defined as level /in the class you used to cast the spell/, so 20, not 60. I can't find the quote, though.

Oh, wait, I just realized -- the condition to set on the Contingency would be "Activate one round before you expire, or whenever anyone takes an action that would harm or incapacitate me." The outermost Contingency would activate after 20 days and then the N-1 one would last for another 20 days. Yeah, that's sounding pretty good.
