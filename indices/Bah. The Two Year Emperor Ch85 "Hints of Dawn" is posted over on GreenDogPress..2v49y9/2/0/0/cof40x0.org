To be fair, it still doesn't work on sufficiently paranoid people. An active Foresight spell makes you immune to surprise, which allows you to Celerity-TimeStop any attempted offensive action. With a Caster Level of 24 (20 + Practiced Spellcaster), it should last for 4 hours per cast. a 60th level character with infinity gold should have quite a lot of bonus spells of 9th level to deal with that issue.

Alternatively, a Contingency effect specifically against dust of sneezing and choking (casting Heal, which immideately ends stun effects among its other effects) would also function.
