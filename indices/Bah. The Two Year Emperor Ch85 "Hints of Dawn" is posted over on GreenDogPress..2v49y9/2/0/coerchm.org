Yep. It's about the only way to quickly take down someone who's been through the FLEA. At least, the only way I'm aware of. FLEA-graduates will make every save on a 2 or better (1 is an auto fail) so anything that allows a save doesn't work on them.

Of course, it's a guaranteed takedown against /anyone/ and it's a lot quieter than a sword fight, so I figure it works well for the way drow would fight. Especially if combined with a Silence spell.
