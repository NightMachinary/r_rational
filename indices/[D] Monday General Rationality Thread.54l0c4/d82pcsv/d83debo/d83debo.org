Depends on the circumstances.

- "With Your Drill...", the piano version, from Gurren Lagann: the default: soft and welcoming but hinting at soaring triumph and excitement when you recognize the melody.

- "Tutim" by Ethnix if I'm together with family, especially my wife. It's not "our song" in the archetypical way, but it's one we both enjoy. Also, protest songs have always been the best at describing my hopes in life. Besides, I want to make sure something of the Hebrew language survives this century.

- "Im Yesh Sikui" ("If There's a Chance") by Muki. The lyrics are suitable and the tune is nice.

- Anything by Sabaton: if I've got to steel myself and fucking deal with shit immediately.

- "Mirai Start" the anime song: if you want to completely and utterly fuck with me. No points if you can't /at least/ pull off a decent Rubber Hand Illusion to make me think you've changed my anatomy to go with the song. Full points if you /really do/ change my anatomy, /and yours/, to fully elaborate the joke. Though I will demand to go back to normal.

- Similar joke for "Carolus Rex", except you have to dress as the Emperor of Mankind and I'll need no Rubber Hand Illusion for that one.
