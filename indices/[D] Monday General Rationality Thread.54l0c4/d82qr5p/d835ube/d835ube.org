If I were to go balls to the wall, I'd save up $2,000 at a time, and start investing them in medical companies in stage 2 trials. AFAIK, it's the least likely stage to fail and then when the stock pumps (See: [[https://www.google.com/search?q=crbp]]), sell out. Last January they were at 1 dollar per share. If I had bought 2,000 of them, I'd have a lot more cash than I currently do.

My problem is that I'm in school right now without a steady job, so no munchkining that for me.
