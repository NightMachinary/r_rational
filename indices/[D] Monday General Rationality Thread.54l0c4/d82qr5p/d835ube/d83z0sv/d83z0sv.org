The financial sector is not particularly amenable to munchkining. They're getting pretty good at estimating a company's future earnings and making sure their estimates correspond with reality. If most medical companies with drugs in phase II trials were undervalued, someone would surely have picked up on that by now. And if not now, certainly in a few years.

I don't know. If you had some experience or little-known information about drug discovery, you'd have a better chance, but if any quantitative analyst can do the research you've done then they probably have.
