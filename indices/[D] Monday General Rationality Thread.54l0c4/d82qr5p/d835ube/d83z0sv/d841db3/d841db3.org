Efficient market hypothesis in a nutshell. While you can outperform the market, you need expert knowledge.

If there's any hot tip that can be summarised in a paragraph, it's probably either incorrect or has already been incorporated, though if it's new enough it may still be profitable.

Best bet to beat the market is to pay experts in relevant fields to guage the expected improvement on new companies. The downside of course is that this would require a significant investment on its own and may still not pay off.
