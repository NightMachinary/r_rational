I have a couple of different songs I have used for the alarm on my iPhone, so when I hear them, I think of waking up. I would pick one of them, to play up the idea to myself that I what I went through was no different than sleep, just on a longer and more extreme scale... Hopefully this would alleviate the sensation that the original "me" died and I am a pieced together simulacrum more designed by the algorithms that "revived" me than what originally organically developed.
