Hmm. Can't help but be a bit annoyed at the classic "talking no jutsu" we see so often in media.

If you can't tell by its name, I call it that because Naruto does it. A. Lot. To the point where it's canon that he's uncannily good at converting enemies on the fly. He's not unique in this aspect though. In several forms of fiction (though anime is particularly fond of this trope) good guys often bring bad guys to their side (or at least convince them to make a Heroic sacrifice) by talking to them in a brief, intense conversation. Maybe even two or three over the course of a few seperate meetings/fights.

And I just can't help but rebel mentally at that thought. Don't get me wrong; people changing/defecting is entirely possible and can happen and be both well executed and driven mainly by the protagonist. I just don't think these intense, brief, argumentative bursts of emotional appeal should have nearly the success rate they do.

Normally, I don't complain about this but in a work that makes an effort to hold itself to higher realistic/rational standards, I adjust my metrics accordingly.
