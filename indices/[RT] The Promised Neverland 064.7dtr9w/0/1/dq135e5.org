I'm sort of reserving judgement until we see the full results of the conversation.

If it instantly changed his mind and now he's onboard with the kids, I'd say that's a misstep. Though we were at least given enough hints that this man wasn't entirely commited to killing them even before this talk, that it sort of works in this situation.

It's still not really the most elegant solution, of course. I would have preferred to see them either overcome his plots, or impress him so much that he began to have faith that things might turn out differently this time, or simply have him continue to fight them every step of the way, until he finally got his wish and the kids left for one reason or another.

But as long as this talk doesn't completely cause his character to 180, I'll consider it not a complete failure. Just a bit of a missed opportunity.
