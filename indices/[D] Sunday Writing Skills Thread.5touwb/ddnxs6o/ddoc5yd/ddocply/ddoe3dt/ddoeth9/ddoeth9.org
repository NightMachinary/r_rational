  So why does the story lose the immersion when they meet? Probably because their internal logic doesn't have them behave at all the way they do when they meet. It probably doesn't have them meet at all. It's not what happens. It's what you want to happen. But in the story-as-real-events, it doesn't happen. That's my guess, anyway.

  This is a really hard problem to solve, by the way. I struggle with it more than any other, actually. The clash between the ideas you get in your head and what ends up being true when you actually try to write it...that's my bane. I don't have a solution, sorry.

Arrrgh. Yes. The meeting is contrived. Very contrived. That's exactly it and I hadn't put my finger on it. Thankyou so much for making it so crystal clear!

My favourite way to brainstorm is to come up with 10 ideas, no matter how good or how bad, just come up with 10 of them. Usually somewhere around 3 or 7 I come up with something that works. Human's overall motivation is he needs money. Vampire's is he wants to mac on some cute human.

So, /how do they meet/? Let's completely take the place and time off the table.

1.  Vampire actually monitored him for a while, decided he liked him, stalked him, and then chose to present himself as an employer

2.  Human is responding to job ads. Vampire has legitimate job for the human (what on earth could it be?), or has decided to let fate decide who he hits on

3.  Later in the story, Human demonstrates aptitude with shopping for things that vampires like. Instead of physical labour, he's making a living as a stallholder in a market. Vampire thinks a human who is drawn to vampire-valuable items would be handy to have around.

4.  Human gets kidnapped (by other vampires) and used as meal /during/ the opera intermissions (refreshments included in the ticket price for vampire attendees!). Vampire, amid the feelings the opera, decides to take pity on him, looks after him - probably buying him off the opera guys.

5.  Human is actually /on the run/ from the army and hasn't get settled into having a steady job or income stream. Vampire finds him when he impinges on his land / property / hunting grounds?

6.  They happen to meet randomly as the wall scene (I was reaching so here it is...)

7.  Someone sets them up - Vampire has a.... friend???? who thinks he's getting a bit out of touch with humanity, so hires him an "assistant". They are set up as like mentor/mentee but then end up kissing

8.  Human is so hard on his luck he ends up working as a prostitute. Vampire hires him, takes pity on him, etc.

9.  Human is working in Vampire's hotel; Vampire courts him.

10. Human finds something that belongs to the vampire (e.g. a passport on the street). Returns it for reward. (Or: doesn't return it. Vampire tracks him down).

Yeah................ the way they meet in my story (#6) is by far the least exciting of the 10 options I just came up with. #1 is functionally identical but at least is a bit creepy if I really want to trade on "vampire boyfriend is creepy".

2 is boring. Number 3 is interesting and relates to stuff that happens at the end of this volume.

4 is a bit too... sad, though at least it's dramatic and interesting enough to get the reader intrigued - but I don't know if the rescuer/savior dynamic is what I want out of this.

5 is OK but not great, and would still require Vampire to have a reason to approach Human - unless he Saw Too Much?

7 is pretty bland, requires a new character. 8 is strictly worse than 4 because it hits the same power dynamics but in a really hard-to-get-right way.

9 is boring, but at least is more "romantic" than the current version - being forced to see each other, slowly building a rapport, etc without having to offer a job. Can even use a lot of the same scenes as the Vampire can ask the Human to do "hotel porter" type stuff when he is an actual hotel porter.

10 is OK, but at the "returns it for reward" point, we don't have a reason for them to keep talking to each other.

So.... from that brainstorming session (thanks for encouraging it), making Human a hotel porter, or /maybe/ making him an intermission snack, is going to be more likely to get me where I want to go, or keeping what we have but making it from the vampire's point of view and saying "the vampire had been monitoring the human for weeks. He liked him. He wanted to smooch him a lot" somewhere.

Do you have any thoughts on this?
