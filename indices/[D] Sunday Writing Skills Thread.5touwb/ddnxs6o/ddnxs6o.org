Okay, here's some of my questions from this week:

- Request for specific feedback: I don't like the way my story starts. I don't think it makes you care, and having read fiction online I know that if I am not interested in the first few paragraphs I'm not going to read it. [[http://pastebin.com/72WudD2c][Here's my first chapter]] (2.5k words, but it's divided into two halves). How do I make this more interesting? I was considering some prologue vignettes about the two characters before they meet, but not sure if that'd be more interesting or not. (human: being overwhelmed by the fact he's about to be sent to war and running away like a coward; vampire: finishing watching an opera about a human-vampire romance and in a flight of romantic fancy deciding he'd like to spend a decade or two courting a human). Alternatively I can start the story partway through chapter 1, or even start it at like chapter 2 or 3 where the fangs come out so to speak and then get flashbacks? I don't know. Structure is hard.

- I've been calling my story vampire yaoi because it's got two dudes, one of whom is a vampire, and they kiss while they have adventures (which entirely revolve around them being different 'species', really - no "storming the castle" type stuff here) and try to make their relationship work. A friend jokingly told me that if my characters are not riding on horseback shirtless a lot, it's not yaoi. In more serious language, she said that based on my description, it doesn't sound like yaoi. So, my question is: are there any guides for trying to figure out what genre the story is? I suppose you could say mine's maybe a general YA romp, but the romance element is far heavier than a typical YA book (well, maybe not Twilight). So maybe it's supernatural romance and the fact it's a man-on-man romance is not enough to get to the yaoi?

- I've made my story [[http://pastebin.com/eiMBRWnW][pass the bechdel test]], but I'm not sure if it's enough, especially because at the end of the dialogue I mention one of the two main (male) characters.

- My personal failing: now I've put my story onto google docs, I'm constantly going through and adding "comments" of things I want to edit and change rather than actually spending time editing and changing things.
