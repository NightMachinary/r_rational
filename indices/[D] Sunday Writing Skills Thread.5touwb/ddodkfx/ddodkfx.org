From past conversations, I think I've picked up a general sentiment that writers find it hard to accurately judge their own work.

Is this generally accurate, or is it just that people who don't have difficulty judging their own work feel no need to comment on it?

Okay, since for the moment I'm apparently alone in here, I'll get on with it.

I have an idea for a fun experiment that would give a rough idea of whether a typical writer is prone to over/under-estimating their own work, and, more relevantly to the participants, how much they themselves over/under-estimate their own work. However, it would require enough effort on the part of enough people that this would basically need to be an epidemic for enough people to want to put in the (not insignificant) effort to make the experiment worthwhile.

So, if the people I've been talking to are just outliers who stick out because they're outliers, obviously the idea is pointless.

That being said, if a medium-sized group of writers took a body of work, including one by each writer (and possibly some third-party, though each additional one could well lead to more reading on everyone's part if it isn't especially well-known), privately ranked them best-to-worst, and then revealed the listings, it'd paint a really interesting picture, immune to the tendency of ideas to converge when discussed.

For example, if everyone else's list puts Alice between fifth and seventh, but she put herself third, she now has an idea both of how good she is (because she has works that have been judged equivalent to hers - of course this is contingent on accuracy) and of how much she's overestimating herself. And, naturally, if Betty put herself dead last and everyone else put her middle-of-the-pack, she knows that she's underestimating herself.

...

Anyway, if four-five people want to try this, that'd probably be enough to get a decent effect, provided we add in something like a half-dozen third-party stories to fill out the numbers. The ideal would be if everyone had already read the same stuff and just had to read the other participants' work, but realistically (and since we'll have to use stuff of comparable quality, which is going to be much less universal) we'd all have to read a bit of mid-tier fiction.
