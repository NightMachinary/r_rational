I'd be happy to do it, but there'd probably have to be a word limit. I'd be able to read, say, ten 3-5,000 word samples over the course of a week or so.

Equally, I wouldn't want to "inflict" 30,000 words of my stuff on anyone, especially if it meant having to potentially read 30,000 words of something of comparable quality.
