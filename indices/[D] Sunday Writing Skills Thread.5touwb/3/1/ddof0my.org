It's hard in general to evaluate how people with very different information, or really, very different models/ideas about what's going on from you will evaluate the same surface observation, and the same is true of writing. I'm pretty sure most writers have some difficulty with it; that's what beta readers, editors, and friendly neighborhood redditors are for.
