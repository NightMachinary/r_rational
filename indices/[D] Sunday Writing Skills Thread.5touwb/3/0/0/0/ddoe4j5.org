Thinking out loud - it might be hard to control for things like genre. People would have to try and be impartial, so that way a randomly chosen My Little Pony fanfiction would be held out on its merits the same way something "high prestige" like HPMoR or a generic sci-fi story would be. People might be inclined to rank on the quality of the /story/ rather than the quality of the /writing/.

I guess you could do subcategories: overall, story/plot, writing, spelling/grammar, level of rationality, "want to read more of this", "similar to the sort of thing I already like". Wouldn't make rating much harder, but would be more useful feedback to the authors.
