I roleplay more than I write (and in fact a lot of my story comes from roleplayed skeletons), and I find it's very common. Me and my partner say that the cause of this is the characters and situations being /real/, having actual motivations and not being puppets on strings that perform what we want to see.

The way we deal with it is we let it happen. Usually, the end result is better for it even if that's not clear at the time.

(For example, in my vampire/human romance, the characters end up breaking up. I pictured an argument over whether slavery is a good idea resulting in the human raising his hands in the air and declaring that the vampire was stupid and cold and the breakup happening immediately and relatively explosively. Roleplaying it out we realised the characters actually care for each other and are nice to each other, so the conversation ended with some animosity but no breakup, and then the human thought it over for a week before finally deciding to declare the breakup. This is better, even if you lose the dramatic "THAT IS IT, WE ARE DONE, I DON't WANT TO SEE YOU EVER AGAIN" scene, it actually makes more sense overall since Real Breakups Don't Work That Way).

I wrote another scene where everything kind of went off on a tangent. I just deleted it and wrote it again, changing the initial conditions slightly. That was enough to make the conversation more closely resemble what I wanted.

Hope that's helpful!
