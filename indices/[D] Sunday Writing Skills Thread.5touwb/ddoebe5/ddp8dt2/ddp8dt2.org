I've had similar thoughts about dreams, actually, but from the opposite direction. My impression is that when your dreams invoke a certain emotion, let's say fear, it cobbles together things you fear and tries to present them in a coherent fashion, but actually cheats and doesn't let you evaluate your reaction but instead just enforces the feeling of fear.

So you'd be hiding, afraid of something and feeling trapped, but when you wake up you realize you totally should've been able to escape easily, or the thing you were hiding from wasn't even /worth/ hiding from in the first place. But your dream cheated and told you that you were feeling afraid and trapped anyways.

So what I think is that your imagination's cheating there, with that scene you can see the emotions of so clearly. Your brain cobbles together the core pieces of the scene and, from your desires, cheats and tells you that it's actually dramatic and tense and witty, even though as it is the scene isn't as dramatic, tense, or witty and if you write it down you'll quickly notice the difference between the scene's actual quality and what your brain told you.

Of course, I have no certifications in this sort of thing at all, so my speculation on dreams may be entirely, eye-rollingly wrong, but so far it seems to match what I've seen.
