Wow, thank you so much for taking the time to read the chapter and to give me such wonderful, detailed feedback!

You're right that it's not softcore erotica, so maybe yaoi is the wrong word. Ah well, that's details!! I need to get this bloody thing in a state that resembles finished.

What do you propose instead of pastebin? The entire thing is on google docs at the moment - I can PM you a link if you'd be interested in honouring me with more in-depth feedback as I rip this thing apart and tape it all back together (what it feels like I'm doing at the moment. Passages need to be put in different places where they'd fit better, it all needs to be massaged and put into place, etc).

On the subject of prolog / vampire's point of view / etc, my first draft of the chapter was from the Australian vampire's point of view, but I wrote it on like 4 hours sleep and wasn't terribly happy with it. Also, I realised that if you enter a vampire's head for this story, all of a sudden it becomes less romantic and more... exploitative. So I switched to the human's. But maybe I should lean into how horrific the vampire's "love" for the human /actually/ is? How he can make these huge, grand, sweeping gestures but at the same time not particularly care if the human lives or dies? How the human feels like he's the centre of the vampire's universe, but really he's a tiny detour in a 1500 year long jaunt through the best the planet has to offer? (Ultimately, the vampire ends up falling in love in the truest sense of the word, and 1000 years from now they're both vampires, together, living in a spaceship or whatever; but the first decades of their relationship are more like the affection one has for a pet than for an equal)

But it does mention the opera, the romantic notion, etc. Perhaps it's a better viewpoint, even if it's less polished, prose-wise. (I feel it REALLY DUMPS exposition, like WAY TOO HARD. An easy fix, though). And I /do/ rotate the viewpoint of the story just a little, so I could potentially formalise this and have the viewpoints alternate with the chapters....

Anyway, here it is, on the evil pastebin: [[http://pastebin.com/kdRXTkME]]
