No probs.

You shouldn't call it yaoi for the same reason you shouldn't call a movie about the personal and societal difficulties faced by a polyamorous relationship of people of different ethnicities an interracial gangbang. ...If that helps to explain.

Pastebin is fine, I just hate reading on it. It's not a big deal.

This first draft from the vampire's perspective is kind of like the other draft: I like it up until the two main characters meet. Maybe if I was looking for gay erotica and had the expectation of gay erotica I'd be intrigued, but I'd then be ultimately disappointed by the lack of gay erotica.

Why does their meeting bore me? Making because it's not communicated why I should be interested. There's a bit of gay in the way the vampire admire's the guy's naked chest, but I know there isn't going to be gay erotica, and I'm not looking for it anyway, which might mean I'm not the target audience. But aside from the hint of gay...why should I care about their meeting? Because they're the main characters? Because /you/ know why their relationship is actually really interesting? It feels sort of arbitrary. I just don't feel the cause-and-effect in the vampire's interest - why is he stopping and talking to this human? Because his mind is on romance and this is the first hunk he saw? Then why does he invite him to be his porter and not, say, proposition him for sodomy?

Ah, so here's what it is: when your main characters are talking to each other, I'm not immersed in the viewpoint character's perspective. In the beginning, before they meet, I am immersed in the viewpoint character's perspective, and that's why the story is pretty readable and engaging early on and drops off /instantly/ when the characters meet. This is true for me for both versions of the first chapter, by the way.

So why does the story lose the immersion when they meet? Probably because their internal logic doesn't have them behave at all the way they do when they meet. It probably doesn't have them meet at all. It's not /what happens./ It's what you want to happen. But in the story-as-real-events, it doesn't happen. That's my guess, anyway.

This is a really hard problem to solve, by the way. I struggle with it more than any other, actually. The clash between the ideas you get in your head and what ends up being true when you actually try to write it...that's my bane. I don't have a solution, sorry.

  How the human feels like he's the centre of the vampire's universe, but really he's a tiny detour in a 1500 year long jaunt through the best the planet has to offer?

Watch "Story for Steven" and then "We Need to Talk." Also, just watch /Steven Universe/. Hitler didn't.

He was too busy posting on pastebin.

/but seriously pastebin is fine/
