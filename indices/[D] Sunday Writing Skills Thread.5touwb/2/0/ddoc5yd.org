I like the very start. It's immersive, gets us into the character's head. People are interested in themselves, so if I'm immersed in the main character's perspective, then I probably like him. Things like the transition from the second paragraph to the third paragraph do interrupt that a bit though.

The writing's good, if a tad inconsistent, but that hardly matters at this stage and is to be expected. For me, though, it just lost my interest around the time the "Australian" guy showed up. I couldn't find a clear hook or point of tension. The only thing that qualifies is that the guy is apparently a deserter, but what is the threat? That this guy is onto him and will blackmail him into being his porter? It just doesn't feel that way.

The "Australian" guy, the vampire, I assume, has some secrets, presumably, but I have no sense of why I should be interested in those secrets. /You/ know. But I don't. Compare to, say, Quirrell's secrets about his zombie status or his history with Dumbledore, which have direct, demonstrated relevance to things Harry experiences.

Here's the real thing, I think: your hook is that a vampire and a human have a gay old time together. But there's no mention of vampires in this chapter. Were there any clues? I didn't read too carefully; the typical reader won't. Your description of a vampire who "finishing watching an opera about a human-vampire romance and in a flight of romantic fancy deciding he'd like to spend a decade or two courting a human" sounds really interesting. I'd like to read that story. But your first chapter doesn't give me that /at all/.

The story starts where it starts. If you find yourself reaching for prologues when you realize your first chapter isn't working, that suggests to me (based on my own experience doing the same thing) a certain lack of detailed, object-level understanding of the appeal of the story and how to transmit that appeal in prose. Gay vampire who thinks he's living in a novel and deserter soldier gaying it up together in WWII Europe is exciting. Why does the first chapter deny me that? Give it to me. I want it.

Expectations are really, really important for a story. In a sense, storytelling is about making promises and then delivering on them - that is, setting up expectations and then satisfying them. If you tell me this is a vampire yaoi story, I'm expecting softcore erotica. If it's actually a YA adventure with a heavy relationship/romance theme, then that's very different. There's such a thing as a teasing hook, but...look at HPMOR, some people felt they were being promised a story about Harry doing science at magic and uncovering its secrets, and they didn't get it, and they complained about it to the end of and after the story. As for what the genre story is, only you know. What does it seem similar to? It's not even that important; you can query multiple agents.

Passing the Bechdel test doesn't matter. It's interesting on a society-wide basis when many/most mainstream books, films, and TV shows don't pass it, but passing it doesn't make a story good or feminist /at all/, and failing to pass it doesn't make a story bad or not feminist at all. (E.g. a story that only has one character, a female, won't pass the test even if it's amazingly good and extremely feminist.)

Fun fact, Hitler actually posted his first draft of /Mein Kampf/ on pastebin. Remember, if you post on pastebin, you post with Hitler.
