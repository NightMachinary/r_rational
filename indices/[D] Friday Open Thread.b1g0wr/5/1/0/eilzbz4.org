Wow, that was a great read. I agree with pretty much everything written and I wouldn't be surprised if my HBS rejection occurred because I ended up in the wrong bucket.

My personal experience mirrors what's described in the article too. My test scores say I'm "smart", but the only reason I'm even on the path to applying to ultra-elite schools is because I lucked out and ended up with an ultra-elite SO. Without being pulled into that elite circle by my SO, I would almost certainly still be living an unexceptional life in flyover country.

The US really isn't as much of a meritocracy as its citizens would like to think.
