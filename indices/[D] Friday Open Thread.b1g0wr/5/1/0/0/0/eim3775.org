That constitutes such a proposition. I'm mostly worried that it will have all the same problems that got politics banned here in the first place, namely people being complete doinks about it and the subject generating absolutely enormous negative utility for this sub in exchange for very minimal positive utility for anyone involved. But if we /don't/, then I worry people will just post stuff anyway, and I'll have to be spending my free time removing it. And generally speaking, I find online discussions of politics to be bad for my mental health.

(I don't think it would be controversial to say that [[/u/eaturbrainz]] was at least part of the problem, especially modding while arguing with people, and he's gone now, so maybe it would be better, but I'm very hesitant.)

I should also note that [[http://discord.gg/rational][the discord]] has a #politics channel, though I have it muted and so can't recommend it (you'd have to see for yourself). And politics seems better discussed asynchronously with more time-per-message anyway, at least to me.

Give me a week to think about it, then ping me again? I'll put a note in my calendar in case you don't. I'm leaning "against" right now, mostly because of bad experiences in the past, both with politics in this sub in general, and with quarantine of topics (rather than outright bans).
