There are a couple of negative effects I've seen in other places:

- Quarantine is fine as a line in the sand, but some people will still disobey the quarantine, meaning that there's still some work involved.
- Quarantines attract people who desperately want whatever the quarantined thing is, and I can tell you right now that I don't want to attract anyone to this sub if what they want is political discussion, especially not since there are so many outlets for that in so many other places, and so much of the discussion quickly turns toxic.
- Toxicity can spill out of quarantine fairly easily. If two people get into a pissing match in quarantine, it's very easy for that to bleed out into other subjects, producing drama and ill will that I don't want.
- Quarantine zones are ripe for targeting, either toward this sub, toward mods, or toward users. (I would care much less about that if discussion of the quarantined subject were something that were core to the function/purpose of this subreddit.)
