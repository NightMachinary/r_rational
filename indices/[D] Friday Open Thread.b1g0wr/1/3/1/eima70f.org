  I'm planning on getting [anti-reflective coating] for my next pair of eyeglasses.
#+end_quote

Don't.

I've worn glasses since I was 5 years old. For 25 years I've gotten out of bed in the morning, put on my glasses, and not taken them off again until I got back in bed (except for bathing/showering (and swimming and riding roller coasters, but those aren't part of a bog-standard day)). I've had many severals of pairs of glasses in my life.

Due to /circumstances/, I got a new pair in the spring of 2009 and then didn't get another new pair until about 5 months ago. That's almost a decade's difference. Anti-reflective coating was not common at that time, and I got them at my optometrist's office where AR coating wasn't being "pushed" because they knew it wasn't for everyone, it was more like a film coating and it was likely to flake and peel off. Over the last decade, it's evolved into ionization and blasting the lenses with electrons to create a layer of magnesium (I think) particles that's bonded to the surface of the lenses and only a few molecules thick.

Sounds fancy schmancy, right?

I recentlyish recovered a memory from age 6, after having gotten my second ever pair of glasses. They told me about cleaning the glasses, how I shouldn't use my shirt or spit or kleenex or whatever else people use, and that the "cleaning cloth and cleaning spray" didn't cut it as an exclusive, and that at least once a day or once every few days I should wash my glasses with mild soap and lukewarm water. I was 6. I think I did that for maybe like a week and then went back to wiping my glasses on my shirt. I think I noticed that the lenses had little scratches all over them, but anyone who has glasses probably knows that you don't really see those scratches once the glasses are on your face.

I forgot about the "washing the glasses with soap" thing until 5 months ago when I got my first new pair of glasses in a decade.

I got them from Walmart. They "upsold" me. They told me that they could tell that my then-current glasses (a decade old, from before AR was a commonplace thing) had AR coating, and that I didn't /need/ to get it but that it's one of those things that you'll miss once you don't have it anymore. So I got the AR coating. I thought Wally World had given me screwed-up glasses (it had been a decade, and I had forgotten that switching to a new pair of glasses has a qualitative wibbly wobbly weirdness to it while your eyes get used to focusing through a different prescription in differently-shaped lenses). I also noticed a weird green reflection on the back of my lenses in my peripheral vision. So I went home and started doing research immediately, and learned about AR coating.

That's when I found out that Wally World straight up lied to me, that my last pair did /not/ have AR coating. People make a big deal about AR glasses being clearer so other people can see your eyes, but I swear that the green reflection on the lenses is like something out of an anime, the very first thing I thought when I got home and started examining myself in the mirror was "why in the bloody hell does the entire surface of these lenses turn green when light hits them at a certain angle?" I also found out that AR lenses are extraordinarily easy to scratch, even if you get "scratch resistant" AR coating.

Luckily I did this research before the first time I ever cleaned them. The "cleaning spray" might contain ammonia and/or alcohol (I can't find a definitive answer - regardless of how I ask Google, she just keeps giving me the same list of "how to make homemade glasses cleaner" and "we sell glasses cleaner, please purchase it from us" and "how to clean your glasses"). Both of those ingredients will break down the AR coating over time and make the world look foggy, owing to being coated in a prismatic rainbow sheen (like the way oil on pavement looks).

So I rediscovered the "cleaning glasses with soap and water" thing. Went out and bought a microfiber cloth to dry them with.

I've treated these glasses more delicately than any other pair of glasses I've owned in the last 25 years, taking great pains to clean them in the most gentle manner I've ever done (the last few months for those 10-year-old glasses I'd been wearing, I just folded up some toilet paper and wiped them down with that (my shirt had stopped working, there was just a permanent grease smear that only got cleared up with TP, presumably from a decade of never washing them with soap and water); TP is a product made of wood, and if you clean AR glasses with toilet paper you might have to get a new pair of glasses).

Even treating them delicately, after having the glasses less than a week, I cleaned them with soap and water, then got the microfiber cloth out of its package to dry them off, and I pulled the microfiber cloth away and noticed a smudge near the middle of the left lense, and I held it up to the light and the smudge was a little cluster of scratches, looking very similar to the little clusters of scratches that I would anticipate accumulating on a pair of glasses after a few years of wear. Apparently, just the most wee little smidgeon of dust on the cloth was enough to scratch the lenses to bits. Since then, I now use the cloth to pat the lenses dry rather than rubbing the lenses with the cloth.

It is straight up /ridiculous/ for a pair of glasses to be /that/ high maintenance for so little benefit. Sure, if there's a light behind you then you won't see its reflection, but you'll see a big green glare. Sure, other people can see your eyes just a little bit less obstructed by light reflections, but situations causing those light reflections on normal glasses are going to cause the green glare. It's almost like the only real benefit to AR is that they look better in photographs that were taken with a flash.

Also, I wore the glasses while wearing a VR headset and now there's a centimeter-long scratch in a straight vertical line on each of the lenses almost directly in front of my pupils, so it doesn't matter how clean the lenses are, I've still got a smudge right in the center of my vision. I'm going to wait 6 months just in case I ruin my glasses and have to get new ones, to ensure I get my money's worth out of these, but eventually I'm going to go to an auto shop and get some sort of chemical goop I read about a few months ago and use it to remove the AR coating from my glasses. The coating is /microscopically/ thin. It takes next to /nothing/ to scratch them.
