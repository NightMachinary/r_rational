I just got back from an eye exam, and apparently I'm near-sighted. I've known this for a few years now (just barely passed my last driver's exam eye test), but finally went in to have my eyes checked. I'm a little bit excited about having glasses, in the hopes that they'll make me look distinguished and intelligent, but this is a new world for me.

Any particular tips? They'll probably only be on when I'm trying to use the living room computer on the big screen, or when driving.
