Do you mind if I ask why you don't intend to wear your glasses all the time?

I don't understand why anyone would choose not to always have good vision.

As for tips: Designate a space where you put your glasses every evening when you go to sleep. Looking for your glasses really, really sucks when you need them to actually see anything.

Alternatively, or preferably additionally, get a pair of back-up and/or sports glasses. Sooner or later you will lose or destroy your main pair. Don't be like me and wander around France blind as a bat because your only pair of glasses fell into the sea on the second day of a two week excursion.

Consider getting an ultrasonic cleaner for 30 bucks or so. You might get your lenses clean without it (though probably not that gloriously clean), but removing the gunk sticking to the nose pads is a pain without it.

Speaking of the nose pads: they will turn green and/or yellow after a while. Apparently that's because the material they are made of is porous and prone to sucking up all the oils and lotions it can get its greedy little openings on. Here in Germany most shops will replace them for free, though I have no idea how the rest of the world handles it.

Take a couple of minutes to work out how to open and put on your glasses quickly and while using only one hand. Not only does it look cool (it really doesn't), it can also save you time and grief in emergencies.

Though from the sound of it most, if not all, of these tips will only become relevant once your eyesight has deteriorated a bit more.
