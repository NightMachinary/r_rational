  Sooner or later you will lose or destroy your main pair.

Really? I started wearing glasses at age 5, and in the last 25 years I've literally /never/ lost a single pair of glasses.

I destroyed a pair in 7th grade. They were the "bendable" titanium frames. During break/recess/whatever at school, I twisted them to show off their "bendability" and snapped them clean in half.

  Don't be like me and wander around France blind as a bat because your only pair of glasses fell into the sea on the second day of a two week excursion.

I mean, were your glasses not fitted correctly? Sounds like the stems were too long if they just slipped right off your face. I just now looked directly at the ground and shook my head /violently/ back and forth and up and down and around and around, and they're still attached to my face pretty firmly.

When I was a kid, I often got glasses that had stems that were one 5mm increment longer than what would've fit me during fitting - because childrens be growin', yo - so I always took them off before riding roller coasters, but after attaining my adult size as a teenager - and the consistently-sized head that accompanies your adult size - my glasses began to fit from purchase to grave / "drawer full of old glasses I refuse to throw away." I've worn at least the last three or four pairs of glasses I've owned on some of the tallest and fastest roller coasters in the US, and they stayed attached to my face pretty firmly. I mean, I haven't worn my newest pair of glasses on a roller coaster, but the pair before that and the pair before that and the pair before that (which I got at ages 15, 17, and 19), yeah, those got thoroughly tested.

There's three numbers printed somewhere on your glasses (unless your glasses are a few years old and the numbers have rubbed off). Width of the lenses, width of the nose bridge, and length of the stems/arms/earpieces. That last one's the most important for this discussion. It'll likely be either 135mm or 140mm or 145mm. The next time you get glasses and are trying on frames, disregard the style for a moment and look for those numbers, and try on all the different stem lengths to see how they fit. The width of the bridge and the lenses are important as well, because your pupils should be centered in the middle of the lenses.

TL;DR: Loss or destruction of glasses is neither an inevitability nor a common universal experience. Glasses don't just fall off your face, and if they do that means they haven't been properly fitted (if you don't already, it's a good idea to try having an actual fitting done at an actual optometrist's office rather than going to lenscrafters or Walmart or ordering them offline - if you /do/ already, maybe find a new optometrist).

I can't stress this enough. Glasses that have been properly fitted by a professional shouldn't move on your face unless /you/ move them.
