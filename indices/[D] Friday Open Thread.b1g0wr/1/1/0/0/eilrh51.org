As someone who /tried/ doing this when I first got my glasses, it usually ends up as way more trouble than it's worth to swap back and forth. What I found is that I had habituated myself to not having perfect vision, and avoided doing tasks that would require it. So when I got my glasses, I found myself using them even for cases I didn't need them before. Add to that the fact that, when going out for the day, I needed to take them with me in the event that I had use for them, and the most convenient place to store glasses for occasional use happened to be my face.

If you have computer-induced nearsightedness, chances are your vision will eventually deteriorate to where mine is at, where everything /works/ without glasses, just with an extra layer of annoyance. I could go without them just fine - I spend most of my time indoors too - but it feels a little slimy and imprecise, like having a coating of grease on your hands.
