Whether I spend time outside depends on the season. In the spring, summer, and fall, it's probably four to six hours outside with my son. Unfortunately, I live in northern Minnesota, and not only are the daylight hours shorter than elsewhere, "winter" starts early and lasts a lot longer.

My eye doctor said that it was probably just me getting older (I'm 33).
