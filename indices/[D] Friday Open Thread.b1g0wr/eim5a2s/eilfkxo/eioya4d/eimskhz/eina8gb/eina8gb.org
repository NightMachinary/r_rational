I've been playing a card game called Faeria for months now after Hearthstone had become too much money-sink and I couldn't play the decks I wanted to play. However, Faeria didn't have that problem and it had quickly become my favorite CCG due to several other reasons. It has beautiful artstyle, requires more tactic and planning ahead than other CCGs due to its unique living board, gives you all the cards in an expansion with 100% guarantee if you buy them. All in all, I'm pretty passionate about this game and realized it's currently on sale, so I thought I'd do some "subtle" advertising here.

It's [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/397060/Faeria/][on Steam]] and this weekend it's free to play. So, try it out and if it strikes your fancy, remember it's on 50% sale ;)
