Okay. To make it very brief, HOURS after the recent terror attack in New Zealand, an Australian senator made extremely insensitive remarks (so much so that when I read the statement I assumed it was poorly done satire). It essentially said that allowing Muslims to immigrate into New Zealand was the cause of the attack, and ended with a bible verse, among other terrible things.

He was not popular for this, and to put it in context, this senator is from a very conservative part of a very conservative state, and he got elected after two or three senators were kicked out of the senate for being ineligible (there are somewhat esoteric rules about what qualifies you to be a senator in Australia - for example, as a civil servant, I wouldn't qualify - and they are not thoroughly checked, so a few years ago it was discovered that a bunch of senators were ineligible due to being dual citizens of other countries without knowing it, so a bunch of senators had to resign). So this guy ended up being the guy who ended up being eligible, despite having very few votes.

He was a member of the One Nation party, which is one of our numerous third parties (we have preferential voting and thriving third parties, who always get one senate seat, and we've recently had the most popular third party have a house of representatives seat, proving the system works, or something). One Nation is one of the more whackadoo parties but also one of the more mainstream parties: it is unapologetically racist, and not just in the way that most conservative candidates are racist, but they literally want to close immigration to non-whites. Sadly, One Nation is popular in the conservative/racist areas of the country. However, this guy was ultimately kicked out of that party /for being too conservative/. He joined another, even more conservative, even more fringe party, and was kicked out of that party too, so now he's independent. When he was sworn in to parliament, his opening speech was extremely racist and even referenced the Nazi final solution.

So with that background out of the way, we come to EGGBOI, an Australian legend. "Eggboy", a 17 year old, attended a political event this politician was holding, and he took an egg with him. He stood behind him filming on his camera and he smushed the egg into the back of the senator's head. Following that, the senator hit (or attempted to hit?) Eggboy twice, and then ~5 men tackled Eggboy to the ground. Eggboy was arrested but released without being charged.

He is now being praised as a national hero on social media as the senator is extremely unpopular for the recent remarks. Several Australian bands (e.g. Hilltop Hoods) have offered Eggboy free tickets to their shows for life.

Meanwhile, our Prime Minister (from our mainstream conservative party) has said that he thinks the senator should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law for hitting Eggboy.

And that's the story! I hope you enjoyed it.
