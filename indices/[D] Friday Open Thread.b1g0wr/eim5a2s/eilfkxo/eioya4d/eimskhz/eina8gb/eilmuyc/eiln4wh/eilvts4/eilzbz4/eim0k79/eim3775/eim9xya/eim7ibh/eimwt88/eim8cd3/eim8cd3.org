So have ultra strict rules. Maybe have it set up so that a couple of the biggest news events from the last few weeks are the topic of discussion instead of letting people just say whatever about whatever.

I don't /really/ care about that. What I'm most concerned about is the fact that I went to say something along the lines of "I support people like Sanders and Warren and Ocasio-Cortez [a statement of fact] because they're some of the only people in office who recognize the validity of the issues we're talking about [also a statement of fact]" (presumably it would've been more needlessly wordy than that because I guess that's just how I roll), and I realized that making that statement of fact would be a violation of the rules. I didn't particularly like that.
