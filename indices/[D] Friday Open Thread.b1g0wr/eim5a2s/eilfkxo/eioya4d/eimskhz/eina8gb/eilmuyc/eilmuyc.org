I'm still waiting for the conclusion of my rather disappointing application cycle.

As HLS is my final hope I've spent a lot of time obsessing about law schools. I even created a website to visualize outcomes of applicants based off of their stats: [[https://www.lawschooldata.org/school/applicants?cycle_id=16&school=Harvard+University]]

The site is my first experience developing something with a user-facing front end, and has been well received, so at least I got a good learning experience out of the whole ordeal.

The recent college admissions scandals also make me super salty as I view my admissions results as underperforming my stats/background.
