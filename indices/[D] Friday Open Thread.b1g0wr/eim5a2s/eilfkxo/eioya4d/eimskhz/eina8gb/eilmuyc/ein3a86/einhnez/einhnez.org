There are several essays in there on why the optimal number of levels is 0, and that we should embrace anarcho-capitalism. They aren't necessarily true, but they are well written and thought provoking opinions that I haven't often seen argued for elsewhere. I think it'd be particularly a good read for you too since you seem to be taking it for granted that governments should be large.
