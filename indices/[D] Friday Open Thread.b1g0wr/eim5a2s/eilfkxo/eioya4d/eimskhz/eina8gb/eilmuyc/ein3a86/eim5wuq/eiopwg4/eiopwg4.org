I'm not sure how long you're talking about, as I'm not familiar with locksley hall. These are probably shorter than what you're looking for, but at [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/03/14/gwerns-ai-generated-poetry/][SSC]], I found a link to 1) an article about making a bot that [[https://www.gwern.net/RNN-metadata#finetuning-the-gpt-2-small-transformer-for-english-poetry-generation][generates poetry,]] and 2) [[https://www.gwern.net/docs/ai/2019-03-06-gpt2-poetry-1000samples.txt][1000 samples from it]].
