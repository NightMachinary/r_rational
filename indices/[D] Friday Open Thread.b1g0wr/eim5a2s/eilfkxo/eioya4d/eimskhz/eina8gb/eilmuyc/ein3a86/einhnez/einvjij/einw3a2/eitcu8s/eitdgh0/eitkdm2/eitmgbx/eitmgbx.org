It really depends on how you measure the economy. [[[https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/25/wage-stagnation-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/](Scott]] Alexander on Wage Stagnation). Wages have been rising. Not to mention standards have been rising as well, cars and houses and phones and just about everything is much more impressive than they were 50 years ago. Point being what you can be for 800 dollars today I'd say is a lot more impressive than what you can buy for 1600 dollars 50 years ago, and isn't that what the pie getting bigger is about?

Not to mention that libertarians are hardly happy about the course of US politics since probably about the The New Deal. The size of government has only ever been increasing.
