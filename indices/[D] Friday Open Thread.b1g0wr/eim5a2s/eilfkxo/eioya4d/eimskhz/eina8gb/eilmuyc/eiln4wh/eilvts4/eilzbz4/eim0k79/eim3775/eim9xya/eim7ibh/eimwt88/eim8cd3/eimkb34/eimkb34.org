Well, really, the /actual/ rules are "don't piss off alexanderwales" and "don't make enough of a mess that alexanderwales needs to intervene".

This is a small subreddit, so you can get away with bending the rules a little; I think everyone's fine with off-mentions of US politics, like the one above. It becomes a problem when someone becomes known for repeatedly bashing the same group, or when you have huge debates that go into chains of "No, YOU are slightly misinterpreting the things I'm saying to cast them in an uncharitable light that isn't representative of my main point!"

(keep in mind, this is not legal advice, and I cannot be held responsible if you end up banned for life because of me)

But seriously, if you want long-form politics discussion from the rational community, [[/r/rational][r/rational]] isn't really the place.
