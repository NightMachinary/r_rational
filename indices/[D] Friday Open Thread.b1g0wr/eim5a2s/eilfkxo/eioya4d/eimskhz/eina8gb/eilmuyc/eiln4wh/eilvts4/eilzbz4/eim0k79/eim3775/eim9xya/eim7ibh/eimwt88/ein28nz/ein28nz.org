Y'know, even now I still sometimes forget that this sub is nothing but rational fiction outside of the Friday thread. Like, when I found this sub at the end of 2016 I scrolled through it occasionally looking for interesting threads, and it wasn't until a few months later that I realized that 90% of the threads were fic recommendations or discussion of a fic or whatever. Part of my brain just never got the memo, I guess. There really is literally zero reason why this subreddit in particular would have a thread dedicated to the discussion of politics. What a brain fart.

Still. I feel like the "whatsoever" part of the rule is a bit overkill.

[[/u/alexanderwales]], you don't need a week to think about it, it doesn't make a lick of sense as a part of this subreddit, it was just a stupid idea my brain spat out while it was confused.

EDIT: Changed "spit" to "spat."
