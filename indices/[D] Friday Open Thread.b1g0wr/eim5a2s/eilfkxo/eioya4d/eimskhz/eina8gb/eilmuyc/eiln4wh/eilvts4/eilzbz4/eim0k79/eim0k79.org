  The US really isn't as much of a meritocracy as its citizens would like to think.

One of the many reasons I've been a fan of Sanders and Warren since 2011.

[This does not constitute discussion of US politics because no one can prove I wasn't talking about Colonel Sanders and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1plPyJdXKIY][Warren G]].]

While I'm here... [[/u/alexanderwales]], how would one go about proposing the creation of a bi-weekly or monthly "discussion of US politics" thread for the upcoming election season in a few months? Or does my pinging you here constitute such a proposition?
