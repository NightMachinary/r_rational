Hmm, looks interesting, but I think I'll be sticking to MTG Arena. It's incredibly hard to top Magic, especially now that it actually has an online version that doesn't look like it was coded by the team that brought us the original healthcare.gov (And doesn't require the fiscal outlay of the paper version). Progression is pretty decent, specific decks are easy to save for with just wildcard drops, and the free packs round out your collection nicely, but most importantly, it's just so much better balanced than most of it's competitors. Wizards has been doing this for a long time, and it really shows. So many interesting deck options.
