  So if I'm going to be spending large amounts of time not getting any (or marginal) benefit from wearing glasses, it doesn't seem to make sense to wear them, except out of habit or the need to be able to have far sight at a moment's notice.

Personally I find that carrying glasses and having to find or pick them up when I need them to be more trouble than it is to keep them on.

BTW do you spend a lot of time outside ? Recent studies have shown that the rise in the frequency of nearsightedness is directly correlated to a decrease in sun exposure and time spent outside.. This is worrisome because if the number of people that are nearsighted increases, the number of people that have it so severe as to be considered blind also increases.
