Thank you for your thoughtful and detailed advice.

The problem with that particular pair of glasses wasn't the fit, though. It was that I decided to splurge and got the ultra light-weight rimless glasses. Which was great, until we took a boat trip and an unexpectedly violent gust of wind from diagonally behind me ripped them off of my face and cast them into the ocean.

I haven't actually lost another pair after that, but I have had them destroyed or otherwise made un-useable or inaccessible in the mean-time, be it through my own actions or circumstances beyond my control.

You're right that my claim of inevitability was exaggerated. On the other hand, just being careful is not enough to ensure your constant and uninterrupted access to any particular pair of glasses.
