  Do you mind if I ask why you don't intend to wear your glasses all the time?

Per the eye exam, I'm only mildly near-sighted, and my vision within about three or four feet is as good as it can be, glasses or not. Roughly 95% of what I do that needs vision occurs within that range (cooking, reading, writing, playing with my son, general hygiene), and wouldn't be improved by wearing glasses. Beyond that range is where I run into trouble. So if I'm going to be spending large amounts of time not getting any (or marginal) benefit from wearing glasses, it doesn't seem to make sense to wear them, except out of habit or the need to be able to have far sight at a moment's notice.
