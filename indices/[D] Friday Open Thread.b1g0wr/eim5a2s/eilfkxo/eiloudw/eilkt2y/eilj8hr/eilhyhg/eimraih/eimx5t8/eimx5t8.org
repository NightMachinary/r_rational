My first pair of glasses were [[https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2017/02/01/rimmed-glasses/coastal.w710.h473.2x.jpg][thin metal wire frames]]. They broke within months, as did the second pair and so on until I got a pair of [[https://www.visionworks.com/images/product/1278110/12781103Q_raw_lg.jpg][thick, plastic glasses]], which lasted years. Recommend you do the same.

Frames vary widely in price for no apparent reason. I have seen $100 frames that were virtually indistinguishable from $10 frames sitting a few feet apart at Walmart's vision center. Get the cheap ones.

Don't bother with transition lenses for driving. Just buy [[https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51xQtvf9ysL._UX522_.jpg][clip-on sunglasses]].

Don't bother with cases. Easier to just carry them on at all times, or to hang them from your shirt's collar.

If you end up taking them to bed for some reason, have a night stand or something within arm's reach to place them right before you fall asleep.
