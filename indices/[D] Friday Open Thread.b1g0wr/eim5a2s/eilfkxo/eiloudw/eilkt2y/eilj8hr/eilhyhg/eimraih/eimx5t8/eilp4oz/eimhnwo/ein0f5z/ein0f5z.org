  Do not buy lenses direct from your optometrist unless you have great insurance, you will end up paying a lot more.

If this is a concern, go along with the flow - your optometrist will check your eyes and give you a new prescription, then you'll pay, then they'll take you out to be fitted for glasses and you should just let it happen. Once they figure out what fit you need, take off the glasses they've given you and look for the three numbers printed on the frames, for bridge width and lense width and stem/arm length. Then just say you aren't happy with any of the styles they have available and just leave. When you go elsewhere for your glasses, you'll have been properly fitted and know all the relevant measurements.

Brick and mortar establishments like Lenscrafters don't care (they'll try to put you in something you find attractive with a high price tag, the fitters at the optometrist should just throw random frames at your face regardless of style to find out your fit before they move on to something as trivial as style), and websites that rely on taking a picture and measuring pixels are inaccurate enough to be problematic, like, you /really/ need your pupils to be pretty much centered in the lenses, and if the bridge isn't the right width they can slide down your nose, and if the stems/arms are too long they can slide off your face, it really is kind of important to get professionally fitted.
