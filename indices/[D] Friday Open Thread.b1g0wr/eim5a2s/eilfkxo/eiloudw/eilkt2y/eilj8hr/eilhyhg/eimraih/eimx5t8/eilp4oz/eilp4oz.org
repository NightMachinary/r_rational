Do you have eye insurance? If so check your coverage details: some will cover new lenses yearly but new frames only every other year or some such. In any case never buy frames from a glasses store, unless you want to pay a ridiculous markup for some particular look. Buy the frames online and have them put the lenses in, or just buy the lens online too.
