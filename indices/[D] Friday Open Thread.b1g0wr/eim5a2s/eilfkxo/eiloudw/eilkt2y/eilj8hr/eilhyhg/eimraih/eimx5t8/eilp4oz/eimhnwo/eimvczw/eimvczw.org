I've worn glasses for most of my life and absolutely hate them, mostly for the looks and the fact that if they get broken I'm severely handicapped in outdoor life. I haven't been able to convince myself to get surgical correction due to the benefits of glasses and risks if the surgery though. Here's some positives:

You can get completely used to them: After the initial discomfort, then some awkwardness, you will forget you're wearing them entirely. I have no problem doing any exercise in mine, and can even sleep in them without a problem when needed.

Always on comfortable eye protection: Always wearing glasses means you rarely have to put on additional eyeware, and that you are used to it. Mine saved me an eye when I ran into a tree branch so hard it scratched them, and have helped far more times than I've noticed.

UV blocking: Most glasses (and contact) lenses block 100% of UV light so you can stare at the sun without wrecking your eyes! More practically this means I find direct sun and glare much less of a problem than other people, and I personally know it isn't roasting my retinas. You will still want sunglasses for comfort, but health wise they aren't necessarily.

Tips: Clean the nose pads and parts that touch your head with an astringent to avoid oil buildup and acne there.

Clean the lenses for others sake, you might get used to or forget about dirty lenses but it will bother people talking to you.

Have different lenses for: sports, casual, and formal. Sports is for durability and frequent cleaning, and you want them tighter than normal. Casual and formal for style since having a separate serious/formal looking pair really helps step it up and accent special occasions for friends.

Put on your glasses to look at things "hard", even when it isn't needed. When asked your opinion about how something looks, or a paper make sure to put on your glasses. You don't need them up close, but everyone else has at least some feeling that you are entirely blind without them.
