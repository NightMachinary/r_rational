Transitional lenses are a trap. They're cool for about a week, and then you're stuck indoors with sunglasses on for ten minutes every time you go outside. They barely work in the car too since windshields tend to block UV rays, which is what activates them. Buy a regular pair and a prescription pair of sunglasses instead.

Anti glare on the other hand is a godsend if you use them at the computer.

I can recommend getting rimless frames, at least on the bottom of the frame. It makes reading much easier since there's less getting in your way.

I too once thought about only wearing them when I needed them, but you know what's more annoying than wearing glasses? Carrying a bulky case on your person with the constant threat of breaking or losing them. Like, as thick as your wallet and as big as your phone. Annoying as shit. Plus your eyes are only going to get worse from here, may as well get used to it.

If you find a frame you really like, keep in mind that the next time you update your prescription you can just use the same frames. They won't usually tell you this.

If you have an HSA, it can be used on glasses.

There's a transition period while your brain rewires to compensate for the frames and slight visual distortion of the lenses. In my experience it's 3-5 days of headaches. If it's particularly bad bring it to the attention of your optometrist, but just be aware, I guess.

Oh, and it /totally/ gives at least +2 to both sophistication and nerd cred.
