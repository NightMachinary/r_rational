I used the word 'cost' a little differently than it should have been used. I didn't mean cost as in financial cost, but as in cost of time and effort keeping the glasses clean and scratch-free. I actually work in construction now and keeping my glasses clear of dust make this a serious concern versus if I was working some sort of office job. Appreciate the warning!
