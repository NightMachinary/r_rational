I got glasses about two years ago and I have an even smaller prescription than you do (I can pass eye tests fine!), however the reason I wear glasses full time now is because once I adjusted to wearing them (took about a week), I stopped getting headaches! I used to get headaches about once a week and now it's more like every six weeks.

Also get your glasses online. I get one "free" pair per year with my health insurance, but that's only to the value of $120, which is the cheapest glasses. Getting them from zenii even after the exchange rate and shipping to Australia is like $50 for the nicest transition lenses and much more choice of frames.
