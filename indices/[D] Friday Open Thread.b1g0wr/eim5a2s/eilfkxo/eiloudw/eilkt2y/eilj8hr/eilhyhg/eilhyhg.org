A lot of people use sunglasses when driving to deal with bright sunlight, but I can't do that thanks to my glasses. So I usually rely on a baseball cap and/or open the sun visor.

Give yourself more space between your car and other people's cars when you start out driving with glasses until you adjust. This will give you more time to react to any issues.

I don't have them myself, but you can also get [[https://www.stantonoptical.com/blog/anti-reflective-lens-coating][anti-reflective (AR) eyeglass coating]]. They are supposed to be good for dealing with glare from bright lights and help with eye strain from looking at a computer screen all day. I'm planning on getting them for my next pair of eyeglasses.
