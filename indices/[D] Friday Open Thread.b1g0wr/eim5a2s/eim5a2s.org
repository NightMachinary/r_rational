Last night I was having the usual nightmare where I'm back in high school for a math test and all the formulas have slipped out of my mind, so I turn to chat with a forgotten friend-

And then it struck me. I'm /back in high school!/ Quick, uh, Apple shares, bitcoin, 9/11, Fukushima, I don't remember enough daily news to immediately prove foreknowledge but I do know a /startling/ amount of future Magic the Gathering trivia, maybe I should get vouched for by /Wizards of the Coast/...

(Then I tried to leave the classrom and spent the rest of the dream in a pointless chase scene with the math teacher. Can't win them all.)

 

On that topic: are there any good stories in which an [[http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/earthfic.shtml][earthfic]] character who goes back in time tries to accomplish goals beyond their petty personal selves? It's a popular wish-fulfilment theme, but the ones I know are either fantasy worlds or people with depressingly small-scale goals.
