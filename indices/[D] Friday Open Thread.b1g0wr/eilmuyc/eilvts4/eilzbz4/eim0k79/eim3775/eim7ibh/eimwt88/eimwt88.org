I 100% agree with this, I don't want the sort of people who love debating politics to get in here, it's completely irrelevant to rational fiction (look if someone wants to discuss the politics of rational worlds, or use the worldbuilding thread to make a perfect political system, go for it), and for people like me who aren't American it really brings a bunch of american politics we're not especially interested in, and then it starts leaking elsewhere. Hard pass, thank you!
