Eh, whatever.

Don't get anti-reflective coating on your glasses. I'm currently typing a response to [[/u/xamueljones]]'s response to your comment about glasses, but I've been working on that comment for like two hours because it was /WAY/ too long and needed to be cut down to a reasonable length, but I still might abandon that comment without posting it (I do that a lot, writing out pages and pages worth of nonsense in a single comment and then just deleting the whole thing). If I /do/ abandon it, the main point was /don't get the anti-reflective coating./

Also, think of your glasses as a prosthetic. Get out of bed, put them on, and don't take them off again until you get back in bed (obviously take them off before showering and before swimming and before riding a roller coaster). None of this "I'm only gonna wear them while driving" crap.

There will almost certainly be visual distortion. The world is going to look weird and wibbly wobbly for anywhere from a few hours to a few days (or even up to two weeks if it's your first pair), because your eyes have to adjust to focusing through them. The only way to make the wibbly wobbly stop is to wear the glasses as much as physically possible.
