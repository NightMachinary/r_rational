You could also move cities because you want a scenery change or a job change. Say you really like warm weather, but were born in Boston. You can move to Los Angelos. Or for job opportunities. Say you want to become an actor. Again, move to Hollywood. Or maybe the scenery you want is nice open farmland, some people really value fresh air and having large spacious properties.

Or maybe job opportunities change. Take someone born in Detroit in the 40s. You can start off in the automobile industry and have a great career. But after a couple decades the economy shifts and you're laid off, no fault of your own. You ought to be moving to a new city where there are different job opportunities.
