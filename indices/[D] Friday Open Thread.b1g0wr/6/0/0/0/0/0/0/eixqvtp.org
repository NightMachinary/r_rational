  In fact, moving cities for the most extremely jobless, homeless poor I would think is just the cost of one bus ticket, and isn't even too much more than that for people working unstable jobs like fast food worker and renting apartments.

You forget about social networks but I would also say that I wouldn't want people to move. It's more optimal for everyone to stay in a centralised location. The only reason you should be out of the city is if it is necessary (mine natural resources).
