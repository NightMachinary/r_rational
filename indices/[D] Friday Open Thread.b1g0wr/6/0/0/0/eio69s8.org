  Like say, if you hate the government and think their education system sucks you may be happier with a more local education system, but if you are worried about local radicals making your schools teach dumb things you may want a national one.

This example seems overwhelmingly in favour of local education systems. If you don't like your local education system, it's relatively easy to change cities. If things are set up like how many libertarians want, they'll be enough different local private schools you won't even need to move at all. If you don't like your national education system, it's a monumental task for many to change countries.
