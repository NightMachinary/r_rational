I think many libertarians take it for granted that capitalism will work in the absence of a small government the way that they believe it /should/ work, as opposed to working /optimally/ - siphoning wealth out of the general economy over time and concentrating it in the hands of a small ultra-rich elite.

A strong government is a necessary evil to actively obstruct the 0.01%, restraining them from buying said government out from under the rest of the citizens and then from using their power to siphon out even /more/ wealth until they eventually consume the entire planet.
