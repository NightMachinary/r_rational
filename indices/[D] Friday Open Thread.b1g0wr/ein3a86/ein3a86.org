Designing a perfect country: Administration

Many people fantasise about how they would improve the world were they put in charge of it, I'm sure in this subreddit we have a particular fondness for these kind of thought experiments.

One of the least interesting and yet significant is how a country is internally organised.

There is a reason we don't have a single central government that manages every aspect of government. Instead we split the government into sections each with their responsibilities, and we further subdivide that into more sections and ad addendum until we're happy.

The question I have is what is a good method for administrative divisions? How should responsibilities be divided per level?

I'm trying to imagine if I was put in charge of say the UK and they wiped it clean so there was no government anywhere and they then said divide up the current government responsibilities into appropriate areas.

In my opinion the ideal administrative system should be robust: it should be able to handle predictable future events, to do so it should be flexible, the size and shape and number of divisions on each level will likely change as people move and cities grow and shrivel. There must be mechanics for responsibilities such as public transport being able to be transferred to a single entity when for example London grows and subsumes the city). It should also be consistent and as universally applicable as possible. One area on the same level shouldn't have different responsibilities than another. That just causes unneeded complications.

Zeroth Level (technically ultimately responsible for everything): National Defence, Foreign Policy, National Infrastructure (railways?, highways?, some degrees of public transport?, how much of infrastructure is there responsibly), Education (to what extent, general guide?, management of schools directly?, standard exams?), Power, Water (?), Standards (deciding when to accept international standards or creating national ones), National Statistics? (collection devolved or maintained?), National Parks and Pollution? Healthcare?

First Level: area? population? density? number? River pollution?

Second Level:

Third Level:

How many levels?

If anyone can point me to the best place to find information and discussion on the optimal administrative system I'd love to read something like that.
