  If you don't like your local education system, it's relatively easy to change cities.

That's actually a sign of the fundamental flaws of Libertarianism. That philosophy starts from an idealized system of government, then makes some simplifying assumptions about humans in order to make that system of government work.

One of these simplifying assumptions is that humans can be modeled as something like a fluid - populations will naturally move along a gradient from less prosperous places to more prosperous places.

That's not true for a bunch of reasons. Among them:

1. It costs money to move from one place to another. If you're already in a shitty place, you're not going to have as much money.
2. It costs "spoons" (or mental energy) to move from one place to another. If you're already in a shitty situation, you're not likely to have the willpower to make the move.
3. Moving will destroy your social network. Generic Appalachian Town might suck and there's no jobs, but at least Aunt Mary and Cousin Joe and your best friend Rob are nearby. (btw this is also why areas like "Little Italy" or "Chinatown" form - if you can move somewhere and slot in to an already existing social network, you're a lot more likely to be successful)
4. Moving requires information. If you move somewhere because there's no jobs in your area, and then it turns out there's no jobs in the new place too, you're extra fucked.

The net effect is literally what you see in the USA now: mobility for the upper-middle class, stagnation and quiet despair for everyone economically below them.
