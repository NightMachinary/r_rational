I think many libertarians do believe that you're going to end up with a few ultra-rich elite. They just believe everyone else is going to be wealthier too because wealth is not a zero-sum game. Who cares if 0.1% of the population controls 50% of the wealth if everyone can afford a roof over their heads and full stomachs.
