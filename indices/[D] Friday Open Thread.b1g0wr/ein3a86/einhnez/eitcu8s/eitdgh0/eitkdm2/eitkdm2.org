There's a ban on discussion of US politics in this subreddit, so I can't be specific with arguments or examples, but the "make the whole pie bigger and everyone's individual slice gets bigger as well, and increasing the size of the already-wealthy's slice will cause the pie to grow faster even if it shrinks the relative size of everyone else's slice" hypothesis has been pretty thoroughly tested over the last 40 years. Adjusted for inflation, the average Millennial male head of household makes 18% and 27% less than Gen X and the Baby Boomers did at the same age. In 2016, home ownership hit its lowest level in 50 years, and it hasn't improved much in the last two years. /One out of three/ Millennials is still stuck living with their parents, the highest that number has been since the end of the 1930s (coincidentally, the end of the 1930s was about 10 years after the start of the Great Depression, and we're currently about 10 years out from the start of the Great Recession). Observable reality contradicts the claims of libertarians, and the final arbiter is observation.
