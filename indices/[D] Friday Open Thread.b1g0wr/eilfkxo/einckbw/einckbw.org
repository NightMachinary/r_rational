If you happen to cycle a lot like I do, try looking for frames that are thin at the temples. I have glasses that have more than a centimetre vertical width at the hinge and get moderately thinner the closer they get to the ear, and I was really frustrated when spring came around and I found out that this frame introduced a wide obstruction in my field of view when looking out of the corner of my eye or over my shoulder (to check for traffic approaching from the back).

Other than that:

- You can always retain the frame and exchange the lenses every few years, particularly if you happen to like your frame.
- Glare reduction is worth it (for me, I don't remember a time I didn't wear glasses)
- Sonic bath cleaners are worth it (they're multi-purpose, not just limited to glasses, but also bicycle parts, for instance)
