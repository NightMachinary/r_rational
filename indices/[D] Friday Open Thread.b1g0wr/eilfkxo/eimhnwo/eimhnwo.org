Hmm, just some random practical thoughts:

zenioptical.com is an excellent source of cheap lenses. Do not buy lenses direct from your optometrist unless you have great insurance, you will end up paying a lot more.

If you have any kind of metal allergy make sure you get hypoallergenic frames to avoid awful rashes. Get something with replaceable nose pads to avoid long term grottiness, as well.

Keeping the lenses clean can be a real chore, easier these days with microfiber cloths. Never ever use paper products to dry your glasses, it is astonishing how easily a lens can be scratched
