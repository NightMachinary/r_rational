You don't mean Silhouette, do you? The self-styled "lightest glasses in the world"? Because the pair I got at age 17 was Silhouette, cost thereabouts of $900 (cost before insurance, anyway; used to have really good insurance back in the day...). Wore them on roller coasters without even thinking about it. Wore them through two years of college, which was up in the mountains, and my glasses never even budged during the incident when I missed the bus and had to walk the 20 minutes from my apartment to class /during a literal blizzard/ (that's an exaggeration, blizzards technically have sustained winds of 35+ mph for 3+ hours, and the one specific instance I'm referring to was 25+ mph sustained for an hour or two with 40+ mph gusts; I'd go outside and smoke in 10 mph sustained with 20+ mph gusts, which was not rare weather there).

Still, I can't imagine someone getting Silhouette glasses and the establishment selling them not doing a proper fitting. Maybe my glasses' stability during the semi-blizzard was due to the fact that I was wearing a thick beanie pulled down over my ears?

On the other hand, I've /never/ been particularly careful with glasses, I've always just put them on as soon as I got out of bed and not taken them off again until I got back in bed 16ish hours later, never sparing them even a passing thought in the interim, and I've never been prematurely dispossessed of a pair of glasses by anything other than my own stupidity that one time when I was 12 and snapped them in half with my own hands. The glasses I got at ages 15, 17, and 19? I'm going to be 30 in a few months and I still have all three of them, and switched back and forth between them over the last 10 years (though I've worn the latest pair almost exclusively for like the last 3 years, up until I got a fresh pair 5 months ago).
