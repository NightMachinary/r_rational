I'm in a similar situation, got glasses recently because I'm a bit near-sighted. At home they are off unless I'm watching TV, at work they're off at my desk but on everywhere else, and I keep them on when I drive somewhere. The bad part is that I often forget to grab them again when I get up, because I'm used to only needing to gather my wallet and phone and stuff. I already lost my first pair. So definitely take care if you're gonna take them off somewhere.
