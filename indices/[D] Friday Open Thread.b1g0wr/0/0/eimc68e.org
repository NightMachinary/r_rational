[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21322/re-trailer-trash][Re: Trailer Trash]] is about a woman who was, as the title would tell you, trailer trash and gets to redo her life. It's pretty much slice-of-life about a woman who is doing her damned best to make a better life for herself as she goes back to high-school. It's very slow to update with about a month per chapter.
