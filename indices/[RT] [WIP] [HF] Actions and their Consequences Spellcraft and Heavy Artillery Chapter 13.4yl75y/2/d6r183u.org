This is one of the most promising stories I came across in a while. I was hooked after the first few chapters and finished up to the latest.

However it will need quite a bit of rework to reach the level of the more popular works on this subreddit.

the issues I have so far:

- The war is basically modeled after the Great War. Soldiers are used as cannon fodder to the very extreme, so much that adapting simple strategies of trench warfare had a huge impact. In the real WW1, the countries lost about 15-20% of their soldiers within 4-5 years. So unless they have some magically enhanced breeding system, this war wouldn't have lasted a decade.

- For the same reason there should be a huge gender imbalance and the civil society should look much more different from our own.

- Even if they conveniently obtain god like powers, the different behavior of 9 soldiers shouldn't change a war this easily.

- the romantic development between 'Scandinavian hot babe' and the main character is a little bit too wish fulfilling. Especially because she is the only female character in the story worth mentioning.
