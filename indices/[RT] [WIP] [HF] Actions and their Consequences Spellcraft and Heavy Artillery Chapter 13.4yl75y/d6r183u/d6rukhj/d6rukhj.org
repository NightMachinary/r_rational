I have some of that stuff dealt with in the story (it just hasn't been revealed yet) and some of it does need some rewriting (that's absolutely true, I've been writing and releasing basically first draft).

One that I absolutely need to clarify - the war wasn't won by that one squad. I need to make that clearer in the story. Gandia was already in the process of vacating - that process in fact took several years, even with magic in place.
