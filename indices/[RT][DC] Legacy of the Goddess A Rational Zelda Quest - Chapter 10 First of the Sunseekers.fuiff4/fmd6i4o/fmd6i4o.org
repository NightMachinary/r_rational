VERY good progress. Link and Zelda both need to learn more from each other in their specializations (combat and magic).

I am exceptionally glad we now have Reinvigorate. That's very helpful for keeping Zelda and Link both alive. Link's a fucking juggernaut to which the only limiter is his own body, which Reinvigorate helps a lot with. And Zelda's not conditioned enough to function in combat longer than 30 seconds, so keeping her fresh is even more important.

Link should consider the use of Bursts to redirect his momentum in ways that're impossible to predict.
