I might be reading too much into it , but the way she phrased that last request doest feel right.We definitely need their help though, so we will have to ask how and where to meet with the Lynx .

Going alone seems like it would offend them less, but would be a crazy risk, especially if it's relatively far. And I doubt they are idiotic enough to jeopardize negotiations during an apocalyptic scenario just for being offended. And we have to consider the possibility of the lynx secretly working for the enemy or thinking we are working for fae or something.

Definitely go with at least Link(doubt they would complain if we explain some of his status, ignoring the farore part because possession of triforce fragments is best kept secret).And more guards if possible.

Also, ask fi what was she saying before Zelda interrupted her in case it was something beyond the obvious .

And confirm Naibi's intentions via fi lie detection
