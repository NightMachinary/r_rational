+*Voting time! What do you do?*+ *(E: Voting is closed. Any additional discussion or comments will not affect the outcome of the next update.)*

Does Zelda go with Naibi...

...by herself?

...with Link?

...does Link go in her stead?

...do neither of them go? (If so, how do you respond to Naibi?)

What else do you wish to do?

--------------

Your previous Void Power total was 1668.

You were able to complete research on the Cane of Byrna reinvigoration effect. This required 769 additional VP.

Fi used a total of 174 VP to restore Link's magic during the course of his training. She did this 9 times.

Fi used a total of 363 VP reinvigorating Zelda during the course of her training. She did this 7 times.

Fi used a total of 136 VP on a combination of Ethereal Avatar and telepathic communication.

This update (chapters 9 and 10) spanned 6 days and you have earned 289 VP from Zelda and 406 VP from Link during that time.

You have earned 250 additional VP per day (out of a possible 250) as a bonus for enduring the hiatus and in place of the previous planning quality and brevity/conciseness incentives, for a total of 1500.

*You currently have 2421 Void Power.*

--------------

NOTE: For future updates, you can earn up to 250 additional VP per day. This is based on the following criteria:

- How well did you progress your goals?
- Did you take any risks, and did they pay off?
- How interesting was writing/worldbuilding for us?
- How frustrating was writing/worldbuilding for us?
- How much did we enjoy the discussion?
- How easy was it to figure out what players wanted to do?
