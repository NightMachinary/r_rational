NB: "No rules" doesn't mean we wouldn't appreciate having a single comment with everything important listed and voted highly to signal your collective acceptance. We won't /necessarily/ take that to be "the plan," and aren't requiring such, but if you all want to preserve a similar status quo and all collectively act to make such a thing Very Obviously The Consensus, then we will go with it so long as it remains Very Obviously The Consensus.

Same for any other way you want to go about it.
