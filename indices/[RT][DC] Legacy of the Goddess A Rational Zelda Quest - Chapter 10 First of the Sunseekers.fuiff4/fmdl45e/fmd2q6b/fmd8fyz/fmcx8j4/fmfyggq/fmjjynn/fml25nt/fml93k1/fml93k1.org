  Shouldn't we explicitly bring a bit more guards than Link if possible?(I mean because bring link sounds like bring only link, but that sounds like a weird thing to do) .

  I mean not sure what is expected of us, and I guess Link and Zelda are not helpless . But imagine if it's a trap and they attack us whith more people than we can handle and we just die/are captured.

  Seems like an unnecessary risk. I guess if the lynx is camping near the castle whith a few soldiers it might be worth going only us as a show of trust. But otherwise I don't see any reason to only go whith link apart from the fact vetch's questions sugest it.

Good point. Added a note on this.

  the secons question will work as it is because it references an ooc concept of seconds , we might need to frame the question whith the definition of second instead(something something caesium 133) same for temperature.

I phrased it that way because Fi appears to be familiar with our world's metrics based on previous discussions, but I'm okay with trying to figure out objective measurements if we think it's necessary.
