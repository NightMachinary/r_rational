These are solid. Maybe add some things like:

- What sorts of resistance should we expect on the journey, if any?
- What are the weather and conditions that we should expect?
- What sorts of supplies should we bring?
- Are there any supplies that we have available here that the Lynx might find useful, that we might offer as a gesture of friendship?
- Are there any traditional forms of etiquette we should be aware of when speaking with the Lynx?
- Do you know of any reliable way of identifying followers of our enemies that we could relay to our officers while we are gone?
- Do you have any existing knowledge of areas in which our people have been infiltrated by the enemy that we should act on before we leave for this journey?

Then maybe some things for during the journey:

- What can you tell us about yourself?
- What can you tell us about the forces arrayed against us?
- What can you tell us about the Lightsworn?
