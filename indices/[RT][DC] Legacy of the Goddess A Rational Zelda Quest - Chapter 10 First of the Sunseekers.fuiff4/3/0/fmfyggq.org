Thanks for the update! I'm excited this is going again.

Some initial plan ideas:

- Go with Naibi. Bring Link. Discuss the viability of bringing a larger entourage with Naibi; if you can reasonably bring sheikah and guards, bring sheikah and guards.
- Ask questions (as discussed separately in the thread.)
- Check status with the fortress before leaving.
- Obtain relevant supplies before leaving.
- Obtain relevant gifts for the Lynx before leaving (if applicable based on discussion with Naibi).
- If Naibi has advice on detecting servants of the Exiled King, relay to trusted/vetted sheikah so they can begin detection efforts.
- Give standing orders to sheikah to scry on Zelda and Link periodically and exchange messages at specific check-in times if possible. Given the mana costs of messages, these should be kept to critical information.
- Have Link spend some time on figuring out how to safely reproduce his monster one-shotting Invigorate technique.
- Continue having Link and Zelda practice with each other. Try some training with handicaps; e.g. Link only uses magic, Zelda uses no magic, etc.
- SOP: Spend up to one tenth of our current VP on time-sensitive research related to old magic or Link's essence changes.

World questions for Fi to discuss with Zelda at some point, since they may be relevant to our assumptions about physics, the passage of time, and cosmere crossover stuff:

- How many seconds are there in a day on Zelda's world, using earth seconds as a measurement?"
- How strong is gravity on her planet, in earth "g" units?
- If this can't be answered directly, how fast do objects drop on Zelda's planet, using earth seconds as a mesurement?
- What is the average daytime temperature in Celsius in the area where Zelda is traveling? What's the average night time temperature?
- What's the length of a year on Zelda's planet?
- How many moons, if any, does her planet have?
- How many suns, if any, does her planet have?
- What's the size of Zelda's planet, in square miles?
- What is the closest other planet to her's? How distant is it?

It's possible I've missed some of this; I haven't checked the Discord updates or new website yet.

A note to my fellow questers:

7 restores totaling 363 VP means ~51 VP per restore for Zelda.

9 restores totaling 174 VP means ~19 VP per restore for Link.

I don't know what % of their mana pool Fi was using the restores at (that may have been in our old plans, but I don't have it handy). This is good for giving us a general idea of how costly a restore is right now, though, and maybe a general relative idea of their mana pools (assuming they are being restored at a similar mana threshold, Link might have around 40% of Zelda's mana pool?)

Also of note, it sounded like mana pool/threshold could increase with practice, so we'll see how that tracks with future mana restoration.

Also of note in regards to crossovers, I saw an interesting word in regard to Hylia: Creation. Given the crossover, this might mean she is - or was - the Creation shard, and contrasted with the Demise shard.
