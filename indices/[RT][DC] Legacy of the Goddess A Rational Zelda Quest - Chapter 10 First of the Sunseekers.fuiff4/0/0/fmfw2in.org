  I might be reading too much into it , but the way she phrased that last request doest feel right.We definitely need their help though, so we will have to ask how and where to meet with the Lynx .
#+end_quote

I agree, it felt very "old sagey", like "you must do the thing, I am being intentionally vague even though I clearly have knowledge on this subject and appalled by your lack of knowledge".

I think we should try to avoid substantial offense by grilling her too much immediately, but try to get some more details along the journey. At present, we have no way of even knowing with any certainty that this is the Lynx's actual representative, do we?

  Definitely go with at least Link(doubt they would complain if we explain some of his status, ignoring the farore part because possession of triforce fragments is best kept secret).And more guards if possible.
#+end_quote

Agree. Absolutely do not split Link and Zelda up, imo.

  Also, ask fi what was she saying before Zelda interrupted her in case it was something beyond the obvious . And confirm Naibi's intentions via fi lie detection
#+end_quote

Agree on both.
