From the blurb on the "About" page:

#+begin_quote
  Legacy of the Goddess is a rational-deconstruction take on the Legend of Zelda setting, as an AU cross with the cosmere setting, explored in the format of a Quest. Among other things, this work aims to be:

  Rational: Characters behave realistically and according to their motivations, not just because the plot, players, or QMs demand it. NPCs have agency, care about the world they inhabit, and will take action towards fulfilling their interests even where it conflicts with player intent. Magic behaves lawfully and has strict rules on what it can and cannot do.

  It is important to note that no character is immune to consequence and anyone can die. Destiny and prophecy are nowhere to be found here.

  Simulationist: Events, contested outcomes, magic, character abilities, etc., are modeled with statistics, physics, custom software, and (hopefully) robust game systems. We aim to keep QM fiat rulings minimal in scope and scale, with as many things as possible being in principle predictable and deterministic.

  Deconstructive: Canon story elements, tropes, and other material are used only as inspiration to reverse engineer a setting where these ideas are taken seriously and pushed to their logical conclusions. This has involved substantial world-building, crafting of fictional histories, etc.

  First and foremost, this work aims to be as internally and logically consistent as possible while still remaining true to the source material.

And if I had to give an elevator pitch:

#+begin_quote
  Hylia is dead, and a malevolent force greater than she is working behind the scenes to unknown ends. The Kingdom of Hyrule, caught up in the center of this conflict, has been on the decline for thousands of years, and in the present day is now faced with annihilation.

  Can you save their world from its impending demise?

Still on the fence? I would say read the [[https://chaossnek.com/Story?chapter=C1][first chapter]]. If that doesn't hook you, then you probably won't enjoy the story. (Do keep in mind there are two prologue chapters before that if you do decide to read.)

E: I should also note that since this is an AU, familiarity with the source material isn't strictly necessary to enjoy the story or to participate in the quest.
