Neat that the story's thumbnail is finally being used, less neat that it's clipped. I may need to make a square cover. As always, feedback is very, very welcome, either here or shouted at me as we pass on the sidewalk.

I look at you. We make eye contact. "What?" I ask.

"The last chapter of Fling a Light was a complete mess. Seriously, this is almost as bad as that debacle with Piggot last chapter."

"Oh, thank you for the feedback," I say. "Do you have any suggestions for how I could improve as a writer?"

You open your mouth. Spiders pour out, crawling down your neck and making their nest in your clothes.

I consider screaming, but hold out my hand to shake instead. In the distance, haunting piano music plays. We know this is all there is to life, both of us flying through the void, hiding our inner turmoil and also spiders and screaming reviews of fanfiction at passersby as we walk through our dreary lives, waiting for this world to end and put us out of our misery and spiders.
