If I were them, I would having children learning about the technology and playing around with it. Children have an enormous advantage over adults in learning new patterns and ideas, even if adults are better at applying the ideas. So children are probably more likely to think of the eavesdropping idea because they would play around with the radios in a war game and stumble on it.

Children also are less prone to [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_fixedness][Functional Fixedness]] and therefore are better at coming up with new uses and how it can be applied to more aspects of life than how the more advanced empire would use them.

Just an idea to justify the odder leaps of thought.
