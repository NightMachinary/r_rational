  *Functional fixedness* is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias][cognitive bias]] that limits a person to using an object only in the way it is traditionally used. The concept of functional fixedness originated in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_Psychology][Gestalt Psychology]], a movement in psychology that emphasizes [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism][holistic]] processing. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Duncker][Karl Duncker]] defined functional fixedness as being a "mental block against using an object in a new way that is required to solve a problem." This "block" limits the ability of an individual to use components given to them to complete a task, as they cannot move past the original purpose of those components. For example, if someone needs a paperweight, but they only have a hammer, they may not see how the hammer can be used as a paperweight. Functional fixedness is this inability to see a hammer's use as anything other than for pounding nails; the person couldn't think to use the hammer in a way other than in its conventional function.
