In the story, the dark ages group has been subjugated by a small but powerful ethnic group, think like, Imperialist anywhere, though they are a much larger population, they have been for some generations now under the heel of this empire.

To avoid giving too much of the plot away, in short they have an uprising everywhere at once, and manage to quickly grab a massive amount of land from the Empire due to their superior numbers, taking out a lot of the local lords and rulers. This would be where they got everything they have from, in this singular event, depending on how well it 'took' in a given area. The Empire's military will counterattack of course in due time, and they'll be forced to make a real fight of it.
