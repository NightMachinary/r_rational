First of all, your Middle Ages society better make sure that their revolution stays completely dark until they're ready to go. The outer world has more of the tech and more experience with it; the MA society will need some brilliant strategy, clear tech advantage, or outside allies in order to avoid defeat.

As to understanding the tech, it depends on what exactly they have. If they just had radios and cannons then no, they wouldn't get it. You said they have encyclopedias and tech manuals; they probably still won't get it. They need books about basic science and, more importantly, the scientific method. Until they understand the scientific method they are going nowhere -- from your description they might or might not have it.

Outside of that, they need to run war games with their new toys. Have promotion depend on performance in the games (being on the winning team not being relevant as long as you yourself behaved smartly and loyally).

A couple of problems they're going to have: using up ammo during testing with no way to resupply, and accidentally giving themselves away while testing. If the outside world hears radio transmissions coming from DarkAgia, they're going to want to know what's up.

Where did they get the materials from in the first place? If they stole them, someone should be looking for them. If they bought them, can they get their supplier to give lessons? Can they hire trainers and instructors from the outside world?
