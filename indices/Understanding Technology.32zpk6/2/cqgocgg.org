Honestly, their best bet is to draw the outside country into a guerrilla war on the borderlands, using the modern society's civilian's as hostages against the possibility of WMDs. Their greatest advantage is the terrain and local support, as well as figuring out the points of failure on foreign military equipment and protocol and exploiting them.

And, yeah, have the children grow up puzzling their way through the diagrams. Go for the other side's civilians, too - a couple sympathetic teachers and skilled trades workers in various fields would be enough to kickstart a tech base with a bit of imagination, resourcefulness, and good management.
