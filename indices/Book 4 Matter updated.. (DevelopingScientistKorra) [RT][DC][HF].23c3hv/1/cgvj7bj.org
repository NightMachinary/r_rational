Legend of Korra rationalist fanfiction -- [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1uatnn/developingscientistkorra/][original post here]].

I have been following this story for a while.. By far the best Avatar fanfiction I've ever read. I loved how writingathing portrayed Korra's isolation in the South. The realism they brought to the story exploring the full potential of the setting.

They've also been rewriting the chapters based on the feedback, so you might want to read from the beginning instead of where you left off if you've read before.
