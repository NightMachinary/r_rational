Xanatos is a really hard villain to write to be much more rational than he already is.

For one thing, he's already succeeded at most of his life goals. He's insanely wealthy, has married a beautiful, intelligent woman, and gained power through his membership in the Illuminati. When he plans his schemes, he makes sure that nearly all outcomes gain him something.

He's ever really basically been shown to have three goals: to protect and expand his wealth, family, and influence; to gain immortality; and to overcome interesting challenges. The first two are pretty much rational goals by definition, and the last... well, to paraphrase Professor Quirrell, "What's the point of being an Evil Overlord if you always have to follow /all/ the rules?" What's the point of having all the money and power, if you're constantly bored?

I can only count /three times/ that Xanatos lands in any real trouble: when he recruits the Gargoyles to steal Cyberbiotics technology (gets arrested), when he creates Thailog (gets betrayed and nearly killed), and when Oberon comes for Titania's grandson (is attacked by a being of godlike power).

The first instance is a genuine failure, but it only results in him getting imprisoned for a few months; the worst he complains about to Owen is the food. And, for the most part, it was the result of something he had good reason to believe wouldn't happen, and was actively trying to prevent: Goliath formed a bond of trust with a human other than Xanatos himself.

The second failure is a result of being untrustworthy. He creates another smarter, stronger version of himself, in Thailog. This is almost identical to Tom Riddle's mistake of creating another Riddle for companionship, and HPMOR is generally considered rational. Maybe a rational story could be told about a Xanatos who, being trustworthy when trying to duplicate himself, can reach a more trusting relationship with Thailog, and gain more through cooperation, but it wouldn't produce that much of a change in the overall story arc. And besides, Xanatos /likes/ a challenge; I don't think he's displeased at all to have Thailog out there as a rival to himself.

Finally, the Oberon issue was completely unforeseeable without foreknowledge of the identity of Fox's mother. And, even so, he was so prepared to be attacked that he /won/ that fight, pretty handily, and even exploited it as an excuse to reconcile with the Manhattan Clan.

Could the other antagonists be rewritten to be more rational? Definitely. Demona and Macbeth certainly could (although Macbeth takes a turn down that path himself when he turns away from his literally-suicidal obsession with killing Demona); so could the Archmage, and most of Oberon's Children that have shown up.

And the Gargoyles themselves often win through brute strength and just through being in what seems to be a much more just world than ours is; rarely do they outwit anyone smarter than the Pack or the Steel Clan.

But Xanatos? He's pretty much the prototypical rational antagonist, and rarely comes out of a scheme having risked more than what he was willing to lose. It would be hard to improve much upon him.
