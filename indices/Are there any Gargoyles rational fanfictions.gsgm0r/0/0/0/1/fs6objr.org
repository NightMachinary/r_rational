  Demona has no ability to delay gratification

Don't know, that seems such a key part of her personality. She's extremely passionate and impulsive, and that too is why she's so quick to hate humanity and sweepingly generalise their flaws. A more reflexive, thoughtful, patient Demona would just not have become a villain at all, she'd have stayed at Goliath's side (though, note, I'm still early in S2 in my rewatch, and haven't seen her backstory for the years passed in between the curse and the present, which I don't remember. So my opinion may change).
