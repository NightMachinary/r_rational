  The second failure is a result of being untrustworthy. He creates another smarter, stronger version of himself, in Thailog. This is almost identical to Tom Riddle's mistake of creating another Riddle for companionship, and HPMOR is generally considered rational. Maybe a rational story could be told about a Xanatos who, being trustworthy when trying to duplicate himself, can reach a more trusting relationship with Thailog, and gain more through cooperation, but it wouldn't produce that much of a change in the overall story arc. And besides, Xanatos likes a challenge; I don't think he's displeased at all to have Thailog out there as a rival to himself.

I like the idea of Thailog as "Smarter, but less trustworthy, version of Xanatos." Not that r!fic is supposed to be didactic, but it'd still be interesting to drive forward the point that Xanatos is ultimately a bigger threat than Thailog because, while Thailog outclasses him in a lot of ways on a one-to-one basis, Xanatos can actually inspire people's loyalty and maintain a healthy organizational climate.

I would have Macbeth and/or Demona lean into their immortality more heavily and pull stunts which only succeed because they can't die. Also, just make them more skilled. Demona should learn some impulse control, but ultimately, we don't see them do much more than shoot lasers and operate complex machinery, but they've had a thousand years in which to learn new stuff.

If I had to strongly differentiate them, which is probably a good idea from a storywriting perspective, then I'd make them "wide vs tall," i.e. one of them picked up a /lot/ of skills, while the other has focused on a few specific skills and continually worked on them to the point that, in those domains, they utterly outclass everyone else because, you know, they have /a thousand years of practice/.

Probably Macbeth and Demona respectively, because I can easily see Macbeth picking up all kinds of trades over the generations and adding them to his repertoire one by one, and Demona obsessing over a few key skills. Since Demona was learning magic even before the rest of the clan was killed or petrified, she is probably /the/ most capable magic-user on the planet short of (some of) the Children of Oberon.

Not sure what to do with the Pack, but part of me is fine with leaving them as patsies whose intelligence doesn't rise higher than "will never hold the Idiot Ball."
