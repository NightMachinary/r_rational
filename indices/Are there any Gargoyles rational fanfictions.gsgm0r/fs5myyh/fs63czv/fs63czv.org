If I wrote a rational!Gargoyles, I'd much rather make the gargoyles cleverer. This might be a bit too much "Giving Frodo a lightsaber without giving Sauron a Death Star," but tbh, I think Xanatos could handle it. >:P

That, or just focus on [[https://gargoyles.fandom.com/wiki/Matrix][the semi-rogue A.I. who was only narrowly convinced to substitute "tiling the universe with it-shaped paperclips" for "tiling the universe with law and order as explained to it by a former criminal and mercenary"]], and for some reason was never heard from again (until the comics, anyway).
