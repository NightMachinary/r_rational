I disagree.

A good way to improve Xanatos as a rational character would be for him to have actual /plans/, where he's trying to accomplish objectives and going through multiple steps to move towards them.

Much of what he does in the show (at least in the early seasons) is antagonize the gargoyles for no reason, get his ultra-expensive military hardware wrecked as a result, and shrug it off with "Eh, I'm rich anyway, let's call this a field test".

Though the part where he gets his girlfriend out of prison is pretty clever.
