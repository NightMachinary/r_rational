Well, I suppose I'm thinking more in terms of the world and schemes itself. There's a reason why the trope of an extremely elaborated plan with multiple possible benefits is called a “Xanatos gambit”... by the criterion so aptly explained by Lucius after seeing the Tragedy of Light, they /are/ a bit too convoluted at times.

Anyway I need to finish my rewatch before I can mull about this properly, I don't remember much beyond the City of Stone arc (I watched this the first time when I was ten years old).
