She's literally had /a thousand years/ since the fall of Cattle Wyvern to learn patience, the vast majority of that after she and Macbeth had parted ways.

I don't think the show goes much into what happened to her after that and before Awakening, aside from recurring conflicts with the Hunters.

I don't think the most important part of Demona's character is that she's passionate and impulsive; I think she's defined by being egotistical, power-hungry, and by using her hatred for humanity as a coping mechanism, to allow her to avoid her own responsibility for the destruction of her clan. If it's their fault, it can't possibly be hers.

That last isn't exactly rational, but I think it could be retained in a rational fic for exploration.
