Xanatos could definitely handle a cleverer Manhattan Clan. It would force him to up his own game a bit, but he'd consider that a bonus.

The rest of their adversaries need upgrades, though. Demona has no ability to delay gratification, Macbeth isn't much better, Oberon has so much phenomenal cosmic power that everything looks like a nail to him, and without Fox or Coyote to lead them, the Pack's most intelligent member is Dingo, who isn't /stupid/, but certainly doesn't play on the same level as even Demona and Macbeth do.

Thailog would be fine as an adversary for cleverer Gargoyles, but he'd need his own Owen equivalent; the fact that he has no one intelligent and trustworthy as an ally limits his potential.
