Yeah, it's not that Xanatos isn't smart or rational in himself, but the show doesn't seem (to this point, I'm at the episode where Coldstone revives but his mind is taken over by a computer virus) to really have such a complex long term plan, so most of what he does is episodic bullshit where he rationalises his loss as "meh I have backups". Plus other aspects of the show are less than rational anyway (why did he even need to study real Gargoyles to build the Steel Clan, which is just... Gargoyle-shaped robots? I'd have understood if he needed a sample of their genetic material to clone them...). It's still a lot of fun, and I really enjoy Goliath too - he's got a real ethic, personality, values and flaws. He's good but won't shy away completely from anger or violence at times, because after all, he IS a +man+ gargoyle of the Middle Ages. There's a lot of good episodes that set up all sorts of interesting conflicts. But the pseudo-science and magic system of the world could be more fleshed out, and having a genuinely rationally written Xanatos interact with them over a long story with a clear endgame in mind but also his traditionally twisted, obliquous plans, would be amazing.
