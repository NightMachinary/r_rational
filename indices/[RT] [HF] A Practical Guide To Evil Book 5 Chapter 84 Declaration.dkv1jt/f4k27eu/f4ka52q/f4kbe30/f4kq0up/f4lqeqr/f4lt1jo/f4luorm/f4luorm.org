This is definitely a good point, but even then I don't think conquest of the entire continent would be the "Victory" that he would be after. Sure he can enjoy it for a while, but that way is just an inevitable band of heroes springing up to end his tyranny.

Like Black did, he can try to keep a lid on it, but only for so long. And Bard was not even involved with a majority of the heroes that Black put down initially. Against the Dead King, the Bard would be out in full force, and if DK goes for the conquest route, he would be handing her so many threads towards his end on a silver platter.
