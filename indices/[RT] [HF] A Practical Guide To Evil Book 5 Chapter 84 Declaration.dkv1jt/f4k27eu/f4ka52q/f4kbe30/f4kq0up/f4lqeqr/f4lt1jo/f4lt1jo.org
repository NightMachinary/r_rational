I think there's another rule that's even stronger than "heroes always win" and that's "villains always believe there's some way for them to win" even if their victory condition isn't total domination.

The Dead King knows that the Bard will always try to kill him and that one day she will succeed if allowed to keep trying. He waits for a perfect moment to counterattack, but if he doesn't take those perfect moments he has resigned himself to lose and die one day, something he is incapable of doing.
