His ultimate goals remain a mystery, though it seems to center around escaping the Gods constraints, but his immediate goal is pretty clear: he wants to remove any potential threat. The Bard's plan failed and the Choir of Judgement is either temporarily or permanently knocked out of the game. Not to mention Malicia needs him more than ever and has convinced half to League to side with her. If he waits, he might never get another set of circumstances so heavily weighed in his favour.

A new opponent /might/ appear, but the current crop is too far below him to be any real threat. And if he waits, he only lets his enemies grow stronger or the Brad to come up with another plan or Judgement comes back in force. And he might become the "ultimate" villain, but between him and Malicia he'll also have killed enough people that there won't be enough people left to oppose him ever again.

It's a risk, like he said, but a calculated one.
