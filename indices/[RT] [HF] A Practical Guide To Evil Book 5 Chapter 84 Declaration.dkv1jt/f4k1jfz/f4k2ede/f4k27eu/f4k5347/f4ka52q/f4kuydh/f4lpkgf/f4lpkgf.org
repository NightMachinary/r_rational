That's not what's going to happen is it? Every single crusade against the Dead King failed because they were fighting on his home turf after he had withdrawn his invasion. Even now you saw during previous chapters that the Alliance couldn't agree whether to pursue him to Keter or to let him retreat.

All he has to do is to offer peace, and the grand alliance crumbles due to the lack of a uniting factor. They might turn their eyes to Keter, but that's a dead end story wise, as it will be "peace offer rejected, heroes out for blood" which ends like all the prior crusades. Or they might turn to Malicia, which gets them out of DK's hair.

This entire trial came about because Cat needed a reason to keep warring on Keter. A reason justifiable not just politically, but in story-form.

Triumphant conquered the whole continent and yet there were still people left to oppose her. People specifically created by providence to deal with her and her armies. The same is going to happen to the Dead King, if he conquers the whole continent. Which is why I don't think that is what he is after. This is indeed the risk he is taking, that slight chance of overreaching in his conquest which might allow the Bard another in to story-kill him. But there is something which he seeks that is worth the risk. He hasn't had this much free reign for conquest since Triumphant. He wants something from down south, mark my words.
