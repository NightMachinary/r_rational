A sequel, set 100 years later?

Maybe a cat does him in in the meantime and the heroes were unnecessary.

Ok, in slightly more seriousness, I think the idea is that the bard has already had her hero's journey and come out too powerful to do it again, so she won't have providence on her side next time around. And Namaseh is careful enough that he can't be beaten without it.
