See, that's the thing. Evil doesn't "Win" in creation. Good Guys Always Win. Black held off the tide that came against Praes for 20 years with his conquest, and yet Callow is no longer under Praesi occupation.

Catherine is very good at twisting stories, and even when she kept winning, she did have to deal with a lot of losses as well. Also helps that she is no longer named.

I definitely think that this is a "chance". A potential win for his "Step 1". He can conquer deep enough in order to get something that he wants, potentially from Dominion lands (the hint at Grey Pilgrim origins was also given). The conquest might all be towards that end.
