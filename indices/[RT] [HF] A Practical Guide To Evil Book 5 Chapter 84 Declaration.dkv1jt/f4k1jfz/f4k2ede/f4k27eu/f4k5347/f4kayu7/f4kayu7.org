That was Catherine's hypothesis before Tyrant's whole trial. Now we know that Bard tried to get the Dead King out and end him with the weapon. DK found out early, and he sued for peace halfway. If his goal is to continue existing, even after the weapon is non functional he would still sue for peace. Because invading more than he has done in his entire history would be the start of a story. A dark story of death ravaging the lands, and the band of heroes emerging from that crucible would be able to end him with the force of the story alone. Hence why he called this a risk. He wants something else.
