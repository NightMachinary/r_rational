I was confused by the wording but I think what it means is this: a truce implies they are a threat, or in some way equal, or can restart a fight they can win. He views the truce not as any of those things, but as a stay of execution.

So he won't move his forces forward, but when he does he'll steamroll them regardless of what they have planned.
