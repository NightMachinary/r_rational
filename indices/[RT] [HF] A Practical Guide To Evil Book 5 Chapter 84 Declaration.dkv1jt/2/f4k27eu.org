Even now we know not what the Dead King wants. Dominion over all those who live cannot be an objective for the dead king, as along with his advance, heroes against him will inevitably spawn. The more land he takes, the more the story turns against him. He cannot appear invincible, yet if he advances now without Malicia being the light that the story shines on, he will be.

And so we come to his parting lines. The man who leaves *nothing* for providence to shine through is now taking a risk. A calculated one, but a risk nonetheless. Why now? What chance does he have now that might not come again? And towards what end? Everyone is asking about what the Bard wants, but what does the King of Death want?
