If he wanted to destroy the Weapon, he would never have sued for peace initially. The weapon was a check that the Bard wanted to use to permanently kill him. Now the heroes don't /know/ how it will act if they use it, so they will be reluctant to use it.

I think there's something down south that he wants to get his hands on. Potentially in dominion lands. The hint with the Grey Pilgrim's origin was a blatant one. Previously if he had continued conquering, the Warden of the West would be forced to use this Weapon and that might have killed him. But now that the weapon is sort-of out of commission, he feels that he has some leeway to conquer until the place that he wants to find.
