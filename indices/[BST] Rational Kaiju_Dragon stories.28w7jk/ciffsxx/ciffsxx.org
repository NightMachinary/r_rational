Well, I'm a sucker for ginormous scaly monstrosities delicately turning pages with their various clawed appendages.. I'll give it a read :P

You just reminded me of an old Choose-Your-Adventure text game I played a while back - [[https://www.choiceofgames.com/dragon/][Choice of Dragons]].

Now not rational per se, but there are paths where you can eschew with the pyromania and do some diplomacy and fairly one sided negotiations. You still stay true to your rabid kleptomania for hoard and penchant for casual subject devouring though.

I had this fanfic idea after I first played it where the dragon hoarded books instead of loot, and actually ruling - developing the initial dynamic between queen and the courtiers, doing things like integrating his faithful goblins within the society, generally thinking of ways you could use him to revolutionize the kingdom.
