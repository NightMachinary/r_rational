The stacked Z-space one might be a useful thought experiment. Assume that there are an infinite number of Z-space layers. Assume that Z-space layers next to each other whose properties are sufficiently similar (i.e. most of them) merge into a single layer, leaving only Z-space layers which have (relatively) dissimilar properties, at least to the point where a merge can't be triggered by the normal operations of the universe.

Now assume that life arises in a layer where a hydrogen virus is feasible. It inevitably gets invented and, as you surmise, all the matter in the universe falls through to the next layer. And the next, and the next, until it tries to fall through to a layer where a hydrogen virus is /not/ possible.

And there it sits. Until the life which created the hydrogen virus, or one of their contemporaries, creates something like a sucrose virus, and matter drops down a bunch more Z-layers until it bumps into one where both hydrogen and sucrose viruses don't work.

Eventually you're going to get to the point where only molecules which haven't been tried before in the universe's entire history by any species at all work for a Z-virus. Which will generally mean that the only molecules which don't trigger a Z-crash will be extremely complex ones only found in microscopically tiny regions of space, such as specific DNA from specific alien species.
