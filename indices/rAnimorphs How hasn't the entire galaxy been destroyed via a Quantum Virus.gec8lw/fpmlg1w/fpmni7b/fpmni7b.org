This is true, but the Anthropic principle only guarantees that we exist to observe the universe. There are any of a variety of explanations:

For one, life might actually be /exceedingly/ rare; all species we know about in the Milky Way rather look like the product of Crayimist. And on top of that, it might be range limited to a galaxy or similar, so sudden-galaxy-vanishing-syndrome would be a rare occurrence.

Or this might be the reason for the (apparently still true, in-universe) Fermi Paradox. Hydrogen viruses aren't possible, but sucrose viruses /are/, so the slate gets wiped clean often enough to prevent ancient civilizations from existing.

Or, heh, maybe it does work on arbitrary molecules/atoms, with no range limit, but it's z-space all the way down. So the entire universe just gets teleported to another z-space every so often, with no apparent effects except that everything drops out of z-space for no apparent reason.

Or any of a variety of other explanations. Even if the continued existence of the universe seems probable, it's possible that such a virus is still a threat to the Milky Way.
