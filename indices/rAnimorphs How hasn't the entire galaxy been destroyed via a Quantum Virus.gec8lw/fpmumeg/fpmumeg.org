The obvious option is a lower limit on complexity. I can think of two intuitive methods by which it might be limited.

The self replication part isn't automatic but rather requires specific properties of both the original molecule and the z-space pair that interacts with it. For the same reason you can get prions with complex proteins but not simpler molecules like sugar you can't get self replicating hydrogen atom z-space complements.

Alternatively or in addition simpler z-space space complements could be less stable with a much shorter half-life before they break down or mutate. A hydrogen atom z virus breaks down faster than it can absorb any matter.
