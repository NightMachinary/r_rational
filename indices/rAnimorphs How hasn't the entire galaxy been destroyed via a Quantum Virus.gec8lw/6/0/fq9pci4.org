If i'm remembering right, that wasn't quite it. The Ellimist is running on a z-space computer, the same one that morphing uploads your brain onto. This means that they can play silly nanners with anyone in morph.

That entire sequence was a simulation, apparently with some rules about how it had to be 'real' (showing only an accurate picture of reality or something, I would guess). And this vulnerability has come up a few other times as well.
