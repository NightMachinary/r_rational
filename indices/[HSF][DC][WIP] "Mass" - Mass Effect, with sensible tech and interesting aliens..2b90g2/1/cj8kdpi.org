More of this please, especially the working and detailed technology presentations. Also I am assuming that Shepard is an engineer class because of personal programming and drones use? Point of note though current drone technology allows anyone to carry a pocket sized, easy to maneuver flying robot, no reason why in the future a more efficient, video transmitting version couldn't be used by every soldier. Great use of the cover cam, wish the enemy was a bit more competent though.
