I am currently working on putting a bit more into the chracters, maybe rewriting to first-person. So it might be on hiatus for a few more days (while I binge Worm for inspiration.)

As for the classes, I am tossing them clear out the window. Might add more scouting drones.

And if I give the Geth any more competence, they will FOOM. I am pegging them as VI-level things, reasons are spoilery.
