Thank you for such a comprehensive critique.

Turians are by necessity groups, and their brainy-wainy isn't an at-will ability, most non-turian telepaths that connect with them "see" a seemingly larger mind. The departure from canon is necessary to avoid acute rubber-forehead alien syndrome. I will show what happens when you start killing turians soon-ish.

The Asari are strong telepaths and other forms of psychics.

Will find a better name for the combat VI. Verbal commands too needs to go; I agree.

Plot direction is undecided but the same basically-cannon event-patterns happen.

And "sufficient evidence to support a manhunt" is Shep and crew scavenging the ruins of Eden Prime for a week, and the "witness" caught it on his iPhone equivalent.

And yeah, I need to drop more "designed to have with minimal radar cross section"s in my descriptions.

Lastly, no. I started writing two days ago.
