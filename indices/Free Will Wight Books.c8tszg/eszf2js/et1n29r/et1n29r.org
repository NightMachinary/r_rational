The whole power level thing seemed pretty weird to me, too. There are tons of books where the main character and their friends are at power level X and they need to beat the evil villain who is power level X+2, but this is hopeless, so they go on a quest to get to power level X+1 and then are really clever / lucky / teamwork-y, so they manage to beat the villain. Does it really matter if X is a bit higher for each book in a series?

To be fair, the books are light and fun so I enjoy reading them anywhere, and it's possible that the large-scale plot will make the power level stuff worthwhile.

Also to be fair, it might just be that the power levels in this series were too explicit to be believable. I do like, for instance, Worm, and that's got pretty constantly-escalating stakes.
