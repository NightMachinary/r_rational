Will has four largely independent series:

- Cradle: starts with Unsouled, is the series everyone recommends
- Traveller's Gate: Will's first published series, starts with House of Blades. It's very good IMO, has a bunch of really interesting magic systems.
- Elder Empire, series A: starts with Of Shadow and Sea, is about a largely amoral assassin lady. She occasionally runs in to the guy in EE series B.
- Elder Empire, series B: starts with Of Sea and Shadow, is about a fantasy Malcolm Reynolds type sea captain. He occasionally runs in to the lady in EE series A.

Cradle is westernized xianxia, Traveller's Gate is pretty standard heroic fantasy, and Elder Empire is kinda pirates vs ninjas vs lovecraftian elder gods.

All of these series can be read independently of each other, though Cradle is kind of poised to become Will's Gunslinger (the story that ties all his world's together).

The two EE series are a bit more closely intertwined, but you can still read them in isolation of each other.
