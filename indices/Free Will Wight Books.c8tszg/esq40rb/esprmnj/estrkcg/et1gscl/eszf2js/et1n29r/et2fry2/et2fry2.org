  Does it really matter if X is a bit higher for each book in a series?
#+end_quote

The real issue for me is that instead of X rising for each book, it seems to rise every couple of chapters. Lindon is weak compared to the copper guy, who's weak compared to his father, who's weak compared to the clan elder, who's weak compared to the school of Heavenly Glory, who's weak compared to Yerin.

Every time the story takes a moment to assure me "this new guy is exponentially more powerful than the last guy", I struggle to take it seriously because I know I won't even have time to get settled into this new dynamic before I'll be introduced to someone new who's exponentially more powerful than /them/.
