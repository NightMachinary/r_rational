OK so I haven't really properly read this in a while, so I think I'm forgetting a few details. I knew that summoners could be summoned by their spirit animals (how the toads summoned Naruto to the mountain in canon), and I get the Naruto added Gaara's name to the Toad contract, using a bit of Gaara's stolen blood.

But I don't quite understand how he used that to summon Gaara himself. I'll admit I kind of skimmed that chapters on summoning; how exactly did that work?
