The way I see it is this:

The contract is two-way, requiring the blood of the users bound to it. Usually it's a bond between a ninja and a "spirit animal".

Spirit animals are mutant chakra animals.

Ninja are mutant chakra humans. Humans are animals.

Ergo, logically, two ninja could be bound to the contract as well and summon each other. It's just probably not done for some reason or another (likely being a trust issue or a secret that a few keep to have advantage over others). It works because Gaara would never /think/ of binding himself to another creature (a weaker one is a pointless tool, a more powerful one is a threat).

In a certain RPG campaign of mine I have a similar setup, where there is a sort of 'feudal system' of oaths from weaker to more powerful individuals, so that when some higher power individuals not part of the sytem (ie: rogue players) decide to go on a killing spree, the 'inferior' leaders can summon higher-power help to deal with the threat.

If Rational Naruto ever gets friends he can honestly trust, they might work out a similar system amongst themselves to call on the others when they are needed in combat, when one is abducted, or simply for fast travel between locations. Could easily see some individuals basically being 'travel hubs' and their job being to make these contracts with people willing to pay, and just charge them for quick transfer to their location.
