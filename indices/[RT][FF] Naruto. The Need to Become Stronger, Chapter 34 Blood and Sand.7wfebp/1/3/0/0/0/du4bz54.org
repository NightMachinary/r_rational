Yup, it is - unsealing only takes an infusion of chakra, sealing requires actual sealing expertise. That's not what Naruto did here, though: He grabbed the bloody sand of the arena, summoned a tadpole, had the tadpole swallow the vial with blood, unsummoned the tadpole, resummoned it with his real body in Jiraiya's bedroom and recovered the vial.

(Other reason why the cloned scroll trick wouldn't work: You can't seal chakra, and blood definitely contains chakra)
