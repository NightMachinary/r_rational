Either there was another frog involved (he was hiding a tadpole again?), or I'm forgetting something and Jiraiya and Naruto can summon each other now.

edit: or maybe people just count as a class of chakra entity, and he added 'Gaara' to the Frog scroll. Or maybe only jinchuuriki do, or the Tailed Beast itself once it was unleashed.
