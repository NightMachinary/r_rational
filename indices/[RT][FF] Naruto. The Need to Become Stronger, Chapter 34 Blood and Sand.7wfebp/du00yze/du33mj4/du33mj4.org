I realize this was still a bit vague, so I went ahead an edited the Spirits chapter to make it a bit clearer how this works:

  He frowned, considering the issue. /Chakra has to be in contact with the thing you change... but in the case of the summoning technique, you're not influencing the toad but space itself, making it so that the distance between you and the toad is effectively zero. Could it be that the space just... snaps back after a while?/

  He tapped the sealing scroll thoughtfully. “Dad, you said you need this contract because otherwise the toads wouldn't agree to come, right? But we managed to summon Iruka without even knowing it would happen, so does that mean it's the contract seal itself that determines who you summon? Like, since my blood is in there now along with the toads', does that mean I could be summoned as well?”

  “Sure,” said Jiraiya, “that's called the reverse summoning technique. Well, truth be told it's really just the same technique but with the destination and origin swapped. Won't do you much good unless you somehow were to find a toad that can cast it for you though, since there's really not much point in you summoning yourself to your own location. Plus the more powerful your target is the more chakra you need, and so to summon yourself you'd need to be stronger than yourself, which is kind of impossible.”

  Naruto nodded slowly. Jiraiya was clearly still thinking of the technique as being a literal contract between ninjas and spirits, but what he said matched with Naruto's understanding: If the technique really just bent space so as to set the distance between the caster and the target to zero, then it made perfect sense that you'd be able to summon yourself to your target as well -- though apparently the cost depended on how much chakra was being moved around, somehow? That was weird.

  The theory seemed plausible, but he remembered Kakashi's lesson about always looking underneath the underneath, and so he kept on thinking. /What else could make the summoned animal teleport back like that? Maybe the technique itself is designed to do that? But why would it do that, and even if that's the case, how could I tell?/

I hope that makes things a bit clearer. I'm always reluctant to give too much exposition like this since it can cause the scene to just go on and on and lose all momentum as a result, but in this case I think it's kind of necessary to make the resolution in this chapter 'fair'.

Next chapter will also explain how Naruto summoned Gaara even though, in accordance with the above, that should have cost a stupidly impossible amount of chakra. (Hint: Naruto figured out the real reason for the "that was weird" bit)
