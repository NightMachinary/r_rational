Okay, this fight scene was awesome, and the camaraderie beforehand was heartwarming. I was glad to see that there is a limitation to how many explosive-Narutos he can field (at least I interpreted the text as saying that a clone's chakra is used up in the explosion rather than returned to him). I'm undecided regarding how I feel about this development on a thematic or character level. I think I will be a little unsatisfied if this is the emotional / dramatic climax of this Arc, even though it was very enjoyable as a chapter and did a bunch of good things (e.g. payoff of Naruto's training, relationship development along the Konoha 12, Naruto revealing himself as a genius in a way that could change things going forward). I think this is because the characters' philosophies/motivations were not fully "in contact".

Also, I have no idea how Sasuke could keep up with this Naruto. I guess I wouldn't have expected Sakura to perform as well as she did though.
