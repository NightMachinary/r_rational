Well, it's true that Sasuke has a disadvantage relative to canon since in NTBS they're both brilliant, but you have to remember that Naruto's brand of rationality revolves around showing off his uber sekkrit techniques in front of the entire world while nobody ever actually saw Sasuke beat Neji. So I wouldn't count him out.

You have a point about the character's philosophies not being 'in contact' - I kind of oscilated between wanting Gaara to represent insanity and wanting him to be this deadly anti-rationalist, and I guess the end result just isn't as interesting to a rationalist audience.

Oh well, the villains are only going to get smarter and more rational as the story progresses, so there should be plenty of fun conflict down the line.
