I completely agree with most of your post, and completely disagree with the last paragraph/sentence.

Rational Naruto appears to be the first to /publicly/ pull this stunt. He may have been the absolute first, for all we know, but all we've /seen/ is this part.

Once it becomes public knowledge, it's not all that difficult to begin designing countermeasures for it. The fact that it requires a very specific set of circumstances for a single user to pull off means that it pretty much /requires/ specific assassin teams to pull it off.

True, the lower level people will look on in amazement at first. They might suddenly know a kind of fear they didn't before, and be very careful about what happens with their blood. The really high level types will already either know about the technique or already know numerous countermeasures to deal with it. Likely they would go for a political solution, putting it on the same level of nuclear weapons in the real world, a Mutually Assured Destruction sort of thing--if a team from your village uses this, everyone else will use it on you to re-establish the status quo. Because if they don't, and /if/ it's as easy to pull off as some posters like to think, then it can't be anything other than the spark of the next Ninja World War.

Now, the big question is, in this Rational Naruto World, do many things from the series carry over? Summoning a person or other powerful chakra being can actually be resisted, with the technique failing or pulling in a different creature entirely. Shadow Clones can be sent instead of the original, for those who know the technique. For those who attempt a summon without having a contract, they are "summoned" to the land of the animals to which they share the greatest affinity. The Summon works in reverse where the /other/ party can summon the one who is normally the summoner. (This latter one, in particular, could be very bad news for would-be assassins as their summoner gets pulled in and splattered by someone more powerful.) Finally, aside from those with a very specific ability, you can only have one 'type' of summon active at a time as the pact is considered 'active'. IE: If you are already bound to a summon, you summon the smallest, least chakra-intensive form of creature to maintain on your person to prevent others from summoning you. Alternatively, you work out a deal where the more powerful ones summon /you/ so you can sleep in their land and not get bushwhacked.

All of that, however, is based on the OC and not the rational fiction we're reading, so we don't know if any of that actually applies or if its all misconception.
