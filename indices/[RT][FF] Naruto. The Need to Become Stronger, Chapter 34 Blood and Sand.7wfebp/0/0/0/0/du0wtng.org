Yeah, but the thing is... this is /rationalist/ fiction. So we assume that the world has an element of common sense and that the people that inhabit it aren't stupid.

Everyone can see that he used a summoning jutsu, a Wind-charged sword, and shadow clones to create the effect.

People see that there were /two/ Narutos that pulled off the effect. One did the summon, the other did the sword. While the Shadow Clone jutsu is fairly rare, to the point of learning it practically being a State secret, the effects of it are obvious, as we've seen through numerous battles in the arena. About five seconds in, even the most untrained, chakra-less mortal can tell that they actually affect the physical world, unlike the illusion 'standard' Clone jutsu. Thus, anyone who has seen it knows that Shadow Clones are involved. If the other guy can't do Shadow Clones, likely you're not going to have to worry. If you only see /one/ opponent, chances are he's not using Shadow Clones.

People who don't know about summoning jutsu are sort of left in the dark. However, has a distinctive effect that can be seen at a fairly decent distance, and once someone has seen it, they simply talk with the majority of ninja who know of the technique, because the effects of that sort of thing (even if not the specifics of how to accomplish it) are taught at the low-level ninja academies. So the bit about the blood and the pact and such is fairly common knowledge.

The Wind-infused blade is a lot more specific. This is one of those things where knowledge and deduction can lead you to the truth. For people unaware of the blade, they are equally unaware of Gaara's use of infused sand as an armor. As far as they can tell, it's a kid with a sword cutting open another unarmored kid. For those with sufficient knowledge, experience, or some bloodline trick (Sharingan, for instance), they can either figure it out on their own or have seen such a thing before. Gaara demonstrated his defense earlier, so seeing it here after others have failed to break through it and then seeing Naruto pull it off narrows down the possibilities. The sand didn't get ripped loose, it didn't get scorched or drenched, there was no obvious light or darkness effects present. The only other alternative is Wind-infused chakra weapons. The ability to use such a thing is fairly rare, and would likely be limited to specific individuals and perhaps a certain Village that focuses on it. In most cases, you can tell a person's elemental affinity by the attacks they use. If things tend to get cut without anything visible touching them, or in this case if they have a blade that can cut through infused sand armor, it's a fair bet they are using Wind. If they also have a sword, well... you should know that very few forms of armor or defense are going to matter.

So, to sum it up, most people can see the effects and, if they have even a basic level of knowledge about ninja jutsu and techniques, they can put the pieces together. Being able to figure out /what/ he's doing versus /how/ he did it is another story, and another level again more difficult to actually copy it unless you are randomly blessed with a series of /very specific/ gifts or are already stupidly powerful and experience.

As for defending against a /Teleport/-based attack, if you've watched enough anime, you generally know that if the other guy is a teleporter, he's going to appear behind you. And if he's can teleport /you/, he's likely going to pull you into melee range. In either case, the defense is fairly straightforward--stay moving, and have your weapon in a 'guard' position in front of you. If you get teleported, surge forward. You will either close into melee range with the other guy and it's a normal fight (hey, he saved you time getting close!) or the guy who teleported behind you is now chasing you at a distance and has wasted power to do it.
