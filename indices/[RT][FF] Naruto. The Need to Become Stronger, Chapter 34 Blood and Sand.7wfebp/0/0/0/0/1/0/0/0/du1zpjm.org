So, lemme get this straight... according to that wiki, the Multiple Shadow Clone is on the secret scroll... /but/ Naruto reads it and uses the /standard/ Shadow Clone technique when he doesn't make 'hundreds' of copies of himself. But it's a separate technique to just make one or two, the technique is not on the scroll, and yet Naruto can do it without ever having studied it.

Yeah, I'm going to go with the rational deduction that it's the /same technique/, different only in how many clones you attempt to create in one go. You're free to call that fanfiction if you like.
