Or, you know, it's just the same technique with an effect that is like:

/"Create X Shadow Clones. Each will have 1/X of your chakra."/

Sane people are like: "Well, I /could/ make X = 100, but that would be silly as it would kill me, or at least knock me out."

Naruto is like: "1/X? I'm just gonna make 1,000 Shadow Clones! *Believe it!*"
