but the important part isn't the wind-sword, it's the teleporting, and the fact that's it's possible. If you're fighting more than one opponent, then suddently it's a possiblity.

And they could just as easily teleport you into a trap. There was nothing but time/dramatics stopping Naruto from covering an area in exploding tags, and then using a clone to teleport Gaara into that and immediately blowing it up. Keeping moving is not really the counter to someone who can teleport you against your will, and has shadow clones. You could be teleported into any kind of dangerous trap, because the clone doing the summoning is expendable, and your real body is not; the wind-fused chakra weapon is not the issue an opponent would face.

And I've already posted something above about how teams of shinobi would love to use this, pooling specialties to gain the necessary effect.

So I still think that while Naruto's move did require a lot of set up and maybe isn't a game breaker on the individual scale, it definitely changes things on a wider scale (what a Village, or even a team can do to an individual enemy), and isn't countered by what you've suggested here.
