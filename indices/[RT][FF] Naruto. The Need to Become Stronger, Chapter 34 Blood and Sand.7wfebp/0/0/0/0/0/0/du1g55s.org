The wind sword is important as it cuts through the chakra-infused material armor. Note that even when teleported, Rational Gaara /still had his sand armor/. The opponent does, indeed, keep several forms of defense, they aren't just teleported naked next to you to be slaughtered at will.

It's a possibility that requires several /very specific/ steps I listed, that you conveniently ignored. Acquisition of the blood, putting it on the scroll, use of the jutsu which itself requires the user to expend large amounts of chakra and focus on something /other/ than fighting for the time necessary to employ it, etc.

Actually, there was plenty stopping Naruto from doing that. For one, he had already expended a large amount of chakra trying /just that/, minus the teleportation. For another, it was his first time fighting the guy. If he didn't have Shadow Clones and already place his 'real' body outside the arena it wouldn't have worked. Which means any potential user has to go through some crazy setup before a fight and get lucky enough /not to be attacked/ before their Clone can Clone itself... you know, like be in an arena fight where you don't attack until a neutral third party says "fight".

Sure, keeping moving is a solution. Because in a normal fight, keeping your head and not standing there going "Whaaaat?" is usually a good plan. Speed is life, as it were. See, for your 'super trap' to work where it's teleported in by a clone, you have to have had an encounter where you acquired some of their blood previously, as well as having gone through the ritual summon binding process. Then you have to setup this trap. Then you have to put your clone in it. Then your clone has to have enough chakra to pull off the summoning. /Then/ the target has to be caught by surprise and not resist it, or be using a shadow clone of their own, /or/ have another way of smashing a path out with some jutsu, /or/ have a teleportation jutsu of their own.

See, once these tactics become known, people quickly find ways to counter or at least reduce their effectiveness. At least, in a rational world, anyway.

Yes, teams of shinobi might be able to pull this off. But if it's a team going after /one target/, there are many other effective ways they can pull that off too. This would just be one tool in an arsenal.
