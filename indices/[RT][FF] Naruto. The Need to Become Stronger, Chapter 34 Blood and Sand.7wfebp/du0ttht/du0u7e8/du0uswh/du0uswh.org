  Nah, it has limitations.

Yes, it does. And we know that. The thing is, no one in story knows it. Naruto used shadow clones to hide what he was doing generally, and a transformation to hide from the Byakugan. No one knows what Naruto did, or how, with the possible exception of Gaara who's dead now anyways. What everyone else saw was Naruto fighting, talking, and then near the end he decides that he can suddenly teleport other people out of all their defenses and eviscerate them. Everyone worth mentioning probably knows that whatever he did has limitations, but that's academic if no one knows what those limitations /are/. As it stands right now, it looks like Naruto could teleport anyone he doesn't like onto the point of a sword, and no one knows how to defend against it. That's fucking terrifying for anyone not affiliated with Konoha.

The wind blade thing isn't terribly unique, but the counter to it is to not engage in melee while the other guy wastes chakra maintaining it. Blocking such an attack is infeasible for opponents of similar skill levels.
