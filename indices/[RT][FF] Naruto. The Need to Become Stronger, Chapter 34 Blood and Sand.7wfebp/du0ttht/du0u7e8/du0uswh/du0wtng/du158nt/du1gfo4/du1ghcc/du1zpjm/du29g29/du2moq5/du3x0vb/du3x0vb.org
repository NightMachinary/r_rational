Ackhtually Naruto shouts both randomly, but the wikipage of the mass version says:

#+begin_quote
  Sometimes Naruto simply refers to this technique as just the "Shadow Clone Technique", regardless of how many clones he creates.

  Naruto learned the technique from the scroll of forbidden seals.
#+end_quote

So he learned the multiple thing, but can also obviously use it to make single clones too.

Probably there is a single clone tech that better optimized for chakra, but Naruto doesn't care.
