Nah, it has limitations.

You have to have some of their blood.

You have to both know and be capable of the summoning jutsu. You also have to find some point where you can put their blood and symbols onto the scroll prior to attempting the summoning.

You have to have sufficient chakra to do it /and/ catch them by surprise. If they know you are trying it, they can offer up resistance.

The sword is like a /sharingan/ focus. Instead of being a ball of random cutting bits of wind, it's all focused along the edge of the sword. You have to have an affinity for /Wind/ (as Naruto does) to use it without requiring hideous amounts of chakra.

Putting all that together, to pull of this trick, you need to have access to a large amount of chakra (say, by being already very powerful and experienced with many other techniques, or by being the host of a Tailed Beast), you have to be able to be in multiple locations at once (ie: Shadow Clones, not the usual illusion kind), you have to have access to a summoning scroll, you have to have access to the target's blood, you have to have spare time to apply said blood to the summoning scroll, you have to have a way to enchant your weapon with a large amount of a very specific type of chakra to cut through the defenses while simultaneously being able to use a large amount of chakra to summon someone against their will.

In short, /very/ few people could reliably pull it off. In fact, unless you're Naruto, you pretty much have to be a Kage or Sanin to even stand a chance.

Also, if you know you're going to fight Rational Naruto, know that you get one shot and you'd better not bleed.

Finally, the Shadow Clone is itself a counter, if we're running off similar mechanics to the show. At one point Naruto was reverse-summoned when he had a Shadow Clone out and he chose to have the clone go in his stead.
