Or you could get around all of these limitations by being a Village, rather than one person.

This is the kind of technique that an assassination or kill/capture squad would love. From Shino giving Naruto chakra with his bugs we know that it is possible to share energy between people. And in any fight it is definitely easier to cut somebody once with your sword than it is to kill them. And then only one person needs to know the summoning technique/have a scroll to make it work. We don't know if this is the kind of technique that can be resisted normally, or that requires a specific countermeasure or technique to stop (like you can't just 'flare your chakra' or something; you have to be carrying a counterseal, or be performing something like shushin or something to 'dodge' it); either way, both could make the brief distraction offered by genjutsu a lot more deadly.

Anyway, what I'm really trying to say is that, from the looks of what Naruto just did, the ninja world should never quite be the same (unless it really is different in a way Naruto hasn't seen yet). If Naruto is the first person to have put his puzzle, then the world will change slightly in his wake. And if not, than the whole Cloud trying to kidnap Hinata incident must have gone down a lot differently. It'd be a lot easier for a kidnapping team to just acquire some of her blood and then teleport her just outside the village walls, rather than try to carry her out physically. In fact it would have been very easy for Hizashi to get that blood.

Either way, this technique opens up so many doors for teams of weaker ninja to catch stronger ones by surprise, and bypasses almost every kind of security we've seen so far if done correctly.
