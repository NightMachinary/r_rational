  I love a lot of Kipling's works, particularly Kim and the Jungle book. He's a damn good writer, capable of evoking an extraordinary vivid image in unbelievably few words.

I agree. Despite the occasional foray into nationalistic fervor, his work is great. It can be incredibly biting as well, with a level of sarcastic humor on par with modern parody acts like Colbert or Stewart.

My favorite example of the latter is his poem [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_the_Light_Brigade][The Last of the Light Brigade]], a direct response to Tennyson's classic poem, and a condemnation of the kind of use 'em and forget 'em policies towards veterans that still is relevant today.
