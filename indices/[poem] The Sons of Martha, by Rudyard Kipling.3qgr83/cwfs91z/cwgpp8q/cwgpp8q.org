From memory, Jesus came to the house of two sisters, Mary and Martha, early in the afternoon. Martha worked to make the house ready for him, and did all the chores and cooked dinner and all that. Mary sat with Christ and listened to his lessons, and Martha got pissed that Mary wasn't helping her. Jesus said basically that Mary was the better of the sisters, because she recognized that the word of the Lord was the more important.

Any or all of that could be incorrect or misleading.
