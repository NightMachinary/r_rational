I tend to avoid things that are popular (regardless of the quality of said fanbase) because I dislike being inundated with the topic; when something becomes all I hear about, I tend to avoid it because I'm tired of hearing about it and have lost any interest in the subject I could have had. I didn't every think the game was bad, and most of the fans of the game I interested with were my own friends, I just grew tired of hearing about the game, and by extension, the game itself.
