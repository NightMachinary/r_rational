I'm gonna go against the grain here, I didn't enjoy it very much. Very very slow paced and constantly descending into melodrama. The one good part is that it really manages to give a satisfying explanation to the Gaster deal in the original game, so it's not a complete waste, but I really don't recommend this to anyone who doesn't care about that.
