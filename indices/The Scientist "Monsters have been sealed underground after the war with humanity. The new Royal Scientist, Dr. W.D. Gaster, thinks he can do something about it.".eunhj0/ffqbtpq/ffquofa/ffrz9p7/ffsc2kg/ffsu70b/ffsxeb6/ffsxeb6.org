Seems like kinda a waste to avoid something just because a few assholes like it. No matter what you like, there are probably assholes who like that too; it doesn't mean the work itself is bad. I do understand the hesitation though. The toxic part of the fanbase is pretty much gone now, though I think it was a small minority anyway. In my opinion the majority of the toxic undertale "fans" were less fans of undertale itself and more children who liked youtubers who played it.
