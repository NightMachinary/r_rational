  The failure wasn't obvious at first---Lady Mary's silence was somewhat believably motivated---but I had the disappointing premonition that Fellowes was going to stick with shallow, contrived tropes to tell his story...and that premonition was confirmed in spades within the first five minutes of the second series, when the story quality took a totally predictable nose dive, and the contrived tension was maintained for the whole remainder of that series.

If you don't mind me asking, what happened in the first five minutes of season 2 that turned you off?
