Yeah. The tipping point when the intriguing / dross ratio flips from "worth it" to "not worth it" usually doesn't occur until near the end, or at the end of the story, because you keep holding out hope. It would be nice if there was a registry somewhere of stories (novels, movies, TV, theatre, etc.) analysed from the POV of whether the story fails at being rational, and if it does, if it's still worth a thinking person's time, because there are enough interesting ideas. I'd subscribe to a blog feed on that topic. :)
