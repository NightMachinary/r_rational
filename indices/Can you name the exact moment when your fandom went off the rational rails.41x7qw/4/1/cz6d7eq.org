What bothered me personally about the latest Stevenbomb was that, while the show is usually great at showing realistic, complex emotional reactions, Peridot's decision to join the Crystal Gems felt really weird. Just an episode earlier she was gushing over how much she would like the Earth to be 'homeworldformed'. The order the episodes aired made it seem like what convinced her to join the CGs was the verbal abuse she received from the Gems in the moon base, and that has rather unfortunate implications. The flashback episode doesn't fit Peridot's behaviour in the moon base at all, and Peridot has spent her entire life on Homeworld, so she must have experienced not being treated like an individual at all before the message from YD.
