I understand where you're coming from, but I think Steven Universe focuses on the atmosphere, and the atmosphere feels properly totalitarian. On the balance, I don't think this is enough to shift the story from sci-fi to fantasy. Sci-fi doesn't have to be perfectly realistic.

Defining genres is based to some degree on preference though, so I think we can agree to disagree.
