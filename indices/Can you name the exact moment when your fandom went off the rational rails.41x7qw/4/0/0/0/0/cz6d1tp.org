To me, at least, it is pretty obvious that the rebellion ended with some form of orbital bombardment which Rose and Co. only survived because of Rose's shield. Essentially they are the last Gems left on Earth.

And yeah, they did nothing of "importance." All of their friends were dead, and they had the fallout of a war to clean up --- Rose was still their leader, and probably wanted to restore Earth to what it was.
