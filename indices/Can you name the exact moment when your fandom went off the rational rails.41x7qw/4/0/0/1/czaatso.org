It's not clear that they have a 300 billion population galaxy (or multiple galaxies). There's a lot of Steven Universe that implies the Homeworld Gem population count is fairly restricted : the size of the Kindergartens, the scale of structures like the Ancient Colony Ship and Galaxy Warp, and much of the background art on Gem architecture. Peridot's identification scheme could theoretically extend to ~78 billion Peridots, but the way it's formatted suggests that use of the address space is probably two orders of magnitude lower, perhaps even three, and she's one of the single most common gem types. Even the Cluster, made from the remains of an intersystem war, is described in the mere millions of gem shards: these are scales that humans would wage war on by the mid-19th century, not what we'd expect from people like us a step up the Kardashev scale.

Homeworld Gems may do the Kingly thing because that's what the have the population (and where a Galaxy warp isn't established, communications technology) to actually implement.
