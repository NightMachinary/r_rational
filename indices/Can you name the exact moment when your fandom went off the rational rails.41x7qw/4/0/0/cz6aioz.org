That's not what I am saying.

I am saying: Governance doesn't look like that. The DA is made to be... Caricatures, perhaps, of totalitarianism. So far I have seen no evidence of them having the levels of hypercompetence it takes to govern just a single planet, to say nothing of multiple galaxies.

YD ought to have been surrounded by senior staff and advisers, shouting orders to and fro 24/7. You can't do the kingly thing and have an effective society that spans a galaxy at the same time --- the information bandwidth simply isn't high enough.

Take the PotUS for instance. Obama has aged two decades in two four-year terms. That's how taxing ruling a 300 mill.pop. country is. A 300 bill.pop. galaxy? Good luck having enough time to sit in a lighthouse with only a single servant by your side.
