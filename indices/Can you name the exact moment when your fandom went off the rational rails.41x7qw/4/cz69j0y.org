In the most recent bout of episodes of Steven Universe we get to know that the evil aliens have an inter/galactic/ empire and that the supposed supreme rulers are kinda goofy and not as competent as would be required to run a pan-galactic fascist government.

It's not an egregious example but it shunts the worldbuilding from sci-fi to space fantasy.
