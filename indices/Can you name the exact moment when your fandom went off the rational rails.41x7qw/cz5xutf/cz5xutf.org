Percy Jackson series. The first series felt pretty consistent and wonderful.

The second series...so many stupid and/or contrived moments.

A partial list:

1. the way Percy loses the Achilles Curse. It seems completely boneheaded of Hera to make her chosen champion vastly less effective and isn't explained/justified in any detail.

2. The completely underwhelming threat of the Giants which are dealt with extremely casually.

3. The completely overpowered monsters/spirits that possess a couple of characters once or twice, wreck their plans, and don't really show up again. Not foreshadowed in previous books, and basically only there to make the plot move.
