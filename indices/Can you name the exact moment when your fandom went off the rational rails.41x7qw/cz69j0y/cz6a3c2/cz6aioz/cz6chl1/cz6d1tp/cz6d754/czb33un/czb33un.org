You are foregoing alien psychology. The CG's might well be thousands of years old, and have had those same friends for just as long. Add in the fact that the next time Homeworld rears its ugly head, they will lose.

Essentially, they are comparable to people with terminal illnesses, but have lived and immortal existence beforehand. Everything they have fought for they will lose in the next conflict, no 'if's and 'but's.

An orbital bombardment that leaves humans alive is exactly 100Ã— more threatening than total obliteration. Ever heard of a smart bomb? A weapon with a sophisticated targeting system is infinitely more horrifying than a dumb projectile.

And yes, it's a given that the corrupted Gems regenerate at odd times and with enormous delays. Pearl took two weeks. No reason an insane Gem wouldn't take a leisurely two thousand years to get its shit together enough to form a giant murder monster.
