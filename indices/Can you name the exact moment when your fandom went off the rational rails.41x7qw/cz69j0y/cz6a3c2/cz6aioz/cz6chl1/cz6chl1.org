So all the other weird Steven Universe stuff does not bother you? Thats where you draw the line for suspension of suspension of disbelief?

I think the world and empire should look vastly different if they have semi-immortal hyper powerful psi-beings everywhere. What were the rebels up to in last 5000 years? Done apparently nothing of importance. Where is the stream of scientists, fans, and political advisors doing a pilgrimage to the temple?

And why would the empire retreat 5000 years? There are just 4 gems left! Thats not a rebel army. Send a scout ship once in a thousand years to check!
