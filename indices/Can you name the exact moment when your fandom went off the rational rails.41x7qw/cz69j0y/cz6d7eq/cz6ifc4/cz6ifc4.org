No, it was being treated poorly by YD in particular that caused Peridot to switch. Peridot came to appreciate Earth after the time she spent there. While she did think it would have been better for Earth to be completely Homeworldified rather than destroyed by the cluster, she came up with a compromise where everyone won. She switched because she realized that the homeworld leaders who she'd looked up to (and obviously never talked to before) wouldn't listen to reason and wanted to destroy Earth out of spite. I'm not sure what the problem with the flashback episode is either.
