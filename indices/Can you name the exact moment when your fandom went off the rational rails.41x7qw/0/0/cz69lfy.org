Aye... so often it turns out to be a blatant lie; there was never a master plan. There were never any explanations. The writers end up punishing viewers for trusting them and for trusting their curiosity.

It's funny, Valve have admitted that there is no set worldbuilding documents for Half Life and the plot wont be determined till they have specific gameplay experiences to fit it around. I know that the G-Man's story might not have ever been written, but I wont get off the HL3 hype train yet, because if there's anything this subreddit has taught me it's that a sufficiently creative rationalist can salvage any series.

We'll just see who they replace Mark Laidlaw with.
