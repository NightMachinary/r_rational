I'm in the process of deconstructing the wish-fullfillment 'people wake up transformed as X in the 'real world' ' fic.

In this case however that is not what is really happening at all, instead the characters in the story are some degree of accurate approximations of the minds/memories of people that were produced by what MIGHT have been a GAI. But quite possibly could have been something a lot less capable then a truly general self modifying intelligence.

The characters are in bodies that on the surface look like and even kind of work like jRPG monsters. But everything is smoke and mirrors and compact applications of technology.

So the story is less "wish fullfillment yay!" story and more "my life as a high tech theme park animatronic arriving a few decades earlier then the tech level should support it"
