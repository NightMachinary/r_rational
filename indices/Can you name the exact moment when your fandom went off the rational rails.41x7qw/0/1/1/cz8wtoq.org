BSG started out with perfectly "explainable" mysticism based on character motivations. Or, if it wasn't explained it didn't determine everything.

I didn't need it to really be explained either but it became a tumor that grew and swallowed everything.

The easiest thing to do would be to simply leave it as something the characters believe but the show is agnostic to, the way they started out.

The problem was -and I think the admitted this- they had an idea they felt was soooo brilliant they had to throw it against the wall and see if it sticked. No planning, nothing. Just..do it, for fun

The ironic thing here is that BSG is brilliant because the creator ran from all the dumb things in Star Trek that frustrated him. No damage lasting more than a week, no character or arc planning and no consistency. And he falls back into the trap.
