Exactly the same problem as BSG, but a lot more frustrating, because at least BSG had a good strong first half of (relatively) hard sci-fi. Lost started out propelled by a boatload of mysteries, it solved maybe 2% of them (but only to push the plot forward with more mysteries), and then it pulled a bunch of hand-wavy, maybe-if-we-confuse-you-you'll-think-that-we-solved-the-mysteries-but-you-just-missed-it crap, and then there was a totally nonsensical mystical ending and /poof/, the whole house of cards collapsed into the nothing it was.

Totally wasted all the viewers' intellects and emotional investment in the characters. I heard a recent NPR article where Lost's show runners gave an interview, and they said that they wanted to explore the concept of frustration and unresolved storytelling. That was their goal from the beginning, they claim. Of course, they never warned the viewers of that, and really, I think the show runners were just covering up the fact that they invented a compelling, refillable concept (great for TV executives to buy into!), but they had no idea where they were going, ran out of steam, didn't have any answers for the mysteries they posited, and crapped out.

Like The X-Files.

Really, show runners need to figure out the whole story before they start airing the first episode. They don't have to have all the details worked out, but if they don't have a solid idea of where they're going to end up, they shouldn't waste our time with a filmed WIP that has no ending, really.

JMS did a great job with Babylon 5 (although the fifth season was shaky, but there were reasons for that that were outside of his control). Why aren't more people telling high-quality, long-term stories on TV? Why are we putting up with all this half-assed storytelling?
