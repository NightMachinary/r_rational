The first two seasons are good. Them being forced into episodic content hurt the third and the fourth had some great episodes with an ending that was the TV equivalent of the essay due tomorrow you write at 11.

Seriously, the writer talked about sitting down, and having no idea how to wrap it up and then just blasting it out.
