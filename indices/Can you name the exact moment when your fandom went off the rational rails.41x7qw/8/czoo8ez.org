Eragon. Where do you begin???

edit: For me, up until the final book, it could have been saved. But that was just the nail in the coffin. Between the deus ex machina powerups and downs, the inexplicable killing-off of the centuries-old magic, telekinetic, and super-strong elf queen only for her killer to be revenge-killed by a normal human, and then the frantic shoehorning of the last third of the novel's events to fit the prophecy - kind of - from the first book... there wasn't really a shred of sense in it by the finale.

Suffered greatly from poor plotting in advance, which led to struggling to very quickly set up the endgame with no... setup.
