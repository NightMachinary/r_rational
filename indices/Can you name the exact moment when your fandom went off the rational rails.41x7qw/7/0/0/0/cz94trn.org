If you do, please feel free to make suggestions for improvement. I welcome all feedback, including critique.

Haha on "I feel like Fellowes decided he was writing a bad soap before anyone else realized". And I think when people realized, they got off the train ASAP. (That's part of my theory as to why Dan Stevens bailed---he was given the most embarrassing, telenovela drek to act out.) Writing shallow plot lines is a common thing with Fellowes, unfortunately. Ah well, tons of people loved watching the show for its costumes and sets and beloved actors, so at least there's that. :)
