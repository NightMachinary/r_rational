We learn that:

- Matthew has been avoiding everyone in the Crawley family, except for his mother, for /two years/. (Really? So he had a falling out with Mary and he's stopped talking to /everyone?/)
- Matthew has gotten engaged to some new, offscreen female character that he only met once, very briefly.
- Mary is getting herself entangled with a new, offscreen male character that apparently nobody likes, including herself.

Setting aside the contrived and implausible nature of this situation, let's imagine how this will play out, shall we? There will be a tedious love quadrangle (because obviously Matthew and Mary are endgame) for the entire season, where we do not become emotionally invested in the new characters and where most of the plot machinations surrounding Mary and Matthew involve getting the two new characters back out of the story again.

And, lo, that is exactly what happened (::yawn::). The male character was reduced to a bully and Matthew punched him (which was briefly satisfying, I admit), and the female character was conveniently killed off by the Spanish flu, which also conveniently spared all of the other characters that we know and love.

But, okay, lots of romances have this kind of extended will-they-or-won't-they structure. The thing that really irked me was that this shallow and predictable plot line dominated the Crawley family's half of the Series 2 plot, and the opportunity cost was immense. Julian Fellowes sacrificed the possibility of a deeper, more resonant treatment of WWI (which was, in effect, just a background contrivance to keep Matthew and Mary apart, and which Fellowes dispensed with in only /four/ episodes---by episode five, Matthew is home and we never see another war scene), and then Fellowes compounded his mistake by utterly wasting the dramatic opportunities inherent in the Matthew-paraplegia storyline, finally capping it off with a completely unbelievable miracle recovery. (Because of course we can't have our male romantic lead injured in any /real/ way as a result of living through /four years of war/.)

My tooth-grinding frustration with the terrible waste of a possibly fantastic storyline at least had one good outcome: it prompted me to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10078078/1/Trust-and-Providence][write the story that we /should/ have gotten]]. :)
