The Two Year Emperor, Suzy's ascension.

Her ascension itself was selfish, endangering the future of her civilisation for the sake of her getting the credit and power by not sharing her two-levels-higher thinking with the rest of the government.

Then, after her ascension, she continues to refuse the obvious route of asking the former protagonists for help, but instead wanders aimlessly, terrorising people and eventually committing genocide in a world where even 'always (chaotic) evil' is easily reversible with a mass-purchasable helmet of inverse alignment.
