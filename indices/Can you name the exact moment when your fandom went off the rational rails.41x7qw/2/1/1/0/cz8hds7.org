The said 10-15 episodes weren't that bad. (spoilers)

There were many hints for the viewer that painted a meticulous plan designed and implemented by someone hidden in the shadows, who was likely controlling either part of the country's administration or the entirety of it.

If the story was told from Primal Homunculus's perspective, and they didn't deliberately make him less likeable by giving him numerous villain balls, I think the premise [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot][could've made]] for an excellent story that was also relevant for this sub. And even with all its flaws, it was still better than the majority of anime shows out there (though I don't know if it's any measure of quality by your standards).
