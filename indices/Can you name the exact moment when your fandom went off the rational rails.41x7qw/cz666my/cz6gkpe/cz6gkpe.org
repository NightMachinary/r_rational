I am currently watching FMA: Brotherhood. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdActStupidity][Third Act Stupidity]] in this show comes into play barely some 10-15 episodes into the story: the antagonists are just so much more powerful than the main characters that they have to sabotage their own plans by one stupid decision or another almost at least once per episode.

edit: Same thing happened in the later Hunter x Hunter arcs.
