I think Ra (and Fine Structure to an extent) was constantly going off the rails in every way. The author can't seem to keep his stories "grounded" if that makes sense. He needs to constantly raise levels of complexity for some reason, eventually going past what's enjoyable.

Still really enjoyable as a whole, I have to admit.
