I've actually started coming back round to LOST.

I think the problem was that the creators lied and claimed that everything would have a hard science explanation iirc.

The end of the series wrapped most of it up /somewhat/. But it wasn't really a scifi or a scifi-tinged show at that point.

I think Lost also managed the transition from "character-based show with weird mysticism" to 'show driven by mystical shit" better than BSG, where it was just a pure asspull
