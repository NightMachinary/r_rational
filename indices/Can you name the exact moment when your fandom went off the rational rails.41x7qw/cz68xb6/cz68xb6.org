Battlestar Galactica is probably the single most promising half of a sci-fi show I've ever seen, followed by the most disappointing. Without spoiling details, it built a great world full of rich characters, compelling plots, and exciting mysteries, and tied them all to a single, nonsensical, contradictory deus-ex-machina reveal.

Now anytime a show promises that there is some "master plan" that will be eventually revealed, I just have a sinking feeling of deja vu and save myself some heartache by predicting that the writers are backing themselves into a corner that they don't intelligently know how to get out of.
