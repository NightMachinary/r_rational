Yeah, I had that same feeling with BSG. Whenever sci-fi writers crap out with a mystical angle, it always leaves me with a disappointed, hollow feeling. I don't mind a little bit of mysticism in my sci-fi---after all, any sufficiently advanced tech is indistinguishable from magic, right?---but I don't want the mysticism to be the lynchpin "revelation" of the whole master plan.

Arthur C. Clarke walked this sci-fi/mysticism line in his writings, and sometimes he did it well (/Childhood's End/) and sometimes he did it poorly (/2001: A Space Odyssey/). Figuring out exactly why one works and the other does not is a fascinating question...
