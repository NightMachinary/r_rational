Personally I enjoyed the second series more than the first due to its more mature characters and themes, but both series suffered from plot contrivances in my recollection. The major issue I had with the second series was how much it of it was driven by prophecy. I've gone on rants before about how every story with a prophecy in it would be better without one, but the Heroes of Olympus series in particular uses it as a crutch to propel the plot.
