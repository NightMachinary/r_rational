Yeah.

This might need an introduction. So, Alicorn wrote her [[http://luminous.elcenia.com/][Twilight rationalfanfic]] a while back. Soon after, she and a friend started something called [[http://belltower.dreamwidth.org/8579.html][Effulgence]] where they threw that fic's Bella at a number of other universes, mostly fanfictional. The link has more info.

This has spawned "glowfic," which is a series of this style of RP between many people and many other people. [[http://alicorn.elcenia.com/board/index.php][Alicorn's forum]] is a little hub for glowfic, as is [[http://alicornutopia.dreamwidth.org/][Alicorn's index]] and [[http://glowfic.dreamwidth.org/][the dreamwidth glowfic community]].

Which brings us to [[http://peterverse.dreamwidth.org/][my very own glowfic index]], where I mostly throw this one character called Sadde at other places and people. It may not make sense without knowing the source material, and some may not make sense without having read Effulgence.

And before I forget, a lot of glowfic happens via Milliways, the bar at the end of the universe (which universe is anyone's guess), whose door replaces (mostly) random doors in (mostly) random universes at (mostly) random times. When someone goes through that door to Milliways, time in their home universe is paused until they return or until Milliways decides that they won't be able to. The bar, for that matter, is sapient, and talks to people via notes on napkins. People's first drink is free, the rest is paid with origin-appropriate prices (i.e. a character from a given world will use currency from that world to pay for stuff, at culturally appropriate prices).

Ummm, I think that's it!
