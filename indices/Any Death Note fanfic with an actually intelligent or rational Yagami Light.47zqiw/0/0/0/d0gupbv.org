I'm reminded! And alive!

Mostly the problem is that I... lost momentum, in a way? And I've gotten better at writing since then, I want to rewrite the ten chapters already published and then continue, I have a plot in my head and all, just. Ugh field, life terribly busy, my fiction-writing needs are being satisfied by glowfic, that kinda thing.

I have a tab open on my tumblr where someone asked me to continue to remind myself and slowly give me courage and desire do go on, but I can't hold myself to an ETA at the moment :x
