Well the true nature of the world of minecraft is really quite simple.

It's a true world in a fold of the §f§k§a§b.

Did you even read [[http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=z7anmVSu][the end poem]]?

Seriously though, You definitely wouldn't want all the minecraft rules to apply, but a naturally evolved life-as-we-know-it-friendly world where floating is the default might be workable. I recall the mechanics of the world of Unicorn Jelly were such that large bodies naturally floated, and only smaller things fell.

To quote from the [[http://unicornjelly.com/physics.html][official physics primer of that universe]]:

  In Tryslmaistan, gravity operates on a different principle than in our universe. The cosmos is striated, and these dimensional lines in the crystalline structure of Tryslmaistan space-time force gravity into a single direction, to which mass -on the planetary scale or above- is irrelevant. This effectively means that there is an absolute up, and an absolute down, and no such thing as zero gravity. One can literally fall forever. There is no vacuum. Air fills the universe from forever to forever. However, a secondary force operates on the macro scale, and it only begins to become inescapable to objects that are 100 kilometers and above. This force is the dominating 'Reticutriational Force'. Essentially, it freezes all massive universe structures -such as world plates- into a lattice, and is so powerful on the macro scale that it easily overcomes the 'striation gravity' unique to Tryslmaistan. Just as in our own universe, cosmic forces operate on different scales, in counterintuitive ways. Where we have the Strong and the Weak nuclear Forces that only operate on the subatomic scale, gravity on the macro scale, and quantum effects at the smallest scale, Tryslmaistan has Reticutriation, Trinal Paravection, Planovection, and so forth.

Actually on second thought maybe unicorn jelly isn't a good example of a nice simple alternate cosmology after all...
