  You don't need to invoke "science" or use words that sound scientific enough for your miracle metal. Readers will suspend disbelief as long as the material has a defined set of qualities and rules it will follow and strays from neither. Else you risk fake explanations.

The world /has/ science though, and to as great a degree as I'm able, still follows all of the regular laws of /our/ universe. So I wanted to ground it as much as I could in science. Its a naturally occurring liquid superconductor.

  The ash is overused and "aetherium" calls back to its writer rather than a name arrived at organically.

The ash? Not sure what you're referring to here.

  The aether as a concept is Greek and the nomenclature: "-ium" is Latin, so unless this fantasy world has been colonized by humanity or is somehow alt-Earth history it probably isn't explicitly called "aetherium" and even its translation would be improbable to translate literally into "aetherium."

I went with 'aether' as the base to connect to its properties related to the island's levitation, and the -ium ending because its an element. I know its not 'goldium' and so yes, if it was a material that's been around awhile, it would probably have a simpler name. That being said, 'floatstone' is the material that was attributed to the island's lift. Pure aetherium was only discovered within the last few hundred years of the world.

  Admittedly a possible solution to its improbable naming is a global scientific authority whose nomenclature is used uniformly or at least by a sufficient majority but even then the material is likely to be commonly called by its most populous historical name, a la "floatstone."

This is pretty much it exactly. The Libarium of Goeth is /the/ leading scientific body on the planet in present times, and has been at the forefront for close to a thousand years. Their terminology is very widely accepted. You're correct though that the populous name is probably more commonly used. Floatstone essentially acts as a catch-all term for the basement rocks that underlie all the rest of the material on the islands.
