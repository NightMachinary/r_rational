  The aether as a concept is Greek and the nomenclature: "-ium" is Latin,

"Aether" is a word in Latin, and it's even spelled the same way. (The Greek version is aιθηρ which is closer to "aither"). "Aetherium" can be a Latin-derived word, the etymology makes about as much sense as I'd expect.

By the way "Aetherium" has been used in fiction before. [[/u/Sagebrysh]], you don't have to change it just because of that, but it's a good idea to get in the habit of Googling your made-up words in case they're Korean swear words or something. "Etherium", for example, would be right out since it's the title of a recently-released RTS game.
