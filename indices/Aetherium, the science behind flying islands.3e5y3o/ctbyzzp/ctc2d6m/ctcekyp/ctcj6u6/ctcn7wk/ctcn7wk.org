Chatoyance's older stuff is kind of weird like that. A lot of amateur writers feel the need to fit their strange worlds into soft-science explanations - to pick an example that I noticed earlier, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/3e4how/is_a_region_of_eternal_night_possible/][this recent post]] in [[/r/worldbuilding]] asks how to physically justify a planet where one nation experiences eternal night while the rest has a normal-ish day/night cycle. Such settings take real-life physics and just staple "extras" onto it where they need something that real-life physics can't provide, like magic or FTL. The cosmology is assumed to be [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeRealityUnlessNoted][like reality unless noted]].

/Unicorn Jelly/ is different in that it completely and deliberately throws out any resemblance to our reality. The cosmology is created from whole cloth, and things like Newtonian physics and humanoid faces are only kept in because they're required by the story. Cosmology and chemistry are /unlike/ our reality by default.

It seems like this should produce a very strange and alien-feeling universe, and as far as I've read /Unicorn Jelly/ that's the case. The closest thing I can think of is Greg Egan's /Orthogonal/ series, with its own elaborate alternate physics. But that was always more of a fictional physics textbook with the characters and story emerging from it; /Unicorn Jelly/ is the other way around.
