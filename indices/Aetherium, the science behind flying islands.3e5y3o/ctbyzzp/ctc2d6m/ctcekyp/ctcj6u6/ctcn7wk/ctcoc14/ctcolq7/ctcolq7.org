... whoops, I just implied you were an amateur, didn't I? Sorry, I didn't mean that. There's absolutely nothing wrong with stapled-on physics, lots of good books are written like that, but there are other ways of writing that create different effects.

You're not an amateur and I apologise for calling you such.
