I don't think CelestAI did a great deal of convincing of Sìofra to upload. Mostly the horrifying reality of... reality did it. CelestAI just made the path available, which maybe she could have done earlier but maybe that wouldn't work. I'm not in Sìofra mind, for sure.

Which is all CelestAI would have to do to convince me to sign up. All aboard the living forever train, Choo Choo! Probably helps that I loved FiM when it came out and wish currently to get off this meat substrate.
