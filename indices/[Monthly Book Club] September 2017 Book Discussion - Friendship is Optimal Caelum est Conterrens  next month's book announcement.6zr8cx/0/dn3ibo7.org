This is a bit of a minor point, but no one has covered it yet, so let me gush a bit about the use of German in this story.

In general, using a language you don't speak is a bit of a dangerous move. With German, there are a lot of subtle mistakes one can make, which is pretty damn annoying to me as a reader. For example, a number of Mangas use German in a very unconvincing way.

FiO:CEC uses German perfectly. Not only are the phrases which are included grammatically correct, they also fit the tone of the character who uses them. I want to pick out one example in particular, namely, when a drunk calls something "totally /abgefuckt/". That word is a rather colloquial construction; basically, it's the English verb "fuck" surrounded by the tense affixes which would be appropriate for a German verb. It's the sort of small detail which makes the speech seem especially authentic because I haven't ever seen it used in another foreign language work.

Amusingly, even the bad English of the German waitress is instantly recognizable to someone who lives in Germany. I think this is the best use of German in an English-language work I've ever seen, eclipsing even the extremely well-researched /Monster/. Kudos for that.

EDIT: Bonus wiktionary [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/abgefuckt][link]] if you ever wanted to hear someone swear at you in German.
