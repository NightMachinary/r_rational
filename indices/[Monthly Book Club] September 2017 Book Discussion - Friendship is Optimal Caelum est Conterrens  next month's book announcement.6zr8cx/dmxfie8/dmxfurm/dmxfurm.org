I have a definition of self that wasn't discussed in the book. In the situation where a second "me" is created by teleportation shenanigans, I would consider both to be equally me, even after the split of consciousness. So in my opinion, uploading would not be death. From this perspective, uploading would be strictly beneficial (assuming of course that it's a friendly AI and uploaded-me would actually be happier post-upload).
