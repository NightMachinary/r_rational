I think the story wants to be a horror very much. It breaks POV to reveal how much of a manipulative lying bastard CelestAI is, and even uses cheap tricks such as emphasising how disgusting the emigration process is (as if it even matters). Where it achieves the horror for me in full force is the concept of loop immortality which is akin to wireheading. But still if no other option for radically extended lifespan is on the horizon, whether to emigrate or not is not even particularly difficult question. There are major caveats, like I don't particularly want to be a pony, or live under a god even if benevolent, or have House Elf like creatures created just for the sake of my values, but for the eternal life the price is acceptable. I can only hope that I'm smart enough to not fall into the loop.
