I'm in the latter category, but it has nothing to do with the debate over whether the uploads are still people. I'm horrified by the idea of living in a world where a physical God has complete control over your life and there's no way to leave, since I see such an existence as more akin to a pet than a human. The Garden of Eden is a nice place to live until you see the walls keeping your mind and body contained.

This is coming from a spiritualist with mental disabilities who is utterly dependent upon society and my loved ones for protection from internal and external threats, so living under benevolent rule is by no means antithetical to me. It's the absence of choice to do otherwise that I can't stand, regardless of the negative consequences that could come of that choice, so I oppose the creation of any sort of AI God like Yudkowsky has suggested.
