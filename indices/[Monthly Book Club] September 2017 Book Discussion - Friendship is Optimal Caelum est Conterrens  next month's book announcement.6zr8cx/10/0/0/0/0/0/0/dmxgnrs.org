It's interesting, thanks for sharing! I'm especially intruiged because at some point you and your copy would basically be identical twins even if you "started out" as the same person.

Thought experiment: teleporter malfunction happens when you're a day old. Morally, are you equivalent, or are you identical twins?

If you are Peter Singer and don't think a day old baby is a person yet, how about at 3 years old?
