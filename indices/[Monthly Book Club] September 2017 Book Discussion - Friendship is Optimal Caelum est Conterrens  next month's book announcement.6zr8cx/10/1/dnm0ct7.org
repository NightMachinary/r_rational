I'm going to reply even though I don't think uploading is death.

I would say that you have a moral imperative to give birth to your "blessed" daughter. As per Yudkowsky's FOOM argument, there is no beating a superinteligence once it exists, thusly you could not conceivably hope to engineer any better system. Therefore, over any given future period of time you can only reasonably expect to die or continue surviving to only die at some later time. As demonstrated in the story your life will barely be worth any utils at all, and given that that is the case, the best option you can choose would be to create a being with +infinite+ large positive(???? I don't know thinking about eternity is hard??) utils. Happily for my argument, given a choice between, like, 3 utils and a number that is much bigger then that, Utilitarianism says choose the big utils. Moral duty Q.E.D.
