  it was great to read all the discussions on the nature of identity
#+end_quote

If it is actually possible to fully represent a person with a set of computer subroutines, as CelestAI claims to do, then "identity" as a concept ceases to be very meaningful. Why talk about preserving "self" if you can copy and paste?

ETA Remember how HJPEV achieved partial transfiguration? He had to make himself realise that the idea of "a whole object" was ultimately a convenient fiction. If your "self" is similarly composed of discrete blocks that can be rearranged like molecules, then it's likewise a convenient fiction, and preserving it is no more intrinsically valuable than preserving an intricate mural.
