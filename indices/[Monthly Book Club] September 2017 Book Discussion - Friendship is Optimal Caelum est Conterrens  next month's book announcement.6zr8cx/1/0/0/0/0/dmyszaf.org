I'm not sure if the fact that there is nothing unique or irreplaceable about a given instance means that the copies don't have any moral value , and intuitions about this seem to vary a lot .If I had to bet on what my cev is I wouldn't even know what option I'm more confident in , its seems that it could go either way.There are days when I ' m more inclined towards one option than the other after reading something or thinking about it but today im not sure .

Even if I choose copies don't have value , I dont know how munch divergence my cev would accept before considering them separate sentient beings with independent moral value. Humans values weren't optimized for that kind of thing so it's normal that im having a lot of problems deciding what to think about it ,I can just hope that there is some cev to extrapolate from that mess.
