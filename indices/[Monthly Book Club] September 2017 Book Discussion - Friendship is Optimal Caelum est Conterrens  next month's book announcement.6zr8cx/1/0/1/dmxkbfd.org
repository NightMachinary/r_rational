  we wouldn't really want CelestAI to tile the universe with computronium (well, I wouldn't!), but she does it.

Don't forget the idea of /Coherent Extrapolated Volition/. As you are now, you don't want her to do it, but just possibly, if you knew as much as she knows, you /would/ want it.

Incidentally, this is also one answer to the age-old question of "Why would God allow terrible things to exist in the world?" Maybe they're not so terrible when viewed from a larger perspective. Maybe, if we knew a whole lot more, we'd think it was the right choice.
