I really enjoyed reading this story, it was great to read all the discussions on the nature of identity (I still don't /quite/ get whether uploading is death or not, but I feel there'd be a moral imperative to do so). It keeps giving me that existential dread that when I sleep I die and am replaced by my clone, though, which is less fun.

In general I like the optimalverse because it shows the danger of unfriendly AI: we wouldn't really want CelestAI to tile the universe with computronium (well, I wouldn't!), but she does it. And because her values are aligned /just a little off/ - come on, everyone is a /pony/! - it straddles an interesting space between computers are either perfect human value maximisers or kill you to make paperclips out of your atoms. It shows that you perhaps don't need /perfect/ value alignment.

Then again, the stuff about loop and ray immortals: Alicorn!Lavender seems unrecognizable to pony!Lavender because of that one small change to eliminate her mild OCD. Which one of them is truly SÃ¬ofra? Is neither? Probably they both are.

Self-centered aside: when I enrolled at university I had to choose between studying Engineering and studying French. I have no doubt that if I chose to study French I would be a completely different person because of all the personal growth I've had over the years that are directly related to the people I met studying engineering. But French!MagicWeasel would still be me the same as Engineering!MagicWeasel is me. So personal growth doesn't change your identity.... wow, it was always making me struggle, the thought whether having CelestAI change your brain was "destroying" part of what made you you. Frame it as a growth narrative and all of a sudden CelestAI is just a tool you use for personal growth - like a therapist but immediate. Thanks, personal epiphany!
