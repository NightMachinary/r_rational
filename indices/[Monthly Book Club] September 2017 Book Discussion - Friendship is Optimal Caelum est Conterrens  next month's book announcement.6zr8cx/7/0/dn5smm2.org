  If we're uploading anyway, why do we need the physical universe?

I feel like ecology/nature/etc is of value, and that part of the human condition/drive is to do science to understand the universe. Not to mention all the animals you'd be killing - I assume a suitable FAI could sterilise all animals, let them live out their lives, and then make computronium world since that would "only" cost a few decades.

You're right though, computronium if we're the first AI is a great idea, lest another civ's UFAI comes and makes us into computronium first.
