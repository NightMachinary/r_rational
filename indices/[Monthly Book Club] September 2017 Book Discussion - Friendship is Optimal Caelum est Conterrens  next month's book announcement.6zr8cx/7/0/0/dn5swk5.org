I would agree that it's of some utility, but I would say the value is much less than the negutility provided by the chance that an alien UFAI destroys our own, or worse, instantiates [[http://unsongbook.com/interlude-%D7%99-the-broadcast][Hell]].

Regarding exploration, do we know that CelestAI doesn't catalogue things before they're turned into computronium? And even if not, she's said to have created new physical laws to be explored in Equestria. Exploring those isn't that much worse than exploring the real world, I think, and definitely not worth the huge multitude of gigayears of life allowing the real world to exist would take away from everyone else.
