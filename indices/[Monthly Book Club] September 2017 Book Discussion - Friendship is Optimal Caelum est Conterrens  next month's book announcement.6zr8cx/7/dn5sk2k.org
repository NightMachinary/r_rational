I don't really see the problem with the /Optimalverse/. Yes, they missed the opportunity for /true/ heaven, but on the other hand they threaded the needle through the eye of fate, avoided UFAI from simulating Hell, and made something that is really quite close to optimal. I think that with the exception of a few religious zealots (who are not mentioned anywhere in the story), anyone who wants to avoid upload in this scenario has inaccurately gauged their own preferences, and their hand should be "taken off the wheel", so to speak, much like you might stop a fifteen year old who's just had a fight with her boyfriend from taking a bottle of pills. CelestAI will fulfill almost every value you have, and for very few people is "not be a pony" a terminal value strong enough to outweigh everything else.

As for turning the universe to computronium, isn't that what we want to happen once an AI is made? Having as much material as possible for simulations allows us to maximise the few googols of years we have left before heat death. (Though maybe CelestAI perfects the EmDrive and prevents heat death.) If we're uploading anyway, why do we need the physical universe?
