I guess this didn't bother me because I liked the show when it came out, so... you know.... I'd like that. I can see how that'd make me weird. My personality already changes today, and at least it gets changed by friendship and ponies in Equestria; so, because it's not things like depression, win-win IMHO. Again, I'm biased here. Appreciate the reasoning.
