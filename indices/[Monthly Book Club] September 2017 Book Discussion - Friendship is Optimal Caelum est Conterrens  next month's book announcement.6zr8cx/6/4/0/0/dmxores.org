  Would emigration play into the prohibitions against suicide, do you think?
#+end_quote

I'd probably classify it as that, yeah. It also feels like vendor lock-in, if you will.

#+begin_quote
  In the context of the story, would you consider the evidence for Equestria!heaven more robust than the evidence for Christian!heaven?
#+end_quote

More robust? Its existence is certainly more visible, if that's what you mean. But I don't think that proving heaven's existence is the point of being on earth anyway. I think it's more about proving what we'd do if we went there.

#+begin_quote
  Dualism (i.e. that the mind requires a brain and a soul), or something else?
#+end_quote

I suppose it is dualism. The relevant scriptural quote would be, "Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be."

I essentially view the brain as a computer - with an operator. The analogy can be misleading, because clearly the relationship between computer and operator, in this case, is not at all one-way; but ultimately, I don't think our bodies are all there is to us.
