Would emigration play into the prohibitions against suicide, do you think?

Or would it be best of both worlds: die and your soul goes to heaven while a copy of you lives in a ponified heaven of its own?

In the context of the story, would you consider the evidence for Equestria!heaven more robust than the evidence for Christian!heaven? Why/why not?

Why do you think simulation is not possible? Dualism (i.e. that the mind requires a brain and a soul), or something else?
