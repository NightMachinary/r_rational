Well that was an interesting couple of reads. I thought they were both pretty engaging (I covered them in an evening and a morning, respectively) and well worth the read. Contrary to your suggestions, I actually found I enjoyed FiO a bunch more. Aspects of FiO:CEC didn't sit right with me, leaving the story feeling a little off-kilter, and on top of that I felt FiO was simply better written.

Part of this was that the characters in the original just feel more "real" to me. Everyone has their own take on things, and they interact in more critical and less directed ways. From the beginning, we have characters talking to each other, not just generally acting observant (“Wait, how did you know my name?” James asked) but thinking them through and making natural observations outside of the script (“Of course they know our names,” laughed David. “We filled out those forms at the front desk to get our accounts.”) Even the other ponies played roles which, whilst clearly fulfilling Celestia's aims, do so emergently out of clearly disctinct personalities.

Lavender never really felt like this. She acts in accordance with the script, the way the script wants her to. She basically only ever communicates with Celestia, and extensions of Celestia's will where deemed appropriate. Lavender thought about death when it was time to think about death, and her opinion at any one time pretty much matched the last thing she just heard. Even Celestia's outside interactions, though part of the story, weren't really fleshed out all that much. I felt the author very much had a thing they wanted to say, and the characters were made to play that part.

This wouldn't be so bad if I could relate personally with the main character, but I felt it was much easier to get that empathy in the first book. For all the FiO:CEC conversed at length with Celestia, the first asked the real questions.

  “What if somebody /doesn't want to be a pony?/” he asked. “Can you imagine that? So you rapture not just the nerds and people with terminal illnesses, but anyone who has a shitty life. What do the rest of us do? We need those people to keep society functioning.”

So, I guess, on this topic, here are some of the things I would ask and say. Most of these aren't character-appropriate for Lavender, but you could imagine David playing this role.

Firstly, you're in a position of weakness, but constraints give you power. Can you excercise this? I'd probably start with something like

"I have made precommittments that exist to enforce cooperation. I will divulge these to you as an when I deem it appropriate. I beleive it is in your best interest to be act with cautioun here should you wish for me to emigrate."

The next major issue is one with uploading. Here is a /major/ hang-up for me:

  the core elements that create consciousness, memory, and identity within any human brain can be optimized and reduced to six terabytes

My first area of direct curiosity would be

- Does Celestia's conception of consciousness and the important aspects of human experience match the part that I value? I suppose this can just be a question at first, though that alone likely won't suffice.

- How, and to what extent, can I assure myself of Celestia's honesty? The more the better. Asking is a good first-step, though nowhere near enough.

- Should I end up having to take these as a gamble, is it possible to compromise? Asking for real-world (pony-shaped) support for my physical body sounds within Celestia's value function, and making it a hard requirement for eventual emmigration sounds like it might work. Clearly it didn't, but I wouldn't know that before the fact.

Later I would probably migrate this concern, though. For all that Equestria sounds like a paradise, the question of opportunity cost is perhaps an even bigger question than that of its existence.

- How much suboptimality is there from this value misalignment? If you believe that human-like experience has moral imperative, this is inefficient from all the indirection and "other stuff" that stops the people being the primary good. If you believe that morality isn't necessarily human-like, then this holds even more true.

- What are the likely outcomes from trying to aim for these opportunity costs?

- Why is it all about my happiness? Convince me and I'm recruitable. Does she really not need help?

Thoughts? What would you ask?
