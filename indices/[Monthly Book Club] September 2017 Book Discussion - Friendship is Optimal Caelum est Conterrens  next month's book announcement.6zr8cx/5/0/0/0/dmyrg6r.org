Yes , of course , In fact I would probably choose uploading, and if i didnt want to i would probably try something like that .But in general If you don't want to upload your strategy will depend of how munch you don't want to upload compared to other things, if you value not uploading more than not dying then suicide is the best strategy , if you don't want to upload because you think that uploading=dying then suicide is just dumb.

A important factor is how far are you willing to go to avoid uploading , for example , are you willing to avoid all human contact? , would you be willing to deafen yourself , even if that meant less chances of surviving , so Celestia cant't talk to you?(she will just send you written mensages but at lest those are easier to ignore) , would you kill people if necesary to avoid being convinced of uploading?.

The strategy depends a lot on that kind of considerations , and even if you are crazy enough to go as far as neccesary to avoid uploading you are most likely going to fail anyway, unless you value not being uploaded so munch that celestia will let you alone(which is extremely unlikely) or you can't be convinced by any possible argument or situation that celestia can set up (which is also really unlikely and not something you can easily change) .
