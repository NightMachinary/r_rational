There are lots of Greg Egan shorts to read [[http://www.gregegan.net/BIBLIOGRAPHY/Online.html][online]], my favorites are [[http://eidolon.net/?story=The%20Demons%20Passage&pagetitle=The+Demon%27s+Passage&section=fiction][Demon's Passage]], [[http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/stories/worth.htm][Worthless]] and [[http://will.tip.dhappy.org/blog/Compression%20Trees/.../book/by/Greg%20Egan/Learning%20To%20Be%20Me/][Learning to be Me]]. If you read them in chronological order, you can see the evolution of his writing. The ones I like most are disturbing and evocative as well as clever, the ones I like least are the pure, undiluted science porn.
