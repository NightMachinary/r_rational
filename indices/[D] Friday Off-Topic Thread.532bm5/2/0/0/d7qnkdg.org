Yeah, the numbers are quite a bit larger. I wanted more room to play with, and so extended the base stat ceiling to 1000 rather than 255, and then the curves I chose compounded this. Also who doesn't like big imaginary damage numbers lol.

Currently I have Physical chopped up into Contact and Projectile, and Special chopped into Energy and Mental. I toyed with the idea of splitting the special stats to match (sp atk/sp def and focus/fortitude) but I'm going to try and keep the Canon system unless this turns out to be unbalanced. Pokemon have IVs and affinity with individual moves, so I'll either try and fiddle with those for the energy/mental split, or explore other methods.
