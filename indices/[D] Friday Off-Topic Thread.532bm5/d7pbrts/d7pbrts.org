Well, yesterday was the anniversary of Undertale's release, and damn if that wasn't the most fun I've had in memory. I spent all day listening to a fanalbum that was released in a launch party on streams (97 tracks! 6 hours of songs!) and looking at fanart and reading people's experiences with the game and how it's helped them. I am incredibly happy that it exists, as it is responsible for my indelible optimism. I'm still kind of riding the high of yesterday right now.
