I was also kind of luke-warm on it, but I think I liked it slightly more than you seem to. It took me a while to actually beat my first play through (*very mild spoiler* - you have to beat it twice to get the good ending, though you don't have to play through the whole game over again, just have to do some extra steps at your last save.)

I'll say that this is a game where the ending is the best part because it really wraps everything together and gives some unique twists on the story and even the mechanics of the game.

So for me at least, it got better and became something truly memorable. But the most interesting aspects of the story are mostly revealed in the end game even if they're hinted at along the way.

I'd say if you can't force yourself to play the game, it's worth it to maybe watch a let's play with the boring bits cut out, or even just read a plot summary. Though the plot summary won't give you the feeling of atmosphere. There's some novel ideas in the game that are worth some time investment.
