I started playing Undertale a while back and haven't reached the ending yet because I haven't been driven to play it when I could do something else. I'm in a position where I'm not entirely sure if I like it and want to finish, but I feel obligated to because of the effect it's had on so many people. It's had some funny and creative moments, and it even made me feel something a couple times, but I haven't been motivated to get back to it.

I'm worried this might be the same case I had with Adventure Time or MLP:FiM, where I checked it out because everyone praised it only to find out that people loved the emotional depth it had /in addition/ to what it was on the surface. Is Undertale a similar situation where it's really for people who are already into what it first appears to be, but has an extra level to it for fans to enjoy?
