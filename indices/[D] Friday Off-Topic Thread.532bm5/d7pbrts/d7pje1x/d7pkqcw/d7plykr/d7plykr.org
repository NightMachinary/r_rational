It'd be easier if I knew what kind of games I actually like. Every time I play one I have to psychoanalyze myself just to see if I'm actually having fun because it's really difficult to tell. Every other medium of art is easier for me to consume because I'm more certain about how I feel about it, even when I'm apathetic towards it.
