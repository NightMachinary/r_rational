I've been doing some groundwork for a tabletop RPG wherein the player characters are all dragons using some modified Pathfinder rules. I am having difficulty complexly imagining a dragon society with individuals living far apart and for thousands of years.

Any idea what a society of perhaps a thousand creatures that can live for millennia looks like?
