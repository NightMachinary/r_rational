Based on some recommendations from this sub I've been reading some of the best reviewed books from [[/r/noveltranslations]]. Overall I'm pretty disappointed.

Over the past few weeks I've been reading I Shall Seal the Heavens on and off. It's so damn one dimensional. The only time that the protagonist fails at anything at all is in his backstory, where it's repeatedly mentioned that he's a "failed scholar". Other than that, its smooth sailing for the guy. He's pretty much excellent at /everything./ He goes from being [[#s][spoiler]] It honestly reads like a 10 year old's power fantasy. There is absolutely no argument against him being a complete Mary Sue.

Pretty much all the stories I've tried from [[/r/noveltranslations]] are Mary Sues, actually. It's weird going to that sub and seeing people highly praising something and then you try it and it's mostly terrible, particularly when they also praise something you like (Mother of Learning is pretty popular there). I ended up reading way too much of these stories for how much they suck.

So yeah, can anyone here recommend a xianxia or the like that doesn't suck?
