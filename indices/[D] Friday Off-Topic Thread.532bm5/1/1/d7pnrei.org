Not a xianxia, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/245417/1/XCOM-The-Unknown-Menace][this XCOM fanfic]] was translated from Russian and I thought it was pretty good. I never finished it because I dropped it for a while and when I came back I couldn't remember who any of the characters were, but it's still a good war story that rationalizes much of the original XCOM: UFO Defense.

The characters are pretty archetypal, but the story doesn't pretend they're more complex than they actually are, so that's nice. It's the kind of story that takes straightforward situations and adds enough details to the proceedings to keep it from being boring. Conflicts are simple, yet engaging.
