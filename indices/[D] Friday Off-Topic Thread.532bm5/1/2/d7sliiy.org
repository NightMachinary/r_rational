As an avid reader of eastern web novels and frequenter of [[/r/noveltranslations]], 80% of the stuff on that subreddit sucks.

I have trouble recommending pretty much anything there to [[/r/rational]] fans, but there are quite a few novels I enjoyed reading. Here is a list of novels that are more than pure wish fulfillment in no particular order.

*Chinese:*

[[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/ze-tian-ji/][Way of Choices]] - Political, very poetic, but the translation went through many hands. Quality story.

[[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/world-of-cultivation/][World of Cultivation]] - If a random person asked for a CN novel recommendation, I would point them here first. Translation leaves a lot of terms in pinyin so it will take some time getting used to it.

[[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/a-record-of-a-mortals-journey-to-immortality/][A Record of a Mortal's Journey to Immortality]] - The MC isn't a munchkin, but is very shrewd.

[[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/demons-diary/][Demon's Diary]] - Same author as above. Shrewd MC

[[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/transcending-the-nine-heavens/][Transcending the Nine Heavens]] - Reincarnation story. In just the first arc he has to out strategize the guy who successfully took over the continent in his past life. Lots of Humor, a bit of politics.

[[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/murdering-heaven-edge/][Murdering Heaven Edge]] - The MC and his friend were unreasonably mature when they were younger. Some powerful demonic cultivator forcibly took the MC as his disciple.

[[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/jiang-ye/][Jiang Ye]] - Same author as Way of Choices, political.

[[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/legend-of-the-cultivation-god/][Legend of the Cultivation God]] - Very slow. We follow a little kid as he discovers martial arts and makes a name for himself. You get to see everything from the mundane to the little bit less mundane. A relaxing read.

[[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/shrouding-the-heavens/][Shrouding the Heavens]] - It turns out Mars is the first stop on a series of teleporters that our Buddhist and Taoist ancestors used to travel the cosmos.

*Korean:*

[[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/dungeon-defense/][Dungeon Defense]] - Haven't read it, but trusted individuals recommend it highly.

[[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/evolution-theory-of-the-hunter/][Evolution Theory of the Hunter]] - Feels the most like a rational novel. The Main Character uses the tools at his disposal in a smart way. I'm not guaranteeing anything, probably contains a plot hole or two in there. game-like elements.

[[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/king-shura/][King Shura]] - Ancient Chinese asthethic. In a martial artist's world where might makes right, the main character has the power of math. Lots of references to Chinese legends.

*Japanese:*

[[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/sevens/][Sevens]] - Disclaimer: I haven't read many Japanese novels. The main character can hear the voices of his ancestors and they give him advice on his journey to save the world from the monstrous endbringer he knows as his baby sister. As par for the course in Japanese novels, the Main character gets a harem, specifically arranged by the girl he likes. There's some nice character growth in there.
