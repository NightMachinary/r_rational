That's a plus in my book. So many novels just skip over that entirely, or shoehorn it in a jarring way.

That's a relief because in that sub, it's like finding a needle outside of the haystack. I would add [[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/douluo-dalu/][Douluo Dalu]], [[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/heaven-awakening-path/][Heaven Awakening Path]] and [[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/the-lazy-king/][The Lazy King]] then. They have pretty interesting magic systems.
