Whoa, thanks so much. A lot of promising looking stuff there.

As for them being "rational", that's not something I necessarily look for. It's enough that it's good. To be honest, I think the standard for rational in this sub can be a little much. I can't think of a novel or work that I liked that was irrational. Usually for me to enjoy it in the first place it needs to hold up to at least moderate scrutiny.

Oh, and I second the rec for Dungeon Defence, it's pretty decent. I really admire whoever is translating it as it's wordy as hell and the author managed to write a lot of exceptional sentences, really quotable stuff. One thing I should note is that contrary to what you would expect from its premise, it's been mostly (up to volume 2) centered more around romance than anything else really. It's well done, but some people might get turned off because of that.
