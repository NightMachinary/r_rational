    Not being able to use my silk at all is another huge pain. I'm able to use it for things like throwing rocks around, but it'll always catch fire eventually, even if it just sits on the ground. The biggest problem here is that my body constantly produces silk whenever I move, laying down a thread wherever I go. In here, this thread catches fire. The flames then race up the line like a fuse, straight towards my increasingly hot butt.
