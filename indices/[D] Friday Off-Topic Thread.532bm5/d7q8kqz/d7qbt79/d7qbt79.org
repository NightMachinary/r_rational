Wow, yeah, that is uprising about Bulbapedia. It might be because it's such an old site that it was just considered easier to keep updating it than overhaul the whole thing.

Also, nice job on the graph system! It looks pretty cool. I noticed that everyone's HP seems to be much higher than in the other games, signalling a lot more range in damage, I suppose? Also, are you planning on distinguishing physical attacks from mental/emotional attacks in any way?
