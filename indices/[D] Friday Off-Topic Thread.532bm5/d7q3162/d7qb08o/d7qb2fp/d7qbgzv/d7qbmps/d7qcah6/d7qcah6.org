Session 2: The party is now level 2.

Having refreshed their spells (and checked to make sure that nothing was missing from the cart) they ventured into the cave to the locked door. I'm not sure how that was solved, as I was listening to the evil kobold mining a chunk of the wall to circumvent the door, and later make a bridge across the illusionary floor that was on this side of the wall.

Once the bridge was made the party crossed into the alchemy lab of a "mad sorcerer." (or something, they still haven't seen the one behind it.) They noted a tarp covering something roughly humanoid standing like a manikin. After the rest of the room was searched revealing two doors on the far side they all gathered near the tarp.

The sword Elf pulled off the tarp revealing an incomplete flesh golem. The party stacked up in combat formation and initiated with their strongest attacks. The flesh golem nearly one shot their sword mage. This is their signal to run which they do to the bridge they made. The evil Kobold tosses the sword mage the pickaxe used to make it and tells him to break it under the golem. Once the golem steps onto the bridge the Elf smashes it dropping the golem into the pit covered by the illusionary floor.

The party takes this opportunity to pelt the golem with ranged attacks. This lasts for a turn before it pulls itself out, being only just tall enough to reach the edge of the pit. This is the signal to run and they do with the Wizard and the True Neutral (TN) Kobold providing covering fire. The sword Elf and the other Kobold reach the room with the trap door and they start preparing rocks to be dropped down the hole from the rubble mined out to make the stairs. This is interupted by the golem raging at its inability to reach it's prey being only about half as fast as they are... It starts to run.

The Wizard and the TN Kobold sprint up the staircase reaching the room only seconds after the others dropped rocks onto the raging golem through the trap door (A few hundred pounds worth.) critically injuring it. It continues up the stairs where it runs into the entire party stacked and prepared to smash it. It dies on the first attack. (A magical, true struck, blessed, guided attack. I'm reasonably certain it was a crit.)
