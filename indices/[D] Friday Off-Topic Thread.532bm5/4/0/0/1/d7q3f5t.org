Hm. I had over looked the "living far apart clause". But going off the last sentence? Relatively small group - cliques will form and stay relatively solid due to the static makeup of the society. Everyone will know everyone else at least a little bit, which means social/reputational warfare will be prominent. And this static social situation will be virtually all the participants know, and mostly all they imagine ever knowing, which imo mirrors the myopia of teenagers who are shedding/forgetting their childhood, while not truly able to imagine the wider adult world.

Perhaps someone else can think of a clever consequence of combining all that with "living far apart" (I think it might just emphasize the reputation warring even more), but I think "basically high school" is a plausible outcome for a draconic society. The golden great wyrm has her clique where they talk trash about those loser /swamp dragons/, the second and third biggest reds spend centuries engaged in minor status posturing over territory, the black dragons in the swamps focus their active ire on the also-outcast greens, while talking trash about the conformist golds and 'roided moron reds and listening to Depeche Mode, etc.
