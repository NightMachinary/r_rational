I have a couple of old monitors but not really enough desk space to set them up. I also use the TV, which has the highest res in the house, with my gaming computer to watch movies and anime in HD sometimes. So I don't move the gaming computer into my bedroom.

I also just have too many hobbies besides vidya gaems.
