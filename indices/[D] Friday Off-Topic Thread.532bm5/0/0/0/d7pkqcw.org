If you're past Undyne and still aren't getting into the game you probably won't. If you're not liking it, don't play. There are lots of popular games that I don't like, and I like many games that are unpopular. Video games are a matter of art and taste and it's reasonable to disagree on it. I played Undertale at a run one Saturday afternoon and found it an enjoyable experience. Narrative continuity is important, so I'd be really surprised if breaking it up over several months is a good idea.

Don't feel like you have to like something because it's popular.
