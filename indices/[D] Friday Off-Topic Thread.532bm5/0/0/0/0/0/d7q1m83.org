Maybe you should watch LP's of games instead. That way it's a video, which, presumably, you would be more able to discern your enjoyment of.

Of course, doing it that way you could miss out on some intrinsic joy or immersion derived from actually being the controller of the game. But some games have substantially better story than gameplay anyway. And in an LP you can skip gameplay. So... I'd say it's a hit and miss tactic. On the other hand you can play LPs at 2* speed. So you can hit and miss faster.

In undertale's case, there are tons of story events that directly insert themselves into and subvert gameplay expectations, so you definitely lose some of the feeling by watching an LP. /Unless/ you manage to vicariously live those experiences through the emotions of the LPer you're watching.

Actually, I've watched a /lot/ of undertale LPs in order to vicariously relive the experiences of the most emotional points of the story.
