Hmm... I can't say for certain -- I loved it from the word go; hell, I was waiting with baited breath for it to even come out (I'd followed Toby Fox, the creator, since his days making music for Homestuck).

However, I will say that there are a lot of people that started it and stopped at some point, and then got back into it again and loved it.

There's someone in a community I'm involved in that got to Papyrus and stopped because they thought it was shallow and then eventually someone convinced them to continue and they adored it, one of my closest friends got to Undyne before the game really hit them... I dunno, it may be that way for you, or it may not be.

Either way, the game is likely to take at most 8 hours for a pacifist run, and a fair bit less on others.

As far as your explicit question goes... I adore it for its emotional depth and its message, as far as theming goes. When I first played it, I found the art kind of awkward, but about two hours in I forgot that that was even a complaint I had because I got so absorbed in the story. Its characters all have a great deal of depth, even those that seem at first shallow and narcissistic -- I especially enjoyed how even the random NPCs you'd come across would have their own personality.

How far along are you, if I might ask?
