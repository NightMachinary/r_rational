  But in the end I still feel like I'm waiting for those moments to happen when I should be having fun just playing the game.

That's more JRPGs than anything. Honestly in that genre I only ever really loved the combat systems of FF6 and Chrono Trigger.

Undertale's choice of bullet hell instead of bog standard JRPG combat was /ingenious/. But with the exception of some of the bosses, it isn't hard enough to be fulfilling. And the leveling system isn't particularly interesting. (Which is intentional, and kinda crucial, but still.)
