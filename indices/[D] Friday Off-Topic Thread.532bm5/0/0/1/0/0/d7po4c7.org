Oh, okay, well, if you progress a couple more hours you'll REALLY hit the story's stride. Given that you've gotten that far and enjoyed the characters thus far, I think it's likely that you'll enjoy the moments I'm thinking of. I enjoyed the gameplay personally, but I can see why you wouldn't!

It's... about a solid hour more of gameplay before you get to one of the points I'm thinking of. I found the story during and past that point to be emotionally absorbing.
