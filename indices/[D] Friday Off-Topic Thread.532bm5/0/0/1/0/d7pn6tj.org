The boss fight with the spider woman. I'm in the chapter after Papyrus and Undyne, who did provide the most memorable moments so far. I think the problem isn't that I don't feel what I'm supposed to, I do, I just don't feel something as often as I'd like. The actual gameplay is pretty simple and doesn't really do much for me. It's fine, but I'm not here for turn-based combat and bullet time, I'm here for the story.

I have a ton of games on my Steam account that I haven't even touched because I keep finding tv shows and books to be more reliable sources of entertainment. Undertale's gameplay doesn't get in the way of the story by any means, I've done several things in the game I feel happy or guilty about, but in the end I still feel like I'm waiting for those moments to happen when I should be having fun just playing the game.
