They (almost) all suck. Not because xianxia as a genre is bad, necessarily (although it certainly has its problems), but because different writing conventions across cultures lead to a close interpretation of the text being incredibly stilted by our standards. [[http://blastron01.tumblr.com/post/128092878250/im-a-spider-so-what-001][I'm a spider, so what]] is the only fan-translated novel I've managed to enjoy (LN, Wuxia, or xiaxia), mainly because the translator takes some liberties, so the text isn't so jarring. (And because the original work is somewhat intended to be a subversion, to the MC doesn't just curbstomp everything.)

As for the overlap between [[/r/rational]] and [[/r/noveltranslations]], I think what happens is that [[/r/rational]] pushes munchkinry, which typically leads to (admittedly well justified) wish fulfilment. The LN fans are in it for the wish fulfilment, so they'll enjoy munchkin-heavy rationalfics. But [[/r/rational]] posters are in it for the munckinry, and not necessarily the wish-fulfilment, so wish-fulfilment without munchkinry bores us.
