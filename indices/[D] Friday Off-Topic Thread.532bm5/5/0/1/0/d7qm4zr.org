It depends. It's really easy for fast food or other meals where they have their nutrition information online, almost easier than just making food yourself. Where you run into problems with other people cooking is that while it's pretty easy to learn how to estimate portion size (e.g. the difference between a half cup and a cup of something spread out on the plate), it's really hard to know how much sauces, butters, oils, etc. are in something.

A teaspoon of oil has ~40 calories in it, so I use that as one of my estimation baselines. If the food is particularly oily, I add another. It's not perfect, but it helps to keep from undercounting, which is where most people go wrong.
