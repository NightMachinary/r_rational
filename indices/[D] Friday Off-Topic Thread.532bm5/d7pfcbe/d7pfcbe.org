Still exercising. ([[https://twitter.com/DPR_exercise][Evidence]].) Hurt my ankle the very first week of a pre-C25k jogging program, and have had to limit which exercises I do the last few days, but still plugging away with whatever I am up to doing.

My old external HD went /poof/, but I other copies of all its data still exist, so I'm reasonably satisfied with my new HD as my new backup, though I'm not particularly happy - in fact, I'd even say I've given a faint sigh or two - at the dent in my budget caused by buying it. (My monthly budget for non-essentials and one-shot expenses is roughly $100. My new HD, including physical-replacement warranty and data-recovery insurance, cost about $250. ... Le sigh.)

I discovered the existence of an internet fetish this week which I had previously been unaware of. That's certainly not something that happens every week.

Am thinking about tackling my diet next, though not in the typical fashion; I'd have to focus less on the specifics of the meal plan, and more on the mental tricks that would be required to improve the likelihood I'd stick to said meal plan. I'm already using most of my "I need to try to keep my heart from exploding" motivational tricks to stick to the exercise program, and am trying to set things up so that "I'm someone who exercises daily" becomes a part of my core self-identity before my subconscious finishes adapting to those motivational tricks and they cease to be effective. Still unsure of what approaches might work at the same time as settling the exercise program into place, or if I'll have to tackle one thing than the other, or what, but am brainstorming options.
