Tracking calories in and calories out is one of the best things that you can do for your diet. The easiest thing about it is that when you start, you don't even need to make any changes; you're just making a list of what you eat every day and giving it a number, which is something like a five minute per day activity. Once you've gotten into that habit, it's fairly easy to notice which foods are really high in calories and where portion size makes the difference. If you're tracking calories prior to eating or buying those things, it gives you a little pause before that moment of purchase/consumption. I think a lot of people go overboard with diets and set up rules that are difficult to follow, which is part of why I think calorie tracking is a better solution from a "will you actually do this" perspective.

(I've lost about 16 pounds in the last two months with just making sure that calories in are lower than calories out.)
