Yeah, simply tracking everything you eat, even if you don't actually do anything about it at first, is actually supremely helpful. It's well-known amongst regulatory agencies and corporate productivity schools of thought that to measure something is to optimize it. Simply tracking something (like number of accidents on the job or output) is enough to get people who are involved to optimize for it. If you keep track of total calories in every day, as long as you're honest with yourself, even if you don't have an explicit goal of "reduce calorie intake to something reasonable" it will happen. It did for me, at least.

Some tricks:

1. Write it down even if you don't want to. You can lie to anyone you want, but don't lie to yourself about what you eat. View yourself as heroic and pat yourself on the back when you successfully write things down. This is right. this is success.
2. Psych yourself up for writing what you eat. Imagine yourself as a hero breaking down a door to defeat a bad guy, or something, and that door is "remembering to write down what you eat."
3. Make writing it down easy for yourself. Have an app, or a diary, or something. One trick I used is that, if I can't write it down, I take a photo. I take photos of what I eat throughout the day and transcribe them into a diary in the evening.
4. At the end of each day, actually look at what the total kcal consumption for the day was. You don't have to like, feel guilty about it or anything, but make sure you /know/ it.

Once you're doing this successfully (say, for 2 weeks) you can take a look at your kcal intake and calculate your kcal output and figure out what you should do. TBH for me even measuring my intake was enough to reduce it, because I started thinking about it.
