Phil Metzger published a new paper, called [[https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1609/1609.00737.pdf][Space Development and Space Science Together, an Historic Opportunity]]. He argues that we can do a lot more space science in the next few years if we spend about a third of the money on developing a self-sufficient space based industrial supply chain.

Which fits neatly as a precursor to the more singularitarian idea of developing self replicating space robots and using that to construct Dyson spheres, maitroyshka brains, etc.

Here's a [[http://www.bnn.ca/video/mining-in-space-is-completely-realistic%7E953030][video interview]] where he summarizes some of his arguments.
