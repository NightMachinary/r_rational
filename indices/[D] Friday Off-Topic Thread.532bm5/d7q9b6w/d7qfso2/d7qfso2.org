The two crucial things you really need to kick off space travel are ways of assembling things in space (potentially from preconstructed sections) and processing fuel.

That lets you get around the worst parts of the rocket equation which would otherwise massively increase the amount of energy required while not requiring a ridiculous amount of infrastructure (which also becomes much easier to create once you have the basics).

Not really feasible at the moment though, I don't think. You'd need a lot more people in space to oversee the process, which requires more frequent trips. Right now we don't have enough rockets capable of transporting people safely.
