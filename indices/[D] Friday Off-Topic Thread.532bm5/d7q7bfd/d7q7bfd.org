What do you want out of a real-world metaverse, knowing the current limitations in VR and which ones are going to be overcome in time (Resolution, FOV, GPU rendering capacity).

The tech is pretty awesome right now, and I don't think we need to reach "Nerve Gear" levels, but I do think we're still a ways off. In my ideal "Metaverse" there has to be a couple of characteristics to allow it to happen, given real-world limitations (bandwidth and ping). For example, to have a good networked VR experience, you need to be able to send data really fast.

Edit: Accidentally posted too early. I'm editing this post with more content.

*Physical Network:* The current internet sucks, and will need some major upgrades to allow even (for US users) cross-state metaverse interaction. For individuals using VR, even 30 ms response time can feel laggy and slow. For multiple people, let's say that 60 ms ping is acceptable for player-to-player interaction. Thus, we need to significantly reduce packet loss in all games and reduce the distance that the signals have to travel. That's for the physical network which would allow the metaverse to be good. Also, data needs to be able to be streamed in large quantities. Let's set a goal of every user having >50mbps AND a constant 60ms ping or lower.

*Features of Metaverse:* The biggest current problem of metaverse, is the sheer size of it. I would argue that a primitive form of metaverse is already here, in the form of Minecraft. Users can join infinitely sized worlds and build, craft in it, and seek after food, as though they were in the real world in many ways, but also interact in the virtual world in a much more interesting way.
