Session 1: The party (Two Kobolds looking for a cure for a supernatural plague sweeping through their town, and two elves) meet in a tavern where the mayor is about to announce a bounty on the thing that is kidnapping the farmers near town. Being all mages (One Wizard, Two Archivists, and a /Spell Blade/?) they "recruit" four commoners to act as meat shields. The party goes to a house to investigate, and finds out that whatever did it is most likely undead.

They don't find where it went so they go to the cave it was last believed to be at to investigate, and encountered a bed mimic disabling the only competent NPC of the lot. They headed back to town strait away to try and get the money, under the suggestion of the only evil character, (Who has yet to falsely claim something is dangerous.) with the corpse of the bed mimic.

On the way they're attacked by goblins and are forced to run leaving the commoners to die, and not set up with a good mix of combat spells, already having fought that day.

They get back to town, and the mayor refuses to believe it was the bed mimic even though both Kobolds have diplomacy, and used teamwork with a corpse of a creature know to disappear people. (Bad luck happens.) They try and fail to recruit a second set of meat shields, but encounter two obviously evil characters in the tavern while looking for them.

They then return to the cave without incident, and proceed to loot it. If it isn't nailed down, they take it. If it is they mine the floor out from under it then take it anyway. Having done this the party (Now slightly more paranoid, and more willing to listen to the evil Kobold when she tells them not to do something.) mines a set of stairs when they find the only way deeper into the cave is a rope hanging down a trap door. Having opened a path they walk down the tunnel with pony (the donkey that pulls the cart they have) right behind them with some supplies. At the end of the hall is a door.

Through that door is a large room with support colloms forming a rough hexagon inside with the four walls of the room having (From N-E-S-W) a large ledge about 10' up, a locked door, the door they came in through, and solid wall. This they found out by the paranoid Kobold and the sword Elf walking around the perimeter of the room. Once they report back the Wizard, and the Archivist/Wizard (Paranoid Kobold) send their familiars out to search the roof of the cave. The Wizards familiar (a hawk) indicates that there is something up there (through gestures) on the ceiling in the middle of the room.

It turns out to be a giant maggot, and the party falls back to the door the came in through (as a choke point) and hits it from two sides once it gets in. (The sword Elf on one side, and the other -unlucky- Elf on the other.) The sword Elf takes damage, but with two characters with the cleric spell list anything less than death is a flesh wound. It dies and they fall back to the trap door room to rest and refresh spells.

The two evil characters wander in in the middle of the night see the entire party alive and well and turn to leave.
