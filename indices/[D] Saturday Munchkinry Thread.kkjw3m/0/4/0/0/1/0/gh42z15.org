  Is it really likely for someone to wordlessly scream or hiss at a person?

I believe I speak for a whole lot of parents when I say noooooo, we definitely don't scream wordlessly at the baby, everrrrrrr. Definitely not. Nuh uh. No way. Um. Not even a little bit? Just, you know, a teensy bit. I mean, no! Not at all.
