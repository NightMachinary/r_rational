You have the power to continually reincarnate after brain death. You'll be born from a random human mother and will contain none of your past lives' memories until someone intentionally speaks your distinct password to you. This password, chosen at your first incarnation, unlocks your soul from your unconscious mind.

The password must be unique enough that you wouldn't be unlocked by a mundane word and something that could be more or less spelled out phonetically by most literate people just by hearing it said.

When unlocked, you gain your first incarnation's memories as well as the memories incarnations where you were unlocked. This includes their learned knowledge and to some extent skills that they learned. The process is spontaneous, but automatically, "smooths" things out to prevent you from suffering much trauma from being unlocked or any other consequences of having lifetime(s) dumped into your mind.

However, being unlocked also gives you the acquired, treated/untreated psychological trauma of your past lives and you won't be entirely protected against feelings of loss and other attachments.

Your innate personality remains constant across all incarnations, even if they're locked.

How would you munchkin this power?

How would you reverse munchkin this power? Your only knowledge is that there was a egotistic rationalist currently living who'd found a way to unlock three previous incarnations with the goal of obtaining power over humanity.
