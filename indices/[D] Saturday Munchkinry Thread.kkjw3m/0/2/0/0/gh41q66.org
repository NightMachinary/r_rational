Having your soul stored that early has a whole host of ethical problems. In-universe questions aside, I'd be cautious about courting the "life starts at conception" people, since folks who take an ethical position without attempting to counteract the effects of it being enshrined in law (gender descrimination, backalley abortions and amateur surgey via coat hangers) are pretty skeevy folks to say the least.
