Since we're dealing with reincarnation, I used the model of ensoulment of the majority of Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs, Daoists, Druze, and other worldviews that believe in reincarnation. Plus from a more scientific standpoint, it makes slightly more sense in-universe.

One's innate personality is largely a product of their nervous system, the nervous system is the product of one's genetic code.

Of course one's genetic code is the source of a sperm and egg, and we could go further back up the sequence of origination, but reincarnation hijacking the chain at conception seems the path of least resistance as opposed to effectively phasing in a different baby later on in the process.

Speaking about the abortion debate specifically, I'd say that one's life does start at conception if you have to pick a starting point as neutrally as possible. It's not the start of consciousness or the ability to feel pain, but that's not what how we define an individual, even if it's part of how we discuss matters of ethics. This is assuming we're defining things by what's closest to the truth rather than what creates the best outcomes.
