Since no one else has pointed it out yet, just having to put on a few pieces of a suit of armour to get the benefit of wearing an entire one is a big boost to dexterity. If the definition of "piece of armour" is also generous enough all you need to do is strap a chunk of relevant material somewhere where it doesn't impede your motion, like tying ropes or fabric to a chunk of thin metal to wear as a backpack and distribute the weight (although the rope wouldn't be durable itself, so you'd need durable bindings and all).

Also what counts as 'wear'? If you surgically implant enough material in your body, would that count? Do prosthetic limbs count as worn? Do your bones? Even just getting an extra layer of bone is a defensive layer that's easy and inconspicuous.
