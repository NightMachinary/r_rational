Prosthetic limbs do count as worn, but you will have to pick a specific property from any of the multiple materials that make up that prosthetic limb. Something is worn when it contacts your skin and you are able to walk around with it on (and the item doesn't leave farther than 1 cm from your skin at any contact points). By that metric, an exoskeleton would count as worn, but not a car, or a building. A cardboard box would also work as "worn."
