For 1000 dollars I'd make a suit/cosplay of spongebob squarepants made out of very porous sponge and do charity skydives utilising the high air resistance property of the sponge to slow my fall and enjoy the views for a really long time. If I can't use the air resistance property I'd instead use the elastic deformation of the sponge so that if I have an accident e.g. my parachute fails or I land badly, I am much more likely to be uninjured and survive (considering the last bullet point it's unlikely this would leave you unharmed but atleast it would increase survival chances). Whilst this use is technically defensive I felt it was a different enough use of that defence to be posted. For 100,000 dollars I would compete in sumo wrestling utilising a loincloth that is lined with many powerful springs, I would use the spring's resistance to being pushed as the property I use since I can use my opponents force against them and empower my own pushes with it.
