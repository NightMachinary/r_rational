For any piece of armor you wear with a volume bigger than 64 cubic centimeters, you can pick a specific material property to be applied over your whole body. So if you wear a boxing glove, anyone punching your body would feel the padding on the gloves. If you wear a shin guard, punching your body would be akin to punching a person wearing hard body armour composed of that shin guard.

Some rules:

- For every piece of armor you wear beyond the first one, you must pick a specific property (chemical or physical) that would then be applied across your whole body. For example, if you wore a titanium bracer, you could pick titanium's toughness or stiffness as the property to get applied. Toughness would result in being able to take impacts better (would result in less displacement of your body), while stiffness would result in having a body that is harder to deform (harder to break bones, pierce skin, etc). You could wear ceramic kneepads for better heat resistance, or an aluminum foil hat to radiate away some heat energy so that you don't overheat as easily when in proximity to high temperature objects.

- When you pick a specific property to be applied, it overwrites any other piece of gear that had the same property applied. For example, if you wore aluminum and steel kneepads, you would only be able to pick one of the objects for their toughness, or stiffness, or conductance.

- When damage is applied to your body not covered by the piece of armor, the damage is instead dealt to the piece of armor whose property contributed to its blocking. For example, if you wore steel and ceramic. Steel would block blunt/sharp impacts while the ceramic would block or resist heat. With enough damage it is possible to break the armor pieces. It is also possible to target the specific armor piece, which could also break with enough damage. In the previous case, a hard enough hit to the ceramic piece (something beyond steel's ability to absorb) would break it, and you would lose the protection of the ceramic. With enough heat the ceramic would melt, and you would lose its protective properties.

- While you do gain the protective properties of each piece of armor you wear, you are still a human on the inside. It is more akin to being covered by a layer of the material over your whole body, that has the same thickness as the piece of armor you wear. Except that layer is solid, and yet you can move your body around as you would normally. A hard enough hit to your body will still kill or injure you. For example, you may be able to survive getting run over by a car, but the shock of it would still give you a concussion.

Which materials do you choose if you have $1000 to outfit yourself? What about $100,000? And what about if you have infinite money and access to all the possible scientific materials (that are available in quantities above 64 cm^{3).}

Barring protection, what are some cool/interesting things you can do with this power?
