Is there any way to keep the effect running even for body parts that are separated? Or alternatively, parts that are added on?

Because I'm thinking about equipping really strong/tough/hard/sturdy armors, and then applying the effects on my hair. Now that creates super strong/tough/hard/sturdy fibers, which, if my hair is long enough or can be disconnected, can be used to create all kinds of amazing items.

It could even be applied recursively! Put on steel armor, now every strand of hair has the strength of steel. Tying them into a bundle makes them stronger than steel. Now sew your long hair into a stronger-than-steel cloth armor, equip it, make the effects on your body stronger, now your hair armor is stronger, so now it makes your power stronger, so the effects on your body become stronger, and so on!
