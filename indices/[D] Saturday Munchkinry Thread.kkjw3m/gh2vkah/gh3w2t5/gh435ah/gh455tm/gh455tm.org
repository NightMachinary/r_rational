You could potentially set up a challenge with a reward (like the millennium problems) but instead of solving a maths problem which someone could theoretically beat you to, you can instead have the question be “decrypt this message”, the message being encrypted with a one time pad, you being the only person in the world with the key and can pretend that you cracked it somehow, this would result in you looking like a precocious child genius(and the fame which results from that label), getting your money from your previous incarnations and then you can make a similar seemingly philanthropic challenge in the name of encouraging development of the field and continue passing the money down (maybe there is a rule that states that anyone who accepts the prize must setup a similar challenge with a prize pool of atleast equal size, that way if one of the people looking after the unencrypted answer leaks it or cheats by abusing their position somehow, you won't lose the money it will just be inaccessible for a lifetime). Instead of having future knowledge you can instead use your wealth to fund the passing of laws which censor information to prevent the growth of future technologies and decrease future discoveries, this means everyone else in the world will unfortunately have no improvement to their quality of life or life expectancy but you could get continual growth of both of those things.
