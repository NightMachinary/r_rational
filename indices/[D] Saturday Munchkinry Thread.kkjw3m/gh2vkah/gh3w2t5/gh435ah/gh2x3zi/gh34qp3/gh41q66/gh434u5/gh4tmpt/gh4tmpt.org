I always thought consciousness was an prerequisite for individuality? Although I really don't have enough readings under my belt to properly discuss/understand this topic enough.

Also if the soul is the thing in charge, then is defining any other point of the start of life other than the start of the soul kinda wonky?

(I still have those misgivings from before tbh. Does saying the soul shapes the foetus but not inhabit the body until birth work under your system? Or even the soul exists in a seperate space but interacts with your body? Does being aborted rather than born and moving on to the next foetus cause problems?)
