"The password must be unique enough that you wouldn't be unlocked by a mundane word" refers to the idea that your password /must be unique enough/ to not be unlocked by e.g. a mundane word, not that your password specifically may not be a "mundane word", though this condition would certainly follow.

"America" and "Google", for example, are clearly not very unique. They are words which are regularly spoken by average people from across the globe.
