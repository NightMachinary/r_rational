Oh. I was interpreting "mundane" differently. I figured it meant words like "the", or "table", or "you", which would be super easy to abuse. I didn't think it would include made-up names, because if they do, then a lot of the proposed plans in this thread won't work at all.

You couldn't make a big company that popularizes its brand name or a catch phrase that includes your password, because then the name/phrase becomes very "common" and so very "mundane" and then the password wouldn't work anymore.
