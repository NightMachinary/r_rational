Why do you think the catholic church still holds mass in latin? Someone already set up the game.

Also, this I think is less useful than Intended. What advantage would knowing about whatever bits a history a random person would know in the future?

Like, you remember how to hand craft a fine bow, very nice, your car broke down. Nothing in thr past 10k years of human history will help you with this as much as a wrench.
