I forgot to mention but for the reverse munchkin approach using the book I could use the traumatic experiences of the character to create someone who the reincarnationer can empathise with to reinforce their traumas and make them see reincarnation as something negative so that maybe they'll work to cover up their password instead, could also make it seem like they steal the lives from the people who jack in, especially children who never even had a chance to live to make them feel guilty in the hopes of making them more likely to confess their abilities to someone which (due to the game) would hopefully result in trauma being amassed for them.
