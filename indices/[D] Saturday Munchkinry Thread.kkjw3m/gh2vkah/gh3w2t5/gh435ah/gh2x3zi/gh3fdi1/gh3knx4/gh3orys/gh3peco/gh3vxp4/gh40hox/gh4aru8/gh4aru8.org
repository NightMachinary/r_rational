  You couldn't make a big company that popularizes its brand name or a catch phrase that includes your password, because then the name/phrase becomes very "common" and so very "mundane" and then the password wouldn't work anymore.

The restriction is presumably a restriction on the choice of password. It's probably not a magical clause that, if contradicted for a given period of time, cause the password to not work for that period of time. I see no reason to read it like that other than to bring up this objection.
