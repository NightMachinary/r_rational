I think we need stricter definitions for what the password can be. What is meant by “mundane word”? I think I'd go for something like “scalene”. It's probably obscure enough, and I'd expect it to be activated in every lifetime that I go to school in childhood, even in the future. Probably activates around age 10-13? If I never go to school I could realistically not hear it until late in life, so it's not ideal. “Algorithm” is also pretty good for a teenage start, don't know if it passes your phonetic test.

If it's needs to be a one-on-one conversation and teachers won't work then I'd choose something related to reproduction, get activated during the Talk. I'm also assuming this is working across languages, because I think the phonetic restriction doesn't make sense otherwise.
