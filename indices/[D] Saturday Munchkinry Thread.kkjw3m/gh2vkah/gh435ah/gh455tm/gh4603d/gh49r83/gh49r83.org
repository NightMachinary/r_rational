Climate change would be difficult to deal with... it would be difficult to get humanity to stop using environmentally unfriendly stuff and living lifestyles which create a lot of waste but if I am worried about knowledge advancing forwards without me being awakened then the solutions would be slowed by my censorship of information. Maybe the creation of a terrorist organisation which is essentially eco warriors that assassinate CEOs, destroy factories, etc. Of non-environmentally friendly organisations would work if that can scare company leaders into changing direction for fear of assassination and destruction of property causing the eco-friendly alternatives being more profitable and the eco-friendly factories being a safer (and therefore more desirable place to work, even for lower wages) place to work. In order to succeed in this reincarnation you'd have to achieve the creation of a terrorist organisation without doing the challenge to pass your money down or else the ethics of the challenge could be called in to question, putting unpleasant suspicion on you in future reincarnations and potentially having your way of transferring wealth outlawed since it can result in the wrong people getting power (if society sees it facilitates a terrorist organisations creation, you could try to be discreet and ensure no one finds out the organisation was created by you but then growing it into something that dangerous would be hard since recruiting would be hard and if you fail, even if you die or kill yourself the body can be used to identify you). The biggest problem with this approach is the trauma associated with it, this is clearly highly unethical and could cause a heavy mental burden for you, even if change was fast the amount of deaths would be high. I realise the goal of world domination is for reverse munchkin but since I'm new here I don't know if the goal when thinking as the munchkin is different or the same, I assumed it was the same but perhaps I am wrong? If it's the same then someone attempting world domination having the weakness of accumulated trauma makes it seem like the munchkin has highly contradictory internal motivations, I think it's an interesting scenario because of that but also really difficult to think of how to achieve that goal. This “solution” to climate change whilst suppressing information about future technologies is a massive reach in my opinion but it's what I came up with for the time being, if I think of something else I'll reply to this one :)
