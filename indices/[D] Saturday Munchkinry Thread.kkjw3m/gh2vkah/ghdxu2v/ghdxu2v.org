I would start a religion which main tenet is meeting 18 year olds, yelling "PLUMBUS, PLUMBUS, PLUMBUS!" at them, then showering them with gifts (say, a laptop, a cheap used car, a new smartphone etc)

The young person is then inducted into the cult that only has two tenets:

1. Be kind to other people.
2. When you meet a 18 year old human, yell PLUMBUS at them and give them an useful gift.\\

Then I would spend some time in each reincarnation to reignite and enforce the cult, wrap it in Chaotic Good mystique, until it becomes a staple of global culture.
