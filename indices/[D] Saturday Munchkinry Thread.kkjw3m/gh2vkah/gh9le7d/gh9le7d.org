I would probably choose a word that I can hear by the age of five or so, then kill myself when it's an evening in Europe until I'm reborn in decent living conditions. Everyone in this thread apparently underestimates how likely they are to be reborn in a poor Asian or Indian family.

Human brain tends to erase memories obtained before the age of five, so they won't clutter my mind. It's an absolute dick move towards my new parents for sure, but the drawbacks make caring not worth it.
