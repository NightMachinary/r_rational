It is simple enough to choose a common brand name as the password. Like "America", or "Google". The problem is they won't last forever. After a few millennia, they may no longer exist, and then your password will never be said again.

Which suggests another approach: using sounds that will never die until humanity goes extinct. I'm thinking either "AHHHH!" or "ssss", which are sounds that people make occasionally and will never go away completely. They are not mundane words, and they can be phonetically pronounced.

The problem then, is this constraint:

#+begin_quote
  until someone intentionally speaks your distinct password to you.
#+end_quote

What does that "intentionally" actually mean? Do they have to be intentionally speaking to you specifically? So it doesn't work if they are speaking to a large audience or in an online video clip? Do they have to intentionally speak your password while KNOWING that it is your password? But how would they know they know your password and it isn't just a lie your previous incarnations told them? Reincarnation could be treated as a hoax after all.

Also do they need to know what exactly the password is for or will do? What if you just trick the world's mothers into thinking your password is a magic word that will make babies who listen to it become smarter? The mothers would 'know' that they are speaking a password to their babies, but they wouldn't know what that password is really for. Would that work?
