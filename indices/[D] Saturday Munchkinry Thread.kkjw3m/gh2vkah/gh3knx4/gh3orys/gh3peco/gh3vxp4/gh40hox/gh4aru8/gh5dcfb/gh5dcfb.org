The problem here is, if the 'mundanity' is defined only with regard to the current time, that means you can cheat by turning your password from a currently-not-mundane word to a future-mundane word. As in, changing mundane words like "the" or "you" or "table" into your password. For example, you could set your password to a slight mispronunciation of "the", then start a mass-misleading program of making people think that "the" is actually pronounced as the slight mispronunciation that is your password. Then your password would effectively become the mundane word "the", and be said nigh constantly in mundane usage, which would be incredibly strong.

The other solutions like making your own brand/company/country/whatever, will create passwords that are only mentioned when someone talks about the brand/company/country/whatever, so the solutions are effectively limited to the lifespans of those brands/companies/countries. A mundane word like "the", barring the deliberate and expensive intervention that you did and that is utterly pointless for anyone else to do, will outlive the others by orders of magnitude.
