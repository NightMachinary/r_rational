  Is it really likely for someone to wordlessly scream or hiss /at/ a person?

If your innate personality likes to sneak around and/or surprise people, sure! Sneak up on a friend and poke them in the back, and they will scream "Ahhh!" at you. Sneak around with friends and they will regularly "sss" at you to get your attention.

But yeah that's why I was asking what "intentionally" means in that sentence, because it is kind of ambiguous.
