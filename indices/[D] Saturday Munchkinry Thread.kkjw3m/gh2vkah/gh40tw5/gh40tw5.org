I would create a conlang like Esperanto and make one of the frequently used words (such as and,for,etc.) the password, I would then create a charity that has a focus on uniting the world by breaking down language barriers by teaching this as an auxiliary language world wide, this ensures that the oldest I will become before I awaken is right at the first steps of education, ensuring I have the most time to prepare, during preparation I will specialise heavily in a skill and use that skill to amass fame and notoriety and then become an ambassador for the charity and continue its growth, if I failed to amass fame then I would commit a crime against the charity e.g. pose as a racist who doesn't want the knowledge amassed in the language of the country I was born in to be translated and accessed by anyone else and burn down charity buildings, attack employees and educational facilities and allow the staff to restrain me to show the heroism of my charity's staff and make it and its purpose seem noble whilst also allowing me to paint anyone who goes against the charity's goal of teaching the world as a villain similar to this incarnation, the other reason I will allow them to restrain me before I hurt anyone is to reduce the trauma and mental burden I will amass committing these crimes. To reverse munchkin I would probably try to wipeout humanity or instead would try to create a global secret organisation or secret society that gives tests to children across the world (similar to a mandatory IQ test), these tests would contain questions that someone their age wouldn't know the answer to but someone who lived during the time would e.g. something popular during the 80s, 90s, etc. Or would use psychological manipulation maybe using leading questions to trick them into accidentally revealing themselves and then torture them their entire life and hopefully that will ensure that whenever they reincarnate and awaken they will probably be mentally broken, this approach relies on them awakening at an early age, they're likely to do that at least once, especially when they make their password a popular word. Another approach (wouldn't use this in conjunction with mandatory test as the pitfalls would be more obvious) is to spread the info as much as possible to prevent them from suppressing it without drawing suspicion, would be hard since you'd probably sound like a lunatic trying to convince someone that was true. Perhaps one way of dealing with it is creating a highly successful work of art that spawns its own sub genre of dystopian, a book where the protagonist utilises human-computer interaction to live out their life by experiencing the memories of anyone jacked in to the system and all the horrible trauma associated with living out another persons life, or perhaps make it unethical where a malevolent force, creature or person utilises this or a similar ability to kill humanity or some other great evil, demonising them in the process, perhaps a video game like prey with mimics that can become anything and... ------------------SPOILERS FOR PREY------------------------------------------------------- the antagonist can become a human-mimic hybrid like the protagonist does and then commit atrocities, the implantation of the mimic DNA being what causes this change making their nature pure evil an unempathetic . ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- the goal of this is to make everyone hate things that can perform similar feats and see them as evil demons and hopefully the constant anxiety about someone finding out and constantly being portrayed as demonic would be enough stress to mentally break them eventually even if it takes way longer than my lifespan. Obviously it's easier said than done to create a work of art with that sort of impact but worth a shot I guess.
