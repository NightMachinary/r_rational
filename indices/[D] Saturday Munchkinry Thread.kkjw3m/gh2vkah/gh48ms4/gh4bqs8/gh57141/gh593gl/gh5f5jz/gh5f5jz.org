Hmm.. can your skin be made into "armor"?

Step 1: Get really super fat.

Step 2: Slim down back to normal, so now you have ridiculous amounts of excess skin.

Step 3: ??? Turn excess skin into armor without it ever going further away than 1cm???

Step 4: Recursive Profit!

Memes aside, what I mean by "parts added on" are things like skin grafts. Ways to surgically increase your body size so that the effect becomes applied over a larger volume of "body". So, as a kind of mundane example, suppose you surgically add a really long rope of skin to your body. Can you then apply your armor effects to this rope of skin, and so gain a really strong/tough/sturdy/etc. whip?

If the "whip skin" notion works, can you keep surgically adding more shapes and structures to your body for the magical effects to apply to them too? You could make entire unbreakable buildings and cities out of your skin (that would still be attached to your body, but could be done through loose and thin ropes). There may even be a way to munchkin up an entire space elevator, surgically implanted into your body.
