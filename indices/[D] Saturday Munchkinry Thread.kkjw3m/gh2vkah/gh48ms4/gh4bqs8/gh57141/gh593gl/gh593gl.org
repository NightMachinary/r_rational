Hmm maybe I should've had another point talking about this. The moment any part of your body gets separated and farther than 1 cm away from your skin it loses the protection, so no recursive strengthening possible.

Parts that get added on do not gain protection. It is only the entirety of your skin that gains the protection, and the individual pieces of armor.
