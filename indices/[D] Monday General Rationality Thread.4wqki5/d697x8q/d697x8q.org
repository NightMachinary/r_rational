Is their any collected list of EA based aguments for or against Veganism? Specifically overall and for each individual animal. The arguments overall for veganism seem somewhat convincing, but then I found out about the order-of-magnitude differences between fowl-based and pork/cattle based meat, along with the fact that honey and mussels don't seem too bad to me.
