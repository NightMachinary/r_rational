I certainly agree, but if the concern is that eating animals kills intelligent beings, then comparing them to humans in this regard is rational. It's the same reasoning antiabortion activists use. If you believe that fetuses are fully human, then abortion is definitely murder. It doesn't make them less wrong, though.
