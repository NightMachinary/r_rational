Personally, I don't think there's anything wrong with taking a gradient approach to veganism (or any moral position, for the most part). If you don't find anything wrong with eating mussels or honey, don't worry about it until you have evidence there is. But cutting certain meats from your diet in the meantime is a positive regardless of whether you still eat others.
