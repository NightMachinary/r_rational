Ok, so I'm watching a movie called 21 and, during a college lecture, they discuss the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem][Monty Hall problem.]]

Now, I'm not a mathematician or anything but I still don't see why switching your answer gives you a better shot. All I can see is that, by eliminating a goat, he's now made it a 50/50 choice, otherwise known as an even shot. So I don't see why switching benefits you. Anyone wanna explain it to me like I'm five? :P
