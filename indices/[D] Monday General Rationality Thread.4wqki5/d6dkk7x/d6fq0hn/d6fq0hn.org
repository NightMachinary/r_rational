/It isn't a 50/50 choice/. It's two doors, of which you have chosen one, but at the time you chose, there weren't two, so the odds /weren't/ 50/50. In fact, when you chose, there was a 2/3 chance of a goat behind your chosen door. Your originally-picked door was probably the /wrong/ door.

Now, the host's elimination, based on his extra knowledge, guarantees that if you switch doors, you switch prizes. If you originally picked a goat, switching gets you the car; if you originally picked the car, switching gets you a goat.

And the odds are that you originally picked a goat. Therefore you should switch.
