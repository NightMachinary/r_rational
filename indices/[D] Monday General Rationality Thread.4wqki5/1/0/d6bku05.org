Around 11 months ago, Undertale came out. Played it on the day of release, and, well...

I still haven't gotten over it. I spent the last thirty minutes crying after watching someone's playthrough of its end. I'm going to have a hard time explaining why it's so important to me and how it's impacted me so much without spoiling anything but I'll give it my best.

I guess, part of it is that the game shows is that very few things are black and white, whether in games or real life. Its tagline is "The friendly RPG where nobody has to die," and it fulfills that quite well. Without going too far into a spoilery lore discussion on the topic, the primary antagonists of the game explore the tenets of hope, the responsibility of leadership and whether to stand by one's morals or one's duty, and more philosophical (and spoilery) questions.

Undertale made me feel a connection to the characters that literally no other game or work of media has ever had for me, and it reminded me and has served as a constant one since that every person has their own story and that a kind word or gesture might brighten their day, life, and this world immeasurably.

I feel like that game impacted me more directly (excepting formative media) than any other piece of media ever has, in making me more kind and considerate. I am very grateful to have had the chance to play it.
