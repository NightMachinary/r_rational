It is very much worth it. If there were only ever one game I got to play, it'd be the one.

Of course, the reason it's so wildly acclaimed doesn't fall solely to its story. It has damned good music. Toby Fox, the creator, was well known in his corner of the internet even before release for his work on music for Homestuck, and Undertale only solidified that reputation. It makes exceptional use of leitmotifs in conveying character, environment, and mood while retaining a sense of comfortable familiarity.

Apologies if I sound like I'm fanboying out, but... well, I guess I kind of am one for it. :p

e: Oh, ah, as for how long it'll take to play, 6-8 hours for the first playthrough. You may or may not want to play it multiple times. I actively chose not to for reasons that may become apparent to you, without spoiling anything.
