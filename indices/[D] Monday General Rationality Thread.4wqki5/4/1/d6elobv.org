I'll try to put it in different terms than the explanation is usually put in, for the sake of coverage.

When you make your first pick, there is a 66.6% chance that you picked a goat (66.6% being 2/3rds, and 2/3 of the doors concealing goats).

The game show host shows you that one of the two untouched doors conceals a goat. This does /not/ change the fact that there was a 66.6% chance of you having picked a goat - he /knows/ where the goat is, and is purposefully showing it to you. Regardless of whether or not you picked a goat the first time, there will always be a goat for him to reveal.

So now there's one goat left. With a 66.6% chance of it being behind the door you first picked, the third door must have a 33.3% chance of hiding the goat - it can't be 50%, because that would add up to more than 100%. If the third door has a 33.3% chance of hiding the final goat, it has a 66.6% chance of hiding the car.

Thus, 66.6% of the time, switching your answer after the game show host's reveal will net you the car.

(Please let me know if I'm screwing around with logic here and making terrible mistakes - I've never heard it explained like this before, but it makes perfect sense to me)
