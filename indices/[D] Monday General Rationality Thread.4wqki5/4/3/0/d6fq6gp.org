You could imagine it this way. Suppose I present you with Box A and Box B, telling you that one contains a pile of dirt, and one contains a pile of gold. You can't test them in any way, just open one and keep what's inside.

That's a 50/50 choice.

Now suppose that I give you this further information: the background of this situation is, we took a million boxes, put gold in one, put dirt in the others, then picked a box at random and called it box A (and filled box B with either gold or dirt accordingly).

That's not a 50/50 choice any more. Box A is now extremely unlikely to be the winner, and you should switch to the opposite box, which you know has the opposite prize.
