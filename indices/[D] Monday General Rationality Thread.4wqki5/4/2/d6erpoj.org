I like these answers here, but let me give you another way to look at it.

Suppose, instead of 3 doors, you have 100 doors. Now you pick a door. The host then opens up 98 other doors. Do you switch?

Consider that you picked one door, and the host opened 98 other doors, and specifically not 'this' one.
