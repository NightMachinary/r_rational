To complete this, we would have to consider the point we actually reach, after the door is opened, and consider what conditions could have led to our observations.

Let's say that after picking door 1, door 2 opens. What branches of possibility could have led to this?

1) Car is behind door 1, Monty randomly picked door 2. There was a 1/3 probability of the car being there, and it leads to door 2 opening with 50% probability (Monty can pick either door), giving this a weighting of 1/6.

2) Car is behind door 3, Monty must open door 2. This position had a 1/3 probability, and leads to door 2 opening with 100% probability, giving it a weighting of 1/3.

Option 2 has twice the probability of option 1, so we should switch.
