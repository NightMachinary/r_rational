lets assume you choose the first door (since it doesn't matter which door you start with) there are three possible outcomes from the start:

the car is behind door 1 (33%) the car is behind door 2 (33%) the car is behind door 3 (33%)

in the universe where it's behind door 1, monty opens door 2 or 3. Switching results in a goat (still 33%)

in the universe where it's behind door 2, monty opens door 3. Switching results in the car (still 33%)

in the universe where it's behind door 3, monty opens door 2. Switching results in the car (still 33%)

it's sorta like how flipping two coins has three options (both heads/both tails/one each) but it isn't a 33/33/33, because the process used to get there means you could have had a T/H or a H/T
