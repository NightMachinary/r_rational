How are you a different person today than who you were a year ago?

Ever since I first noticed in high school how much I'd grown from the person I was the year before, I've made a commitment to pay attention to and try to ensure I continue to grow every year.

It's still a month early (my birthday is September 1st), but this past year, among all the incidental changes, I feel like I've succeeded in the commitment I made last year to waste less time on video games that I defined as "time sinks."

I love games, but I realized I had gotten to a point where a lot of the games I was playing were virtual treadmills. I played them because they were fun enough and short enough per session that I could fit them in between a few spare minutes here and there, but the truth was I was still spending time doing something unproductive and, ultimately, unfulfilling. On top of that, I have a completionist mindset in video games, which makes it hard to stop playing games even after they're no longer fun.

So I set goals for myself to quit games that had no ending once I reached personal goals. I quit Clash of Clans early this year when I maxed out TH 9, quit Clash Royale last month when I hit Legendary Arena (as a free-to-play player, without any legendaries, yes I'm proud), and stopped grinding quests in Heroes of the Storm just to get the daily gold that I never spent because all my friends stopped playing. I also stopped caring in Hearthstone about capping my rank every month or filling my card collection, which takes a lot of stress and drive to grind out of the game.

With the loss of all those small time sinks, I've found myself able to spend a bit more time each day, at the very least, brainstorming for my story or articles, or playing games with actual stories and endings, even if only for 15-30 minutes at a time.

Here's to continual personal growth.
