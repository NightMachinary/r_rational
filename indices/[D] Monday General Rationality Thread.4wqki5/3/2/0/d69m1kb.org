  This is arguably genocide.

Genocide usually only applies to humans, I think. The animal equivalent - extinction - is happening at a very fast rate indeed due to humans' actions, and so one more species (especially as poorly-adapted as chickens) is only a very small difference. If the extra resources freed that way could save two or more other species from extinction, then in terms of 'non-human species destroyed' it's a net benefit.

Not to say that your whole argument is flawed, or anything, but that last part is definitely quite iffy.
