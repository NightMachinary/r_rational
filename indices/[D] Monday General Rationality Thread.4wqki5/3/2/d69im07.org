From an intelligence perspective, pork and beef are definitely the worst to eat. I eat them anyway because they are delicious, but people who care about that sort of thing should care about those the most. Chickens are really dumb, and sheep aren't the brightest either, so they are more moral to eat.

I really don't get the arguments against milk and eggs though. Yes, eating free-range eggs and milk is far more moral, but once you've gone that far the animals are pretty much in ideal conditions for their species. They aren't going to be slaughtered, they get to socialize with other members of their species, forage, etc. Chickens lay eggs, not using them is a waste. Cows make milk. Not using that is a waste.

What's really interesting is to argue that eating these animals is moral because they only exist for the purpose of our consumption. Chickens are too stupid to survive in the wild under normal circumstances, and literally require human care. Cows can survive, but only because we wiped out all of the large predators which could hunt them in most of the places where they live. If humans stopped eating chickens, their entire species would die out in a couple of years, probably. This is arguably genocide.
