C+Pd from a response below RE eggs/milk:

The big issue with milk and eggs are the 'byproducts' - in the case of eggs, the male chicks that are the brothers of the hens that go on to lay. They are worthless for meat (they are not a breed that grows big and meaty), and they don't lay eggs, and very few are needed as studs, so they are often ground up alive (it's called maceration), or suffocated.

On milk, in order for a cow to give milk she needs to be kept pregnant almost constantly. The calf is taken away soon after birth which is traumatic for both mother and calf, and then the male calves end up as veal and the female calves end up as dairy cows like their mothers.

There are fancy 'holistic' farms that are run on some sort of hindu-esque religious philosophy where this doesn't happen, but they're vanishingly rare and the milk very expensive.

Some specific information on some of your points:

#+begin_quote
  Yes, eating free-range eggs and milk is far more moral
#+end_quote

The word 'free-range' in food standards is almost meaningless. I advise my fellow Australians to by the 'organic' certification, because it actually places meaningful limits on stocking density. It's also associated with a bunch of woo, which really sucks.

  They aren't going to be slaughtered, they get to socialize with other members of their species, forage, etc.
#+end_quote

They are slaughtered. The natural lifespan of a cow is 20 years, but dairy cows are slaughtered at about the age of 7. Egg-laying chickens can live 10 years + and are slaughtered at 1 day (males) or 18 months (females).

#+begin_quote
  Chickens lay eggs, not using them is a waste.
#+end_quote

Chickens have been bred to lay more eggs than their wild counterparts ever did. A wild chicken will lay <10 eggs per year, a domestic chicken 300+. This puts a huge strain on their bodies (calcium loss, they can have hernias). It's actually pretty trivial to stop a chicken from laying if you use a birth control implant (designed for dogs).

#+begin_quote
  What's really interesting is to argue that eating these animals is moral because they only exist for the purpose of our consumption.
#+end_quote

I for one want them to go extinct, or to be kept in small numbers at zoos.
