Central to this questioning is the idea that creatures are not necessarily better off having not existed in the first place; Thus with less milk demand would mean less cows existing in (possible) pain. This applies to chickens as well; I'm fine with their being noon more chickens, since this (might) be a better world than one with any chickens.

I cannot believe that I didn't think of cruelty free milk/eggs; my main objections to eggs were based on factory farming.
