The big issue with milk and eggs are the 'byproducts' - in the case of eggs, the male chicks that are the brothers of the hens that go on to lay. They are worthless for meat (they are not a breed that grows big and meaty), and they don't lay eggs, and very few are needed as studs, so they are often ground up alive (it's called maceration), or suffocated.

On milk, in order for a cow to give milk she needs to be kept pregnant almost constantly. The calf is taken away soon after birth which is traumatic for both mother and calf, and then the male calves end up as veal and the female calves end up as dairy cows like their mothers.

There are fancy 'holistic' farms that are run on some sort of hindu-esque religious philosophy where this doesn't happen, but they're vanishingly rare and the milk very expensive.
