If you want a real low-hanging fruit of vegetarianism, the lowest-hanging fruit is "eat larger animals" to save lives. A cattle has like, a quarter ton of beef on it. You could possibly switch all your meat-eating to beef and kill like, 1 cattle per year (if you're fine only eating 1-1.5 lbs of meat per day). This is probably way better than the huge number of chickens, hens, etc that are killed. You can also avoid eating intelligent animals like pigs I suppose. It really depends how you measure things.

I currently eat enough meat (mostly chicken) that I probably am responsible for the death of like, at least 1-2 chickens per week. Just in terms of "number of animals killed" I could probably go from killing 100 animals per year to 1 animal per year by switching from chicken to beef for all my meat consumption. This would be 99% of being a vegetarian, morally, with very little impact on my life. However, I like chicken a great deal and don't view chicken (or cattle, for that matter) as having moral weight. Still, the "eat larger animals" strat is one worth looking into imo
