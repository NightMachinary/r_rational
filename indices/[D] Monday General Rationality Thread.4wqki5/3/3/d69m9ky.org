I don't have much to say on the morality of veganism, but there is also a marketing aspect to strict veganism. When people see you greatly change your diet, they know you care a lot about the cause. They start to really think about what could be so offputting to lead you to make that choice.

Strict veganism in a moral sense isn't much worse than a case by case examination to the morality of veganism, but it doesn't leave as strong an impression. It's more effective at spreading your ideals and affecting change to the industry at large to show sacrifice.

Another moral question to ask is should you do everything you can to reduce suffering of animals, or is it sufficient to just not contribute to it personally?
