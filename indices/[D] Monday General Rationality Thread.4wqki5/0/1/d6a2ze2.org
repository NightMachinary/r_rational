To me this seems like a bit of a typical mind fallacy. You're imagining the kinds of extreme circumstances that would be required to drive YOU do do something like that. I've had a good amount of experience in dealing with the types that do that kind of thing, and from what I've seen most of the time it's that they're truly selfish. In that they don't care about other people. At all. They saw an opportunity to make money, and they took it. It's a very impulsive and spur of the moment thing. Dealing with these kind of people is almost like dealing with a paperclip maximizer. If you get mugged in the street, they really /will/ be willing to kill you for $5. They actually prefer the future where they have $5 and you are dead, because anything about you literally means nothing to them. Actually, in their minds, what you're holding is /their/ money, and any resistance you put is getting between them and /their/ stuff.
