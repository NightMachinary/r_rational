Sounds like you've rederived a lot of [[/r/Stoicism]] from first principles. (For the record, the "not showing emotion" little-s stoicism has nothing to do with the actual ancient Greek philosophy.) I've always thought it's kinda up there with the tenets of rationality, so it's very cool to see that your life has been influenced in that way by this sub. Cheers, mate. Glad you found your Magic cards.
