Man, good on you. Two weeks ago tomorrow, I had the passenger window of my car shattered and my workbag stolen. I was in the office parking lot and was only there for an hour, but it was entirely my fault for leaving it there. Inside was a work laptop, charger, and sign pad all worth about $800, lots of files and papers that are a major inconvenience to lose, and the bag itself, a leather satchel which was a graduation gift from my dad, which was apparently about $300.

I'm probably going to have to pay my company for the loss of the equipment (we were warned not to leave them anywhere carelessly) and the cost of the window replacement has already been another $400. I was hoping to at least get the bag and files back, discarded somewhere once the electronics were stolen, but we couldn't find them around the area, and no word from the police yet on the case. I've already given it all up for lost.

The anger I had toward the thief was mostly blended with disappointment. Like you said, what did their life have to be like for this to be their best choice? What makes it worse is that I work for a company specifically aimed at helping the poor and underprivileged, and unless he just wandered into the parking lot from somewhere else, he must have been a client of ours. I would have happily handed the guy a few hundred bucks, which is probably as much as the laptop was worth to him, if I knew his situation was desperate enough for him to do something like that.

Perspective on things like this is important. It's the difference between growing hateful and bigoted and distrustful, or moving on with your life. Forgiveness isn't just for the forgiven, but also peace for the forgiver.

Also, glad you got your cards back. My brother had his binder stolen at a hobby store, and was devastated until the community (which can often be great) found the culprit out and got it back for him.
