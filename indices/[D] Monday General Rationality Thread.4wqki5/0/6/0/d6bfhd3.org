I find it amusing to imagine someone who might have been about to steal the bike, saw the sign, and got so mad that they wrote that on it, but didn't, in the end, take it. I can't really imagine the alternative, some random person just walking by and deciding to write it at random. Maybe it was the same person both times, since you were presumably at the same college campus both times.
