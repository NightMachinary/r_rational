Why are you and [[/u/DaystarEld]] both assuming that the thefts against you were someone's "best choice"? Both crimes strike me as blatant low time preference opportunism. Not any kind of reasoned "this is the thing I should be doing right now", but instead "I /could/ do this right now".

I'd like to be presumptuous and speculate, play The Devil's Advocate a bit. Would you perhaps feel embarrassed at being angry over the theft of /MtG/ cards? Does that brush too close to negative stereotypes for comfort? They were still yours, they still represented not just "entirely too much" monetary value, but probably incalculable emotional investment. The thief had no idea what he was stealing - for all he knew it was necessary medicine, or something required for work, or to pay the rent and but food.

Do you perhaps feel a social pressure to take the zen stance? Conspicuous disapproval at crime is Red Tribe behavior, after all. Good Blue Tribe members (particularly those in very low crime areas) instead make conspicuous displays of sympathizing with those who commit crimes against them. A few notable, recent European examples had rape victims refusing to report their attackers, for fear of justifying accusations of immigrant propensity for sex crimes. Do you think those people felt morally superior to those who predicted that such crimes were likely to occur?

Have you considered that there may be benefits to displays of disapproval, to disincentivize antisocial behavior? Perhaps if the thief had encountered more people expressing the belief that criminals were Vile Scum instead of Sympathetic/Heroic Victims Who Hold All Moral Authority, he may have paid more attention to the other things he could have done right then, or decided on a different best course of action.

Obviously, neither of us knows the particulars of this individual. He could be someone with a sympathetic story, even after correcting for biases in his personal account. Or he could just be a dumb asshole with a terminal case of impatience. Just offering some food for thought.
