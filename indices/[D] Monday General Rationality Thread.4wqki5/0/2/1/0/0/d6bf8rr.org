  not that you specifically said they "Hold All Moral Authority", but that society in general gives that impression nowadays, which is a sentiment I would agree with.

Could you elaborate on this? In what way does our society give the impression that criminals hold "all moral authority?" I honestly don't understand what you're trying to say.

  if the only data point you have for someone is 'smashed someone's window to steal items', wouldn't it be a fair statement to say that the odds are that they are a bad person?
#+end_quote

I don't actually know. What's your base rate for chance any given person is "bad?" 49%? More than that? And what % of "good people" have ever broken a window to steal something?

I'm not trying to be difficult, I'm honestly curious how you'd quantify your beliefs. Breaking windows and stealing are undeniably bad actions. But if a singular bad action was all it took to make a /bad person,/ I feel safe concluding that there exist no such thing as a good person.

And sure, you or [[/u/iconochasm]] might say that breaking a car window and stealing is not the same thing as lying to someone or stealing a sandwich when hungry or some other more minor bad thing that a person might have done in their youth. It's certainly worse than anything I've ever done... but it's far from the worst thing a person can do, or even the worst thing that occurs in any given city on a daily basis.

And again, I'm not trying to absolve criminals of their guilt or responsibility, and I don't think [[/u/Frommerman]] is either. I finally finished that blog post I mentioned about the importance and [[http://www.daystareld.com/guilt/][power of guilt]]. I just think that, in this case, hate or blanket condemnation of the thief is probably not a more constructive mentality.
