Just my two cents, but I think [[/u/Iconochasm]]'s point is not that you specifically said they "Hold All Moral Authority", but that society in general gives that impression nowadays, which is a sentiment I would agree with.

And while everyone would like their actions to be judged in context, if the only data point you have for someone is 'smashed someone's window to steal items', wouldn't it be a fair statement to say that the odds are that they are a bad person? While /some/ people who took such an action may be in extenuating circumstances that minimize the evil actions they took, or even justify it, /most/ people who undertake such an action don't have such justifications.
