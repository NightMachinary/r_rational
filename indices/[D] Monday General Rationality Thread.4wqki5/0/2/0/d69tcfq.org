I mean, I did say I would testify against him. I see my responsibility to be as good as I can to all humans as separate from the state's responsibility to correct and prevent crime in this issue.

The guy is probably an asshole, which is why he had prior warrants. However, I don't know that. In particular, I can't feel mad at him if his plan was to sell the cards to get drug money because that's more or less a biological imperative. If that's the reason he broke into my car, I'd argue his brain and human physiology betrayed him.

I refuse to judge him until I have more information. If and when I find out more, that will be the time to form personal conclusions regarding his character.
