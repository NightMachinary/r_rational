I don't know whether this would go here or in the off-topic thread, but I just wanted to share an experience.

In April, I had my Magic collection stolen out of my car while I was at a restaurant. They shattered my back window and took my backpack. The collection is worth...entirely too much, so this was a pretty terrible thing.

Fast forward about two weeks. I get a call from the police saying they've found my backpack. Apparently the guy who stole it had no idea what he had, and decided to take it to a local game store to sell it. Unfortunately for him, I had contacted every game store in the city and every online store as well, warning them about the theft. My collection is pretty unique, so the proprietors of the store in question recognized it from my Reddit post immediately and surreptitiously called the police.

The guy was arrested on prior warrants. The interesting thing, from the perspective of this sub, is that I have decided on a personal level that it is not rational to be angry at him.

I know nothing about him. I know nothing about his life, how he grew up, nothing about his general circumstances. What I do know is that he considered shattering someone's window and stealing their stuff to be a reasonable way forward in life, which is terrible, but is in my opinion more indicative of a deeply broken life and person than an evil one. How shitty must his life have been, after all, for that to feel like the best thing he can do?

He's going to jail, no worries about that. I also don't know what the prior warrant was for, and it's up to the state to build their case against him. I will testify against him if I'm called, but I would want to talk with him first because I'm curious about his perspective on the matter. I would want to know more about him before condemning him, instead of just throwing him to the wolves because he did something shitty to me personally.

I don't think I would have felt this way about it if I did not frequent this sub. I just found that interesting.
