  Have you considered that there may be benefits to displays of disapproval, to disincentivize antisocial behavior?

I agree that there's great value in shaming others for their harmful acts, when those acts are truly harmful and anti-social. I'm actually writing a blog post about it, and the valuable role of guilt in changing behavior.

But this:

#+begin_quote
  Perhaps if the thief had encountered more people expressing the belief that criminals were Vile Scum instead of Sympathetic/Heroic Victims Who Hold All Moral Authority, he may have paid more attention to the other things he could have done right then, or decided on a different best course of action.

Is you attacking a strawman, edging from presumption into something vaguely more insulting than merely playing Devil's Advocate. Where do either of us say the thieves "Hold All Moral Authority?" Where do we even call them "Heroic?" I think you're twisting yourself into an odd position to speculate that [[/u/Frommerman]] and I are only being forgiving as a result of social pressure, or out of desire to be "good Blue Tribe members," and in the process are revealing your own biases rather than exploring ours.

Maybe I'm wrong. But to settle the question of my own thoughts on the matter, at the very least you can discount the feeling of "embarrassment" for being angry over magic cards, considering I lost something far more "serious." The loss of company equipment, money, and irreparable damage to my job (potentially even losing it) is at the forefront of my mind when I consider my anger at the thief, and how much damage he potentially did, not just to me, who he's never met, but my clients, who he probably wouldn't even have known to consider when taking the actions he did.

What stops me from condemning him in my mind and holding onto that anger is the simple understanding that desperation and greed are two different things. I don't know which was at play here: blatant low-time-preference-opportunism, as you call it, is indistinguishable as an act from a desperate man or a greedy one. So I'm not going to judge a stranger on one rather than the other until I know for a fact which was which.

Just like I wouldn't want someone to judge my own actions in a vacuum. I can still say that the thief was wrong, can still say that they should be prosecuted, without condemning them as a person.
