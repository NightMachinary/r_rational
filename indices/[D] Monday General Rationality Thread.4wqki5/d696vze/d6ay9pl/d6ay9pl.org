When I was in college, I bought a cute little 3-speed bicycle for $5 at a church rummage sale. I'd had several bicycles stolen at that point and wasn't going to buy anything new, but this was so cheap that I decided that if people were just going to cut the locks, I wouldn't bother to lock it. I made a little laminated paper sign that attached to the seat with an elastic strap.

It said: "/This bicycle is protected only by my faith in the underlying goodness of human nature./" With a smiley face sticker.

Twice people wrote "FUCK YOU" on the sign (both times it washed off) but nobody ever stole my $5 bike. A few years ago the gear assembly self-destructed or I'd still have it today.
