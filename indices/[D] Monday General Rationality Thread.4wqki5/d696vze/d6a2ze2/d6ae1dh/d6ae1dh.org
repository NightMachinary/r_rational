Oh, I know that is perhaps true, maybe even likely true. But I don't know it for certain to be true, and I am going to withhold judgment until such time as I do.

And, even in that case, it's still difficult to judge them. If they are a case of antisocial personality disorder, I'd argue they had no choice in the matter. They didn't choose to have nonfunctional mirror neurons, nor to have impulsive behavior as a default mode of action. That is the fault of their brain, not them. You still lock them up of course, for the safety of the rest of society, but not out of personal malice towards them.

If that's not the case, then they were somehow /made/ to be that way. I don't want to imagine the horrors that a neurotypical child would have to go through to make them that broken.
