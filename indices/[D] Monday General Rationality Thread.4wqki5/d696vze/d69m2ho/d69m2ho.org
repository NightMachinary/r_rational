I've had 2 ipods stolen out of my car, and each time I have the same reaction as you. I've never been in a place where I would commit petty theft, but I imagine it's terrible. I have it pretty good, so I just tell myself they needed it more than I did.

To broaden the context of this, I think the is the rationale behind a very strong welfare state if capitalism is the economic system. You don't want to have a dog-eat-dog game where everyone is forced to play for their survival. Instead, much better to gift things to people (a social dividend?) to increase quality of life to the point that it simply isn't worth it for the poor to steal. This sort of enormous safety net is at odds with the morality of "earning," but I think that's an outmoded morality that was suited for an economy with a shortage of labor.
