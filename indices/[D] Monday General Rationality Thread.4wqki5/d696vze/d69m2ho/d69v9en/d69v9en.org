Absolutely. Welfare is more or less a zero-sum system (I would argue in many ways that it's better, opponents would argue that in many ways it's worse) but crime is unarguably negative-sum. My thief couldn't possibly have sold or made use of that laptop for anywhere near the value it was worth, let alone worth to me specifically. And not only did I lose out on the monetary value of the things stolen and the broken window, but also the loss of important work-related documents are irreplaceable.
