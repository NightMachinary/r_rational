The only entry I can find for "divine herald" is Pathfinder. Is it a 3.5 thing as well? (Not that that is necessarily a showstopper, I'm just curious.)

On that subject...what exactly is the deal with Pathfinder? Is it a campaign setting? A revamp of the rules? Some of each? Where did it come from? (canon, 3rd party, etc) and why? Answers or pointers to the FM welcome.
