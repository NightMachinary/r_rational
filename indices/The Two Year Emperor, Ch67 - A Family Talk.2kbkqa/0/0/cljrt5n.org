  Given that the FLEA exists, does Drifa losing her levels really matter?
#+end_quote

Well, the levels can be restored, but she's going to lose her connection to her goddess, whom Drifa has dedicated her entire life to since she was 18 years old. She spent a century or two in the field, fighting to protect Amilsandre's people and their homes from every nasty thing that goes bump in the night. Then she spent some time in the upper echelons of Amilsandre's church, learning the political / economic / logistical side of making sure that people have homes and safety. Finally she became the head of the entire church, and spent all her time working to make sure that the church ran as smoothly as possible.

Now Amilsandre is going to shun her, strip away every tangible scrap of that lifetime of service, and render her untouchable by all faithful -- from now on, no worshipper of Amilsandre may speak to, sell to, or shelter Drifa. Ever.

So, yeah, it kinda matters.

  This is likely partially because I spent most of it in fits of laughter

Thanks! I had a lot of fun writing Drifa's lines; I was snickering most of the way through. I'm glad it came across as funny OUTSIDE of my head.
