It shows up in Deities and Demigods, IIRC, but it wasn't important. They're mentioned occasionally in other sourcebooks (I know the Tome of Magic mentions Andromalius as a former herald of Olidammara). Pathfinder included a lot more material in the freely-available published material, so it shows up there.

Pathfinder is not, legally speaking, D&D. It's unofficially called D&D 3.75, or occasionally just "Totally-not-Dungeons-and-Dragons." It's printed by Paizo, who wrote Dungeon and Dragon magazines for years (So it'c not quite 3rd party, but not quite canon either.) It picked up where edition 3.5 left off, with both extensive support for the OGL and very similar mechanics; it was originally going to be a set of tweaks, but they decided they wanted to change a little more than that and gave it an independent rulebook and title. It's basically a wholesale rebalancing, with more options added for everything and a new, pulpy campaign setting added.

I'm a big fan. When it looked like D&D NEXT was going to keep floundering, I was in favor of them scuttling their operations and selling the brand to Paizo, because they've done good things so far.
