  Are there any Amilsandre followers in Grofhamr? I had thought that they'd all converted to Herr√∫n.

Yep, there still are. Many of the people have switched, but not everyone. It's only been a few days so far since the ritual started; changing your primary object of worship away from your chosen god is a tough thing to do, even in a polytheistic religion where it's ok to pray to multiple gods.
