I think there is a level of difference between what Joon considers to be a DMPC, ie someone directly controlled by the DM, and the emulation of a person. Presumably, Vervain wasn't a full person like basically everyone else probably is, more of a vessel for the DM to act through to get Arthur off his ass. It's the level of direct interference that the DM has on their minds and decision-making. There is a lot on Aerb that the DM doesn't seem to directly interfere with after it gets going, even if he's running the software, for reasons of fair play.
