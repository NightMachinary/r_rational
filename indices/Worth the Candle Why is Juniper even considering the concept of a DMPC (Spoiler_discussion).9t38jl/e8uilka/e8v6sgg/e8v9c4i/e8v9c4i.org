There are a lot of differences.

If you stumbled upon a sufficiently advanced computer and started a simulation of an universe, it would not make you yourself all-powerful as a being. You could probably not even be all-knowing in the universe you created, as you probably don't live long enough to go through everything that ever happens in it, even if you can pause and rewind it and read everyone's thoughts.

Whether or not you are actually a god as your being does matter. Because as non-god your motives and needs and wants would most probably be completely different than if you were an actual god. If you are not a god, someone could maybe trick you, or you could actually just fail in your goal, whatever it was. Like if you wanted to play a grand good vs. evil thing and planned that good wins, the simulation would be so massive and there would be so many rules that maybe the evil just wins anyway unless you start smiting them or restart the simulation or something.
