  The DMPC is exactly not that. It's a character that is puppeteered by the DM if not all the time, then most of the time when Joon meaningfully interacts with them.

Why would the set of qualia known as "Mr. Dice Guy" (DM) pretend to be another set of qualia known as "Vervain" when he could instead just instance a set of qualia that IS "Vervain" (rather than one set of qualia imperfectly pretending to be another) and then tweak the variables of Vervain's mind on the fly to make Vervain's goals align with the DM's? The DM's computational substrate is the ultimate method actor because it can instance any mind the DM wishes, and alter it at any time in any way he wishes. (I would say the DM definitely has these capabilities since Jun also has a watered down game balanced version of these capabilities via soul magic.)

As far as I can see considering these factors, the definition of a DMPC is just someone whose mind the DM is more likely to tweak than the characters the DM is supposedly hands off from.
