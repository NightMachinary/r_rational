Even assuming Aerb is some sort of simulation, PCs, NPCs, and DMPCs are entirely different things. The player character (Jun or Arthur) are actors controlled by the player; the NPCs are controlled by the DM, but are not actors themselves, they can be said to have no free will or perfect knowledge; the DMPC is an actor controlled by the DM. The DM has a perfect or near perfect knowledge of the simulation. If a PC knew every horrific thing that the party would encounter throughout a dungeon, and the perfect solution to any problem encountered, the only moral choice, or logical choice would be to inform the PCs, and even the NPCs. Vervain did none of those things, and Arthur suffered terribly.

I'm not certain of Arthur's contact with the DM but if he believed that Vervain was the voice of god, such as it was, he reacted no differently than Jun, or perhaps even more reasonably since vervain was a companion and friend which had been guiding him into what can only be described as a horrific life. Pretty much the first thing Jun did to the DM was beat him to death. Imagine if it turned out that Grak or Amryillis or Fenn knew everything that would result of Jun's choices, and just let it happen.
