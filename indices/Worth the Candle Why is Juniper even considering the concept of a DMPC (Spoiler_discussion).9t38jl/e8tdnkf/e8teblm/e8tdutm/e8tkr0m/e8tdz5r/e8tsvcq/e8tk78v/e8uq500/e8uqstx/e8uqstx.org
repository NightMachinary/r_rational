  Why would the set of qualia known as "Mr. Dice Guy" (DM) pretend to be another set of qualia known as "Vervain" when he could instead just instance a set of qualia that IS "Vervain" (rather than one set of qualia imperfectly pretending to be another) and then tweak the variables of Vervain's mind on the fly to make Vervain's goals align with the DM's?

Because he confessed to having a personal preference towards one and not the other at least in some cases. Now that could be a lie. Or it may be true. The valid answer you have to consider is still "personal preference".

It doesn't look true to me in Vervain's case, but the evidence is too weak to be anywhere near conclusive.
