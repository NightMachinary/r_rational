Ah, of course. I went back and read that part of Chapter 109 again.

It's odd how Arthur spoke to Joon. I would have expected Arthur to think that Juniper was for sure the Dungeon Master, but the message he left was more like Arthur knew Juniper didn't make and control the world, just that it drew inspiration from Juniper's mind.

Did Arthur go for many years convinced that Juniper was toying with him in role of the Dungeon Master and then somehow learn that Juniper wasn't behind everything and that it would be possible that Juniper could enter the world in the future?

It almost felt like when Arthur said “I'm glad you're here” that it was like how a prisoner would say it to a warden, when the warden was condemned to the same jail.
