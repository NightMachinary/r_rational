  All the party members are DMPCs.

No, that's... not really true. The difference here is that the simulated NPCs are presumed to be simulated in earnest, with the DM not really micromanaging their behaviour. That's what simulation is /all about/, to take most of the labour off the DM. It's more or less an equal playing field with the DM. A truly simulated NPC can surprise Joon just as well they can surprise the DM (if DM is human).

The DMPC is exactly not that. It's a character that is puppeteered by the DM if not all the time, then most of the time when Joon meaningfully interacts with them.

We don't know why Arthur declared Vervain a DMPC. Maybe he had good evidence (not equals 'Arthur was right'), or maybe he was nuts.

Joon can dismiss any musings about DMPCs simply as something he can't really do anything about. But dismissing the idea as a whole is an obvious mistake.
