I think it's still a meaningful concept. It's the difference between the DM creating a person and letting them run independently from that start point, and the DM controlling every action of a person. Yes, the DM still controls the start point of that person, and could shape that person to lead to the outcomes they desire, but there's a difference between someone being an independent being with their own thoughts, motivations etc, and them just being a sockpuppet
