  All are emulations of human minds created by the DM and running on the DM's computational substrate

While this is true, up to this point we've been assuming the DM is computing the brain states of each party member the same way that he does Joon's, ie, they have qualia.

The implication of calling Vervain a DMPC is that Vervain wasn't even an emulation with his own thoughts and feelings, just Dice Guy self-inserting himself into Aerb and acting out a character.
