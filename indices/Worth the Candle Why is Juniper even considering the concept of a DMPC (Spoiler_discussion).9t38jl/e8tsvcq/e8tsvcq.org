From Arthur's point of view he wakes up in a game that is completely made from Juniper's ideas. Who do you think Arthur would think the DM is? He probably said to Vervain so many times "Fuck you, Joon. Let me out of this game! At least admit to me you're fucking with me." until he lost it and killed him.

When Joon finds Arthur, Arthur is not going to be happy to see him.
