Even if we as readers can imagine the concept doesn't /need/ to have meaning from the actual DM's point of view, Joon has evidence that /Arthur belives/ it has meaning to the DM, and the interactions Joon /has/ had with the DM support or at least don't contradict the premise that the DM /does/ think in those terms. So it's as true as anything else in the game world, really, and there's no downside to thinking the implications all the way through before dismissing the conflict /if and when/ that is the proper response.
