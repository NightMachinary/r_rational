I agree Vervain would have said he wasn't Juniper. But I thought that Arthur just stopped believing him and got frustrated, hence the killing and the DMPC message.

What message did Arthur leave for Juniper? I remember something about a Juniper tree on Smith's grave or something? But I don't remember that conveying specific ideas.
