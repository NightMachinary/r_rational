Following that chain of logic, all NPCs are also DMPCs, which doesn't quite mesh with what (my understanding) a DMPC is.\\
In a tabletop RPG, one of the differences between an NPC and a DMPC is how the character interacts with the party. While an NPC might have a fleshed out background, things they want to accomplish, goals, desires, etc, the DM roleplays as that NPC to the benefit of the verisimilitude of the world. As a player, you expect the people you interact with to behave like people, with their own lives, and stories, and motivation to behave the way they do.

A DMPC is different. Sometimes they are a character the DM is particularly attached to (either a character they really wanted to play in a game themselves, or a theory crafted something or other that they never got to play), and the DM favors this NPC with lots of "screen time", special magical powers, or other "look at me!" types of stuff.\\
Other times, the DMPC play out an in-game reason for the players to follow a particular path, allowing the DM to subtly guide the players down routes they might otherwise not choose to go down.

The DMPC has an intelligence guiding its motivations outside of a simple backstory or a quest to give. It serves as an Avatar of the DM's will in the world, influencing the only characters whose decisions the DM doesn't normally get to make.

The players.

Since arriving in Aerb, Juniper has seen and dealt with a lot of strange things and to "immediately dismiss the concept of a DMPC" and immediately conclude Arthur was mad doesn't really seem consistent with his character.

Just my two cents. :)
