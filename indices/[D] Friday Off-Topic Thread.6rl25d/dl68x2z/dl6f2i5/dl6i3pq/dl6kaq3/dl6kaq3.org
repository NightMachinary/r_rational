I totally agree with that interpretation of the illogic and it does help me deal with the way my depression rationalizes itself, it was all the other stuff Kamina did that I found kind of stupid. His decisions worked out in the end, but things like trying to combine mecha by slamming them together before he knew Lagaan could do that were objectively dumb decisions. He's not a bad character, I just liked Simon more from the start.

I know what the show meant when Kamina and later Simon pulled someone out of a depression by punching them in the face, that's just not something that would've worked in the context of my life or any of the people I've helped with depression. I wouldn't have had any context to understand it at all if I hadn't seen the suicide arc from Welcome to the NHK where I agreed with the criticism the depressed people received.

I think Gurren Lagaan promotes a good vision of masculinity, even if it doesn't spend as much time warning against the toxic interpretations of it, it just doesn't appeal to me as much because I have never thought of myself as masculine despite being a cisgender male. I've always personally identified with intellectual characters who tend to support others because I lack charisma and often question my convictions.

In some ways, I've always thought of myself as more archetypically feminine. I still feel psychological pressure to be masculine and associate masculine archetypes with good things, but for most of my life have firmly believed that I am incapable of embodying such ideals and decided I was okay with being a stereotypical nerd. My personality has always tended towards "submissive" even if I'd like to be more "dominant".
