You know, that's the funny thing. I've never been anything other than male, but until /Gurren Lagann/, I never really felt /good/ about being male. It wasn't something that was working well for me, and it wasn't something society told me had any particular virtues that didn't come with over-balancing downsides in the modern world.

TTGL made me finally feel proud about the category I fall into, as if my maleness really has something to give the world. Sure, it /is/ illogical. It says so: "go beyond the impossible, and kick logic to the curb!" But being illogical is genuinely important, because the map is /not/ the territory. The "logic" in your head is often not the logic of the real world, and until you [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/up/shut_up_and_do_the_impossible/][/kick it to the curb and go beyond the impossible/]], you can't even know how limited you're letting yourself be.

(See? Everything Kamina said was actually profound!)

I'd like to see I've been there, but it's more accurate to say I'm /being/ there.
