I'd like to thank you for getting me to finally watch Gurren Lagaan after all this time because it ended up having the desired effect of fueling my optimistic outlook on life. The show isn't going in my all-time favorites, but I almost feel like that's a good thing since the story is so illogical and the themes so rooted in aggressive masculine archetypes that someone in my situation should probably only take it as a reminder of my personal philosophy rather than a direct inspiration for it.

Considering that I've spent the past few years going through depressive episodes due to my inability to live up to my own standards, which caused me to fall even further further from aspirations for self-improvement, that was a reminder I sorely needed. I'm actually thankful the irrational elements of the series annoys me because that acts as another reminder to remain idealistic without following those ideals blindly.

As for the story itself, the second arc is my favorite because Simon's struggle against depression resonates with me and Nia's unrelenting compassion was inspiring. The rest of the show consisted of ideas I really liked with execution I had mixed feelings for, but I was still satisfied in the end and the mythic scope of the themes kept me from judging it by the standards of a kid's show.

So now that I finally have the context to understand all the praise you've been giving to [[https://www.webnovel.com/book/6838665402001705/6850172302001300][Forty Milleniums of Cultivation]] all this time, I'm damn excited to start reading. Ever since you first pitched it on this sub it has sounded like the exact kind of story I want to have in my life, hits all the marks I've been demanding from stories lately, and even has some tropes that subjectively appeal to me like [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialArtsAndCrafts][Martial Arts and Crafts]].
