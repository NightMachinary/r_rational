That's the 'slow' part of the beginning of the story, yes. Conventional run-of-the-mill xianxia novels tend to do nothing but heap benefits upon benefits upon the character in an effort to deliver the most distilled power-fantasy possible, to the point where the behavior has become sort of ingrained as a trope, the same way that, idk, falling-into-waifu-boobs and panty-shots have become deplorable but commonplace conventions in anime.

There's almost a feeling that if you don't write an absurdly op mary sue, then your work wont even have the baseline audience of 'people who read xianxia specifically as an escapist power fantasy', which will lead to the work failing- similar to how for a while the visual novel industry was afraid to back projects without sexually explicit content, because of how even the shittiest story could apparently be guaranteed to make a certain baseline popularity just by coasting off the lowest common denominator audience alone.

Basically, this sort of thing is... the author's concession to 'genre tropes'. You have to realize that, for the first hundred chapters, the author of FMoC wasnt sure if he was going to write a generic-but-financially-predictable shonen xianxia mary-sue power fantasy, or the much more risky but interesting Tengen Toppa Gurren Rationality 40k we actually got. Choosing to /not/ write the metaphorical equivalent of a fanservice-moebait-pantyshot-waifubait-haremromcom in this context was a massive risk for the author, and it paid off massively, but the first few chapters still show a lot of early-installment weirdness!

(This is also part of why original fantasy IPs in china are regarded with lower status than they might otherwise be- there's a similar sort of stigma going on with the genre as a whole. )

Anyways, back on topic- this sort of 'overload your limiter to unlock greater true potential' thing is just, generally speaking, how a lot of xianxia novels explain powerups for the protagonist. Just try to think of it as, like, how saiyans in dbz get more powerful everytime they approach near-death. It's a whole /trope/. It doesn't monopolize the story too much from here on out, as the story's focus goes more towards societal worldbuilding over Li Yao's personal powergrinding, but it is still a thing, on occasion. Just a heads-up.
