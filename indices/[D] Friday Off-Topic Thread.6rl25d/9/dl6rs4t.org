Ok, we have had plenty of important questions on this reddit so far, now for something incredibly mundane: public washrooms.

As a germophobe, I try to avoid using any washroom outside my home, but sometimes it is unavoidable. During these times, what bothers me the most can be "how do I get out of this washroom?" If it's an open door, I can just walk out. If it's a pushable door, I can push it open with my feet, which are nicely protected by my shoes. But if it's a pullable-only door? Now I'm stumped.

Unfortunately, the washrooms at my workplace are all closed by pullable-only doors (pullable from the inside). But what's interesting is that the handle is vertical, kind of like a horseshoe or a shopping bag handle, but made of metal and vertical. In it's intended usage, one should grasp the entire handle with a hand, and simply pull it towards oneself. But being a germaphobe, I realize I can minimize surface contact by using a single finger, which is important because the sink is inside the washroom, so I can't wash my hands again after exiting.

This then presents an interesting problem: where should I grasp the vertical handle? The top? The bottom? The middle? There seem to be pros and cons for various positions.

For example, small children are usually short and have poor hygiene, and may frequently grasp the handle without washing their hands, so the lower parts of the handle may be dirtier than the higher parts.

On the other hand, you would expect taller people to grasp the door by the top, and taller people probably produce more excretions than shorter people since they have more body mass. So taller people might leave more germs on the area that they grasp, meaning the top part of the handle may actually have more germs than the lower parts.

Then again, the gunk and grime on people's hands may include liquids, which can slide down the handle, so it might be that the lower parts are instead the dirtier portion of the handle.

And so I seek the knowledge (and opinions) of [[/r/rational]], where would you grasp a vertical handle to minimize germ transfer?
