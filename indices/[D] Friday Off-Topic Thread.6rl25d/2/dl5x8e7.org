Some reads:

[[https://www.engadget.com/amp/2017/07/12/hyperloop-one-70mph-test-devloop/][Hyperloop had its first successful test run]]. Big news, but a long way to go.

[[https://www.wired.com/2016/09/beautiful-book-reveals-architectures-impact-politics/][The layout of parliament seating.]] Less trivial than you might think.

[[http://potlatch.typepad.com/weblog/2014/12/governing-through-unhappiness.html]["Governing through unhappiness"]] and I guess, the rise of audits over politics? An interesting read but hard to explain.
