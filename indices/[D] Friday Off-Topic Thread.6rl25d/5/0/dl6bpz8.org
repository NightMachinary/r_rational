I absolutely love JL8. At a time when I didn't understand the concept of finding things "cute", this came along and shocked me not only with how /adorable/ it was but also how emotionally mature it was. This story is the definition of wholesome, these kids actually learn important life lessons that are just as applicable to me as an adult as to children.

What's especially impressive is how this was all done while keeping every member of the cast in-character with their canon counterparts and making thematically appropriate references to the original stories. I totally believe that these kids will grow up to be the icons of DC comics, and that shows the author has a deep understanding of the characters.

The scene that sums up everything I love about this comic is when Bruce comes home after a rough day at school and /talks to a plush robin about his troubles/. Not only is that the most adorable things I've ever seen and advances his character arc beautifully through introspection, it makes perfect sense for where Batman got the name from and what it had meaning to him.
