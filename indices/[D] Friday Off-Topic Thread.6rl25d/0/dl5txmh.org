[[/u/bambamramfan]], whom you may know from his [[http://prequelsredeemed.blogspot.com/][film analysis blog]] which I believe has been linked in this sub before, has recently started a new blog project: [[https://exploringegregores.wordpress.com/who-worships-an-evil-god-2/][Exploring Egregores]].

  Sometimes people in the rationalist community write about egregores. Scott has written about Moloch. Sarah Constantin wrote a great one about Ra. That's more about the results of processes than something individuals would worship (like the Invisible Hand), but the feeling of them seemed very right. They were terrible and inhuman, a drive given form that we could never really comprehend.

  Moloch and Ra sound a lot like what happens when you read too much of a book, and are wholly given over to some greater Thing, that has no concern for normal, boring, human life. So: what if the whole suite of gods in the Mythos were egregores like that?

Disclaimer for transparency: The author is a personal friend of mine and I have seen drafts of these in advance of publication. In fact, reading the draft for Cthugha is why I changed my flair on this sub to Cultist of Cthugha two months ago.
