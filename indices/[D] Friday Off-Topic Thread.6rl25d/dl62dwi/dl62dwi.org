I'm looking for guest readers and voice actors for the Pok√©mon: the Origin of Species podcast. Im interested in finding someone to read both the Launa interludes (Red's Mother). Both chapters are a lot of fun. I'm also interested in attempting full cast episodes if there's enough interest.

If you're interested or would like more information, shoot me a message! Alternatively you can comment in the discord. [[https://discord.gg/gEKNhTk]]
