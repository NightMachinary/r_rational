I put it in quotes because I couldn't think of a more appropriate terminology even though I know it's inaccurate and a false dichotomy. I just have tendencies that happen to line up with that archetype, though it certainly does not describe me in totality.

I was introduced to the concept of gender dysphoria at a young age and have questioned my identity before so I don't think I'm trans. I mean, it's hard to prove a negative, but I've never experienced the kind of disconnect between body and mind the way transpeople have described it.
