So I'm up to the 130s chapters in /Forty Milleniums of Cultivation/, and this is fast turning into one of my all-time favorites, right alongside /Gurren Lagann/. Some nice quotes:

  /Naturally, man struggles upwards as water flows downwards./
#+end_quote

That is... that is... /that is what it means to be human, holy shit, this author fucking nailed it./ I am quoting that the next time I have to write a dedication for literally anything. "Man struggles upwards as water flows downwards."

  Prior to the Mystic Skeleton Battlesuit, the cheapest crystal suit [power armor] was worth over 500 million [credits], and that was just a training model. It wasn't equipped with any noticeable offensive magical equipment.

  Before, spending an amount of 500 million could only arm a single cultivator, but now, it could arm at least five cultivators!

Holy shit. There's the [[/r/rational]] content, right there. It's an explicit discussion of the economics and engineering principles behind arming and armoring a Space Marine Legion, complete with notes that in the +Great Crusade+Star Ocean Imperium era, the +Man-+Emperor +of Mankind+ knew how to mass produce power-armor but the technology was lost during the +Horus Heresy+Armageddon Rebellion by his +Chaos+demonically corrupted son.

The main character and his university department make it their explicit goal: change the strategies and economics of humanity's war against demon-beasts by /engineering/ an industrial-grade power armor.

  The Soviet-style weapons that had a common structure, low manufacturing costs, were easy to operate, and were constantly produced in a steady stream from simple factories, forming an overwhelming steel army. A sea of boorish and uncivilized soldiers, who had only the courage but not the battle experience, after equipping these simple weapons, forcibly suppressed the German-style weapons and the elite among the elite soldiers, and in the end, had even pushed them back. Those extremely exquisite German weapons that wer called a work of art were all completely smashed into bits.

UNITED TOGETHER IN FRIENDSHIP AND LABOR, OUR GREAT SOVIET UNION SHALL FOREVER STAND!
