The one thing I seriously disliked was having Li Yao granted First Class Federation Disabled Serviceman status for overloading his qi and passing out during a pre-exam competition. That just seems like a Gary Stu-ism: having a demon beast get superpowered and cause trouble during the contest was kinda predictable, but actually fighting it and surviving shouldn't be given an extra, lifelong reward. It should just be, "You fought the accidental, interloping supercharged demon beast before reinforcements could arrive, and you survived. Congrats on surviving. You should be dead."

Especially because he restored his Spirit Actualization Quotient and even expanded it in, what, a month? Did we need an extra one-month training arc after the whole several previous training arcs, followed by Li Yao getting free money and train tickets the rest of his life?
