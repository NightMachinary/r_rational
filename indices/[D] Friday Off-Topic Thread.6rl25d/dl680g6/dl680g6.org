I've been reading a Justice League comic called [[http://limbero.org/jl8/1][JL8]] that's probably the best version of the "characters aged down to children" comics I've ever read, on par with a Dragonball Z one I randomly found online like 15 years ago that I haven't been able to find since.

Figured others might be entertained by it, but [[http://limbero.org/jl8/104][this comic in particular]] tickled me, since the idea of Batman and Superman having developed a way to talk to each other secretly as kids is both rational and adorable.
