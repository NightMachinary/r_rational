Absolutely to all that. Not only is the central cast perfect, it also brings in many non-central DC characters very well, when they show up (and even characters from Sandman, which I keep forgetting is DC).

Also it's just downright hilarious: it's rare for me to find a comic that makes me actually laugh out loud rather than just exhale air from my nose in occasional amusement.
