I got a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-energy_X-ray_absorptiometry][DXA scan]] a few days ago after hearing that my gym offered them for $24 a pop ($12 if you have their insurance). Had one done a while back and was a bit underwhelmed that my results came back almost identical to 1.5y before (15% BF @ 25y/6'1"/190lbs), but not too disappointed given how little effort I've devoted to lifting the past 1.5y. I've seen people ask about fitness-y body recomposition type stuff on here before, so I'd recommend exploring the possibility of having a scan done as one way to quantifiably benchmark your current status, see how much fat you can potentially lose, ballpark rmr more reliably, track changes in muscle and fat mass at a finer grain than just through weight, etc.

On a tangentially related note, I'm watching [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Wars!:_Shokugeki_no_Soma][a show about cooking]] right now and it's got me thinking -- why don't foodies/gourmets/gourmands/epicures/etc. do more to explore enhancing the pleasures provided by food through means other than modifying the composition of the food itself, but rather through fasting and exercise? I've eaten at a wide range of places and do a lot of cooking myself, and yet the tastiest meals I've had have overwhelmingly been during or after long hikes. A metric buttload of gas station candy and two Subway footlongs consumed after a few dozen mi of empty belly's trudge were more delicious than any fine dining I've ever had, and seems to me an experience much more accessible than ponying up $$ for fancy restaurants with long waitlists and rare ingredients. To a lesser extent, eating relatively homogenous and bland foods (e.g. Pasta Sides and Snickers) for a week+ straight can turn otherwise decent novelty into an amazing flavor explosion, if fasting is too demanding.

Likewise, it's well accepted that the esthetic elements of a dish independent of its taste and smell influence our enjoyment of it, so a lot of care is taken to ensure that a meal's presentation and a restaurant's ambiance both serve to complement any direct consumption. But if one lives in a pretty place with decent weather, it's not hard with a short hike to beat for beauty even the most luxurious building interiors. There's some cost in time and effort (though the latter may be paid back, as mentioned above), and food from a thermal won't intrinsically taste better than fresh off the skillet, but I think the benefits here clearly outweigh the costs.

So I guess I wonder why there's not more attention paid to stuff like this when discussing how to improve meals -- e.g. something like "hummus with pita reaches peak enjoyment after having wakefully fasted for 10-12h [Sturgeon 2015] and accompanied by the melodic gurgle of a 110 ft, 2,000 cfs waterfall". Or maybe there's already some subfield of gastronomy that covers these considerations (beyond ofc determining that the effect exists, e.g. [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10594666]], [[https://bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com/%E2%80%A6/10.11%E2%80%A6/1471-2202-5-5][https://bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com/.../10.11.../1471-2202-5-5]], etc.)? This isn't really anything I'm formally familiar with. And naturally people picnic and haul their cast iron pans and w/e with them on camping trips all the time.
