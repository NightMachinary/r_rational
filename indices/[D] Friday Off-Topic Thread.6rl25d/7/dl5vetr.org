Is anyone interested in a writing group?

I've have a partial idea for a novel that I want to turn into a completed project. I bet a lot of people are in the same boat, and think a group could be helpful and motivating.

My goal for the group would be to get projects to a full first draft in less than a year. The timeline would be something like:

- Week 1: Story ideas & premise
- Week 2: Refine story summary
- Weeks 3 & 4: Create Structured Outline
- Weeks 5+: Work on draft, with > 2k new words / week

For outlines, I plan is to go through KM Welland's [[https://www.amazon.com/Structuring-Your-Novel-Workbook-Hands-ebook/dp/B00P72KYWA][Structuring Your Novel]] workbook. It seems to ask reasonable questions and produces the 'Hollywood story structure' that a lot of authors seem to like, with some extra notes no character and conflict.

From there, 2k words / week would get the project to novel length by the end of the first year.

To keep motivation up, I'd want to exchange weekly updates. There'd be an expectation that people would read each other's work and comment.

Actual group discussions would be online, probably every week or two, as needed.

What do people think? Does the plan sound reasonable? Are people interested in participating in something like this.
