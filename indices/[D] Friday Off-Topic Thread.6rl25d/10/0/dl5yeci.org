I'm not sure if it's "increase contempt" so much as "decrease awe and mystery."

The first time I encountered programming, it seemed like some kind of wizardry. But, then I started to understand the discipline piece-by-piece. And, once I learned enough pieces, the whole thing looks mundane.

I bet it's similar with people. They seem incomprehensibly competent when we meet them. Then we learn what they're doing.

And we lose our sense of awe.
