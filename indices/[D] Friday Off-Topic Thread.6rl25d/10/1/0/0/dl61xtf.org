Ah, it's just a grammatical complaint? I guess that's more understandable. Although the editor never said how he would correct the issue...how would [[/u/ToaKraka]] feel about the pronouns being replaced with "his/her" or "his or her"? Or "one's"?

Also, apologies to [[/u/ToaKraka]] for projecting the "anti-SJW" narrative onto that sigh. Many of my feeds are inundated with those types of PC stories and their subsequent vitriolic anti-PC reactions, so that was the first place my mind went.
