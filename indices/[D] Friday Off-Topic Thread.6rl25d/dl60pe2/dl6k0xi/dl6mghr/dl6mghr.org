I didn't have a problem with that, but yes, it becomes less prominent. More precisely, in FSN the One True Pairing takes over, and only Saber gets any romantic screen time. She is very reserved however, and there are only a few romantic scenes in total, all clustered toward the last few episodes. Rin remains a friend and ally. Similarly in Unlimited Blade Works, Saber is treated as basically asexual, and only Rin gets any significant romantic screen time. Both series are pretty tame, though. No kissing or sweet talking or discussing the future.

Fate Zero has very near zero romance. There is one pair in the entire 26 episodes that show each other any affection, and they already have a kid together when the series starts.
