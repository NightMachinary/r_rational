I really struggled to get through Fate Stay Night (anime) because of the weird gender stuff. I think I got to about 4 or 5 episodes in before I dropped it. Does that get any better? The way the characters apart from the main dude were behaving became annoying because they became so centered on him which was breaking my immersion.
