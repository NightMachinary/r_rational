Fate/stay night has its origin as a visual novel with three distinct routes, each with their own claim to fame*, and trying to collapse a branching plot tree into a linear narrative is going to be a lossy conversion any way you do it. Fate/Zero works very well as an anime because it was adapted from a light novel written by one of the best writers in the game, Gen Urobuchi, as a prequel.

*Fate is the simplest plot-and-character-wise, but a lot of people love the shit out of Saber. Unlimited Blade Works introduces the character of Heroic Spirit EMIYA, who gets memed to hell and back. Heaven's Feel is incredibly dark and fucked-up, and also contains the "true ending" because it's the route that explains the metaplot.
