I enjoyed railgun more than Index. However, they overlap and some of the episodes are about the same thing from a different perspective. Index also goes on longer. There are some cute characters from Railgun I wished would get more screen time, which they do in later Index episodes. Won't say who, because spoiler, but they are interesting. Unfortunately, that's mixed in with a lot of quite boring episodes that do not involve them. Starting with Railgun is probably the way to go. Says Rhamni says Rhamni, confidently explaining the situation.

Out of the three Fate shows, I think I enjoyed Unlimited Blade Works the most. It felt complete, but if there is more left to uncover in the VN, that pleases me greatly. I am currently playing through it to unlock the route that doesn't have an adaption yet, but it seems to do that I must complete the two other routes that do have adaptions.

Here's the thing. All three series spoil important things about the other two. Unlimited Blade Works definitely was made for people who have already seen Fate Stay Night, so don't start with that. Fate Zero... You'd think watching the prequel first would be the way to go, but I actually recommend starting with the original FSN. You'll probably like both regardless of viewing order, and of the three I think FSN was the least awesome (But still miles better than Railgun). But there are things in FSN that build up slowly and resolve with very satisfying twists, that Fate Zero assumes you know and spoils very unceremoniously. Of course, watching FSN first gives you a very good idea of who will survive the prequel, but in the end I think the plot twists and character secrets in FSN are more precious unspoiled than the suspense of who survives FZ. There are characters in FSN who seem to be one way part way or all the way through, but turn out to have enormous secrets, good bad and neutral. For me, one of the best parts of Fate Zero was having gone through FSN with one impression of a character and then have that shattered completely by the prequel. Now that I'm playing through the VN, I'm noticing things that would have completely passed me by if I hadn't seen all three series before playing. They are all great, and they all add a lot to the full picture.

Ultimately, it's up to you. The first episode of FSN will tell you most of the people who die in FZ, and the first episode of FZ will casually spoil half the hidden connections and tragic back stories of FSN.
