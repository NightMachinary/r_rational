  Sigh...

Why?

- The paper was /unintentionally/ published in English with just male pronouns, because of an oversight while translating from Polish (in which, according to the article, pronouns are gender-nonspecific).

- Looking at twitter, it doesn't seem like there was an "uproar"; some female surgeons just spoke up because they already work in a field that used to be a boys club and is still male-dominated, and publishing an article titled /Modern Surgeon: Still a Master of his Trade.../ only furthers that perception.

- The editor retracted the article, because this is an issue he and the journal care about, and they didn't want to alienate part of their target audience of surgeons.

- The article has already been corrected, and the journal says they'll republish a fixed version

- The original female surgeon “instigator” on twitter has already thanked the author, and no longer has any issues with the article.

To me, it sounds like this was a reasonable complaint that was handled fine on both sides. While PC culture can definitely get out of hand (especially in regards to language and/or gender), this situation isn't anything to get exasperated over.
