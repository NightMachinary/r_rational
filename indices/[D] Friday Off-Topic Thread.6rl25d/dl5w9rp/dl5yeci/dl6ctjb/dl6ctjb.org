  I'm not sure if it's "increase contempt" so much as "decrease awe and mystery."

What? Even at my most optimistic, I never assumed that the average personal acquaintance of mine was "awesome and mysterious". Rather, I assumed that such a person was approximately equivalent to /me/. (I am, not "awesome and mysterious", but rather "cool and open to questions".) However, I soon found myself forced to lower my expectations below even that seemingly-reasonable level.
