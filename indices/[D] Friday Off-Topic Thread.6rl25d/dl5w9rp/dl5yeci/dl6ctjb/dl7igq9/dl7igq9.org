I don't see my friends as figures of myth or legend. But, it's easy to see them as more competent and skilled than me.

The Facebook "highlight reel" effect makes it easy to get the impression that other people are happier and more confident than I am.

And mental bias makes it easy to think that other people are good at impossibly hard things, while I'm only good at easy stuff.

That shine wears off as I spend more time with people and see that they work basically the way I do.
