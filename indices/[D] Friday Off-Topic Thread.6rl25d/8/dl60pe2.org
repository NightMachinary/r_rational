I hurt my back two weeks ago. No permanent damage, but I've spent the majority of the last 14 days in bed. Which gets very boring indeed. But on the upside, I did finally get around to watching Fate Stay Night, Unlimited Blade Works and Fate Zero. I, um. I recommend them. Kind of a lot. They were really good. I also watched Akame ga Kill, A Certain Magical Index 1&2, and A Certain Scientific Railgun. These were all pretty good too, but Fate Stay Night wins, hands down. Now I'm playing through the visual novel because there is apparently a good third of the game that has not yet been adapted into anime.
