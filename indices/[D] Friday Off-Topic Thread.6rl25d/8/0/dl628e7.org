I heard the original Fate/Stay Night anime wasn't very good and Unlimited Blade Works left a lot out from the visual novel, but I've had Fate/Zero on my list for a while now since I heard it was the best Fate anime.

I watched the first episode of both Index and Railgun, but am only considering watching more of the latter. Index didn't make me want to see more of the characters, Railgun somehow did even though one of them is a serial molester.
