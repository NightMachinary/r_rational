Thanks, though I knew pretty much all of that already. When I consider delving into a new franchise, I tend to do a lot of research. It seems like the visual novel is the best way to experience the original story, but I don't think I'd enjoy the medium of a VN so I'm just going to check out Zero since I know it has a story and characters I would enjoy.
