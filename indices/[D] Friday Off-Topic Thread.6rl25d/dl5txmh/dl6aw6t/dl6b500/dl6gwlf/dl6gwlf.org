Well, not to tell you what to write, but Ra is about authority and legitimacy. The Emperor is /normality/. /Just/ when you, a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHoldersSeries][Seeker]] or something, think you've basically survived everything, /just/ when you know you've managed /not/ to fall into the orbit of any eldritch powers or egregores, /just/ when you think you're safe - /because/ you /are/ safe - the Emperor has you.
