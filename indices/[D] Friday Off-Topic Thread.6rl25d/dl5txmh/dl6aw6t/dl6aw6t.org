Actually, a request for [[/u/bambamramfan]]: could you do one of [[http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Emperor_of_Mankind][the Emperor]], the god of Humanity, of normality, causality, and banality, who Protects and yet unmakes, for to serve Him is to have your soul stripped away day by day as you shed everything irrational, unreal, and immaterial in you, becoming a being only of reason and service.
