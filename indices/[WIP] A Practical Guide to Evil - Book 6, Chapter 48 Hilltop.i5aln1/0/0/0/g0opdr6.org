  Consider the perspective of someone who lost their family to a murder learning that the punishment for the perpetrator is for them to receive psychological counselling so that they can understand how their crimes will damage their social standing and to then be given a position of power where they can enjoy socializing with friends while working in a field they love. Would anyone really accept this as an adequate punishment? Doesn't it make more sense to consider this as the criminal gaming the system to escape justice and even profit from their new position?
