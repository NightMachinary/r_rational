So it seems as if Cat's "long price" is making Akua realise that redemption is impossible to achieve, that she will never be a part of the Woe, and that no one will ever consider her a good person, yet deciding for herself to do good regardless of this anyway.

First teaching her what her life /could/ have been, how she could have a genuine group of friends around her and people admiring her, and then taking that away and showing that it was nothing but an illusion all along, /with Akua accepting this and still going through with it./

That's cruel, man.
