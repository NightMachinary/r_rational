Think of it in terms of electricity.

Akua was a master of keeping the resistance in a circuit low. When she absolutely couldn't keep resistance low, she found a way to recycle it back into useful work--like a heat pump, using waste energy to do additional work.

Masego intentionally introduced a resistive element into the circuit to make it more resilient to limit the overall current possible in a circuit--like the ballast in a fluorescent light.

I wonder if Akua could have partnered with one of the Named healers to do more than just vent the heat created by channeling along the cold iron; since the energy is there, it would be cool to see it repurposed as a burst of healing to offset the risk of needing to get in stabbing distance of the constructs.
