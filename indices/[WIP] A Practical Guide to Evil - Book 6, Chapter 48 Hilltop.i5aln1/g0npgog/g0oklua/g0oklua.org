I actually think that this would constitute far to mild a punishment and can actually be considered a tremndous victory for Akua. The type of psychological punishment that Akua is dealing with may bother her for a while but then like any human she will simply adapt and get on with her life. If anything it will leave her in a superior position as once Cat is convinced that she has adequately punished Akua any further interference from outside sources that seek to impose a more severe punishment or prevent Akua from working in a position of power will be opposed as an attempt to undermine the authority of the Black Queen.

Consider the perspective of someone who lost their family to a murder learning that the punishment for the perpetrator is for them to receive psychological counselling so that they can understand how their crimes will damage their social standing and to then be given a position of power where they can enjoy socializing with friends while working in a field they love. Would anyone really accept this as an adequate punishment? Doesn't it make more sense to consider this as the criminal gaming the system to escape justice and even profit from their new position?

I personally think that it is quite telling that a condemned social manipulator who had bragged that she would be capable of finding a way to avoid punishment and become a trusted subordinate has found herself in a situation where she has indeed become a trusted subordinate and the evidence demonstrating the severity of her punishment is entirely limited to assumptions on her mental state. It seems to me like Akua has simply succeeded in her manipulations and is now laughing victoriously in her mind as she marches down the path to a role as the trusted subordinate of the most powerful woman in Calernia with the only cost being the need to make the occasional display of inner turmoil. The exchange of potential emotional pain in exchange for essential immunity from further punishment and a position of tremendous power is a deal that Akua would have eagerly accepted ever since she lost to Cat.
