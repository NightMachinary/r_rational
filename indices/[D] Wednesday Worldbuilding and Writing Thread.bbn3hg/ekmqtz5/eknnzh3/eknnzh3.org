What is such dialogue typically trying to achieve? You don't necessarily need to transcribe the spoken dialogue fully (or at all), depending on your preferences. You already mentioned trying to get better at describing actions during dialogue too.

In general, I personally don't take issue with long conversations between characters if the conversation is engaging to read; that can, however, be a high bar.
