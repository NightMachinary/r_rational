This setting sounds like a lot of fun. (I've always had a thing for really big trees.)

I think you could also have a lot of fun with the alternate climates, rather than just saying that stuff doesn't grow out there as much. You could have huge underwater algae, for example, or deserts where cacti grow wild. Out in the cold... I don't really know, but you could always make up a fictitious plant that thrives in the snow or something.
