Still kind of churning my wheels on my "rampant plant growth" setting that I think I mentioned here a few weeks ago. I've decided on magical energy to facilitate fast and never-ending growth, combined with a wet environment, and facilitated by exposure to sunlight (as otherwise there would be plants that only subsist on the magic and the ecology would become too alien). Kudzu grows a foot a day, so that's the baseline, applied to bushes, trees, vines, and everything else, so quick that it's a legitimate threat to human civilization.

So, let's talk adaptations.

Adaptation 1:

The trees and vines are constantly growing, but rather than continually cutting them back, they can be braided, sculpted, and directed in order to make walls and barriers, effectively allowing the problem to become its own solution. This still takes time and effort, but can be done without much in the way of cutting implements. It represents people twisting nature to their own goals, men who are cultivators of the wilds.

Adaptation 2:

There are some places that trees and vines will naturally not grow, like large rock outcroppings, places that have exceptionally poor soil, high altitude, deep underground, sufficiently cold climates, or on the water. All of these represent fairly different civilizations, some of which aren't core to the setting itself (e.g. polar climate doesn't look /that/ much different). I do like some of this idea though, that there are people who have built up their own civilizations that are as far away from the plantlife as they can be while still able to have food to eat. It represents a fundamentally skeptical/cautious approach to nature that I think works as a nice counterpoint, men who are not "of the forest".

Adaptation 3:

Rather than sculpting or cutting the land, or going where the plants are not, it might be possible to simply go with the plants, allowing them to shape daily life. These people would be something like nomads, moving and situating themselves almost every day, carrying minimal and light shelters and little equipment. The most evocative of these would probably be people living in tree houses that are elevated with the natural growing to be out of reach of major predators and pests, but I can't actually find any historical examples of full civilizations using tree houses, and I'm not sure the peculiarities of the setting can actually justify them. These would be people that don't do much with nature, neither cultivators, battlers, shunners, or anything else. Limited room for advancement though, and presumably low-tech.
