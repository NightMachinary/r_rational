In regards to adaptation 2, a concept I find really interesting is ecological succession. There are types of plants called "pioneer species" that are the first to inhabit areas previously inhospitable to plants. They break down rocks into soil, add nutrients and create conditions favorable for other less hardy plants, and then are outcompeted by the newcomers who are able to utilize the better soil conditions. Add a little bit of magic and I imagine nowhere would be safe from these guys.
