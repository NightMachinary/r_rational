For instance some thing that we might expect to see is that:

1. Group of people who gather information about classes which the MC asks about classes before selecting their class. Possibly selling it or possibly hoarding it for personal advantage.
2. A toddler being allowed to get the last hit on a bound monster, being told to invest in intelligence, and now having adult-like intelligence. Thus allowing said toddler to start the level grind way before their peers.
3. Psychotic serial killers being very high level and protective personal(guards/police) finding solutions to handle such high level individuals without relying on adventurers, either with ethical or less ethical means. Possibly being rewarded with the honor of killing a caught criminal for the XP.
4. Ways of getting XP being sold on the market.
