  the dungeons have an MMORPG's ability to replenish their inhabitants boundlessly.

This does leave the question of how they're replenished, though. (Also, if people/humans aren't spawning they might evolve.) Do they come back (resurrection) or is it like cloning? (Can monsters have children?) Evolution doesn't strictly require sex, something like cloning would work as well. (With the caveats that 1) exact cloning might miss out on mutation, and 2) if you have the genetic materials, then you could bring back whatever you wanted, allowing for artificial selection, or just creating the same group over and over again. (Which could vary if your copying process wasn't perfect, and especially if you threw away the old stuff.))

Resurrection takes things in a different direction - what if monsters learn?
