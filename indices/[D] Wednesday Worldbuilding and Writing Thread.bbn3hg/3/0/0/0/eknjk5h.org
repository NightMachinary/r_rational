You know, I really wonder whether such a world wouldn't have devolved into a total destruction of life. If there's evolutionary pressure to kill more things then most things will end up killing more things than they need. Structured humans in particular would be seeking out easier ways of killing.

For reference the meat industry puts a lot of strain to our environment despite the average meat eater only eats 70 big animals(pigs and bigger) during their entire lifetime. You have to go really nuts if you need 10k kills of equal lvl.
