Cetacean, not cephalopod; dolphin-like, not squid-like. Cephalopod bodies would be much more interesting, but I didn't find any information about their neuron packing density, their brains are so different they don't fit the paper, and I don't think they have the kind of social structures, play, and methods of communication that some cetaceans are known to have.

I don't see the avians inventing powered flight; they're below-human skill at that kind of engineering, and it seems redundant for a bird. Eventually, maybe, but probably much later than first contact would be. Similarly, I don't expect they'd have popularized explosives, since primitive ones aren't very useful in air combat, especially if industrialized war isn't common. Flight might even mean they wouldn't invent advanced metalwork, since it's costly to carry heavy things.

Cetaceans would be a lot easier for first contact; maybe as simple as an adventurous avian setting sail, or a migrating cetacean coming close to a populated shore. The cetaceans would be smart enough to capitalize on the opportunity in full, even if the avians weren't.
