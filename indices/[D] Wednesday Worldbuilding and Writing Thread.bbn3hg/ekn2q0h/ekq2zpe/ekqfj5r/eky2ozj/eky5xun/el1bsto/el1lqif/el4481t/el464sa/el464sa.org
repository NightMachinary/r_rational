What are you envisioning these balloons to be made of and powered by?

Large, cheap, strong, and thin fabric sheets are hard to imagine without sowing machines, which are complex enough I'd say the avians wouldn't invent, and their lack of clothing culture (clothes are weight) would reduce the demand.

Coal seems to require a mining culture. So does oil. These seem much more likely to be popular in metalworking societies. Without ground transport most of the value of those resources goes away, too, and the avians aren't likely to have horses.
