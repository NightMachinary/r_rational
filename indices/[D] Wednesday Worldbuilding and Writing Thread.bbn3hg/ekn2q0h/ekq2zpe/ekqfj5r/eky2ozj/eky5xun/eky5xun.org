I'm not against cephalopods, they just seemed somewhat less plausible. Either is fine in the sense that you can write a story about it.

The avians are smart enough for flight aids, but evolution already made pretty effective birds so it's not clear how much improvement could be made by pre-industrial society. Farming feathers sounds practical, hot air balloons maybe not---in our world those were only invented in 1783, by a more educated mind than the avians are likely to have. A practical balloon needs a better heat source than a wood fire; we had floating lanterns long before we could fly in them. Their woodwork would be pretty good though, so I agree you would expect some technologies to be well ahead of the era.
