Whoops, not sure how I misread that.

Though, I might suggest using squids anyway. IMO smart whales are over done and (some) chepalopods are pretty darn smart. Plus I think divers recently found what's basically an octopuses wilderness fort. A bunch of octopi built a giant structure consisting of their individual dens out of debris in a largely open stretch of ocean bottom, presumably for some sort of mutual defence benefit since they're usually solitary creatures.

Anyway about artificial flight aids.

I'm talking about a whole range of technologies that would run the species equivalent gambit from shoes to cars. I honestly would not rate a species as sapient if they spend all their time flying and never consider that maybe they could rig up something they could wear to change their aerodynamics for the better. And they could start with something as simple as harvesting feathers from non-inteligent avians they hunt that have different wing shapes and tying them together finding out which shapes are helpful by trial and error (should be a stone age technology for them). I'd also expect them to figure out hot air balloons if they have fire and canvas/paper, since a flying species should consider being able to make things neutrally buoyant in air for easy towing super useful, especially if their solution to conflict is to move away.
