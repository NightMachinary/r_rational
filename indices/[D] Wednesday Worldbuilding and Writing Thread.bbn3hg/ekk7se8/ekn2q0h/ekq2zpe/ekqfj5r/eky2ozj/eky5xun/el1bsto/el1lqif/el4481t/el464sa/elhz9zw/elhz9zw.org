Paper and wood until demand for better balloons drives the invention of textiles after which canvas possibly silk. I'm not a textiles expert but I'm pretty sure you only need a loom and a spinning wheel to make textiles. Sewing machines are indesensible labor saving devices but their absence can be overcome with more labor or more time. Baloons being expensive isn't at odds with them being important.

For fuel, whatever is abundant of: charcoal, rubber, whale (possible conflict point) or otehr animal oil, tar, alcohol or vegetable oil. And again as the demand for better balloons drives their technology eventually coal and natural gas, or petrolium products mined specifically for building balloons.

Also I do think they'd develop clothing culture they'd just develop different clothing culture. Clothes are wight, but they're also useful. In particular it's a lot easier to put on an elaborate tail-dress when you go courting and take it off when you go hunting than it is to drag a peacock tail around with you all the time. Especially if they're using the flight aids I sugested which are practical sort of clothing, then the jump to decorative clothing that catches they eye of the otehr sex is a small one, and it doesn't take many genrations to start getting fashion trends as young people try to differentiate themselves form their peers and parents to get laid.
