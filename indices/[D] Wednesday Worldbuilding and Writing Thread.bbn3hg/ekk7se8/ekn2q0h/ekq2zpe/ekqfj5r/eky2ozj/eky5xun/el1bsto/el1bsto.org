The main advantage to flight aids would be that wing shapes are always a compromise among multiple competing advantages.

Evolution will have equipped the aviens with only one local maxima, useful in the environment they evolved. As they spread they'll find environments where otehr wing shapes would perform better (high cliffs with abundant thermals favoring wings optimized for soaring, vs flat open plane favoring wings optimized for generating lift by flapping, vs dense forrest favoring wings good for rapid maneuvering and diving, etc.) technology would allow them to adapt to these environments faster than evolution can. For a human equivalent see how in spite of having one of the better thermal management systems for the savanna of Africa we still invented clothes and came to rely on them as we migrated to otehr climates.

As to using human progress with aviation as a model for a flying species, I think that's fundamentally flawed. A flying species probably understands flight the way humans understand ballistics (having a rather good intuitive grasp of it even if they can't do the math, and probably not even realizing how complex the problem they solve every day actually is). So I'd look to out use of thrown/launched tools and compare based on similar construction methods to get a timeline for what a flying species does with flight technology.
