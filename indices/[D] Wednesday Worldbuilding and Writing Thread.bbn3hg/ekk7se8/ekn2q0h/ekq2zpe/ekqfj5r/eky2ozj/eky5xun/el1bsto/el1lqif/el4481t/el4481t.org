It really depends. the fact that they can fly without the machine really changes things, as it means simpler machines that do one thing become more viable.

Mostly I'm imagining wing-gloves that add some weight in exchange for a change to your wing/tail surface area/shape, but you only ware them when it's worth it, gliders that only get used in environments conducive to gliders, and rarely something like a rocket booster to assist with getting heavier loads (like a glider) off the ground or to (briefly) make up for the speed shot-fall against other flying creatures.

I do however think they'd get balloons working. They'd have a lot of motivation to do so as it's be their equivalent of a hand cart, and finding an adequate fuel source is more a matter of access to resources than anything else. They probably need some metalworking to get really good balloons working but it's probably closer to bronze age tech than industrial revolution tech if you have a real economic motivator for needing to lift more than an armload of stuff into the air.
