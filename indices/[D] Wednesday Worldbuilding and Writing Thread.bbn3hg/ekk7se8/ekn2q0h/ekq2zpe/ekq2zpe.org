I think war would be possible and it'd be a one sided affair dominated by the aviens, provided they have the technology to build prosthetic flight aids (think lift assist via balloons, wing extensions, possibly even booster engines) and depth charges. Depth charges are actually pretty simple, and I'd expect a flying species to have an easier time with the hard parts of flying machines than humans did. With those two technologies they can potentially strike any cephalopod community without the cehpalopods having much recourse. However since the aviens don't have the same concept of war we do, they might not think of it, but I'd expect the cephalopods will. So the aviens will likely be negotiating from a position of strength whether they realize it or not.

I'd also be curious whether it's an avien submarine, or a cephalopod super-lithos that is the vehicle for first contact. (ok I juts wanted to use that word) Who makes contact with whom could shape a lot of their initial relations however as it will affect what kind of initial mistakes get made and how widely knowledge of them spreads. The Cehpalopods would have a harder time repairing any insult they give against the aviens than vice versa due to speed and range of communication for example. And in both cases there are bariers to the visiting species immediately recognizing the home species as inteligent (the visitors have machinery capable of supporting them in a hostile environment which is a bit of a give away)
