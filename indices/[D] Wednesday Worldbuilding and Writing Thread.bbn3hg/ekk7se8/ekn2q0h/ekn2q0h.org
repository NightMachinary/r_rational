Here's a wack idea I've recently thought of. Background reading: [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4685590/]].

--------------

Two species (coincidentally) evolve at much the same time to civilization-spawning levels of intelligence. Humans don't exist here. One is a bird derivative, with a small but incredibly dense and fast brain, optimized by evolution for the low weight and fast reflexes needed by avians. The other is cetacean that had a successful runaway mutation that greatly increased brain size, selected for because intelligent behaviours allowed the animals to game their mating ritual and hunt elusive prey better, but did nothing to speed their naturally ponderous brain.

The result is a contradistinction between what might be termed the clever, and the wise.

The avians have simpler language than we do, and struggle with the highly abstract ideas we use to construct our maths and our machines, but their intuition and wit is unparalleled, and they use writing and tools to compensate for their weaknesses. Their society moves quickly, flight hastening the spread of innovation and producing a globally semihomogeneous culture, as the planet quickly fills with their cities.

It's unlikely that such a creature could build an iPhone, but they should be capable of much of our history's less complicated technology. Their ability to fly gives them a different conception of territory and war than we might be used to; governments cannot rule from atop when each member is so freely able to move where it wishes. Citizens cannot be forced into a king's army, walls cannot fortify against immigrants or attackers, ranged weapons are of little use to anyone. Decentralization is the name of the game.

The cetaceans, blessed by a fluke of biology, have minds that can hold books in their heads, reason through the most complex of arguments without a note, visualize contraptions in motion and whole. They speak slowly, with deliberation---they could not follow the rapid pace of the avians' tongues---but what they do say is packed deeply with meaning, nuance, and entropy. They live in groups, each with its own culture, each enclave knowing its own small subset of the many languages and dialects available across the sea.

Their environment and physique are hostile to the development of large structures or written records, so their societies remain small. For sure, they discover and industrialize farming, they clear the waters of their predators, they build caverns and safe havens, but for the most part their lives are rural and philosophical. Left much longer, alone, most likely they would evolve back to the norm, living in the remains of a haven they could never hope themselves to build.

I'm going to cut my own comments about this short since this is already pretty long, but the question is:

*What happens when these species meet?*

What would a story set in this world, overseeing this discovery, look like? They have so much to offer each other, and so much need for the help. Unlike most such early species interaction, these societies barely even compete, and a war would be incredibly difficult.
