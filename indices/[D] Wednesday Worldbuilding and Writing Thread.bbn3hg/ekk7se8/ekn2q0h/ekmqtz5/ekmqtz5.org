Sometimes I find myself writing long conversations between 2 people that are just paragraphs of alternating dialogue.

First of all, is this is a bad thing?

Second of all, how can I spice it up? I can interrupt with the POV's characters thoughts, but sometimes those thoughts are already just the things they say in conversation. I can write the other character's reactions and describe their body language, but I don't think I'm very good at describing body language. (Guess I should get better?)

I can set the scene somewhere interesting, which helps a bit, but after the introduction, there's not much else to say about it. I can have the characters doing some action and have the dialogue interrupted by descriptions of that action, but this often seems irrelevant to the conversation and adds extra noise. And sometimes, the characters are necessarily just in a boring meeting room anyway. (I actually did start one section with the POV character's feelings on meeting rooms, which worked surprisingly well, I think.)

Does anybody have any other advice?
