Imagine a world where Everyone has the same sense of humour.

Like, it's not that people /Generally/ find the same kind of thing funny, or usually agree whether a joke is good or bad. It's not some kind of cultural enforcement or mind control.

No, for completely natural reasons, Literally /Everyone/ has the same sense of humour, with visible deviations constituting maybe, say, a quarter of a percent of the population. Genetics, Nurture, and- as long as they understand the underlying context even vaguely- culture? They play no role. Thinking of a funny joke is like winning the lottery. And it makes you famous. Comedians are simultaneously revered for their universal appeal, and the hardest job in the world to succeed in. Oh, it used to be that you could be a good- on a local level- comedian just by being able to execute already well-known jokes which involve physical difficulties, but the rise of video put an end to that. Now being a Comedian requires a highly gifted mind and fast iteration time- or a large joke-research company backing you. It is whispered in dark corners of the world that the governments have all searched for their best jokes, and have them at the ready to distract enemy soldiers in wars.

Political parties still exist, for all an insult to either side amuses all members of the world. Advanced teams search for political jokes, which support their ideology. This is the best form of propaganda. Find a joke with inherent political implications, and fame and money are not your limit. you could lead a company- decide policy on the world scale, by releasing or refusing to do so.

[Vague story idea stub thing. is it good? bad? interesting? It probably wouldn't be easy to write a story about it- to be unique the jokes have to be centre stage, but I'm not sure what one would write about in such a case. But i thought it was an interesting idea, at least.]

[if this is the wrong thread, I apologize for doing so but I /Think/ it fits best here?]
