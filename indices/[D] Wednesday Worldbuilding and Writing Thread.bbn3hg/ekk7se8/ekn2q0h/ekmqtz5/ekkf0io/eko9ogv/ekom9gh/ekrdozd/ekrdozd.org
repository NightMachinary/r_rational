*Relativity*

Anyone up on their equations for relativistic acceleration?

Assuming that you have a craft of a constant 10,000 tons, and an engine that exerts a constant force of around 890 meganewtons (ie, a felt acceleration of 10 gravities), which equations do I use to find out how much objective time it takes to accelerate up to .9c, or .99c, or the like? (I'm pretty sure that it's more than just multiplying the subjective duration by the final speed's Lorentz factor, but I'm having trouble finding an intro to special relativity that doesn't shove the whole four-dimensional mess of calculus and matrices at the reader all at once.)

Edit: Nevermind, found what I need at [[http://www.desy.de/user/projects/Physics/Relativity/SR/rocket.html]]
