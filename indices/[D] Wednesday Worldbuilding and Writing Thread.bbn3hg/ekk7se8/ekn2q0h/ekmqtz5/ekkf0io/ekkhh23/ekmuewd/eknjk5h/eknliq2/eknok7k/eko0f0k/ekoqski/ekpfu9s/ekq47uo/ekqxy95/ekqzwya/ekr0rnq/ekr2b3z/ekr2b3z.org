â€˜Cheese' basically means a strategy that circumvents the intended difficulty of a challenge. This includes the original list.

  This probably means doing things as a slow, boring grind with one overleveled party member doing the brunt of the work while low level hangers on sit back and apply ineffective buffs, ineffective debuffs, etc. Fights are also probably as lopsided as possible, with as many cheesy strategies as possible, e.g. monster farms where kills can be accomplished with zero risk whatsoever, heavily fortified chokepoints constructed by extremely high level characters who won't be counted as killers, borrowed/rented equipment that trivializes things, etc. If not all level N monsters are created equal, only the weakest or most easily trivialized monsters of level N will ever be fought.
