I don't think you can assume genetics and evolution because the level system makes no sense as an evolutionary target, nor is there an obvious â€˜natural' magic that would seem to allow levelling to evolve sanely. It's easiest just to throw that whole framework away.

As to how monsters get replenished, I'd have just said they were spawned by ambient dungeon magic, because that's how games work.

  Resurrection takes things in a different direction - what if monsters learn?

Things get fucky if farmed monsters are human-tier smart even without respawns, and if they're not that smart it doesn't matter if they learn because they aren't smart enough to do anything about it.
