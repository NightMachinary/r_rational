Levels existing in games and levels existing in physics are only nominally similar things.

Humans being handed â€˜magic to make level systems' is a very different scenario, too, since you're positing an atomic magic that then would be implemented by intelligent minds, not evolution. Even if there is such a level system magic, /and/ it was something that evolution could find, /and/ it was well-specified and atomic (so evolution would optimize for it, rather than the underlying system), it would result in something completely different to humans.
