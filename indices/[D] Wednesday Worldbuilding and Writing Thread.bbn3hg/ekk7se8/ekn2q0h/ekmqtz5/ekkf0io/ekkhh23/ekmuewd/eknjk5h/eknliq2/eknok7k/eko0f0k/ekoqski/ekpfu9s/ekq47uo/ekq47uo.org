The level systems we have in the real world evolved naturally.

Humans are a product of evolution, so in the same way a spider's web 'evolved' so do our games. Additionally wargames exist in a competitive environment with selective pressure driving their changes over time, and war games produced role playing games (speciation event) which is where these level systems used as a model for gamelit come from. Then adapting roleplaying games to computers got us MMOs (another speciation event), which were successful enough to be noticed by business and that brought gamification as motivation for actions in real life, and now China has a Social credit "level system" applying points gained from actions to an overall score affecting the real world.

If the magic to make level systems real existed we'd probably be a handful of decades away from a gmelit world ourselves right now assuming the magic din't derail our enter history (which admittedly it totally would have).
