I find this funny because in Latias' Journey by Ri2 (not rational but a still pretty good fanfic which I grew up reading as a teenager), one of the villains was Mewgle, who was an AI that looked kind of like a cross between Moogle and a demonic clown version of Mew. And Mewgle's goal was to trap all the other villains and heroes, including the Big Bad and the Big Good, in an mmorpg world of his own creation.

I will also note that game mechanics and stats are meant to be simpler easier to understand and track versions of real world phenomenon. And when something is simpler, easier to understand and easier to track, it's also easier to control. Perhaps a *sufficiently* power hungry authoritarian government *would* turn literally every part of life under their rule into something like an rpg. Maybe the only reasons this hasn't happened yet is because we haven't had any authoritarian rulers with sufficient power and power-hungriness to do so.
