Thanks for the detailed responds. Those are great thoughts.

There's no hard cap but per the rules but you would have to kill some number of equal level opponent(or the equivalent) which given that (A) the level curve will heavily skewed towards the lower levels[unless people really go to town with the monsters] and (B) that's a ton of beings to kill, I would expect there to be a soft cap. Perhaps a sufficiently high lvl dictator would train people up to her lvl[by having them kill people in a way that maximizes XP gain] to kill them for XP but that carries it's own risk[ and could make for it's own story].

Edit: Assuming no way of increasing longevity this soft cap would turn into a quasi hard cap. The few high level people would be busy building legacy and avoiding being killed by the other high level people, and thus would lack the time to continue the grind.

In a way that could potentially decentivize people from leveling since they would then be worth less XP and thus the grinders are less likely to go after them.

You mentioned the degenerate in your other post as well. What do you see as the degenerate conclusion?
