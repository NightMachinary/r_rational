Depending on how long buffs last, you might have career adventurers auctioning off the right to cast buffs on them before they leave town and go adventuring, to get a share of the XP. That could even evolve into a form of prediction market that predicts how successful their quest will be.

Since the XP doesn't depend on the danger, I'd expect to see adventurers seek out as many options to trivialise encounters as possible. For example, standard practice might include smoking out or flooding dungeons and to never engage melee-only enemies up close if at all possible. Perhaps this would lead to more specialisation in terms of roles, for example archers who refuses to take jobs where the enemies can used ranged attacks or fly, or tanks who only fight enemies who they're certain can't get through their defences. With that in mind, the most important role might shift towards scouting out the enemy, to ensure that the appropriate specialists are sent to the right locations.
