I really love this idea. My first thought when I started reading was "that's the kind of ecosystem that would support some awesomely huge creatures". As in, the size of dinosaurs and up. Especially if the magical energy that promotes life made it's way up the food chain. But even if it didn't, you have enough calories to support massive herbivores living in fairly close proximity. And with massive herbivores comes massive carnivores...

My second thought was thinking of the logistics of this ecosystem. You have these extremely dynamic plants that are going to be competing with each other for water, sun and soil. How dependent are they on these things, above and beyond the magical energy? Are you going to have a dense jungle of impassible plants, stacked dozens of meters deep, like a borg cube of plants, extending over the horizon? Would the plants die or go back to normal without the magic?

An interesting way to introduce tension to the setting would be if the magical energy would vary from place to place, so that there would hotspots of plant activity that would shift and threaten cities and nations. There could be massive advantages to being near such a spot(abundant food and resources, maybe even magical resources?), but also big potential threat if the zone expands or shifts, as well as the 'commonplace' natural hazards (eg. huge herbivore migrations, predators hunting outside the zone, plants having to be constantly contained).
