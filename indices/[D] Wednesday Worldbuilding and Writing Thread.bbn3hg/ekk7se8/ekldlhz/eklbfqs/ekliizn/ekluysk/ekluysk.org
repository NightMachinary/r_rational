I'm not sure how much I'm going to develop it as a setting, but I kind of want to get at least six or seven different biomes down, which will take inspiration from various Earth biomes or plants. It's possible that a sea biome or desert biome might make it into there, but I'm still kind of doing the broad sketches. Oceans, lakes, and seas are a whole different story, with seaweed rafts, floating islands of biomass, and stuff like that, but the setting isn't (yet) /for/ anything, so it's kind of hard to say whether or not they'll get an entry in the worldbuilding doc I'm writing. Regardless, there /are/ places that are inhospitable to plant life, though given the extra boost that plants are getting, there are far fewer places like that than on Earth.

(One of the things I definitely do want is a look at something like mangroves, but I don't think that fast growth actually aids in sediment accumulation, which is how mangroves make new land.)
