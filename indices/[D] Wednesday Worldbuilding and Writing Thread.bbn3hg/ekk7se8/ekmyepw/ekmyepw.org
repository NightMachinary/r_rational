How about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil%27s_garden][Devil's gardens]], clearings in the forest produced by ants that some plant species have "domesticated"?

#+begin_quote
  The ant Myrmelachista schumanni creates devil's gardens by systematically poisoning all plants in the vicinity except D. hirsuta, the tree in which it nests. The ant poisons the plants by injecting formic acid into the base of the leaf. By killing other plants, the ant promotes the growth and reproduction of D. hirsuta, which has hollow stems that provide nest sites for the ants; a single ant colony might have more than 3 million workers and 15,000 queens, and may persist for more than 800 years.[3] Although the ants fend off herbivores, the size of the garden is restricted by leaf destruction increasing as it expands, as the ants are unable to defend the trees beyond a certain point.[4][5]

Course you might need to improve the ants a little for your setting. . . .
