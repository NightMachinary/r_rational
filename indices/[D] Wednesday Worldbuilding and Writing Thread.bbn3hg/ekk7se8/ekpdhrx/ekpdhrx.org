If the magic force feeding the plants has some kind of base-level intelligence behind it, this setting sounds a lot like Pandora, from Avatar. You could even have plotlines where fighting the plants too hard results in the plants fighting back, either through overwelming growth or by developing spines, poison, noxious fumes, etc. Tons of ways you could go with a setting like this one.
