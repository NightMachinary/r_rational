Assuming that permadeath applies, the biggest factor is probably risk minimization. That is to say, people will be optimizing for the fastest *safe* way to level. This probably means doing things as a slow, boring grind with one overleveled party member doing the brunt of the work while low level hangers on sit back and apply ineffective buffs, ineffective debuffs, etc. Fights are also probably as lopsided as possible, with as many cheesy strategies as possible, e.g. monster farms where kills can be accomplished with zero risk whatsoever, heavily fortified chokepoints constructed by extremely high level characters who won't be counted as killers, borrowed/rented equipment that trivializes things, etc. If not all level N monsters are created equal, only the weakest or most easily trivialized monsters of level N will ever be fought.

(What you /don't/ get, unless there's a ton of work put into it, is people actually fighting for their lives in a dungeon.)

On a social level, you probably have a world that's dominated by a few people with a really high level, unless there's a level cap or level scaling is skewed such that reaching level N is effectively impossible for anyone (which doesn't appear to be the case per the rules). Depending on the specifics of leveling and the powers of the classes, you would expect either authoritarian rulers who each have dominion over some area and authoritarian underlings to manage smaller territorial units, or a grand unified empire controlled by the powerful with controls in place to prevent/screen people from ascending to their level.

Some classes are likely to be better than others for mundane use, and those are likely to be the most popular ones, but it depends on the specifics of which class can do what, how long buffs last, etc., all of which would need some definition (and probably iterative development, if you wanted to make a non-degenerate setting, or an interesting degenerate one).
