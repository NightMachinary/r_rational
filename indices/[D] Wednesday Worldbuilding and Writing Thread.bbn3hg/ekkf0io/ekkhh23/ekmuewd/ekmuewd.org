If the cheese is good (and it probably will be), you might not find so skew a distribution of levels. Early levels will be easy because infrastructure can cope with low level monsters, so people will be killing well above their skill level and powering through the rankings.

The trope is normally that higher level monsters are less rote, more prone to unexpected variability, and much harder to contain, which combined with the sparsity of even-higher-level people means a lot more effort is needed to tackle those areas safely.

This only happens when there's moderate superlinearity, eg. n^{k} rather than k^{n}, since exponentials have a tendency to explode. If the industrial course gets you to level 100 (from, say, ~1k kills) in a standard education, high level â€˜hero' types might only get to 300 in their lifetime from a full ~10k solokills, each requiring significant planning to do safely, and probably more since solokills are unsafe. x^{3} scaling would only make such people a factor 30 stronger than than the standard individual, for significantly more than 30x the investment.

The most value these elites would have would then probably just be power-levelling a bunch of people to level 200, and the cycle repeats again until the average person ends up leaving the system not because it's not able to power level them up, but simply that the reward isn't worth the time investment. The highest level characters are mostly determined by how long they've been grinding the ladder, and which of them are rich enough not to need to spend their time supervising people climbing the ladder below them.
