  It's easiest just to throw that whole framework away.
#+end_quote

Easier, but reasonable?

#+begin_quote
  the level system makes no sense as an evolutionary target,
#+end_quote

It (genetics) affects, say, your starting base stats. (Provided that humans are still the result of sex, and not spawning, or being brought from another world. Selection still tells you a bit about old people (unless it's hell, with an ever increasing deluge of immigrants.) - "There are old pilots. There are bold pilots. But there are no old, bold pilots." This goes up if there's immortality.)

#+begin_quote
  just said they were spawned
#+end_quote

Spawned how? When the dungeon is cleared, then after one hour, x number of (brand new) goblins will reappear in the same/random places, y slimes, etc.?

#+begin_quote
  if they're not that smart it doesn't matter if they learn because they aren't smart enough to do anything about it.
#+end_quote

Imagine Groundhog Day. They don't have to be /very/ smart. But they're learning from death. If they don't get it the first time, or the second, they will still be there the hundredth time. Knowing how to make fire isn't necessary to learn that sticking your hand into it hurts.
