I feel like this must be done before but how would you expect a litrpg setting to be different than a normal fantasy setting? I'll provide a ruleset here to have a world build by but if you have comments or thoughts that would apply to a different framework feel free to share those too.

1. People have classes and can only gain experience by killing enemies and by completing dungeons. Experience received depends on both the level of the killer(s) and the relative level difference but not on on the relative danger. People do not gain experience by training or doing classes related stuff unless it's killing or dungeon crawling.
2. Experience is split between those who were involved in the kill. The effort involved in killing the monster does not matter but there's a minimum threshold of doing at least one point of damage, one debuff or giving one buff to someone who does one point of damage. If multiple people of different levels participate in the kill, the lowest level members gains the least experience. This difference increases as the level gap increases such that when there is a large level gap the lowest level member gains basicly nothing.
3. It takes roughly 30 solokills of equal level to achieve next level. The power of classes scales superlinearly with class level.\\
4. Optional: Assume that ability scores and skills can be trained independently of class level but that it takes X weeks to raise a stat/skill from X-1 to X, i.e. it takes 3 weeks to raise a skill from lvl 2 to lvl 3.
