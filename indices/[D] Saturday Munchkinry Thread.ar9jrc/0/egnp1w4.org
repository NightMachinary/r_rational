Super power contagion, social graph version: The original super was a timeline jumper that entered our timeline from ElseWhere, and promptly got a job as a caretaker at a hospice. Over the next year the original nine supers - Frequently called the "Gray wave" or the "Rejuv 9" came about. He explained matters to them, and seven of them took up the same mission.

The way it works is, that for every Empowered Person who knows you (loosely defined, but you cannot "know" a thousand people. You got to know something about who they are. The biblical sense, however, always works, as long as it was consensual, even if they do not recall your name. Yes. There are people who try to exploit that. ), if something happens to you that is fatal, you get a one in 127 chance of instead getting a super power that prevents that death.

This is a /separate/ roll of the dice for each person who knows you, so you can, if sufficiently lucky, get more than one power, but you also cannot make yourself deathproof by befriending 127 powered people.

Patient Zero spent a lot of time talking to people about to die, mostly from old age - and eventually some of them triggered, generally with healing or regenerative powers that reversed that condition.

Most powered people are still both from, and at least 50% employed at, hospices, with some kind of self-healing power.

The second largest group are the drowning-proof, which is a crack-pot military scheme where you stand in front of a auditorium and tell your life story for 2-4 hours, and then they drown you under medical supervision, lying highly discouraged.

The power you get is generally somewhat stingy - The strongest powered are generally the hospice sourced, because fixing "is 98, and about to die from a laundry list of illnesses" generally requires an outright healing factor, while the drowning program usually just gets you super hemogoblin or the ability to manifest gills.

Now. What is the most mad-cap abuse of this you can think of?
