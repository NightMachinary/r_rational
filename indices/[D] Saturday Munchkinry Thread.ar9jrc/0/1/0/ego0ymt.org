Because you can fairly reliably bring back a drowning vic if you do the whole thing in a controlled setting.

Having ways out of the drowning other than the obvious is a neat exploit, and would definately trigger something interesting in the cases where the subject "rolls" multiple successes. - You cant trigger the same power more than once, so a drownee with a hundred witnesses who triggered 5 times might get gills, the ability to phase through materials (Once/day) , a gremlin-touch ability to make machinery break (once/week), the ability to enter suspended animation, and the ability to hold their breath for two hours.

You cant do the drowning bit twice though, or at least, not on a success - The second time your life is just not in danger, and experiment indicates you also only ever get one roll from each witness. - Trying a second death method right after the drowning /always/ fails.
