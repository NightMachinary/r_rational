I don't think it's impractical to get together a group of current immortals and immortal wannabes for a rapidly rotating orgy until everyone "knows" everyone else? And once you get a small group going the gains should be exponential since you can bring more in and others have more incentive to join. People who have benefited but don't want to continue chip in to maintain the group for everyone else. If you could prove something gave people powers or death resistance people would put up with a lot to get that. People don't hesitate to go through chemo for "only" a chance at "only" a decade of life for comparison, and most do it for years.

A minimally invasive way would just require 5-10 minute meet ups throughout the day, which seems reasonable in the pursuit of powers and immortality. 3 a day gives you close to 2 1% risk of deaths a year for half an hour a day, a better return than exercise and you'd get your daily exercise on top of that!

Edit: if people are 100% into it you only need to be immune to: starvation, dehydration, exhaustion, lack of sleep, cardiac muscle buildup, and friction to be at a point where you don't need to live a life outside the "Grinder". Once you have those your ever increasing known numbers should outrun deaths from more specific things as they crop up.

Also The Great Grinder would be a fantastic name for this faction/place!
