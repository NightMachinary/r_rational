*Mistborn Munchkinry Miniseries Part 10: Duralumin and Nicrosil*

Ok, week ten of the mistborn munchkinry miniseries, for a general overview of the magic system, see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9zz4sa/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ead595h/][part one]]. I strongly recommend reading the first part of that comment if you weren't here for the past weeks and aren't familiar with the mistborn setting. Parts 2 through 9 can be found here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a23pe3/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eauwn90/][2]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a4be9x/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ebcx4eg/][3]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a6ftyl/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ebuo08h/][4]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a8lgsu/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ecbqhr8/][5]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/af85cz/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/edw9q7a/][6]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ahmsgc/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eefzs0m/][7]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ak1kjr/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ef0o7jj/][8]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ametuf/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eflf195/][9]].

/Spoiler note/: I will avoid things that I consider excessive spoilers, but the exact workings of the magic system are moderate spoilers themselves, so if you intend to read the books and are sensitive to spoilers you should probably skip this one.

This week we have the second pair of enhancement metal, duralumin and nicrosil. As always we're interested in what a duralumin or nicrosil twinborn compounder can do, both here on earth (where they are the only one with this powerset) and in Era 2 Scadrial. Duralumin and nicrosil are again metals where the allomantic half is not particularly useful on its own, so for those metals you'll be stuck with the feruchemic half (plus compounding) on earth.

*Allomancy*

Allomantically, duralumin and nicrosil are paired in the same way as aluminium and chromium. Both make an allomancer burn their entire supply of metals in one massive burst, but duralumin affects the allomancer themselves and nicrosil affects anyone else the allomancer is touching.

In both cases, the effect depletes any metal reserves the targeted allomancer is currently burning and in exchange massively amplifies the effects of that metal for a very brief amount of time. What this does precisely differs slightly depending on the metal being burned:

- Iron/Steel: Very briefly apply a ridiculous amount of force between the allomancer and a metal object. This can easily result in the allomancer getting crushed by their own power if they don't have access to some kind supernatural durability (eg. burning or tapping pewter). Duralumin/nicrosil enhanced pushes/pulls are also able to affect metals that are partially inside a person (though only metals in their metalic forms, you still can't pull all the iron out of someones blood).

- Tin: The allomancer's senses all become massively more sensitive, causing an immediate, crippling headache as the allomancer is overwhelmed by the influx of sensory information.

- Pewter: The allomancer briefly becomes unbelievably strong and near invulnerable, capable of crushing a persons head with a headbut without so much as getting a scratch themselves.

- Bronze: Duralumin or nicrosil allow a bronze allomancer to pierce copperclouds and detect allomancy over a much larger area than normal, though only in very short bursts.

- Copper: Duralumin/nicrosil enhanced copper allomancy can very briefly create a near impenetrable coppercloud and shield the allomancer from duralumin/nicrosil enhanced mental allomancy.

- Brass/zinc: Create a very brief, but massive change in the target emotions (eg. make the target feel a short burst of uncontrollable panic). Duralumin and nicrosil allow soothing/rioting to affect even an allomancer burning copper. In addition, duralumin/nicrosil enhanced soothing or rioting a person with a sufficiently damaged spiritweb allows the allomancer to take direct control of the targets body. This effect lasts even after the allomancer stops soothing/rioting the target. Allomancy and feruchemy don't provide a direct way to damage a persons spiritweb (though other magic systems do), but we know emotional trauma and/or certain mental illnesses can also cause your spiritweb to crack. Such cracks are typically too small for allomancy to sneak through, but it is not inconceivable that an extraordenarily horrifying experience can break a person to the extend that the allomaner could take control.

*Feruchemy: Duralumin*

Feruchemically, duralumin stores spiritual Connection. Storing Connection makes the feruchemist become less noticible in a crowd and makes it harder both for them to relate to other people and for other people to relate to them. It becomes harder to pick up on social cues and interpreting the intent behind what a person is saying (eg. getting when someone is making a joke and when they are sincere) and similarly other people will have trouble understanding the feruchemist.

Tapping Connection does the opposite, making the feruchemist more relatable and making it easier for them to interact with other people. It is theoretically possible, but very hard, to store or tap Connection to specific people.

Tapping sufficient Connection also creates a conduit between the feruchemist and the cognitive realm in the area around them, which has the peculiar side effect of letting them speak and understand any language that is commonly spoken in this area.

*Feruchemy: Nicrosil*

Nicrosil feruchemy allows you to store (Innate) Investiture. Investiture is the power of the gods that diffuses into the world, it is what powers all the magic systems and most importantly for us, it's what makes someone an allomancer or a feruchemist.

Nicrosil feruchemists are able to store their feruchemic and allomantic abilities in Nicrosil minds. While storing, they become worse at using the magic system in question, burning metals generates less of an effect and they become less efficient at feruchemically storing and tapping attributes. Then when tapping the resulting metalmind, they become better at using those powers.

For a Nicrosil compounder, this means they can store their allomantic nicrosil ability for a time (during which they wouldn't be able to use their powers) and then tap the created nicrosilmind while burning nicrosil to create an even greater than normal burst of power in any allomancer they touch.
