And with that we're done with the enhancement metals! Next week we get back to some more clearly defined powers when we dive into the temporal metals.

I had a whole bit about unsealed nicrosilminds in here originally, but we don't really have any idea on how those work and the speculated explanation was getting crazy long so I decided to leave it out. Sorry for anyone with plans to start mass producing Bands of Mourning.

Using duralumin enhanced allomancy to take control of people not affected by hemalurgy is speculation. We know the mechanism is based on damage to the spiritweb and from Ruin and Kelsier talking to people suffering from mundane mental trauma (as well as the whole system of the Nahel bond) we know you don't need magic to damage a spiritweb, so I don't think it's much of a stretch.

It might also be worth noting that everything in the Feruchemy: Duralumin section is just side effects of having a lot/very little Connection, the actual use of the power is likely something completely different.
