My statistics is failing me, check my math please: 1/127 odds of life per power knowing you 126/127 odds of death Total chance of death = (126/127)^{powered} know #?

This doesn't seem right since by this you need 583 powered to know you to get your risk of death per death to <1%?

"The biblical sense" seems the only way to achieve this, with a loose definition allowing thousands per day (meaning you can do this until there's no more new powereds since you should outodds deaths as they occur). You could use this along with extensive registry to get the world's entire population to non-superpowered pretty quickly if everyone was willing. I'll try the math for the world population if someone can fix my math or point me in the right direction.
