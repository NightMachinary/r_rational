Oho, a probability oracle! Find an even faster way of killing a pleb, such as hooking up electrodes to his brain that shock him with high voltage if a computer says so. Let the probability treshold be 99% and assume sufficient deduction powers. Let us have the hash of a password for which we want the password. Generate a random number. If it's at most 0.01, try a random password starting with the bit 0. If it works, kill him. If the random number was larger than 0.01, kill him. If the observer deduces that he has a >99% chance of death and saves him, the password starts with 0. Repeat, churning through one pleb per bit.

This trick is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PP_(complexity)#PP_compared_to_other_complexity_classes][better than P = NP]], if you can read computer science. Who needs quantum computers, anyway?
