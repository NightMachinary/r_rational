Depending on the definition of death, things like heroin ODs and electrocution are also highly reversible triggers. Making someone immune to electrocution through some random means seems more helpful than making them immune to drowning. There's also Commotio Cordis, where hitting the chest at exactly the right angle at exactly the right 1/100th of a second during its cycle stops the heart. You might just get a power which fixes the defect and not notice, you might get something more esoteric.

The Empowered community should eventually all become immortal. If they all make a point of knowing eachother (an annual orgy is, hilariously, possibly the most efficient means), the community will eventually be large enough that everyone gets thousands of rolls per death, and each new person added to the community will also be able to add their own family members to the network with relative ease.

HIV might become a blessing rather than a curse. AIDS kills you a bunch of ways at once due to a wasted body, exotic cancers, and generic diseases becoming lethal, so becoming immune to all of that at once would be akin to a hospice death which also makes you immune to most or every infectious disease. This would also contribute to the annual empowered orgy.

1/127 non-still infants with Trisomy 13 born to Empowered mothers would trigger with something which prevents them from dying to Trisomy 13. This is utterly terrifying, and might be world-ending if the power is something like perfect instinctual biokinesis. Other similarly lethal birth defects would also run this risk.

Eventually, and assuming a particularly dangerous infant isn't born, a system might be set up where cells of several hundred empowered invite new people in, power them up, and then send those people off to new cells. This would maximize the number of new rolls people get per death, allowing the creation of absurdly powerful individuals with potentially dozens of powers. Someone will eventually get the time travel power and close the stable time loop with this scheme, and the world would become a patchwork of empowered villages. Iterate to Singularity. We're even protected from the usual worries about AI and paperclippers in this scenario, as the AI would have to dodge every seer, kill every brute, and trick every thinker, and then plan around the dozens of powers each person they try to kill could get at the moment of death. If a GRB ever hit Earth, most people would develop some form of radiation immunity, assuming they didn't have it already. Sun-diving would become a fun activity for the family as long as you have several thousand unused death rolls in reserve, and I don't even want to think about the powers you could get from that.

Congratulations, you just turned the entire world into discount Crawlers who might become even more powerful than Crawler.
