I was reading *The City and the Dungeon*, which is a decent but not amazing litrpg.

The economy is a mess though and makes me wonder how easily it could be destroyed.

The basic gist is that there's a city with a massive magical dungeon and people can choose to convert themselves into beings that can enter the dungeon and grow in power.

The trade-off is that in order to survive, they must eat one red crystal a day. The dungeon has 100 levels and gets exponentially harder as you go down and adventurers can find different types of crystals (blue, yellow, orange, green, etc). Tiers follow a similar progression, with blue adventurers needing a blue crystal.

Where it gets weird is the conversion rate.

1 green crystal = 1000 yellow crystals = 1 million orange crystals = 1 billion red crystals. A blue crystal is "worth" a trillion red crystals.

Obviously absurd, but what could you do if you had regular access to high level crystals? In the book, one example is a high level adventurer buying up all the shirts in the city.
