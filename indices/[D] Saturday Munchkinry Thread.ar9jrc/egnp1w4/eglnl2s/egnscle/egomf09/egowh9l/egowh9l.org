I haven't read the story so I might be completely off: My first thought was: "Good god why would someone choose to do conversions that way?" Immediately followed by: "Damn, I use a system that has a 1:1760:5280:63360 conversion path."

Just to double check I understand this right: each step along the ROYGBIV order is a thousand times more valuable? (Theorizing that there are indigo and violet?)

You could crash the economies of lower tiers I guess, but generally adventurers would be creating different economies for each level since they basically only care about the color they need. The only munchkin use of high tier excess is to influence other high tiers that are struggling to get their daily. Anyone further up the tier that has excess high tier can immediately flood the market below them, but then people should just promote up eating up the excess.

Munchkin: fund huge numbers of lower tiers to get them to your level to help you?

Not munchkin but theorizing: In spite of the 1/1000 conversion ratio there might be some crazy power point where it's easier to force taxes on lower power adventurers than it is to get them yourself? If what you say is correct this is the end game: the dungeon gets exponentially harder so tiers must be exponentially stronger to keep going up. The cost per tier only grows multiplicativly so your power grows faster than the lower levels cheapen to you. If people have powers that lend themselves to subjugating the first one to reach a new tier can become a tyrant and live off taxes. If the dungeon gets too hard some form of this would become a necessity
