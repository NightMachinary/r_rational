Somewhere there's a story about a time traveler who has wired his kidneys so that he pees pure meth, and then jumps back in time to an era where meth is likely to be easily sold for large amounts of money. He missed the timing, though, and ends up just after meth is legalized for mass consumption, and there's no market for black-market urine meth.
