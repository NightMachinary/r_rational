So if you want to kill someone in this setting, subject them to a weak lethal attack, then an overwhelming one.

Does your trigger chance per witness scale with the number of powers the witness has?

Does the roll depend on the recipient's belief that he is about to die, or the fact? If the first, the asleep are helpless. If the second, we could try looking into the future: Get a bunch of empowered observers to know each of another bunch of plebs. On command, kill the plebs with extreme prejudice unless they just showed signs of gaining some power. Whenever a pleb shows signs of gaining some power, immediately send the previous command. When we would have reason to give the command, the hope is that we got a signal about that in the past. And then we could use that to launch our nukes 30 seconds before the Sovjets or something.
