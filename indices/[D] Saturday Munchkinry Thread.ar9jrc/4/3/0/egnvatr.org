One day while you are out partying the Janitor, whom you've ignored your entire life for being "beneath you" flips up the glass case covering your ominous red button. Right before he presses it he stops and smiles to himself for a moment. what kind of evil dictator would install a defeat me button? He closes the lid, finishes cleaning your office and leaves. He knows you arent actually that bad of a person, after all you did bring peace on earth.
