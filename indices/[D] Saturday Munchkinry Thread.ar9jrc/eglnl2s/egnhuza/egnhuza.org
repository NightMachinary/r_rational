I'm not entirely sure what "better at using those powers" means. They'd still be limited by how much they stored, right? If it let you get 1.1x as much as you stored, then that seems like it would break the world quickly - compounders can do positive feedback loops for their metals and break stuff, but you've mentioned a few times that they're very rare. Necrosil sounds like it would let /anyone they touch/ do a positive feedback loop.

Supercharged Brass/Zinc sounds very exploitable, especially since you mentioned it stays after they stop rioting/soothing. Is there any other upkeep cost? An amoral king could just horribly torture people to harm their spirit web and build a thrall army
