They specifically said the only dementor they have left in Britain is the one at the ministry, chances of someone lending dementors is zilch for two reasons: one, no one wants to write controversial stuff about other magical governments, and two, no one wants to spend dementors to somewhere they will just die.

Also considering the only reasonable way to keep dementors under control is to feed them then I can only imagine taht Harry would have researched dementors and be planning on wiping out non-British dementor prisons too.
