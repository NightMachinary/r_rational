I think the biggest difference is the author's failure to emulate distinct character voices and word choice from HPMOR. The most outstanding failures so far have been Dumbledore and Quirrell, but there have been a lot of instances throughout. Dumbledore and Quirrell have previously spoken with a certain sophistication and formality throughout that the author does not really manage to credibly imitate when not lifting dialogue whole from HPMOR.

I mean, look at all of 10 (90), Updating Beliefs Part 2. Examples of phrases I would not expect to see from Quirrell (not nearly complete, just a few 'highlights')

"And worse than that, you showed to the world that you're just a pathetic little kid, and Malfoy lost his fear of you."

"Merlin damn it, boy!"

"Are you suspecting me?"

Examples I wouldn't expect from Dumbledore from Ch. 11:

"You made a big mistake there, Harry,"

"And while we have exceedingly little data as to what a botched Killing Curse might do,"

etc.

It really felt like HPMOR had a number of different speakers in it's dialogue - I suppose Yudkowsky focused on their different ways of speaking and word choice and levels of formality and sentence structure a lot and made each major character a distinct individual. Following the Phoenix, though it tries, doesn't really capture the voices nearly as well.
