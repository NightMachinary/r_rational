This story continues to be just awesome. I really feel as if it's at least the equal in characterization, plot and general application of rationality to HPMOR itself -- if Eliezer had posted these chapters rather than the ones he did post, I don't think I would have been able to notice any drop in quality or even realized that a different author was writing these ones...
