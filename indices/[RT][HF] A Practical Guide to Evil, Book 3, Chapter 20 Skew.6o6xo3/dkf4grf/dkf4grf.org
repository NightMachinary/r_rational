Brief recap - the Named Cat has on her "side" are:

- Adjutant
- Apprentice
- Archer (?)
- Thief (?)

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/68y7nw/rt_hf_a_practical_guide_to_evil_book_3_chapter_8/dh2lpeo/][Prospective Names (per previous speculation):]]

- Robber
- Ratface

Going to throw in Kilian for discussion. I'm including her because the "last big talk with Love Interest before battle" is such a standard narrative scene that I expect Kilian to resurface at some point.

Edit: Cat's speech to Thief is a remarkable throwback to her speech to herself.

Book 3 Chapter 20: Skew

  “Gods Below, am I tired of hearing about fault,” I shouted. “Fault and blame and Good -- none of it fixes any of this. If you want a solution, you deal with realities. With what exists, not the pretty little world that ‘should be'. Praes would have acted in its interest, and that meant torching the country. Procer would have acted in its interests, which was making us a protectorate. Anyone who plans without acknowledging that isn't planning, they're lying to themselves. That's what I can't stand about the lot of you. Do you think doing the right thing is enough? Fuck you. I've had to bloody my hands to get this far, Thief. I didn't enjoy it, and some of the things I've done will haunt me to my grave. But the only clean victories are the ones in stories. Preach all you want, I have gotten things done.”

I'm going to change things -- maybe not all of them, but enough. And if that means getting my hands dirty, I can live with that. I don't have to be a good person to make a better world.”]]
