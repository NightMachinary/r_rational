  Assasin likely isn't a great combatant (He generally is only described killing non combatants or ambushing combatants with poisons), especially when the other named is standing right in front of his face.

Correct my memory, but have we seen Thief fight other Named? I remember her fighting Hakram but that was before he came into his Name (and it cost him his hand, but not his life). So that sorta makes it even more likely she shares similarities to Assassin - she stays out of fair fights and/or might not be that strong.

Or another possibility: if Thief was actually Assassin and she could feel Hakram coming into a Name or knew of his importance, so she didn't want him to die and thus didn't go all out. Regular people don't go against any Named, even less offensive-oriented ones, and live very often. But she had to take a hand to make it look convincing.

  Plus thief seems pretty adapt at getting away

She said that she met Assassin "when she first came into her Name." Odds are that she either did not have all of her Aspects yet, or was still learning to use them. And at that point Assassin had been killing Heroes for at least a decade and a half. If Assassin wanted Thief dead... I think she'd be dead.
