Makes the end of the chapter where Foundlings officiers hunt down assasins in praes a bit weird.

Cause it ends with Scribe talking like Assasin being mad is a major turn on for her. Also, the assasin is frequently abroad, like during Cordelia's rise to power, while Scribe is Always at Black's side.
