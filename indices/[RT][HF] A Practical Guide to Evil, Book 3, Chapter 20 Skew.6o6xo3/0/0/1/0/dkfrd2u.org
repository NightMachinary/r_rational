My main doubt about this is that Warlord is (as you stated) an orcish Name, and Cat is Callowan to her core. I feel it much more likely that she transitions to a Knight of some sort, or maybe Queen of Blades or some other culturally relevant Name. She has great respect among the orcs, but I could see it more easily going to an orc such as Juniper.

Or maybe Hakram... do we know if Adjutant is a transition name like Squire and Heiress? It feels like it might be; Adjutant is a military aid to a senior officer. If Hakram eventually branches out to become an orcish leader, I could see him transitioning to Warlord. Then again, Black Knight and Captain are both "end" Names that serve under other roles, so maybe Adjutant is similar.
