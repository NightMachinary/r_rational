Erratic has mentioned in one of the comment sections that Warlord is an orc title/name. I somehow doubt Cat will gain the allegiance of the entirety of Orc nations. I'd much more likely believe Hakram becomes Warlord eventually.

Or Nauk. Nauk is often not brought up during all this but he's pretty amazing all on his own.
