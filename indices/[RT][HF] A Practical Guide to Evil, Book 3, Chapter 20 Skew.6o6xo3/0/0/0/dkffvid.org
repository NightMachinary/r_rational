Not sure about those last two; Thief herself said that Assassin tried to recruit her:

#+begin_quote
  “Assassin tried to recruit me, when I first came into my Name,” she suddenly said.

  ...

  “The conversation couldn't have lasted more than a quarter hour,” Thief said. “To this day, I shiver when I think of it. That... thing was death made flesh.”
#+end_quote

So my thinking is that she's the Assassin analog, though Robber definitely has the better temperament for it.

I also find it really curious that this got tossed out unexpectedly, but there's no explanation (or followup from Cat) asking what they talked about or why Assassin let Thief live. Assassin has always been portrayed as reveling in (creative) death; and the Calamities, especially Assassin, have killed what, a score of fledgling heroes? I can't imagine she got away from Assassin despite the power her name might have conferred; which means Assassin let her go. Why?

Edit: A possible answer to my own question: Thief /is/ Assassin. Erraticerrata has mentioned that Assassin has already been in the story, in person, just not named as Assassin. It could be that Assassin took on Thief's appearance and is playing at being her. That could also explain why Cat notices the differences between Thief and other heroes she has met. Thief isn't attractive like most heroes become; she doesn't have the weight of presence or the ability to inspire like other heroes, even antisocial ones like the Lone Swordsman.

It's circumstantial, but I have been wondering which character we've met is actually Assassin, and Thief seems like a good fit.
