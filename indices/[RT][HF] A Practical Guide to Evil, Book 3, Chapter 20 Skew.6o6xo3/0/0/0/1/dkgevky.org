I'm thinking Assassin is likely that leader of the Blackguards who's appeared a couple times. But the reason I assume Thief fills in for scribe is because of this chapter. She literally skulks around and steals information/stuff making her the perfect black ops character. Also, she doesn't really kill all that easily, the only time we've for-sure seen her try to massacre anyone is versus pre-named Adjutant under William's dumbass planning.

Robber however? He's filling in the "infiltrate and execute" activities that Assassin would. He runs a team of sneaky murderous butchers and would likely make for a great Assassin himself with his enjoyment of insanity.
