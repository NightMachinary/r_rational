  I'm thinking Assassin is likely that leader of the Blackguards who's appeared a couple times.

Lieutenant Abase, right? Just curious, any particular reason why? The best I can think of is that Black tells Scribe to contact Assassin, and if Assassin is in the Blackguard and thus traveling with them, that explains why murders can happen within hours of the request. Anything else?

  But the reason I assume Thief fills in for scribe is because of this chapter. She literally skulks around and steals information/stuff making her the perfect black ops character.

I can see that to some extent; Scribe and Thief both share the characteristic of going unseen. Though Scribe seems to be MUCH better at it; Cat knew Thief was in the room in this chapter, and Thief had to take out the guards rather than just walk past them in "Raid." Scribe however can basically disappear from plain sight if she doesn't want to be seen.

Scribe also strikes me as more of the bookish type, while Thief is much more dexterous and energetic; I don't think we've ever seen Eudokia look rushed or move quickly or anything, but Thief is constantly on the move, throwing boats at armies or scaling the walls of heavily warded keeps to find Diabolist's secret basement.

Still, I agree, she's a closer match to Scribe than Robber is, by a long shot. I just wonder if my Thief = Assassin logical leap ends up being right, is there going to be some other character who steps up to fill the Scribe role analog?
