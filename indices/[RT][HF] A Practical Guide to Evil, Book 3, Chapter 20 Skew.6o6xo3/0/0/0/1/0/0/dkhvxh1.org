  I can see that to some extent; Scribe and Thief both share the characteristic of going unseen. Though Scribe seems to be MUCH better at it; Cat knew Thief was in the room in this chapter, and Thief had to take out the guards rather than just walk past them in "Raid." Scribe however can basically disappear from plain sight if she doesn't want to be seen.

Well, yes. The Calamities are, in their respective roles, MUCH better than Cat's team. I mean, could you compare Cat to Black? Adjutant to Captain? Apprentice to Warlock? etc etc. But they're all specialized differently and have their own fields of excellence. Thief would just be an analog not an exact duplicate. Plus scribe isn't as useful as a great Thief in a lot of situations even if she's an amazing "webweaver".

  Lieutenant Abase, right? Just curious, any particular reason why? The best I can think of is that Black tells Scribe to contact Assassin, and if Assassin is in the Blackguard and thus traveling with them, that explains why murders can happen within hours of the request. Anything else?

There are no /real/ reasons that I'm guessing this. But Abase has been named, is always around, and is in position to provide what Assassin does. While he might easily be someone else in this story given Erratic's hints I think he's the most likely culprit. But I won't be terribly depressed if I'm wrong. Assassin isn't an easily solved character and I wouldn't force myself to match wits with the author in this regard.
