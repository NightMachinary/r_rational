I haven't kept up with it, last I read she was leading an army through faerie, but I assume she hasn't changed sides since then... and up to that point she's literally working for the "evil empire". Even if we see their motivations as rational, for most of the known world they're villains /and/ they deliberately exploit that. From the viewpoint of basically the rest of the world she's absolutely a villain.

I'd call her a villain protagonist rather than an antihero.

Edit: You've convinced me she's not "amoral". But now I'm wondering: is it possible to write a villain protagonist without either alienating the readers or showing how their morality justifies their villainous acts?
