I've been reading [[https://www.amazon.com/Awaken-Online-Catharsis-Travis-Bagwell-ebook/dp/B01J0E8Z8A][Awaken Online]], a story about a full dive vr mmo - I've been listening to the audiobook and would definitely recommend it. MC is literally a necromancer king in his own kingdom by the end of the first book. He might not necessarily be evil - but the rest of the world treats him like a villain, he regularly commits virtual mass murder, ritualistic murder and psychological warfare. Later in the story he's even put on unofficial trial in the real world for it. Lot's of political intrigue and diving into the mechanics of the magic and the world, not very deeply but definitely enough to tickle that munchkinry trope, at one point the game nerfs him and his abilities specifically because he exploited it so bad.
