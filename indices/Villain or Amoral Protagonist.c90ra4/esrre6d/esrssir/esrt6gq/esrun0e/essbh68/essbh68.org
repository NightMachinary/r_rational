Honestly, cat is an ally to her Country, then her morals and then whoever the guy with the biggest stick is. I think that she really is a good person, even if her goodness is focused almost entirely towards blind Nationalism.

Her morals are pretty dubious on most days as well, though I think if some had to pin her down on them it would come down to the fact that in her point of view human (yes specifically human) life should not be given material value, this core moral has shaped the direction she has grown in through the entire series, it is why she Hates Praes so much, even if she doesn't hate the Praesi as a whole, the fundamental basis of their culture, human sacrifice, goes against her at her core.

Then there is the fact that she tends to side with whoever has the biggest stick, starting with Praes, and going into spoilers probably best left out of this thread.

I find her a fascinating character, and am baffled when she is called a Mary Sue, or even called Irrational, Cat is exceedingly rational /for the logic that her world runs on/, this logic is counterintuitive to us, and she has been getting better and better at it as the series goes.
