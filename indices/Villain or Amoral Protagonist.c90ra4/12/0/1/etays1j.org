To be fair to Cal, a lot of his mistakes are from his own experimentation. He's got no reference frame for what is rational beyond what his Wisp says. So his earlier mistakes are at least understandable.

However by the later books when he does have an understanding of the world he's not rational I agree. Hell, his original is sometimes more rational when it comes to the utilization of his available resources.
