I think 'amoral' is fair considering he really lacks any kind of deontological restraint. You can say he's an utilitarian but frankly even then his risk perception is kind of... skewed? He just /decides/ that Superman is a threat so dire he warrants murdering innocents to stop and then has no more qualms about it, regardless of what happens as a consequence of his own and Superman's actions. He never really questions his own judgement or future predictions. And remember it's stated that he did have criminal friendships and contacts and a murky past, so it's not like he ever was much above dirty means, and that was back when he wasn't fighting for some kind of greater good, but just to get rich.
