I wouldn't say Taylor is immoral or amoral, precisely. But she is a traumatized teenager, with all the limitations of a traumatized teenager. She makes abrupt and drastic decisions, often without regard for probable long-term consequences, because she frequently can't see past her own anger, fear, or pride. She is, in short, a very flawed hero, and the "doing the wrong things for the right reasons" tagline is IMO at least a little misleading.

​

She isn't outright immoral in the sense that she isn't deliberately, consistently, and flagrantly antisocial in her long-term goals. She doesn't hurt people for fun, for example, and perceives all her actions as morally justified (as did Hitler, for that matter). But I don't see how a deliberately antisocial character would be especially interesting--it sounds like the psychologically unrealistic sociopaths you say you're avoiding. And despite what I said about bad decisions, she makes excellent use of her powers on a tactical level. She's far from stupid. Just impetuous and angry.

​

And if that doesn't do it for you, much of the supporting cast is differently immoral.
