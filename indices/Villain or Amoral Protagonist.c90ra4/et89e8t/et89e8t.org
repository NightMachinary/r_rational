So far (past a thousand translated chapters now), I've wholly enjoyed Gu Zhenren(/'Master of Gu'/'Gu Daoist Master'/'Reverend Insanity'). Fang Yuan is basically this, live-forever-or-die-trying, and with no moral qualms about the rest of reality (while also not being malevolent-for-its-own-sake).

(Note that Timeless Leaf has about 50 translated chapters of the manhua adaptation.)
