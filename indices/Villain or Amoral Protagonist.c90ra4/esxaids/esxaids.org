To scratch The Metropolitan Man itch: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8700173/1/Lex-Luthor-Triumphant][Lex Luthor Triumphant]] by GuapoMendez.

For more DC universe: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-better-class-of-criminal-dc-si.394632/][A Better Class of Criminal]] is more funny than rational. Follows a self-inserted, slightly insane villain in post-apocalyptic Gotham. He runs for mayor obviously. If that wasn't enough, he has Moriarty in his head.

[[http://www.ironteethserial.com][The Iron Teeth]] a rationalist story by [[/u/dsraider]]. Follows a morally oblivious goblin who can't understand why any action against his own or his master's interest might be wrong.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1534683/1/Harry-s-Madness][Harry's Madness]] by SilverLocke980. What if Harry snapped and become darkness that rivals Voldemort himself.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Luck_of_Barry_Lyndon][The Luck of Barry Lyndon]] by William Makepeace Thackeray (love this name). If you are not a fan of 1800s writing, then at least watch [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072684/][Kubrick's amazing adaption]]. While the roguish narrator remains unreliable, he made him more sympathetic.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolita][Lolita]] by Vladimir Nabokov. A well-liked and charming man marries a woman doesn't sound villainous at all. You've been duped, he was a pedo all along. There is a reason we don't meet young Adolfs or young Lolitas on the street anymore. This book is the reason for the latter. It was also [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056193/][adapted by Kubrick]].

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prague_Cemetery][The Prague Cemetery]] is Umberto Eco's attempt to write the most despicable character he can. Follows a racist, misogynistic spy and a forger who deals with his political opponents and participates in nineteenth-century Europe events.

This short story may not fit perfectly, but I'll include it nonetheless: A Study in Emerald by Neil Gaiman. No link here. Better to go blind. Trust me.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29588376-the-lies-of-locke-lamora][The Lies of Locke Lamora]] and the Gentleman Bastard Series by Scott Lynch. Ocean's 11 in medieval times. While probably rationalist, I read them for the banter.
