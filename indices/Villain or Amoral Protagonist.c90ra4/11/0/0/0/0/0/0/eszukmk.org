Yeah, I can see that happening :) I didn't hate the ending, I thought it was cute in a way, but yeah it was clearly nonsensical. Didn't impact my enjoyment mostly because it didn't feel like it mattered to the story at all. Like you could tear out the last couple pages or whatever of every copy and no one would notice, they'd just assume it ended more ambiguously.
