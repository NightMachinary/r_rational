You can't call someone amoral just because they do shitty things--moral people do shitty things all the time, and Cat's /primary motivations/ are moral. The entire reason she pursued power, then a Role, was her disgust at Praesi abuses of power and her desire to improve her people's quality of life. She does have an ingroup vs outgroup mentality, but that's been the norm for most of human history (and arguably still is).

Is it moral to crucify someone? Absolutely not. Can a moral person crucify someone? They can, and they have.
