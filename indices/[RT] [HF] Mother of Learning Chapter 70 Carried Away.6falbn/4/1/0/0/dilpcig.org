Well, she was willing to endanger herself to save those wounded soldiers, she just had the favor returned coupled with bad luck. It's not like the simulacrum was sent with the orders to sacrifice himself, quite the contrary. In fact, Alanic may side with Zorian/simulacrun there, Taiven came close to disobeying orders, the one thing he strictly warned her against. It's kinda debatable whether simulacrum is a commander, but the original Zorian, Zach, Alanic and Xvim absolutely outrank her.
