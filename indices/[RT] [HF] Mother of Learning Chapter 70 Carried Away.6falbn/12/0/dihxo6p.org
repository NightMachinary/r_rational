the Lich can just tp away, it will not hit just like he does with any other threatening spell he just tanks the ones he know he can take.

the hydra have a simular problem, we don't know how easy the dimension cutter is to dodge or how volatile it is, if it activate on touching anything the hydra can just spit poison breath to stop it for example.

all in all we don't know enough about the spell but most likely since he haven't used it before it's something that's good for stationary targets.
