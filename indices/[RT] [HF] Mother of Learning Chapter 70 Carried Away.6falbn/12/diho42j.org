  Before Zorian could finish speaking, Zach had already fired some kind of projectile at the building. It was seemingly tiny, more of a faint red pinprick of light than a proper-looking offensive spell, but its flight path was followed with a piercing scream so loud it made Zorian's ears hurt.

  The projectile slammed into the wall of the building and then burst into crescent spatial distortions that sliced through everything in the vicinity with no visible resistance. The whole heavily warded building fell apart like an apple thrown into an industrial blender machine, burying everyone in it under several tons of rubble.

This is an impressive spell. It's small and quick to cast, but it ignores a heavy warding scheme and uses spacial distortion to destroy an entire building. I wonder why we haven't seen him cast this before? It would have been nice against that hydra or Quatach'Ichl.
