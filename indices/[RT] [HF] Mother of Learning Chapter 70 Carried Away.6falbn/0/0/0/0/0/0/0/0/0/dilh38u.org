Yeah, I can see this. Zorian's surliness is very similar to my own, and I can see myself yelling a a simulacra in the same way if I was under as much stress as Zorian was at the time (under attack, plan not going to spec, close friend about to be murdered, etc). It's basically externalized self-criticism, because I'd damn well be yelling at myself inside my head just as much as I'm yelling in my head at my simulacra.
