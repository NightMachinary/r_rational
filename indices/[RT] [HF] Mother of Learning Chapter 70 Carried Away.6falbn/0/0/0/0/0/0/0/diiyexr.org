That's not the thing though, the simulacrum just saved Tavien and Zorian responded so aggressivelyâ€‹ without much reason. I can see him being telling the simulacrum to hurry up and be more conservative with mana, but shouting at it and calling it stupid? Seems a little off from the Zorian who usually internally complains, and seldom by demeaning others unless it's warranted.
