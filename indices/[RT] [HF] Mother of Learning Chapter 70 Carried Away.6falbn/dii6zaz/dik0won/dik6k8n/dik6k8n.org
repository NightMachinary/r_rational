When I say "dismissing his sacrifice", I'm envisioning a scenario where Taiven is at first relieved, and then horrified when Zorian explains the mechanics of simulacra (if she doesn't already know them) in the most flippant way possible. Simulacrum or not, she still saw a sapient being with its own separate experiences die for her, and it probably wouldn't help that said being was for the most part identical to someone she cares for.
