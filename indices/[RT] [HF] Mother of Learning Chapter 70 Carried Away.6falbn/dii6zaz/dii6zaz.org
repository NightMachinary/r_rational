Ever since they were introduced, I've been kind of uncomfortable with how the characters view simulacra, so I'm hoping this incident with Taiven brings up the moral issues surrounding them. Given her views on the timeloop, I can totally see her getting angry at Zorian for completely dismissing his simulacrum's "sacrifice".
