Why would RR be a simulacrum of /Zorian/? I mean, 1. burdensome details when there's no reason to expect that Zorian would luck into the plot /twice/, 2. Red Robe didn't predict Zorian well at /all/, nor keep tabs (and if RR was a simulacrum then you'd expect RR to know Zorian and potentially keep tabs on him).
