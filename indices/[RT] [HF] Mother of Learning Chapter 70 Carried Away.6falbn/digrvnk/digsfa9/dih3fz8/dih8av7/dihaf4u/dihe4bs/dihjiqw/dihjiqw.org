Are you being sarcastic? (I literally can't tell, but the video you linked seems to imply it).

True portals would break conservation of energy as well as conservation of momentum anyways. You can't argue about them without A) assuming that the portal gun somehow compensates by providing that energy and absorbing the excess momentum or B) that the universe they have is so fundamentally easy to munchkin into Oblivion that it should have happened eons ago.

There's a good chance that portals (or in this case, dimensional gates) are merely unmovable because it increases the energy requirements or the gates themselves can't do the math required to make big changes to the relative position. There has to be a tolerance for small changes, as is obvious to anyone who knows about the true nature of sound and heat.
