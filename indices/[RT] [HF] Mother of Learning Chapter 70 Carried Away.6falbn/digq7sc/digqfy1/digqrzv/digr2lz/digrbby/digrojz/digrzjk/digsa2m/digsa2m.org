I know what's on their list, but it doesn't mean that they'll ever figure it out to the point they can assassinate Red Robe when real life starts, stopping Red Robe interfering.

Yes if they can somehow just remove Red Robe from the equation (doubtful) practising an attack on the base could be a good idea. Otherwise Red Robe can COMPLETELY negate any repeated practice they do.
