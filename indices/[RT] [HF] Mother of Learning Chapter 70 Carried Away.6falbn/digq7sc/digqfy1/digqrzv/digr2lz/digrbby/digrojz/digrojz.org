Red Robe currently throws that plan into the wind. For that tactic to work they need to figure out exactly who Red Robe is and where they start the cycles, and then essentially eliminate Red Robe the moment real life starts.

Also they won't ever be able to practice exactly how it will play out in the real world due to the absence of the Cyorian Aranae.
