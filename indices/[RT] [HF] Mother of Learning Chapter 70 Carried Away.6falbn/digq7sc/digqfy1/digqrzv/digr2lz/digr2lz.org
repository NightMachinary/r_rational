True. I am not fully convinced they would not be able to dredge up the same amount of support in the real world. I am however skeptical that they could do it as easily, and that they would be willing to do it. Sacrificing people if they are already doomed to die is one thing, but actually setting up an assault in the real world would be a much more impactful undertaking. That said, this was not a mission to stop the invasion or minimize casualties, so it would probably be much easier if that was their goal from the start.
