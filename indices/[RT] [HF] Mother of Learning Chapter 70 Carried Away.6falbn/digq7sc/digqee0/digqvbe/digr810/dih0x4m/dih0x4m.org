I assume it would work by replacing the original souls with souls from the Sovereign Gate. So wherever their bodies were in the real world when the Gate was activated, that's where they would be when they get out. Except that some time has passed in the real world. Probably not much, seconds, minutes, hours? If RR's soul was replaced sooner he could do something like walk away, or kill Zach. We know too little about the pre-loop situation though. Zorian would be in his bed but we don't know whether RR entered with Zach or found out about the loop when he was inside. We don't even know if Zach had to be present at the Gate to enter it. Maybe it's tied to Zach's bloodline and RR activated it. Since Zach wakes up in his bed each loop it implies that's where Zach was. Or maybe he gets to choose a starting location when activating the Gate?
