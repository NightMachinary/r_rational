I would guess seconds, minutes at the most, as the time RR has spent out of the loop is a small fraction compared to the life time Zach has spent in the loop so you have to multiply that time by at least 5 for the time the time loop takes in the RL.

Just had a thought. There is a few hours between where Zorian wakes up and the loop starts, found when the Aranean were soul erased from the loop, that could be a buffer period for when the projected time estimate of when the loop starts and ends in the real world ... potentially.
