Magnitude refers to innate capacity rather than acquired. A natural magnitude 20-30 is high, and a magnitude in the 60s(Zach) is downright inhuman and well above any mage ever recorded. The 243 number comes in through the innate 60 expanding through practice, but magnitude isn't a very good measurement at that point since there are other factors that improve the results like shaping skill and familiarity with the spell.
