You say that, but very very few of the force that assaulted the Ibasan base knew about the time loop. All those forces were making this assault thinking they would die.

And with Zorian's memory books of Xvim and knowledge of Alanic i'm sure he would be able to convince them again (without the cutting of the spiritual plain) and i'm sure they'd think 50 deaths is worth stopping a whole invasion...

In fact, knowing that all it takes is destroying the dimensional gate to stop the invasion, i'm pretty sure Zorian and Zach can spend a good few cycles finding out how to convince more officials of the threat, so that they could basically send an army to the base, or even a way to stealth destroy it?
