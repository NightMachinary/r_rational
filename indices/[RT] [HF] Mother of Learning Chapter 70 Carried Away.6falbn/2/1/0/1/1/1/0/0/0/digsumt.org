But he won't see it coming. He's never seen them try it before. He won't initially expect them to even survive and exit the loop, and even once he realises that they did, he won't know what they'll do. He's a complication, sure, but he's very beatable, especially without his loop-ejecting cheat.

Honestly, I'd be more worried about him trying to assassinate Zach first thing, and Zorian at the first opportunity.
