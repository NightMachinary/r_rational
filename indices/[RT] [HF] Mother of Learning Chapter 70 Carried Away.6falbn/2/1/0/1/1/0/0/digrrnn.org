What's the alternative use of their time? Zach tried to fight the invasion head-on for /decades/ without success, and that's without summoned demons being added to the mix. Sure, there are missing factors here, but it seems like repeated gate theft attempts have pretty good payoff. If they can identify all the priority targets, find good counters to the anti-aranea wards, etc, then even with further complications in the real world, they might have a chance to nip the invasion in the bud. And that's worth a whole lot of effort.

(And they want to steal the gate for research, anyway; if they can make that theft more efficient and take it with the portal still open, great!)
