  You know," Zorian suddenly said. "My past self would be horrified if he saw me right now."

  "Why?" Zach asked, arching his eyebrow in askance.

  "This attack is pretty... audacious," said Zorian. "There is no way my past self would ever consider this a reasonable risk to take. A part of me scoffs at this, dismissing it as simple cowardice, but there is another part of me that can't help but wonder whether the time loop had eroded away by ability to recognize what is and is not appropriately cautious behavior. What if we manage to leave the time loop and deal with Red Robe, only to die two months later because we did something completely stupid out of sheer habit?"

  To Zorian's surprise, Zach actually seemed to give the question some serious thought.
