I have a hunch that Ichl will investigate how this happened. Just this chapter it mentioned he is one of the only threats to Z&Z.

RR and Ichl had a deal where RR would provide him info. I wonder if that deal was made before the time loop started or after. If it was before, Ichl might suspect it's related to RR in some way. Otherwise he could just track down Alanic as an organizer of the raid and learn about the loop from him.

Edit. Ichl may also want to get his gate back or destroy it. He's getting his forces out to make the defenders feel relaxed, then strike where they have the gate.
