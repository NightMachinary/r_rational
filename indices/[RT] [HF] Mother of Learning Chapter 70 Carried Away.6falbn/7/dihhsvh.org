So stealing the gate cancelled the invasion, but it wasn't /just/ stealing the gate. The way they stole the gate told the Ibasans a few things:

1. Plans of the invasion are likely leaked. No more surprise attack.
2. Someone had enough knowledge of their base to come in with a strike group and steal a portal. What more might this group know?
3. (Ibasans might not figure this out) The raiding group had enough knowledge of the Ibasans internal structure that they knew who to kill to prevent the calling of the Lich, and they knew the Lich was involved.
4. The Ibasans just lost a bunch of officers and trusted subordinates. Sure, they could probably still pull off the invasion, but losing a bunch of trusted and competent personel is going to set them back.
5. Finally, we don't know how the gates work. It might be that the Ibasans are now worried about a counter invasion if they continue to leave their gates open and active.

Overall I don't think it would have the same effect on the invasion, if Z&Z just snuck into the base and quietly sabotaged the portal.
