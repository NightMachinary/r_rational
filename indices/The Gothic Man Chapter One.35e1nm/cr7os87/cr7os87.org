You make inquires about Gotham University's Department of Psychology, one of the foremost psychology programs in the world. You suspect that your father's alma mater may be interested in admitting the scion of the Wayne family.

You care about the darkness in the world, your family's foundation has control of an asylum, your father was a doctor, your mother was a philanthropist, and you don't think punching darkness in the face is very effective. Why not heal the darkness?

After all, you thought you saw in one of the documents about Arkham mentions of "attempted reforms" to become a "mental health institution" as other [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunatic#Use_of_the_term_.22lunatic.22_in_legislation][lunatic asylums have recently]]. If your father was a healer of men's bodies, perhaps you could be a healer of men's minds.

((I don't know if you already have a general arc planned, but without Batman's "punch evil in the face" mentality, Bruce is pretty primed to be a psychologist. If this is set in the same timeline as Metropolitan Man, then the setting is the 1930s, and in the real world at this time, organized crime is moving away from liquor, lunatic asylums are becoming mental health facilities, and FDR's New Deals are starting to turn the Depression around. In that atmosphere, with large amounts of money, a childhood friend placed highly in the local justice system, and access to Arkham, Bruce could become quite the noted criminal psychologist.))

((Since Gotham borrows heavily from New York City, [[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/aboutus/history/index.html][Columbia University's history]] and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_psychology][their functional psychology program]] could be used as a template for his studies. Psychology could put him in close contact with Drs. Strange, Crane and Quinzel. Prefrontal lobotomies and electroshock therapy came into vogue in the 1940s, so a heavy focus on psychology could go rather Gothic. Using what Bruce knows at this point, it's kinda hard to dive into the more meta-game-y aspects of dealing with the vigilantees, except in eventually trying to make them not be vigilantees and actually part of the system.))
