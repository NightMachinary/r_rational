  The second report from the three or so Wayne Foundation employees who take you seriously is waiting for you, along with a breakfast courtesy of Alfred; your father's old retainer and your Godfather, who is either staggeringly loyal or playing some vastly deeper game that involves managing your affairs perfectly for ten years in your absence.

Put Alfred under surveillance.

  There appears to have been an uptick in mental illness in the city, especially crime-related, and the old Arkham Madhouse has come into the Foundation's hands. Lucius wants your input in determining the renovated version is effective and secure.
#+end_quote

Investigate the nature, severity, and proclivity of mental illness in Gotham. Is Arkham specifically for criminally violent offenders? What is its history? Your personal opinion won't be much use in this situation regarding security, so the quality of construction, treatment policy, and security protocols should be inspected and tested by various Wayne and Gotham inspectors. It obviously needs to be licensed to run, so the asylum itself should be dealt with through the proper channels.

  The district attorney is looking to talk to you about improving law enforcement; you remember being pretty close friends when you were younger. You're honestly not sure if it's a coincidence or Alfred's way of nudging you to get back in contact.

This is the only thing we can affect personally. Schedule an appointment.

  Some kids were apparently bitten by a crocodile while shoveling snow into a manhole. Are our sewers infested with crocodiles?
#+end_quote

Should be left to the city to deal with until further notice.

  Finally, there have been several “lesser” heroes reported attacking petty criminals in the wake of Superman's disappearance. A guy in medieval-style armor in Metropolis has apparently shot someone, and Gotham Police are investigating several claims that a “ghost” has sabotaged shipments in the docks.
#+end_quote

Should be left to the police to deal with until further notice. If the Wayne Foundation has a resource flow through the Gotham docks, up security personnel and protocols. Vigilantism is rife with criminal concerns itself, so if this issue grows you should support the police wholly. Any security-minding citizen should be willing to go through proper channels to contribute to the safety and well-being of Gotham.

What are our resources? What is the Wayne Foundation's specialties? What are our personal skills?
