/Passive:/ Assume for the time being that Alfred is loyal, but stay alert for any evidence to the contrary.

/Actions:/ (in order of priority)

- Think back to the previous training that we have undergone: What skills do we have?

- Schedule a meeting with the district attorney.

- Request relevant information on Arkham from Lucius. We will probably not be able to give feedback yet, however, if we are able to meet with the DA.

- Request information on these imitation supermen through the available channels.

Ignore the crocodiles for now. I'm sure that it has to do with Killer Croc but that's meta-gaming; our Bruce Wayne knows nothing of KC and should be more concerned with other matters. Criminals, not wild animals. Granted, a crocodile in Gotham City is a definite oddity, but there are many explanations besides a criminal one.

/Priority/: Acquiring contacts and building information channels.

Should read "determining that the renovated version"
