Since the behavior and statistical trends behind criminal activities tend to be tightly correlated with the behavior of the local law enforcement, I would first talk to the DA-friend about how he/she thinks the law enforcement can be improved and follow it up with a visit to the Arkham Madhouse to see if there has been anything odd criminal activity-wise to cause the mental illness or if it's really the other way around (or if there is no causation, only correlation).

The other two things are not what Bruce normally deals with and should be delegated to someone more competent. Crocodiles go to animal control, and 'lesser heroes' go to the lawyer firm on retainer to analyze how likely they are to help or hinder catching criminals and if there's any way to channel them into a positive direction.
