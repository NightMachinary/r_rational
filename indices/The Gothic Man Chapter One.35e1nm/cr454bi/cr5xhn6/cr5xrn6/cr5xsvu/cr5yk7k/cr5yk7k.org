Obviously biased as I am by knowledge of the DC-verse, I'd say low to negligible risk. But it really depends on how many meta vigilantes are known. I'd start with the wanetech policies to establish that bruce knows that metas both exist and are on the rise. The risk would be higher if +Bat+Gothic Man has already appeared.
