Go online to check the news. Make sure Alfred isn't lying to you about current events or concealing information. Similarly, phone ahead to confirm the meeting with the DA.

Is Gotham really the best place for us to live? Maybe we should go to NYC to help out in the aftermath of Superman's disappearance. Also, maybe we shouldn't even try to be a hero unless we see an existential threat. I feel like leading a 3rd world country into the modern age through money and stuff might be a more profitable avenue of helping others than fighting crime. No US city has crime worse than what can be found in the 3rd world. I guess we might have political connections here, though.
