Economists have suggested a couple different implementations but the one I'd suggest here would maintain progressive taxation, such that the lowest tax bracket might be -30%, but the highest tax brackets are still positive numbers.

So high paid professions would be pretty much the same (perhaps paying slightly more), while the low income population receives more money directly back from the government. This partially offsets the phenomenon where as low income individuals make more money, they lose benefits, and so marginal increases to their income don't increase quality of life to the extent expected.

eg: -30% on the first $35k, 0% on the next 35k, 30% above 70k, and perhaps 37% above 200k
