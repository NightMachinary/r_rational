If a priority is dealing with crime, and you have basically unlimited funds, then making crime less profitable, while simultaneously offering other avenues seems like a potentially reasonable approach.

- Investigate Criminal Enterprise revenues.\\
- If drugs, push for legalization.\\
- If extortion, push for higher police budgets, subsidize weapons for self-defense, subsidize classes in self-defense.
- If prostitution, push jail sentences/longer jail sentences for customers. Alternatively, legalize but make it government run from designated licensed locations.

Before taking any of the above paths, read any available research as to whether these things have been implemented anywhere, and if they had the intended effect.

You are a rich billionaire in a corrupt city, so effecting local politics is presumably not too difficult.

Also consider if precommittment can be used as a weapon.

- Consider ways to plausibly pre-commit to punishing certain behaviors. If every kidnapping an organization launches leads to one of their buildings getting blown up, they'll stop kidnapping people.
- Consider ways to plausibly pre-commit to punishing criminal revenues in general. If you estimate they made $100 million last year, can you plausibly do $100 million in damage to their organization? Breaking things is generally easier then creating them, so while this sounds difficult, it may not be impossible, and if it CAN be done, it would probably be the fastest path to victory. While there is the obvious destruction of property method, also consider hacking there bank accounts, conning them with a ponzi scheme, and other creative methods. If greed is their motivation, turn it against them.

Next you want to provide opportunities to would be gang-members, increasing the cost of hiring of criminal organizations.

- Negative income tax policy encourages lawful employment
- Tuition subsidies encourages post-secondary school attendance
- A startup incubator similar to y-combinator 'might' encourage entrepreneurship and job creation, although this requires further analysis. This is likely worth doing regardless as it can be self-funding, and will probably scale well with enough time.

So after getting some analysts to look at the studies on the above mentioned issues, and hiring some lobbyists to start pushing the politicians in the right direction, schedule an appointment with the district attorney.
