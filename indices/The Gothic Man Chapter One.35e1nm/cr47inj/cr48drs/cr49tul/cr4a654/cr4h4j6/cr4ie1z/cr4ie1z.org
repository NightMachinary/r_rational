My chicken scratch math didn't really go anywhere. The big problem was that sonic boom "impact" changes depending on the aerodynamic profile of the object in question, and so far as I could find that information doesn't really exist for a person in flight. And it's also a complicated question because the speed of sound decreases as altitude decreases. Given how many variables there are, and the fact that I wasn't going to use it anyway, I settled on five minutes up, five minutes down as a good-enough guesstimate.

(I also sent in a question to xkcd What-If about Superman and abatement laws, but it never got a response - probably because he gets a ton of weird questions like that.)
