He limited himself to subsonic speeds, in part because he wanted to keep from breaking windows. New York City to Chicago at the speed of sound is roughly an hour, which means that if you care about street-level crime, /most/ of it will be over with by the time you get there.

Aside from that? Superman only speaks English. That makes global work a whole lot more difficult, especially in the 1930s when mass media is much less prevalent. He also does have some anthrocentric leanings - he cares about the United States more than other places, even if he might try not to, and he has a strong connection to Metropolis, not to mention a day job that occasionally requires him to be "on call".

Everything else comes down to his moral stance of unambiguous goods and the practical aspects of trying to be a symbol.

(Though I don't think it ever made it into the fic, I had the idea that later on Superman would realize that over certain distances, it makes the most sense for him to fly upwards at subsonic speeds, move around the planet at top speed once outside of atmosphere, and then slow down again to dive back down to the planet. I sat down to work out the math on what made the most sense at what distance, but then realized that there wasn't really a place where Superman would mention that to anyone, and Superman's viewpoint sections were scrapped pretty early on.)
