Echopraxia is like Blindsight, but moreso. It's incredibly dense and difficult to read, and even after to read-throughs I'm still struggling to get on a grip on what it was all about. (Though it's entirely possible/probable that's on me). Blindsight has a much more distinct and interesting lineup of characters, and even it's most convoluted/messy moments it's more focused and compelling than Echopraxia ever is.

tl;dr: I disagree. Echopraxia is incoherent, poorly-paced, and only occasionally brilliant.
