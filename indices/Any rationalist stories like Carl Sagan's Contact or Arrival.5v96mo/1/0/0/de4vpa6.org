Peter Watts tends to write novels each crammed with enough ideas for 4-5 other novelists. His plot is sort of set dressing to let him explore his world-building ideas on consciousness and biology. I don't really mind, as the churn of ideas is interesting.

He's a fairly interesting character in his own right: He's a former marine biologist, had his leg half eaten by necrotizing fasciitis, and he's no longer allowed in the US after getting pounded on by Cartman-esque border-cop several years back for the crime of asking what was going on during a delay as he was returning to Canada.
