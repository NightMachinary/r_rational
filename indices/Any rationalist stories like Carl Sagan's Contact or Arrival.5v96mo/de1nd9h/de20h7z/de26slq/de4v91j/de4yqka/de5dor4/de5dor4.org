Different strokes for different folks, I guess. I personally thought the central point hung together better in the end.

Ultimately, at the risk of oversimplifying, I think one of the creepy and awesome main points from Blindsight was that consciousness itself could be an evolutionary disadvantage, and that aliens may not even have the concept. It explores this through all sorts of characters with different thinking patterns, and some nicely alien aliens. In some ways it is a rather Debbie-downer ending, because it basically indicates we may be an evolutionary dead-end about to be eaten by more efficient beings.

Echopraxia, on the surface of it seems to push on this a bit further on a couple of fronts:

First it digs in a bit more about what the consequences of force-evolved consciousnesses not having the same sort of safe-guards we've built up over centuries might be. (The bit about the sages not being able to even consider failure, etc.)

But I think, the central bit with the spider in Echopraxia I thought was very well done, in that it attacks one of the sort of standard over-simplified rationalist arguments that Yudkowski trots out over and over in HPMOR, about "how if I could form a sufficient mental model of what a smarter protagonist would do, then I'm just as smart as the protagonist", by noting that it can process large quantities of information, just very slowly.

It gets at the distinction between the ability to think a thought at all, no matter how slowly, and being able to do so fast enough for it to be useful through such an emulation layer.

Running very complicated thoughts on inefficient human wetware leads to the burst of activity pattern at the end of the book, and a (for Peter Watts) a rather uplifting ending, in that there seems to be a pattern in which we may not have to give up what makes us human to compete.

As with everything else Watts writes, though, most of the 'action' bits of plot and what have you are really just window-dressing so that he can talk about these things. The action in Blindsight was better done.
