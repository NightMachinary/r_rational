Okay, so I read that story. Was pretty good and very much in that author's style. I don't think it appropriately captured what I was looking for. Which was the wonder and discovery of it all that is in Contact and Arrival(to a lesser extent).

But I do like how it goes for very "alien" aliens like you said. Where values were just flat out incompatible and the issues were morally dubious at best. Interesting stuff to think about.
