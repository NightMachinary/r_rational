Well, more like covering my bases to make sure that I don't miss something neat/obvious, and so that I have a well-defined set of rules.

I don't /usually/ find the munchkinry threads to be that useful for the actual munchkinry. For me they're mostly about getting myself into the mindset of rigid systemization, thinking about exploitability on my own, and getting a sense of how other people think about the systems as presented. It's easy to dump out a half-formed thought, but harder to present it here in a way that people won't just break it immediately, or that they won't have too many questions without good answers.

(And hopefully the people who munchkin take some joy in what's essentially an impetus to flesh out and think over stray strands of worldbuilding or novel writing for me.)
