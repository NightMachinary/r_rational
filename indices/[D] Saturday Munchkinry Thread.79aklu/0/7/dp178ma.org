It seems your intent to allow Taylor-level multitasking while disallowing short-term technological victory would be better modeled by the rule that you technically control one agent (sending instructions and receiving a human's bandwidth of information about the state of matters) which is not self-aware, infinitely multitasking, has only short-term memory and otherwise acts as you would. [[#s][Spoiler]]

Can we keep everyone from leaving even if everyone we aren't controlling could communicate telepathically? Consider the strategy where we parallelly spend 90% of our power fractions-of-a-second-flickering through ~32Â° sectors of the Zone and 10% doing longer tasks. Using cars to escape is right out, but might bring back those that stray too far. Trains/Planes are swiftly sabotaged. Dropping prone is much easier than standing up, so people will have to crawl. During up to 45 hours of crawling at a meter per second, a good portion of the population becomes exhausted enough for me to focus on the rest. Some might try to kill others or themselves to decrease my power. Game theory suggests having those that would kill others for this purpose kill themselves instead, but they might be few enough that the prisons can be used for them.

Simply letting the hardest-to-control people that would crawl out leave alone turns this into a big hostage situation, and the outside world will hardly let millions starve, so trade and work can keep going. I am anonymous in much the same way Light is, which incidentally incentivizes me to raise the standard of living. Communism actually works now: No more homeless, little need for cashiers, bureaucrats, police, /looks up occuptions lists/ - /can't actually find good ones :(/. Tourism might survive if I never control tourists in the first place. I might let people keep a semblance of money for morale, but an instant 90% one-time-tax (and 90% reduction of prices for permanent residents) gives a fat diplomatic bargaining chip.

Once an efficient society is in place, what use is my power? Once I find one, the interesting story of how to maximize people count might become relevant.
