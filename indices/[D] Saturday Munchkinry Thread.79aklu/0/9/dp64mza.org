The fact that they retain experiences sounds like you could use it for training muscle memory in soldiers, athletes, etc. Nobody needs to know it's a person doing this, for example it could be disguised as a property/enchantment of the building they are in.

Civilian uses abound as well. You could have gymnasiums where anyone walking in the door is instantly "motivated" to go through a sequence of rigorous exercise on autopilot. A city full of atypically buff, healthy people would probably tend to attract immigration, all else equal. Having everyone excel at sports would have its own allure, and you would always control the outcome of sporting events, so you could bet accordingly if you want to selectively impoverish someone or raise capital without taxation.

You might similarly have fake-enchanted classrooms where even the dumbest and/or most distractable of minds can be steered through curriculum that advances their math and writing abilities without fail, because they will mechanistically write a sequence of essays and formulas for hours on end without succumbing to the effects of boredom.

To give the city a nice artistic style, you could possess a bunch of people and make them do art for hours on end, cycling out the ones with least talent. The ones with the most talent could go around producing tastefully synchronized, high quality graffiti, murals, and so on.

People who want to pass a message could write it down, then be taken over so you can see what they wrote, then the recipient could be taken over and made to write it down. So you could have them pass "secure" instant messages that way.

Depending on the level of finesse permitted, you could selectively take over eyes and hands as needed for the messaging system, making it seem like a simple magic object is responsible. Or perhaps, unobtrusively take over a person by instructing them to do whatever they would normally do, getting access to their senses and unconscious/automatic actions only.

If you have access to the autonomic nervous system's actions, you could put people in a relaxed state instantly. Great pseudo-enchantment for a designated spa or recreational area. You could just as easily kill them instantly by telling their heart not to beat (or /prevent/ heart attacks from being fatal by starting them back up again). By assuming very brief control, you could have it so that anyone who walks through a given door is suddenly relaxed, tired, alert, etc., at very minimal expenditure of the per person time budget.

If you want to grow the population organically, you could influence people to have more children by taking them over at precise moments to ensure contraceptive failure. You could also engineer lots of meet cute moments and ensure that most people end up with a partner, even without really trying. The zone could easily get a reputation as the most romantic city in the world, the best possible place to meet your lover. All the more (creepily!) so if you can influence arousal and physiological symptoms of attraction.

You could also use this power to comprehensively prevent child abuse, murder, drug addiction, and other undesirable / socially contagious phenomena, provided you are willing to put people under enough constant scrutiny. People about to break a law or desired norm could be made to experience paralysis until the opportunity passes. The effect could perhaps be explained as city-wide wards, or a religious explanation could be invented (basically, a benevolent god watches over this city). Of course, if you have autonomic control you could probably also do some pretty heavy duty Pavlovian conditioning to prevent intervention from being needed to begin with.
