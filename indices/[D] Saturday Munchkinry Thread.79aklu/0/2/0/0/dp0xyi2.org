So am I unable to bidirectionally communicate via more than single-digit amount of puppets simultaneously? Or even just passively listen.

Edit: And really, while motor control is different from high level reasoning and is okay to independently enhance, this only means that you can make all your puppets simultaneously "walk forward balancing on uneven ground, stepping over smaller obstacles", but you can't make all of them "collect all valuables in the building you are in and drop them off at location X" or even "grab nearest weapon-like thing and attack nearest person". These require higher lever reasoning that you don't have. Effectively you have an army of quick zombies with impressive reflexes, but you can't control them with more granularity than giving the crowd a direction to move in.
