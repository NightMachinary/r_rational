As for the edit, I think that's a pretty fair descriptor, but you /do/ have the ability to use your normal level of reasoning and communication in pursuit of your goals. It just doesn't get multiplied with the number of drones.

I guess I would say that while you /can/ have an army of quick zombies, but it's not /just/ an army of quick zombies. If you wanted to take all the valuables out of a building, you could take control of everyone inside it, then have a single-digit number of people there comb through for things that you thought were valuable, switching your attention between them as needed for evaluation or more complex tasks. And if you wanted to, e.g. deal with an armed force, you could just take control of them and have them commit suicide, or sit there as docile targets, and even if you only did this one-by-one, you'd still be really effective.

It's a matter of leveraging your advantages within the limitations.
