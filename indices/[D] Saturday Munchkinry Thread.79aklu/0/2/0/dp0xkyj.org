You can observe where everyone is (equivalent to a three-dimensional GPS that gives you a point in space), but you can't see what they're doing without taking control.

Reading comprehension is, to me, fundamentally different from simply moving your eyes over the words printed on a page, and takes place at a higher level of cognition, though I suppose you might disagree. I probably need a more formal definition, but the idea is largely that you get bodily-kinesthetic and visual-spatial enhancement to deal with the sheer numbers, but that this is not equivalent to adding raw brainpower or increasing /g/-factor.
