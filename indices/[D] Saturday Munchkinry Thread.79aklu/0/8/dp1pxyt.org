10%? You can can run a society based entirely on rewards, methinks, without need for punishment.

In other words, you can use your zone to facilitate conditioning / brainwashing according to your values, if you keep at it long enough and regularly send your chosen folk out into the world. If they've grown up in your zone and you exemplify your values with appropriate comeuppance and rewards รก la karma, then they will internalise this as expectations for future experiences.

I think.

Another idea would be menial work. You can have coal miners or something like that doing menial work, but rotate them out regularly. Yes, they're doing backbreaking work, but not long enough to actually break their backs. Use this as a means to either do a lot of very well coordinated menial work, or set up a giant sweatshop and outcompete anyone else. Take clothes, for instance, have farmers be uncontrolled, they farm produce and cotton and are paid what their work is worth.

Depending on memory access (i.e. if you can make subjects forget about things) you can even have subjects more or less rent their body to you, if you're open about your whole spiel, and you make use of their bodies for whatever and pay them back fair and square.

Be the biggest, most secure prison ever by lying about your spiel, like telling you're limited to 10 miles. You use the population of the 100 miles radius to absolutely control the 10 miles radius circle. Tell governments you're willing to buy or take prisoners and guarantee they won't break out, ever.

You can combine these of course.

Sorry for the haphazardness of ideas, sleep schedule's wonky.
