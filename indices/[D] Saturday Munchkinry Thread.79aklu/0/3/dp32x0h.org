Hmmmm....

/I/ cannot read two textbooks at once any better than I can on my own. But the person I am controlling is aware at all times, so /he/ can. I could market an anti-procrastination clinic - 'read those textbooks you keep putting off' - and use my ability to force my customers to at least /look/ at the textbooks.

I could also offer public speaking services - not /me/ doing the public speaking, you understand, but rather me using the client's body to give a speech without showing the client's nervousness.

This is just two examples; I'm sure there are plenty of other reasons why people might want to pay to be controlled (assuming I never abuse it).

I am also going to be extremely useful to the police. I know exactly where every last living person in the Zone is; this includes a number of people who are presumably wanted by the police to assist with their enquiries in a variety of matters. I can simply march these people directly to the nearest police station. (Joining the police myself might deal with a few odd issues regarding citizen's arrests, plus provide a salary package). Moreover, I know where people are /in real time/ - I can use that to become the perfect guard for any facility wholly inside the Zone.

Honestly, though, "no longer need to sleep" might be the most important part of this power. Eight extra hours per day!
