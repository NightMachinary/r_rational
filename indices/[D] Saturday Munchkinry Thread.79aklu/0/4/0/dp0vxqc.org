As you come to within the border of the Zone, you will feel increasingly (irrationally) incapable of leaving the Zone. If you pass the border, you will have a massive, continuous panic attack and devote all of your mental and physical resources toward returning to the Zone as quickly as possible, regardless of all other consequences. If it proves impossible to return to the Zone for more than an hour, you will instead be overcome with a similar panicked desire to end your own life at all costs, with no room for other thought. You're still limited by your normal intelligence in pursuit of these goals, and the intensity of them allows you no ability to do other things (including the ability to sense or control people within the Zone).
