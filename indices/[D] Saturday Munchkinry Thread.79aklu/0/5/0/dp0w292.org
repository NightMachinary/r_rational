If you're controlling up to your limit of people and the population goes down, thereby lowering your limit, you have thirty seconds grace period to voluntarily lose control of whoever you want, and if you don't choose, you'll lose control of the person closest to the border of the Zone. (You can voluntarily lose control of anyone at any time.)

If someone under your control leaves the Zone, you lose control of them.
