Eh, I'd be a little careful with that kind of reasoning. Even if you manage to set it up such that you have one ruler with absolute unchallengeable power, that ruler would still have an incentive to minimize the amount of effort they have to put in to maintain that power.

World optimization is hard work after all, why not spend today enjoying the power you have and start fixing world hunger tomorrow? Or better yet, why not hand it off to someone else (with minimum oversight of course) you have worked very hard to get to where you are, don't you deserve to slack off a bit?

There is more than one way in which power corrupts.
