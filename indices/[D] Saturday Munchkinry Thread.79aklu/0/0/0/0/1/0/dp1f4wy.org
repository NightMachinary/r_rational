See a lot of this depends on the method of world domination scheme used, because I'm generally assuming you either have mind control or enough overwhelming force that no coordinated large scale resistance to your rule is possible.

The idea that having only one government would create a single point of failure here is something I find rather questionable. Because it make implicit assumptions about what counts as a nation, and assume that a single failure point is always worse. After all a single extremely unlikely failure point is better than many vastly more likely failure points in many cases.

There's also the assumption that if the centralized government somehow fell the government wouldn't just be reformed or have the individual local governments turn into new nation states.

Overall I'm not sure your point here is really very strong and I also doubt it couldn't be averted with good enough planning before the fact such that the government has plans in place for how to continue if any single part of the ruling party is eliminating.
