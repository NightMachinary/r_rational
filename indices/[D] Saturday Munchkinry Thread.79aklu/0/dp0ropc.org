There is a static spherical volume with diameter 100 miles, centered on downtown Seattle, called the Zone here for brevity.

- You cannot leave the Zone.
- You cannot move the Zone.
- You know where every living person in the Zone is.
- For every ten living people in the Zone, you can assume physical control of one of them. (e.g. There are 3.8 million people in the Seattle-Tacoma metro area, so you could assume physical control of 380,000 of them.)
- Your mind can infinitely expand to deal with both the multitasking and sensory experience of all those bodies, but you don't otherwise gain any cognitive enhancement. (e.g. You cannot read two textbooks at one time any better than you could do it on your own.)
- People are aware that they've been taken control of and experience whatever happens to their body. They don't know that it was you.
- You no longer need to sleep.

Given all that, what do you do in order to accomplish your goals, whatever they are? I would appreciate solutions that respect social norms and established institutions, as well as megalomaniacal disregard for consent and the safety of others. (If your goals are lame or uninteresting, you can substitute them for "make as much money as possible" or "establish yourself as grand ruler of a new nation within the Zone" or something like that.)
