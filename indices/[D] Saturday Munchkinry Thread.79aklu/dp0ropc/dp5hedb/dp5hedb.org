I'm assuming that I want to control the world but don't want to do all the hard work involved in that.

I make it very clear that there's something in the Zone that can kill people on a whim, or ruin their lives. I make sure that anyone who tries to leave is gunned down by forces stationed at the border. I make it clear that rebellions will be cut down by their own members.

And then, when people start realizing that they can't resist me, I start working the other side of this. Offer rewards to people who help me - people gunning down rebels or runners, people who offer my servants money or goods, people who educate children by brainwashing them to be loyal to me. Off criminals who interfere with your servants.

When I have enough servants, start cloning or breeding or brainwashing people for loyalty to me. These people won't need to be controlled, which means I can focus my attentions on those who do. They can also be used to accomplish my goals outside the Zone.

I never let people know who exactly is controlling them all.
