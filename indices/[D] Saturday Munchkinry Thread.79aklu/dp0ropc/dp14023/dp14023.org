  People are aware that they've been taken control of and experience whatever happens to their body. They don't know that it was you.

Sure, but sooner or later they will notice that only people in The Zone are being mind-controlled, and would understandably be pretty pissed about it. If you just try to mind control people sloppily, pretty soon a nuke will land on the Zone just to free all your puppets from their captivity.

So honestly, if you are a good person, or at least someone who doesn't like having nukes dropped on them, you wouldn't use this power much, at all. Maybe to get some criminals to commit suicide, but that's it. But that's a "lame goal", so let's aim for something megalomaniacal, like taking over the world.

First:

#+begin_quote
  For every ten living people in the Zone, you can assume physical control of one of them. (e.g. There are 3.8 million people in the Seattle-Tacoma metro area, so you could assume physical control of 380,000 of them.)
#+end_quote

Can you choose who?

Can you cycle through them? Like control 380000 people one day, and then another 380000 people?

Can you cycle through them really really fast to stop anyone from ever leaving the Zone? Crash their vehicles into trees and stab themselves in the legs if need be?

Can you artificially inflate the number of people in the area by mass reproduction/cloning? For example, could you create 38 million embryoes, which are technically people, and then assume control over the 3.8million non-embryos in the Zone?

#+begin_quote
  You cannot leave the Zone. You cannot move the Zone.
#+end_quote

I want to expand my numbers to gain more power, but the 100 mile diameter of the Zone means there's only so many people I can physically stuff inside it. :( Is there no way to expand the Zone?

What about controlling people who are only partially in the Zone? I could probably develop biological and medical technology to have people grow long strings out of their bodies, and attach those strings to the Zone. Would that work?

*World Domination Plan #1: Targeting the Powerful*

By stealthily controlling key people in charge of the Zone (and never releasing them from your control so they can't blab about it), establish the Zone as a wonderful tourist resort. Try to host world-wide events that attract lots of rich and powerful people. Gather as many as you can, then take control of their bodies and loot them dry. Make them give all their money to you and then commit suicide in secret after setting up trails that suggest they have left the Zone safe and sound, while not actually letting them leave the Zone since that would allow them to escape. Actually don't take the money directly, use proxies, which in this case means any random person in the Zone: take control of that person to get the cash.

Now that you are filthy rich, use that money to fund whatever evil world domination plans you have. Research doomsday weapons or super soldiers. Bribe people in power into becoming your loyal puppets, then invite them to the Zone and make them actual puppets. Research how to expand this damn Zone so it covers more than a puny 100miles.

*World Domination Plan #2: Targeting the Faithful*

Start a cult. Your new powers are ridiculously well-suited for smiting people. Proclaim the Zone as the promised land, where God watches over all his people. By which I mean you. You watch over all the people in the Zone. And smite whoever is evil (or disobeys your cult's doctrines). By which I mean making them write long suicide letters of repentance before killing themselves. For less rebellious targets, you can give them divine warnings by taking over their bodies and forcing them into prayer for hours before releasing them.

Also target evil a lot more publicly, to attract more followers to the Zone. Crime in the Zone would be pretty much 0 after all, since you never sleep, and watch over everyone, and smite anyone who tries. Gather those followers, and when its time, whip them into a religious frenzy to begin a holy war hell-bent on conquering the rest of the world.

IN THE NAME OF KANE.
