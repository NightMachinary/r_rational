The previous caveat here that, that power can't meaningfully increase one's own QOL is sort of relevant here. There may still be incentive towards nepotism but that is just as easily solved by being friends with anyone else in power. As for being incentivised to the bare minimum to maintain power given the methods of achieving world domination I mentioned earlier you aren't going to need to put that much effort in except by occasionally making shows of force, in the case of mind control you can actually be pretty safe letting other people do all the work since you can be totally assured of their loyalty.

You're also somewhat assuming that just because you've achieved world domination you would have to act as the leader for the entire world which is wrong and a terrible idea. Instead you force preexisting governments to merge and make them to do what they need to get the results you ask of them.
