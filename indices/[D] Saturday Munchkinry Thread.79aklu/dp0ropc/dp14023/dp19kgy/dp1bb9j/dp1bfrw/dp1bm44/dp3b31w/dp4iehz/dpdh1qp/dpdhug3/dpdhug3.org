I wasn't talking about this scenario specifically because this scenario is absolutely not one that allows world domination (I was talking about scenarios under which you would be assumed to have the requisite abilities to achieve world domination). You just can't fundamentally control more than a few people at time effectively with body control. Given people remember being puppeted, as other comments have pointed out this basically gets rid of the possibility of accomplishing much on the global scale with these abilities.
