My experience with [[/r/menwritingwomen][r/menwritingwomen]] and the twitter equivalents is that it tends to be roughly 25% blatant sexism, 25% men using a weird metaphor which doesn't land well to describe a woman, and 50% men writing prose which would not offend any reasonable person. If you're worried about falling into the first two categories, a better solution than listening to twitter is to just get some women you know to beta read your stuff and give you comments.
