Most of the examples they give seem pretty extreme to me. For a series which claims it's mostly talking about â€˜something that isn't inherently problematic, and it would ping nobody in a negative way if we lived in a world without misogyny', I think it would have worked better to have gone a bit more nuanced. I don't particularly need it explained that it's crass to talk about how sexually arousing a corpse is.
