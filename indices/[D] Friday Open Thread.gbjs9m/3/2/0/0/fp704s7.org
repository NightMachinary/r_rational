Sure, but there's two levels here, aren't there? The prose as all the hypothetically available details of the scene, filtered through the viewpoint of the view character- sure- but also as filtered based on your target audience/your own imagined perception. And the target audience, given that not making a decision and going with what comes automatically is also a decision.

You're giving information on the view character, but you're primarily giving information to the reader, and if your readership wants to know the cup size of every woman in the story- well, there' s a market for that isn't there? ;)

I get wanting to avoid writing cringe, though. But cringe is context-and-viewer sensitive: one cannot be all cringe to all people.
