On the topic of the title itself, someone who doesn't care about the problem fits within the stated purpose as written, because they don't want to offend women.

They also fit within the intended purpose, because there's an implicit moral judgment and they're within scope of the moral landgrab.

The title is also misleading in an instrumental sense because reading it would most benefit someone who wants to offend women.
