  But a lot of men like to read that sort of thing. Even going beyond smut, that's the fact of existence for the interior of the male mind: the experience of perceiving the world from the point of view of your average man is inherently offensive to a lot of women (and presumably vice versa).

As a haver of one of those heterosexual male minds I can see what you mean. Since reading the article series I've become aware of how my first, instinctual response when seeing a strange woman is to assess how much I want to breed with her. (Which honestly kinda weirds me out.)

But isn't that exactly why we should make sure that our fiction /doesn't/ focus on that, outside of porn? If our instincts are geared to ensure that we rate a woman's personhood as a secondary concern at best, then the fiction we create should strive to counter that.

Additionally, including gratuitous descriptions of a woman's looks to please your heterosexual male readers at the cost of the enjoyment of other groups is yet another example of sexism/inequality, I think. As well as suboptimal writing.

As to clich√©s about men that I would find offensive... I'll certainly be on the lookout for those in the future. The only one I can think of would be that men are incapable of properly dealing with feelings, be it their own or those of others.
