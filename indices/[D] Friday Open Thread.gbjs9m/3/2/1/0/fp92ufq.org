"Additionally, including gratuitous descriptions of a woman's looks to please your heterosexual male readers at the cost of the enjoyment of other groups is yet another example of sexism/inequality, I think. As well as suboptimal writing."

Maybe this is where technology can help us. We can have the reader fill out a form before reading the webnovel, and the book can have several different versions of each paragraph based on the sorts of books the reader likes to see. So for the same paragraph with the same basic information, the men get loving descriptions of the female sidekick's breasts, women get more of an emphasis on the male sidekick's physique, and people who want neither (or both!) get that. You could composite it all together programatically when the page is loaded, based on the user's selected options. This way, everybody can see what they want to, and nobody has to be offended/alienated!

This started off as a joke, but now I really want to see it.
