In part 2, they mention avoiding describing women's looks for the sake of it.

But a lot of men like to read that sort of thing. Even going beyond smut, that's the fact of existence for the interior of the male mind: the experience of perceiving the world from the point of view of your average man is inherently offensive to a lot of women (and presumably vice versa).

Now I want to see a work that takes each of these tips and goes in the opposite direction as hard as possible.

(I also want to see the version written by a man towards women writers... But I have a hard time imagining it. Can you think of any identifiably female takes/writing cliches that some men might find offensive?)
