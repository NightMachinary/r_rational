It always makes me a little salty that the japanese have this webfiction to novel to manga to anime pipeline for stories as dumb as "I got isekaid and now I'm a hot spring", but stuff like Worm or Worth the candle or Unsong only get the occasional bit of fanart. (admittedly, sometimes it's really good fanart, but still.)

The western publishing industry has its head in its ass and continues to do only what made it money two decades ago, while appealing to the same readers that were reading two decades ago. At least RoyalRoadl has the webfiction to kindle unlimited/patreon pipeline.

(Though I shouldn't be too salty. Latin america doesn't even have their own dedicated sites, they mostly just stick to the margins of the english language sites. One of my little brazilian cousin told me she reads stuff on /Episodes/, which was a hilarious conversation.)
