There's [[https://syosetu.com/][Shousetsuka ni Narou]] ("Let's become novelists") which according to Wikipedia seems to have been the origin of a fair amount of popular Japanese light novels and anime, including KonoSuba, Overlord, various Isekai stories, etc. Though I don't know how many of the more well-known ones are still there- The Irregular at Magic High School was, if I remember correctly, taken down once it got a (great) print novelization. The currently airing [[https://ncode.syosetu.com/n5040ce/][My Next Life as a Villainess]] is still there it seems.

Makes me wonder if any anime company would take up Mother of Learning.
