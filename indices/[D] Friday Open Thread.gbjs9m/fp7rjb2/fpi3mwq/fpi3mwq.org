  I've always wondered about web serial sites in other languages. In English we have RoyalRoad, ff.net, AO3, etc., but what about non-English sites? Anyone know any?

Russia has its fair share of dumb webfiction and sites that host it. That's where all the translated litrpg is trickling out from. The big ones would be [[http://samlib.ru/][Samlib]], [[https://litnet.com/][Litnet]], [[https://author.today/][Author.today]] and promising newcomer, [[https://litmarket.ru/][Litmarket]].
