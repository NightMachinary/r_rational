So, apparently my mother killed an Asian Giant Hornet (a "murder hornet") about a week ago. She says there's no mistaking it, it was the largest hornet she'd ever seen in her life, almost as long as a thumb, with that characteristic huge red head.

News articles released today say that sightings have so far been limited to the Pacific Northwest. We live in North Carolina.

There's no way a single hornet could be here without a colony, and there's no way a colony could be established on literally the opposite side of the country without a bunch of other colonies between here and there. If it /is/ a murder hornet and it's /here/, then it's already /everywhere/.

I'm anticipating sightings being reported across the whole country within the next few days, and I'm leaving this comment here now so that I can hopefully be proved wrong. I really don't want to be right.

EDIT:

And no, it wasn't an Eastern Cicada Killer, those don't have the same big head.
