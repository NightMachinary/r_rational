I've been reading a lot of [[https://mythcreants.com/][mythcreants]] lately, which led me to a 7-part series called [[https://patricia-penn.com/2019/11/23/a-guide-to-writing-women-for-men-who-dont-want-to-offend-them-1-7/][A Guide To Writing Women (For Men Who Don't Want To Offend Them)]].

Reading it left me rather mortified at how many blatantly sexist/misogynistic/inappropriate descriptions have passed my inner critic simply because I was used to reading their like.

I'd love to hear what other people here think about it.
