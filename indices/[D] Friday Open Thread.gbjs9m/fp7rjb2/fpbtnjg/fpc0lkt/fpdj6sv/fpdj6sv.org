I'm not saying it's likely but it's possible they can be established near you and in the Northwest, but not in between. The hornets near you don't have to be from the same source as the Northwest. They are much more likely to have been imported to the coast by shipping or hobbyists than anywhere in between, so they could just be a separate import to your coast. It's pretty unlikely they've spread across the entire breadth of the USA without being noticed, especially given how distinct and scary they are.

The environment and competition between the two coasts are drastically different. I personally haven't heard any accounts of them in the Midwest and I'm moderately connected to farmers, hunters, and beekeepers in the area. Also if media companies caught wind of it the story would be everywhere, it's too good of a story like killer bees and CCD.

Edit: Or this opens up the flood of reports from across the country. [[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/us/asian-giant-hornet-washington.html]]
