I've always wondered about web serial sites in other languages. In English we have RoyalRoad, ff.net, AO3, etc., but what about non-English sites? Anyone know any?

And, now that I think about it, any non-English rationality groups/sites as well. How prominent would they be, given this English one is not that big either?
