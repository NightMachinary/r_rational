"Einführung in die Elastizitäts- und Festigkeitslehre" (Introduction to elasticity and strength of materials) honestly did a way better job at explaining the subject matter than my professor did. The book is from 1993, written by the professor's predecessor, and without it, I would have bombed that exam /so/ hard.

It's probably useless to you, seeing how it's written in German, but if anyone here is going to be studying anything Engineering-related at University of Stuttgart, /this book is vital/.
