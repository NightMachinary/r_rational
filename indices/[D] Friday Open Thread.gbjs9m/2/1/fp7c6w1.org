I really like Spivak's Calculus as an introduction to differential and integral calculus, but it's certainly not for the feint of heart. As you usually get with Spivak books, it's very very rigorous. His most popular book is Calculus on Manifolds. An alternative I've also seen is Apostol's calculus. I've never read it, but I've heard it's good.

Currently, I'm reading Computability and Logic by Boolos et al. (as well as finishing up the last few chapters of Spivak's Calculus).

The Machine Intelligence Institute has a [[https://intelligence.org/research-guide/][research guide]] bound to be full of well written papers and textbooks. It's aimed at information relating to AI alignment, not general information though. This is where I found Computability and Logic.

Also, don't discard that LessWrong post! Most things in science evolve slowly, and for things like "the history of western civilization", good resources from 10 years ago are likely still good sources.

Often if you go to +[[/r/math]]+ [[/r/Economics]] or really any other subject-specific subreddit, you'll find in their Wikis a bunch of good textbooks as well. I believe I found Spivak's calculus by making a post on [[/r/math]]. (EDIT: I vastly overestimated the number of subject-specific subreddits that have a resources section. In any case, if you make a post in those subreddits asking for textbook recommendations, they are more often than not happy to reply).

I'd also point you in the direction of [[https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm][MIT OpenCourseWare]], where MIT uploads a bunch of free, online courses complete with video lectures and often problem sets. For courses they don't upload videos and other materials for, they often include a syllabus which lists the textbook they use to teach.
