The two best textbooks from my CS education were:

- Discrete Mathematics with Applications by Susanna S Epp. Intro-level text on discrete math, sets, set operations, counting, and discrete probability. Very thorough, takes you through everything in small steps without repeating itself, and covers a lot of ground.

- Algorithm Design by Jon Kleinberg and Éva Tardos. Advanced-level text on algorithms. Not quite as friendly as the former, but it does get the job done and the exercises are excellent.

Other resources:

- Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher M. Bishop. I don't like this one nearly as much as the above, but it covers just about everything and I've spent so much time staring at its section on normal distributions that I'd feel weird not to mention it. (But maybe if it was better I'd have had to revisit it less often.)

- [[https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/][A Primer on Bézier Curves]] by Pomax. Explains almost everything there is to use on Bézier curves, with interactive demos.

- Beautiful Trouble: A Toolbox For Revolution. The top-level structure is a bit scattershot but the internal linking is great. Some of the "principles" section are the best resources on strategy I've read in any context. (Would recommend No Shortcuts by Jane McAlevey more for organizing methodology, but it's a pile of case studies, not a reference text, and I thought her interview with Current Affairs was more approachable.)

And one more thing a bit off from what you asked for:

- [[https://directtovideo.wordpress.com/][directtovideo]] by Smash. Not organized, narrative-format explanations of how a democoder made his best effects. Basically no information on "how" and everything on "why," which makes it one of the best explanations of the actual practice of advanced computer graphics I've seen.
