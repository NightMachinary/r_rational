Introduction to quantum mechanics, second edition, by David Griffiths.

I used it for my second year of university. The university-mandated textbooks were obviously written by a committee, and reading them made me want to burn them. Griffiths' book feels like it was actually written by a person.

What is a physics textbook? The core of the subject is the mathematics. Really, if you just listed the basic equations/structures/relations, that's most of the meat.

The reason to have prose is to bring you, the reader, into the state of mind that glues these mathematical models to a vision of the world- to bring multiple parts of your mind in line, and give them all small parts of the picture.

A high school equivalent- you have the maths describing the position and velocity of a ball moving under gravity for the part of you that deals with maths, you have pictures of trajectories for your visual part, you have prose to try to reach whatever other parts of you that it can by getting you to imagine stuff.

I found this textbook fun to read. Considering that it's technical, I find that impressive.
