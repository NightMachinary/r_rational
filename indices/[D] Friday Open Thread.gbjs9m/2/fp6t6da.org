What are your favourite textbooks? Or non-textbook sources of well-structured information about a particular subject?

I've been thinking about [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9LXxgXySTFsnookkw/exercises-in-comprehensive-information-gathering][comprehensive information-gathering exercises]], and reading well-written textbooks covering unfamiliar fields seems like it'd have good return on investment. It's kind of like what schools are trying to do, except they're terrible at it.

There's a [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xg3hXCYQPJkwHyik2/the-best-textbooks-on-every-subject][post]] on LessWrong about best textbooks on any subject, but it's positively ancient (2011).
