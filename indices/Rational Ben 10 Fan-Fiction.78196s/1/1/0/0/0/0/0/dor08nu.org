I was intrigued by your last sentence, so I did some quick research and math. Galvan are apparently roughly 5 inches tall, but otherwise look like they share proportions with humans. Optimistically assuming that they have roughly a tenth of human's volume/mass, that gives them ~7*10^{-3} cubic meters to fill and 7 kg to fill it with. That must be some serious stuff that they are made of if they are the cognitive 99.9999%. I look forward to what you do with it.
