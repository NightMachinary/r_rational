One thing that always concerned me in Ben 10 was that the omnitrix was supposed to contain the DNA of all the species in the galaxy to foster unity or something, but the aliens Ben gets access to are ones that are useful in combat, instead of weak species like humans. Why did he get those combat species (and Greymatter) out of all the species he could have gotten? Why did humans fall on the shallow end of the power pool?
