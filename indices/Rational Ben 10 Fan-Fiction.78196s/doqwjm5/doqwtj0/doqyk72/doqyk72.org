That is a common sci-fi explanation for the importance of humans, but I don't think it is very plausible.

Innovation seems to be a matter of one' s ability to do three things.

1. Cast a wide conceptual net through the space of solutions

2. Filter the pile of ideas for good ones

3. Physically actualize the idea

All of these three seem like they must in some sense be dependent on intelligence, if not track absolutely with it.

If there are millions of intelligent species, and humans are even in the middle of the pack, then there are almost guaranteed to be orders of magnitude differences between the top and us. The only other solution would be to posit that among the enormous number of possible cognitive substrates and neural architectures, everything essentially converges within an order of magnitude or so of 100 IQ. This is all to say, I don't know that you can both have humans possess unremarkable intellect and remarkable talent at problem-solving.
