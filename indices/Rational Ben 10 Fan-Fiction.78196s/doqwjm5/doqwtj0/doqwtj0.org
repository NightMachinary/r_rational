Well in my story what makes humans so special is that they're not special at all. They don't have genius level intelligence, they aren't super strong or super fast. They are the average joes of the universe and their only remarkable trait is their ability to innovate and overcome hardship.

The Omnitrix was built by Azmuth as a tool of peace in an act of repentance following the destruction caused by his previous creation, Ascalon, a weapon of terrible power.

The Omnitrix had a three-fold purpose:

It would promote inter-species understanding by allowing other beings to experience different ways of life.

It would serve as a repository for the DNA of over a million different intelligent species, preserving them in the event that any of them should ever become extinct and bring them back.
