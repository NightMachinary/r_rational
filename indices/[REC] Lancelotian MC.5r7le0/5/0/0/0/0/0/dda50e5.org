No, of course I don't think that every work needs to contain an aro/ace character. And I also don't think that that kind of attitude is anywhere near as common as people seem to think it is. It mainly comes from a few young teenagers, still in the process of establishing their identities and still in the beginning stages of navigating social justice concepts, who try to shoehorn LGBT+ identities into every character they like. For the record, I don't consider that a "pathology" or "deranged." It's just a manifestation of standard kid stuff--essentially trying too hard to earn a place in a community they identify with, combined with the black-and-white thinking of someone who isn't yet equipped to handle a lot of nuance.

The majority of people who advocate for representation are reasonable, and it's frustrating when people dismiss our concerns because they equate us with a few confused teenagers. The "make every character gay" stuff gets a lot of play because people find it funny and spread it around to mock it, but it's really not that popular or influential of a stance, and it shouldn't be the focus of the debate surrounding representation.
