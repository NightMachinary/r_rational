This is exactly it. I self insert as my favourite MCs. There are characters I simply can't self insert into. The demands I listed, describes me or how I want to be; a character I would be able to easily self insert into.

I can read about female MCs, but not when it's for wish fulfillment. I can't self insert into a female MC. I can admire her, and enjoy her story. But my capacity to identify with her is much diminished.
