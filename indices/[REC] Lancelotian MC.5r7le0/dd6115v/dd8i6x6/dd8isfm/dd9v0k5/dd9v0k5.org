As for Identifying with women, I guess the literature we grew up reading matters, ggrowing up in an environment, that made me proud to be born male, and in a fundamentalist christian home( where wives are supposed to be subject to their husbands), I grew up with the belief that men are superior. A belief that's hard to discard, regardless of the truth of that belief, I was made proud to be male. I also grew up reading male MCs. It's quite late and hard to start identifying with female MCs.

I believe in equality more or less though(equal legal consideration for one).
