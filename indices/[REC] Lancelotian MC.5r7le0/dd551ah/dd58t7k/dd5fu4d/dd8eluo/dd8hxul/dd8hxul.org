Can you self-insert as characters who are different from you in other ways besides gender? For example, Draco Malfoy is a wizard and you're not, but you could identify with him. If you can identify with a wizard, why can't you identify with a female character?

I don't think anyone is talking about "censoring" fiction. I'm really confused about where that came from.
