Gotcha. The word for that is not amoral, but /consequentialist./

  Was the payoff negative? or positive?

This is the question whose answer depends on your value system. Different people will assign different values to the same outcome. The same "payoff" is positive for some people, but not others. As a consequentialist, you need (and presumably have) a moral framework for evaluating consequences.

For example, suppose your enemy is in danger and you are deciding whether to save their life. If you save them, the consequence is "your enemy is still alive." Depending on how much you value human life, that could be a positive or a negative outcome in your eyes.
