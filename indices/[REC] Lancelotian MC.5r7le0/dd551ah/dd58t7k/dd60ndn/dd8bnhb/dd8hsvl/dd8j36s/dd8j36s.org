I sure hope I decide not to save my enemy. I wouldn't want to be that "weak". I try to desensitise myself, so that I can make the right decisions, but I've never undertaken or being part of any violent crime before, so I don't know. I do know that the consequence of my enemy being alive, may bring me negative utility unless they have a change of heart.

But if the enemy will die anyway, I suppose it will be much easier to get accustomed to it. Making those decisions, thank having to pull the trigger myself.

I hardly see the rational decision as sparing them.

I believe that sensible individuals should be selfish. Your interests should hold a great deal of importance.

There are times when I would have died for others(people I didn't know personally, but thought will bring more utility to the world than me. I've started to increase my own self worth since then though, due in part to rating my potential utility much higher).
