Seems like I misunderstand or misrepresent my understanding of amorality.

I view amoral as not having a concept of 'good' or 'evil', the way conventional morality has.

For example strong A.I will be amoral, yet capable of rational decision making.

Something similar to that, only with emotions.

My morality is this: "right" actions give a positive payoff.

"wrong" actions give a negative payoff.

The rightness or wrongness of an action isn't how rational it is, but how consequential it is.

Was the payoff negative? or positive?
