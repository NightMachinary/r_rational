That's not what amorality is. If your dream MC is utilitarian, he's not amoral. He has an unconventional moral framework, but he /does/ have one.

It's impossible to take "logical, rational" actions unless you have such a framework--you need to have specific values you're trying to achieve. For example, it's only "rational" to kill one person to save fifty if saving those fifty people advances your values in some way. Without that context, it's a totally arbitrary decision.
