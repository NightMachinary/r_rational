I'm a computer science student, 3rd year.

I did operations research last semester.

Became atheist second year, and became a rationalist, after accidentally stumbling upon rational wiki.

I've been trying to cultivate my own rationality since then.

Bayesian Decision making is something we do in Operations research, I decided to apply it to life.
