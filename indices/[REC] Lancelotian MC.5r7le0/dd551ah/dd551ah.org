  MC is male. For story with multiple MCs, at least one of them should match listed criteria.

Why? The rest seems to follow similar themes.

#+begin_quote
  MC is amoral. MC doesn't believe in good and evil, and does not abide to conventional morality.
#+end_quote

A lot of the MC's around here have decided that at least seeming to abide by conventional morality is useful. You don't often see protagonists completely ignoring conventional morality, if only for the reason that having a track record of adhering to conventional morality is a /very/ good thing.

Outside of that, you often see them adhering to unconventional moral frameworks. It's important to note that that does /not/ make them amoral in any way. We probably want to avoid words like "amoral". We want to avoid that as a group in general, and any appearance of evil should be the cartoon villain level.
