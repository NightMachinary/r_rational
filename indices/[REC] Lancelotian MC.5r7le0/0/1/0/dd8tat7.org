Agreed! But Tailsteak says somewhere in one of his early strips that he planned right from the start to make Leftover Soup exactly 1,000 pages long. To reinforce this, he mentioned that he would be finishing Leftover Soup in 2017 back in December when he was around strip #950. His reason for doing so is because he wanted to tell a story with a beginning, middle, and end unlike most webcomics which only have a beginning, middle, and just continues on forever without any ending.
