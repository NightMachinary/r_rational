The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Nothing][Prince of Nothing]] series sound right up your alley. It's a very complex series for me to try to describe, but the main character Kellhus fits your requirements almost perfectly. The only catch is that we learn very little about his inner thoughts despite following him for so much of the book and readers are left to decide on their own whether or not he's evil or amoral. Some people find the book boring due to the extensive world-building. I highly recommend reading the reviews on [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010MEPN14/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1][Amazon]] or some other site before deciding to read the book. It's fairly easy to find free copies of the first book online, but the rest of the series you might have to buy. Try bookzz.org if you have very little money to spend.

The [[http://crystal.raelifin.com/about/][Crystal Society]] is about an artificial intelligence named Face who sounds more feminine than masculine, but there is so much social manipulation in her every thoughts and action that I think you'll like reading about her any way due to how her single desire is to be *known* by every human and she only (barely) follows conventional human morality publicly to look 'benevolent' to humans because fame is better than infamy. The first book is free online, but you will have to buy the second one and the third one is coming out roughly in December.

[[http://www.hpmor.com/][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] features a version of Harry who is considered to be /intensely/ moral by many people on this subreddit due to his idealistic desire to want everyone to never ever die, including people considered to be evil. This moral conflict between him and the rest of wizarding society who thinks Death is "The next great adventure" is a major part of the story albeit not all of it. There's a /lot/ going on throughout. Since you sound like you like moral conflicts, I suspect you'll enjoy Harry. It's free online.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender's_Game][Ender's Game]] is a classic which you probably heard of before so I won't get into it too much. I'll just point out that Ender is considered by the subreddit one of the few examples of an genuinely intelligent characters in popular literature where we actually can learn good habits of thinking rather than a "genius" character who we are told rather than shown to be smart. I'll be stunned if free copies of this book can't be found somewhere online with some googling.

[[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][Worm]] a whopping monster at /2 million/ words long and all entirely free online. Features a female superhero who constantly finds herself making horrible decisions in her pursuit to be a hero. Fans often comment on her doing "the wrong things for the right reasons". Taylor is exceptionally cunning, pragmatic, and clever as a [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level3intelligent][Third Level Character]]. She's female, but her gender is such a minor aspect of the story that I rarely noticed or thought about it.

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Blindsight][Blindsight]] is an amazing book about people with very unusual ways of thinking and bizarre moralities along with aliens who genially feel like they are aliens rather than Star Trek aliens who are humans painted a different color. I can't write a summary good enough to do this book justice, but the TV Tropes link is very informative and will bring you to a free online copy of the book.

There are a lot of good rational fiction on [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic][TV Tropes]] I would recommend for hours of pleasurable reading, but there aren't any other fiction I can think of on that page which fulfills your main amoral requirement.

PS What does 'lancelotian' mean? I tried looking it up, but google doesn't tell me the meaning. I'm guessing something to do with amoral and probably a historical connection to Lancelot somehow. Or is it just a word you made up to identify characters similar to Lancelot?

EDIT: Looking at your post again, I think you are very heavily influenced by characterizations of the heroes in xianxia novels. The genre as a whole is considered by this subreddit to be very stagnant as mentioned by the top comment on this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4ab3xk/recommendations_xianxia_is_a_good_genre_and_you/][post]]. [[https://friendshipispower.wordpress.com/about/][Forty Millenniums of Cultivation]] is the rare exception which is liked by this subreddit. I think you have been reading so much of xianxia that you are desperate for something different, but are so used to reading stories from that genre that you haven't considered trying other types of stories. The only reason for my thoughts about you is because we had some people come to this subreddit from [[/r/noveltranslations]] asking for recommendations before and they made very similar requests to you.

EDIT 2: I just realized that while I was recommending books, there were two comics I would recommend as well.

[[http://www.leftoversoup.com/][Leftover Soup]] is a comic at only 970 pages with the author saying that he will be finishing it at exactly 1,000 pages. So it's not as long as you wanted, but the characters constantly discuss deep, thought provoking topics many of which are very easy to to get into arguments over (for pete's sake, the first page involves a rape joke!). They also often end up discussing whether or not a given horrible action is required due to one's moral philosophy/religion, so I think you'll like it despite the near total lack of any of your requirements.

[[http://freefall.purrsia.com/][Freefall]] is another comic which doesn't fulfill any of your requirements, but it's a very lengthy comic (several thousand strips) which examines the implications of alien and artificial minds which are similar to human minds, but are nonetheless different enough to make coexistence difficult.
