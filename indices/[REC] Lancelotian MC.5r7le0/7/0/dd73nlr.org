First. Not about fiction at all, but read some [[http://www.slatestarcodex.com][www.slatestarcodex.com]], particularly [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/][his article on Moloch]]. Wrong though that blog sometimes is, it is a thing to cherish. If you like it, read on.

So, there's a comment above which says "you don't belong here." I'm going to put my foot in it. They are both completely wrong and also accurate. Culturally, you're a poor fit, your expressed desires and viewpoints too vulgar and unrefined. But you're probably a dozen times more like the average lesswrong member than that average member was before reading Yudkowsky, and for good or ill lesswrong and Yudkowsky are/were the backbone of this community. This place absolutely has what you want and that is in no way limited to being a source of fiction.

You say you came here from [[/r/noveltranslations]]. The typical light novel is, well, pretty fucking low IQ, and that's coming from somebody that has a great deal of contempt for the fetish people around here have for the term IQ. The [[/r/rational]] sub is ostensibly focussed on "rational" fiction, but in fact it is a hub for the LessWrong exodus's Rationality community. People here care first and formost about ideals, ideas, how to live in the real world, and discussion around that. [[/r/rational]] is the sub that aggregates Rational fiction for these people due to the historical accident of Yudkowsky's magnum opus proselytizing peice being a "rational" fiction work, making such fiction an interest in its own right for these people. But if you come in only caring about fiction and talking as though that matters and you're ignorant of local rules and customs and cultural viewpoints and values, you might get told you're in the wrong place.

You're not in the wrong place, but you have an amazing experience of growing and learning ahead of you (I imagine anyway, from what you've said, that you'll like what you found around these parts, and many, myself excluded, have found the LessWrong and related material profound and life-changing.)

So, you should read [[http://www.lesswrong.com][www.lesswrong.com]] 's Sequences. You should read [[http://www.slatestarcodex.com][www.slatestarcodex.com]] . You should take a peak at [[/r/slatestarcodex]] . See if these seem to be things you'll value. If they do, welcome to the community.
