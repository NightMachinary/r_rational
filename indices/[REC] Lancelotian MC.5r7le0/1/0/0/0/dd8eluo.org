I self insert myself sometimes as characters. I can't do that to female protagonists. Not sure what you mean by edgy, I'm not yet done with HPMOR, but Quirrel is kind of my favourite character. Followed by Draco Malfoy. I couldn't connect with Harry, because of his morality. His conceptions and belief in good and evil seem naive to me.

I myself am not moral, I'm not quite amoral, but how I described my MC is a projection of how I am or want myself to be.

What I want to read about is someone who represents my ideal.

I don't see why you should censor fiction.
