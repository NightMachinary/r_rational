You were talking about characters that are not quite right for this subreddit.

I can't identify with female characters. No that's wrong, my capacity for identifying with female characters is severely limited. There are reasons for this, I've not bothered finding out all of them. I don't see it as a problem.

I can read and enjoy stories with female characters, but identifying with them is difficult.

I'll probably, no definitely enjoy a female MC who meets all my requirements, but I won't be able to self insert. The recommendation wouldn't let me enjoy my fantasy of being who I want to be.

I'm not a misogynist, but suffice it to say, that I'd never choose to be born a female(no matter how advantageous the female(unless my exploits as one would benefit my next male reincarnation), if I reincarnated as one, I'd kill myself so I can reincarnate again.

Call me a male supremacist if you like.
