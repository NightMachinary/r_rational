Um...okay, I don't know why you felt the need to volunteer the information that you'd kill yourself if you had a female body, but whatever. Personally I think gender is a totally arbitrary barrier to identification with a character, but I can't really argue /your/ preferences.

That wasn't me, and in any case saying an archetype doesn't appeal /to this subreddit/ has nothing to do with censoring fiction. The people in this sub who do not like edgy characters are not proposing to go out and erase them from other people's stories.
