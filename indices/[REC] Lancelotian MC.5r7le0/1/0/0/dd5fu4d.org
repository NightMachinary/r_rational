Your original post sounds like you are asking for an "edgy" protagonist... I think on [[/r/rational]] we look down on edginess for its own sake^{note} , although many of works we like can get pretty dark and many have... goal-driven protagonists. Worm is a great choice, although the protagonist is female (not sure why you had a constraint in gender) and has serious self esteem issues, she also kicks ass, is very ruthless, and has extremely strong convictions that drive her to take down foes way stronger than her. The Metropolitan Man sounds like exactly what you are liking for, Lex Luthor operating in a paranoid and efficient manner to fulfill an arguably good goal through amoral means.

^{Note:} that said, Quirrel in HPMOR was super edgy and it took forever for some people to figure out he wasn't meant as a role model, and a lot of people still think he is cool. I think the pushback after realizing about Quirrel may have made [[/r/rational]] more sensitive to the kind of edginess you are asking for.
