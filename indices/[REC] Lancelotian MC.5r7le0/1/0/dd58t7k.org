I don't know what less wronger means.

Amoral: doesn't make you evil.

I want an MC who is amoral. They will not hesitate to take "evil" actions for a rational goal.

I mentioned, that I'm okay with genocide if it's a rational decision.

AN MC who pretends to be moral is all-right; I do that too. It doesn't change the fact that I'm amoral, I obey laws and haven't committed any violent crime, or ever been prosecuted for criminal charges.

But at heart, the MC should be amoral.

In our world to day, obeying laws has been highly beneficial so I do it.

Amorality isn't evil, it's neutral.

If I can save someone, I might if and only if the cost(resources expended, hostility gained, etc) is far less than the potential benefit(person saved will repay me, I'll gain favour of them or others).

If there is absolutely no benefit, or it's negligible, I'll abandon them even if it'll cost nothing.(UNlikely, because even popularity from saving is a benefit.)

tl;DR Amorality, is the most important character requirement.

I don't want an MC who's shackjled by morality. Hecommits crimes, if it's a rational choice.

I've never killed before, but if I were in a situation in which it was the logical, rational thing to do, will I? Yes, and I won't be bothered by it.

That's what I want from an MC.

MCs who kill for non logical reasons, are not my cup of tea. In fact, I'm slightly repulsed by them.
