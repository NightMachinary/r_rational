Yes. A positive outcome is one that bring a positive payoff to one's self.

I believe altruism is irrational, I believe selfishness is right.

My "moral" framework, is: "good"; anything that benefits me. "bad" anything that confers a negative payoff.

Empathy is absent from my framework, and the framework of the character I seek.
