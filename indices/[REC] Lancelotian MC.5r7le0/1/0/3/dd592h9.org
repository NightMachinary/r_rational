What does less wronger mean.

I believe that a false negative does not hurt, but a false positive does, or hurts much less.(i.e a decision rejected as bad but which was in fact good, is better than a decision accepted as good but was bad. Even if payoff of was better).

Minimise risks, after maximise profits?

I don't believe in terms like good and evil.

"Wrong" is something that has a negative payoff.

"Right" is something that has a positive payoff
