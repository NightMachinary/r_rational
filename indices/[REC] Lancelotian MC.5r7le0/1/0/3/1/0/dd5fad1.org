Just to chime in, i went to a Mathematical Psychology conference and it felt like 1 out of 3 presentations/talks/posters had the word Bayesian in the title and everyone used the word at some point or another. Bayesian approaches were used both for statistically analyzing raw data, and as an underlying model of various cognitive data. So the word actually is really common in certain fields.
