Edgy is slang for a particular type of over-the-top, trying-too-hard style grimness. Generally the connotation is that whoever designed the character is trying too hard, overused cliche tropes, doesn't really grasp/empathize with how their character would play out in reality, etc. Like if a character cries tears of blood while meditating on slaughtering their enemies who tortured their parents in front of them when they were a kid. If this same character has a katana that they bisect their enemies with and an ability that grants them immense power over darkness and shadow but drives them into a blood rage. Any one of these elements might be okay on their own. Altogether at once, they might be okay if they were played for black-comedy or parody. They might even work if they were gradually introduced and made sense in the plot in an overall well written story. But thrown in all at once, played seriously, they are too much. It gets completely ridiculous if the character is an OC (original character) and/or SI (self insert). So yeah, what you were asking for with "pride" and "amorality" and character I can empathize with via inserting myself into their (awesome) role trigger a lot of the warning signs of an over the top "edgy" character.
