Just for clarification: Asking that uncommon demographics be respectfully represented in fiction (instead of ignored entirely, or represented only as objects of ridicule) isn't about being unable to identify with other types of characters.

The issue is that our mental model of human society is heavily influenced by fiction. For, say, a gay person to see gay characters represented in fiction as people worthy of basic respect is validating to their identity. Conversely, to see an absence of gay characters gives the impression that they're weird, uniquely broken people unworthy of a place in society (this is particularly damaging to young people still coming to grips with their identity).

I have a personal experience with this. As an aromantic asexual person, I /never/ came across characters who were like me while I was growing up, except in the form of heartless, sociopathic villains. I wasn't even aware that that was a way "real" people could be. It took me a long time to accept that I genuinely lacked romantic and sexual attraction, and even longer to stop thinking of it as something wrong with me. I believe that seeing respectful depictions of aromantic and/or asexual characters in fiction would have helped me accept myself much earlier, and saved me a lot of heartache.

Just as importantly, respectful representation also affects how the rest of society thinks of your demographic. If you're a gay person surrounded by people who never see gay characters in fiction, or see them depicted only as perverts, that will affect the way they treat you. I believe that the increasing amount of positive representation of LGBT+ characters has done enormous good in shifting perceptions of LGBT+ people, in a feedback loop that then further encourages representation. I've watched my own mother's opinion of trans people change dramatically just over the course of a single TV show centered on trans characters.
