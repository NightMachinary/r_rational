That criticism is essentially about taking that reasonable point, and turning it into a pathology. Seeing some aromantic, asexual characters would have been beneficial. But I'm going to guess that you don't think /every/ character, or even every work /must/ have or contain that sort of character. Would you think it was reasonable to demand that some author change an existing character to fit your specifications, or would that strike you as deranged arrogance?
