There's a common criticism of SJWs regarding fiction. It generally goes something like "The inability to identify with characters who don't match the reader's exact demographics betrays a failure of empathy and conceptual ability". I suspect we're seeing the wild version of that trait, without the ideological framework. Or a more charitable possibility, as [[/u/hoja_nasredin]] suggested, a misfiring heuristic to avoid anvil-dropping.

I also suspect that people asking for female MCs would be more likely to ask in a more women-oriented/dominated venue. I see them occasionally in [[/r/fantasy]], for example, and I'd be shocked if there weren't /TwoXFiction type subs.
