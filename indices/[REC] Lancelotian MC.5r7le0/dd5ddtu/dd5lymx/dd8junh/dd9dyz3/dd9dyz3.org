Have you ever felt pushed around by society, like the system is trying to screw you? Have you ever wished the protagonist of stories, the ones that are too good to kill their enemies, would at least maim them badly enough to stop them from coming back? Do you like stories where the main character fights and scrapes and struggles for every advantage and eventually takes down her enemies hard?

If you answered yes to at least two of those questions, I would strongly recommend [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][Worm]]. Sure you think you can't derive wish fulfillment from a female MC, but I think this story might be enough to change your mind. The first couple of chapters with all the bullying shit can be painful to read, but it makes the MCs development into a ruthless badass that much more satisfying.*

*To other people that read worm... yeah I am playing up the aspects I think Dragon-God would like, I know the story is more nuanced and has a subtler message, but on my first read through I was mostly just enjoying Taylor's raw tenacity.
