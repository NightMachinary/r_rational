He did confirm that to be the case, but that's something that never made sense to me. There are so many points of divergence between a reader and a fictional person, of which gender is only one. Why should specifically gender be a deal-breaker with respect to the reader's ability to identify with the character? I'm a woman and there are certainly male characters I identify with.
