Oooh. I did not believe that was possible. I know there are people who are male supremacist(speaking as one who may be considered one), but... I certainly did not expect that from them.

While women may tend to be more emotional(or is the whole left brained thing a myth they told us in school?) that does not mean there cannot be more rational. He would have been more nah forget it. I can't find something redeeming about it.

Suffice it to say, that stereotyping an enter demographic is about the most irrational, unscientifc, asinine, inane fatuous thing I've ever seen somebody do. I really hate stereotypes(in real life, they are somewhat tolerable in fiction).

The irony, is that that statement is irrational, and should be contradicted by empirical evidence(i don't know any real person but several fictional characters. However, I'm pretty sure there are women who are quite rational).
