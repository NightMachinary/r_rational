So the idea is: we pick a book, as many people as possible read it and then discuss it in details on 14th (and then pick a new book)? I'm... not sure it will fly. But trying definitely won't hurt XD

One book may be too little tho, for example, people who don't like the genre of the proposed book would feel left off.
