Yeah, you got the idea right! My proposal this month is fanfiction because it's shorter and there's less time until the 14th, but I'd expect future books to be of the 100k-150k word sort of length.

Yeah, there's definitely some genres that I'm not a fan of. If that happened to me and the book was available for free/cheap, I'd probably give it an honest try and see if I liked it; but if it was 10 USD the excerpt would have to be very good for me to buy it. But if I didn't like it I could always wait for the next month - I don't know how we'd choose stories but I'd want to make sure there was a lot of variety (so you wouldn't do two hard sci-fi stories in a row, I'd also personally love to see stories that people might not be familiar with - so no Speaker for the Dead or the Martian). Hopefully that would help.

More generally I think it would be great to try and locate books written by a diverse group of people - e.g. it'd be great to see what a sci fi author from Paraguay thinks aliens might look like if there's an English translation of their works on Amazon. There's a couple of Australian sci fi YA novels I read in high school that aren't really Rational and definitely not available on Kindle but might be more interesting to the general population of this sub just because they're written from a different viewpoint.

But I'm not a great aficionado of fiction (part of my goal in this Book Club thing is to expand my own horizons in that regard!), so it'd be leaning heavily on other peoples' recommendations.

I think if we do more than one book people might not have time to read it in time (since I assume most people would do this in addition to what they'd read anyway, and wouldn't want their full month of reading to be set by 4 books), and I think it would also dilute discussion in the thread since if people had a choice of three books, most would only read one or two, so part of the point ("everyone has read the book recently") wouldn't apply.

But in the end the answer to all your comments is to try it and see what happens.
