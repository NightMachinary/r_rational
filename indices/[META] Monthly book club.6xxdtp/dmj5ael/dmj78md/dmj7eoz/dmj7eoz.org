Sure is, figure it's a good one to discuss as a result, and perhaps people who have been meaning to read it can get around to it.

I don't really intend for this to be a way to get more eyeballs on obscure stories, more a way to have people discuss a "big" story in an environment where they know that other people have read it recently.

(EDIT: actually thinking about it, obscure stories might be a great idea. We'll see. Probably a mix of Top 10 and obscure ones?)
