So I was thinking the "Friendship is Optimal: Caelem Est Conterrens" story might be a good fit: it's relatively short (57k words) and has a lot of transhumanism/identity stuff that I think would be of interest to people here. Then again, it's also got ponies, which may not be a popular choice. (The story is set in the modern world where there is an MMORPG about ponies that ultimately results in transhumanism: it is not set in a world where ponies are "real").
