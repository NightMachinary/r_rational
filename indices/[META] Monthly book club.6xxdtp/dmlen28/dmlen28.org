Does it have to be a work of fiction?

Considering the entire sub is already focused on stories, how about introducing non-fiction books? I am thinking of more rationalists-oriented literature, like e.g. /Thinking, Fast and Slow/ or /Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions/.

It'll be nice to find new useful books and talk about them. Kind of like [[https://www.reddit.com/r/BettermentBookClub/][Betterment Book Club]], except with a different focus and community.

But either way I do like this.
