Well, far be it from me of all people to advocate caring what strangers think of you without some higher purpose, but for the future remember that unless you plan on moving to another state/country soon, you might be surprised at how often you cross paths again with people from university within your field. If you get a reputation for slapping away hands of friendship, even if you don't see it that way, it can be detrimental in unexpected ways.
