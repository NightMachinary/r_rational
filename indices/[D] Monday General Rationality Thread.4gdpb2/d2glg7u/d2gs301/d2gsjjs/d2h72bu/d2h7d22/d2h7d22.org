  I'm surprised you even bothered to engage in that conversation.

Well, I was specifically called out, so I felt that I was expected to respond, and would lose prestige for not doing so. Also, I wanted to explain my reasoning.

  Did you expect anything else? Or were you just outrage trolling?

Even at this advanced age, I still vaguely remember receiving lectures about "peer pressure" in high-school health class, and expect other people to have received similar lectures in similar classes--so I was expecting them to leave me alone after only one or two entreaties, lest they lose prestige for engaging in a frowned-upon behavior.
