I think that you eventually get to know the people that you consistently interact with online, enough that you start to build up a mental model of them. RES shows that I've given [[/u/eaturbrainz]] something like 500 upvotes, which means that I've read at least that many comments he's made. Some random person having a child isn't worthy of note; it happens all the time and takes no special skills or effort. But if [[/u/eaturbrainz]] announced that he was doing something that's big-picture banal, like getting married or having a child, I would probably still find that interesting, both because it would mean updating my mental model of him and because I would instantly be able to picture it more vividly than for some random stranger.

(I believe this is one of the big reasons that fanfic is as popular as it is; once you've watched dozens of hours of a character on TV, you have a concrete visual of them and care more about what happens to them. A story about two students at magic school falling in love is typically less compelling than if those two students are Hermione and Draco.)

For what it's worth, I tend to share off-topic things here mostly because this is the internet community that I'm most active in, and consider a lot of the people who post here internet friends, or at least acquaintances. (But I do try to confine that stuff to the Off-Topic thread, because it's admittedly banal and definitely off-topic.)
