I completely agree with everything you said. I personally would acted as you mentioned, remain silent or make an excuse. This was an exercise to format ToaKraka's message into a less hostile tone while remaining true to the original and to cut off any attempts of persuasion.

ToaKraka had mentioned that he wanted to speak up since he usual held back, so silence was out of the question. I also assume from his messages that he did not want to lie, so saying something like, "Sorry, I'm busy," wasn't on the table either. Even, "sorry," seemed like it'd be lying since he apparently wasn't from his choice of words, therefore, I intentionally avoided using it to remain as honest as possible.

It don't like it either and would never say it unless I was seriously annoyed. It was included as a preventative measure assuming they would try to pressure him regardless of his response. The overly formal tone, would have been a clear indication that he was serious about not wanting to go and they should not try to persuade him.

Ending the message on a lighthearted tone would help diffuse the tension from that previous statement and help convey to the recipients that he means no offense while finalizing his opinion on the invite.
