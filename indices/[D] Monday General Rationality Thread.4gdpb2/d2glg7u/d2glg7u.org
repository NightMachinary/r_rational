I had [[http://i.imgur.com/XqSk7fP.png][a very entertaining conversation]] (images mentioned: [[http://i.imgur.com/8JurE9R.png][1]] [[http://i.imgur.com/ZYCyNuV.gif][2]]) on Friday evening, when several schoolmates for unknown reasons pushed me to attend a party to celebrate our impending graduation, and I pushed back. I probably shouldn't have bothered to make any response at all--but, after four years of near-silence toward these people, I was just /itching/ to speak my mind, at least once...

If any bridges were burned (ha! he says that as if he thinks any existed in the first place!)--(shrugs) well, I can't say that I care /too/ much about the opinions of three dozen people with whom I probably never will interact after the end of this week. Heck, maybe some of the dozens of people who didn't actively participate in this exchange actually /agreed/ with me, and were attending the party under similar duress! After all, isn't "reclusive nerd" rather than "partying jock" the /proper/ stereotype of the engineering student? (On the other hand, though, from my [limited] observation of my classmates, I can't think of any people who have a high chance of fitting the "reclusive nerd" description. Indeed, /two/ of my four groupmates in the senior design project mentioned at the top of the email chain engaged in enough weightlifting to have developed bulging muscles!)

Really, though, I think my responses were reasonably level-headed. /My interlocutors/ were the ones who insisted on continuing to pressure me, and my rebuttals to their challenges were perfectly relevant. Feel free, however, to prove me wrong.

--------------

This incident, by the way, recalls to my mind a challenge against which I didn't bother to mount a defense. Some months ago, the esteemed [[/u/eaglejarl][u/eaglejarl]] made [[http://archive.is/Fpcv6][this reply]] to me when I described myself as "just an ordinary student in civil engineering":

#+begin_quote
  (a) You're an engineer. (b) You hang out on [[/r/rational]]. You're not an 'ordinary' anything; be proud of that.
#+end_quote

I guess that, at the time, I didn't care enough to argue (or even to downvote the comment)--but I certainly didn't forget about it.

/Is being an engineer worthy of pride?/ Well, in the first place, I'm only a /student/ in engineering, while I'd count as an "engineer" only a person /actively researching/working/ in an engineering field. In the second place, even if I /were/ an engineer, I really don't consider obeying well-defined guidelines and conducting simple mathematics (or maybe typing numbers into a program) to be significantly more praiseworthy than most other occupations. "Engineering judgement", phooey!

/Is being a frequenter of [[/r/rational][r/rational]] worthy of pride?/ In the first place, being a /writer/ of books or articles (fiction or nonfiction, rational or nonrational) is worthy of pride, sure--but merely /reading/ such works most certainly is not. In the second place, being "rational" obviously is worthy of pride--but to assume that frequenting [[/r/rational][r/rational]], or even disproportionately reading "rational" books, implies rationality is, in my opinion, a /totally/-unwarranted leap. I've read and greatly enjoyed /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/662][Atlas Shrugged]]/, /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/271][Black Beauty]]/, and /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/ several times each--but that /by no means/ implies that I'm interested in pushing objectivism, animal rights, or polyamory.

And, as long as I'm being an uppity ingrate toward my betters, I might as well go all-out:

The subtle art of attention-grabbing! How much is resting on your laurels, and how much is introducing new material? For example:\\
- The esteemed [[/u/alexanderwales][u/alexanderwales]] recently has raked in the +moolah+ useless Internet points for posting on topics as banal as [[http://archive.is/b44Zx][a newly-born child]] and [[http://archive.is/lUeXL][a recently-burned hand]]. Why did people choose to give upvotes to these comments? Did they do so in order to encourage more writing from the commenter by making him happier? (I'll admit that I almost upvoted them just for this reason.) Were they /actually interested/ in the topics that he presented? (I guess there /are/ rather a few people subscribed to [[/r/upliftingnews][r/upliftingnews]]--but [[/r/gore][r/gore]] has been quarantined, so I can't see its subscriber count.) Or--cue [[https://youtu.be/admQ2Ideh0M][sinister music]]--did they upvote on reflex these comments merely because they were made by a highly-regarded writer?\\
- (insert [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophasis][cute rhetorical device]] here)

Yes, this section of this comment obviously is +partly+ largely born of [[http://archive.is/dHqFQ][resentment]]--but, on the other side of the coin, I /genuinely do not see/ why /photographs of sloughing skin/ should receive so much karma. I find it unlikely that the overlap in subscribers between [[/r/rational][r/rational]] and [[/r/spacedicks][r/spacedicks]] is /that/ large.
