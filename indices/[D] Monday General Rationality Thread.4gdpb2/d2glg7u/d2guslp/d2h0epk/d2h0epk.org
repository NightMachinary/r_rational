    I can't think of any people who have a high chance of fitting the "reclusive nerd" description [..] two of my four groupmates [..] engaged in enough weightlifting to have developed bulging muscles!)

  How does one's physical fitness define whether they are (not) a reclusive person, a nerd, or both?

I wonder how much something like physical fitness or athleticism covaries with generalized traits like "intelligence" or "charisma" or "willpower", and if the patterns of association are consistent across countries and cultures. I think stereotypes in the U.S. invoke a sort of "game-y" model of physical/mental ability, where you have a finite pool of points that you can distribute (e.g. through hard work and effort, which may be regarded as limited resources if for no other reason than the finitude of time) or that are distributed for you (e.g. through particular sorts of pleiotropy or exposure to different environments during development or w/e. And while I've not looked into it at any depth, I've heard mental disorders like Asperger's can make people both more analytical and socially inept). And so someone who is very smart will necessarily be awkward and weak; conversely, a hot, muscular jock is usually assumed to be dumb.

However, my personal impression (colored though it is by stuff like halo effects, confirmation bias, and sampling bias) is that these traits more often covary positively, and that, say, the smartest people I meet tend to be more athletic and attractive and charming than you might expect given no or an inverse association, or that the strongest people at the gym seem to have a more "intellectually impressive" occupation, and so on. This, in turn, would be expected if there are a lot of positive feedback loops in play (e.g. you're smart, so you can train your body or social skills or w/e more effectively. Or you're very diligent, so you can study and work harder, or resist harmful temptations better and be healthier overall. Or you're really attractive, so you have more self-confidence and can more easily pursue your goals).

What are all y'all's thoughts? I'm sure someone out there's looked into this more formally, so is anyone familiar with whatever relevant lit's been produced?
