Being healthy has several well noted positive effects on energy levels and amount of work done. It also as noted invokes the halo effect about you, meaning the cultivating a healthy appearance is a good way to achieve more positive interactions. Plus it makes people live longer. The game model of physical vs mental has several problems, not least that a properly optimised gym goer can look pretty damn fit with only a few hours of effort a week, and it is entirely possible to trick your brain into finding the gym or other exercise types enjoyable. Or just be lucky and find an exercise type that you find enjoyable by default.

To put it more simply, being physically fit is a good idea in most cases. Since in theory more smart people should come to correct conclusions than not smart people, I would expect fitness to at least weakly correlate with intelligence.

A quick google to test my theory and yes, [[http://psychcentral.com/news/2009/12/03/link-between-physical-fitness-and-iq/9914.html][The study shows a clear link between good physical fitness and better results for the IQ test.]]
