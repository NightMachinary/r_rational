Ok So the stroop test is a measure of reaction time.

The meta analysis states there was only a very small positive effect, and it's not clear what kinds of cognitive tests they were looking at.

Also it would be a bit hasty to draw conclusions about it making you smarter from the study that looked at brain blood flow. It's not like we have the knowledge of neurology to identify intelligence with just a brain scan (other than being able to see obvious damage)

Overall based on the information I can see in the abstracts that isn't behind a paywall. It would seem that the cognitive benefits to exercise are small and limited to what you would expect from a stimulant like caffeine. Yes it may prevent cognitive decline in old age and increase reaction time and concentration a bit, but still no evidence it would provide much actual boost to say a iq test.
