Well, empirically, there's a pretty good correlation between "physical attractiveness" and intelligence - in the studies I've seen, r is usually around 0.4, a finding that continues to hold when the subjects being rated are young enough to not be affected (very much) by the causal chains you suspect.

Geoffrey Miller, in The Mating Mind, suggests that the main cause may be that because people +combine genes on the basis of associative sorting WRT the sum of physical and mental attractiveness+ care about both looks and smarts, you get inter-generational reinforcement of the correlation between the two.

That is, the (physically) attractive get to pick the partner which they like the most - which tends to be because they are smart and/or hot - and so you end up with children who grow up to be hot AND smart (or hot/hot, or smart/smart) - within the confines of the heritability of these traits.

I'm not very good at pushing symbols around, but my intuition of the relevant math says that this would work as the primary cause of the world we see (where r(IQ parents - IQ child) = 0.75 and r(hot - smart) = 0.4) so long as mental and physical sharpness are roughly equal in importance and the sorting effect in human matchmaking is pretty strong.

The other effects, like hot people being judged as more competent, and so getting hired for harder jobs, are also true.
