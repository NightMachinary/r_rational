  even you, ToaKraka

Without any additional context I'd thought this wording was rather rude just by itself --- like they're deigning to invite /even/ you to their party, lol. Your then unnecessary complication of the conversation made me think that they may be used to similar shenanigans from you by now, and if so then it may've been an inside joke aimed at that (in which case you yourself may or may not have been part of that particular in-group depending on your attitude towards the situation).

Regarding the issue in general, what was the point of generating walls-of-text at a simple party request? If you wanted to explain your unwillingness to participate, one simple paragraph would've sufficed. If you wanted to show you were smarter than that --- again, what's the point? It's just one of those situations in which the more you complicate things the more /you/ start looking like the negative side.

  I can't think of any people who have a high chance of fitting the "reclusive nerd" description [..] two of my four groupmates [..] engaged in enough weightlifting to have developed bulging muscles!)

  The esteemed [[/u/alexanderwales][u/alexanderwales]] recently has raked in the useless Internet points for posting on topics as banal as a newly-born child and a recently-burned hand.

I don't think it's about points, but rather about sharing some life experience in the relevant subsection of the community (Off-Topic Threads, duh). I usually upvote such userposts if I find them interesting (though him being an interesting author to me is also a factor making his posts interesting in general, yes) and ignore otherwise.
