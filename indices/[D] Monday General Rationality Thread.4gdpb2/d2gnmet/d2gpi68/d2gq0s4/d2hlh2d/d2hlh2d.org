  There's plenty of other content that's crap or off-topic or both. Inconsistently enforced rules are pretty awful.

'Crap' content that is on-topic is a matter for downvotes, not mods - that way lies totalitarianism (with the Three on top, ofc).

I'm not going to reply to everything, but it's worth noting that anyone can report posts or comments they think are inappropriate or off-topic. We do take this seriously! Personally I tend to leave posts I'm not sure about, /unless/ they've been reported.

Also that standards and rules do change slowly over time, depending on the current problem - for example, the 'no brainstorming' rule was created after a plague of such posts.
