In that case, I suggest not using a license!

Most of the rights you claim here are already granted by law, so the main problem is overeager prosecution. In this case, something like the following (not legal language):

#+begin_quote
  (c) $me, $year, all rights reserved.

  To protect users of this work, I pledge not to allow prosecution of reasonable non-commercial use for any reason. I further grant permission to make and distribute transformative works (not exact copies or very similar works) under the CC-BY-NC-SA license. This work will fall under the CC0 License on $date.
#+end_quote

Or something, you should probably get a lawyer to draft it for you.
