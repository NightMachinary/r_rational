Parties or large-gatherings-with-loud-music are really boring for me too, and I duck out of them whenever possible unless there's a compelling reason to go.

Hell even going to restaurants that are too loud for conversation irks me enough that my friend group knows about my aversion, and since I also don't drink alcohol the few times I've agreed to go to bars with them have left me mostly just hoping everyone would be done soon. I'd say you made the right decision not to go.

That said, while your responses were definitely level-headed, they also had the tone/feel of antagonism to them. Maybe that's a subjective thing, but if this is something that's been building up and finally released, it makes sense that you'd be a bit more acerbic than you might otherwise be. Maybe in the future remind yourself that such people, whether they be classmates or coworkers, having a lack of understanding for your perspective doesn't automatically make them malicious in their insistence, and stick to straightforward points: "I don't really like parties or drinking, thanks anyway." Maybe offer to grab a pizza slice instead sometime if they keep asking why not, if you prefer that.

Of course, I said all that while missing the years of context that your interactions with these people have provided you, so maybe they've often been snide and mealymouthed about your "otherness" before, in which case this kind of send-off is probably more deserved, if no less constructive. If it got some weight off your mind though, no real harm done.
