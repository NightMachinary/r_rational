There was a time in my life where I could have written the emails you did. Some assorted advice I would have given myself in your situation:

- You wouldn't have enjoyed that party, at all.

- Find people that you can be unguarded and relaxed around, and whose company is easy to enjoy.

- Parties can be enjoyable if there are people there whose company you enjoy.

- It's not a lot of fun to be sober while others are drinking, or to drink while others are sober. Accordingly, it's useful to partition parties into drinking and not drinking and only attend if you're aligned.

- Alcohol is a social technology. It's easy as a nerd to underestimate the value of social experiences and community. I've gotten good mileage out of a deliberate decision to drink only socially, approximately once a month. This would have been a surprise to my younger self.
