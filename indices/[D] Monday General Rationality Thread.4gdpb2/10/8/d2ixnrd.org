You've been given good advice already. But yes, you portrayed yourself as arrogant and rude and I'm inclined to take the side of your peers.

From your first statement, it shows that you are unable to empathize with your peers. It was clear from the thread's topic that the OP felt it was a special occasion to socialize and indulge in alcohol. You dismissed his feelings by stating it was not a good reason. You phrased it in as if to claim that it objectively and obviously was not a good reason, and that belittles his feelings and intentions. Furthermore you ended it by implying that you wished them harm. This not only implies that you think you are better than them, but that you don't even care for their wellbeing, which is increasingly insulting given that you've spent a significant amount of time together as peers, and they've considered you somebody worth their time. It is not unreasonable for them to feel insulted and jaded to find out that their feelings towards you were not reciprocated, not even on a false pretense.

Your addition remarks cemented that opinion. You even go so far as to laugh at the notion that you might enjoy spending time with them.

I find your choice of words quite rigid and impersonal, which may be what you're going for, but for such a casual conversation, it lends itself to appear arrogant, which it did.

To convey the same message, I personally would have said, "I don't drink, not even coffee. I also don't like such social environments, so thanks but no thanks. Please respect my personal choice. You all can enjoy yourselves with my absence on my behalf."

And if I wanted to reciprocate their feelings of camaraderie, or at least let them know I do see them as more than strangers, I'd include, "Watch out for the hangover." Or to be even more personal, "I wouldn't know it, but I hear hangovers are pretty terrible, so have fun and take care."

You'll soon find out, if you haven't already, that in life, it's very important to build and develop social skills. To be human is to be social. You'll find out that every single job out there, regardless of what it is, is looking for a team player or will require you to interact with people, sometimes with people you don't even like, and if you can't deal with them tactfully, you're going to have a lot of problems.
