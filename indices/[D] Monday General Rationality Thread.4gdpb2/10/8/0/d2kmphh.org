  "I don't drink, not even coffee. I also don't like such social environments, so thanks but no thanks. Please respect my personal choice. You all can enjoy yourselves with my absence on my behalf."

Even this sounds "weird", overly formal and giving the topic too much attention, if these people have barely interacted with [[/u/ToaKraka]] and all he wants to do is to politely decline and disengage. That's what you might write to people who really care about you and are genuinely curious as to why you've refused.

And I'd reserve "Please respect my personal choice" for some kind of peer pressure nightmare. While it will definitely work, it unsubtly paints them as the bad guy, which will sour the conversation.

In [[/u/ToaKraka]]'s situation,

#+begin_quote
  Aww, sorry, I'm busy that day. Have fun!
#+end_quote

or a more truthful

#+begin_quote
  Sorry, I'm not really the partying type. Have fun!
#+end_quote

or possibly even silence, would be more appropriate.
