  Your then unnecessary complication of the conversation made me think that they may be used to similar shenanigans from you by now

  Regarding the issue in general, what was the point of generating walls-of-text at a simply party request?
#+end_quote

I started with a two-sentence reply, and wrote the wall of text only when the pressure continued. Really, though, I wasn't joking when I said I was having fun in typing it. I think this is only the second or third time that I've had the opportunity to explain why I don't enjoy parties (to non-family).

  How does one's physical fitness define whether [he is] (not) a reclusive person, a nerd, or both?
#+end_quote

I'll admit that I was going for stereotypes there. Still, there's a difference between "physically fit" and "having bulging muscles". In addition to that, they put little care into shaping their pronunciation of English.
