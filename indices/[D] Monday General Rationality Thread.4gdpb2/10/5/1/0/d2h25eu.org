I think the way you "unnecessarily complicated" the interaction with your classmates is more interesting than their motivations for pushing you to accept their invitation. Especially since you have revealed that you haven't really spent time with them at all.

It seems simple to me - when you rejected their invitation with a, "Enjoy your hangover", they read your response as an attack on their intelligence. And I don't mean this as an accusation, but you /did/ mean to do so, right? Actually, even if you didn't mean it that way, all you needed to do was to say something like, "No thanks" and the conversation would have ended there. Instead - and I think this is what [[/u/OutOfNiceUsernames]] was noticing as well - you otherized yourself by declaring that you don't imbibe like the rest of them and then you even expressed your disdain (it's hard to read "Enjoy your hangover" any other way) that /they/ actually /enjoy/ such /base/ and /superficial/ temptations. And so they felt that you were insulting them (and in your comment, here on reddit, you do insult their intelligence! People you barely know!), and sought to injure you back as politely as they could - by insisting on enjoying their company....

Which, at that point, was not what they were really saying. At that point, the bridges were burned, as you said. The subtext of their persistent invitations was that you were a charity case - the poor social pariah - /look/ at how /kind/ and /lovely/ and /polite/ we are, including this fellow in our festivities even though we no longer wish to.

Mystery solved.

(P. S. plenty of nerds work out nowadays and have bulging muscles. Exercise helps increase mental strength as well, improving one's ability to concentrate and maintain focus. It also helps regulate mood... It's probably not a good idea to associate a healthy behavior with an undesirable trait. It's also probably not a good idea to otherize yourself if you wish to increase your chances of success in the job market. Employers hire based on referrals first - most jobs nowadays are attained thanks to nepotism.)
