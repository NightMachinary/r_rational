People like Alex. That's not something you need to get upset about. People will probably like you more if you're less rude to them. When they say "a beverage" they don't mean necessarily alcohol or caffeine, you can have a lemonade and an orange juice. If you don't like them you don't have to go. Just make an excuse a couple of days beforehand or lie and tell them you're going to Canada or something.

I dunno if you're ready to hear this, but I used to do this shit a lot when I was younger, and you know what? Your life will be better if you don't spend so much time and energy shitting on people because they're happy and you're not.
