No additional context apart from maybe I wasn't harsh enough filling in the questionnaire and I'm fairly good at seeming like I'm keeping it together well even when I'm really not, which probably doesn't help. The two GP's I've met so far didn't really seem to believe that I was having problems. Most of them didn't really seem to like the idea of antidepressants at all on some kind of moral level.

Luckily I had an appointment with a professor of psychology who has sorted all that out, and I now have a piece of paper I can show at the next appointment and things seem to be moving in the right direction. Seeing as they're working with the government I'm assuming my piece of paper will in fact be terribly important, driving forth all before it with its radiant light.
