Huh. I'm not in danger of killing myself either and it was very quick and painless - the GP gave me a prescription after a 10 minute consultation and I picked it up at a pharmacy the next day.

Unless I'm missing some context (you've already tried some meds and now are going through some specialist stuff), maybe try a different GP?
