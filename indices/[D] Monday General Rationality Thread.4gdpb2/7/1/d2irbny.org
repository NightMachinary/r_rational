It depends on what you want to do.

If you want to just publish it, then as [[/u/blazinghand]] says, Kindle Direct Publishing is probably the way to go. You can go from raw text, to .mobi file, to having it available on Amazon in about half an hour. However, you can't give it away for free through that platform, which means hoops to jump through for anyone that wants to read what you've written. (On the plus side, possibly there's some profit in it.)

If you want your own website, there are a bunch of options out there. If you want a blog format, Blogger is free and just has the standard "we have an unlimited license to publish your stuff on the website you're making with us". Wordpress is the other heavy hitter, but probably overkill unless you want lots of the other stuff it offers, and then you'd have to find your own hosting. And if you have your own hosting, then publishing online isn't too hard to do even without Wordpress.

Let me know more about specifics. I've published through KDP, published a serial on my website, distributed through Patreon, and have used FictionPress and AO3, so I have some experience with the various ways to get fiction to people.
