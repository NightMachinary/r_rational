If you want to publish a work of original fiction under your name and reserve rights to it, I recommend [[https://kdp.amazon.com/help?topicId=A6KILDRNSCOBA][Kindle Direct Publishing]]. You can make it available for free to Kindle Unlimited users, or charge for sales as with most ebooks. You also retain rights to publishing a physical book-- this would just be for electronic sales. [[/u/eaglejarl]] did this for his excellent story, The Two Year Emperor, so you can ask him questions about how to do it.
