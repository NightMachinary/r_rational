Now that the pathfinder campaign I DMed has drawn to a close, I'm gearing up to play in a new Bash campaign. One of the character ideas I was lobbing back and forth with a friend was a brilliant planner, a perfect strategist. From limited information he can perfectly deduce what's going on, or what's likely to go on, and use the tools available or make plans to deal with it. While you can use the Bash chargen system to make mages, psychics, superhumans, mutants, healers, people who have laser eyes, and so on, the actual rules are very flexible, and allow for someone to be made like this.

The basic problem, though, is that /I/ am not a perfect strategist. So, how do I make a character whose power is "very good at predicting things and is properly prepared" in Bash? Actually it's fairly simple, and quite hilarious. I take the Conjuring and Summoning powers, with the restriction being mundane things. So, as a player, I don't need to actually explain how I figured things out beforehand. I can just make things up post-hoc! For example:

/Ah, the hapless victim Donnie is actually Dr. Don Hieseldorf the mad scientist? Well... (rolls for conjuration)... you see, Dr. Hieseldorf, I saw through your disguise the moment you walked in. That red dust on your fingers, that only comes form 3 different mesas in the area, and the tear on your cuff would only come from a left-handed man using this kind of saw, whereas you were faking being right-handed. So, naturally, I deduced... etc etc. And that's why I'm now holding a plasma pistol that happens to counter your field effects! I've had it hidden on my person this whole time!/

or, for the summoning....

/Oh, the self-destruct mechanism is triggering a Pietium overload? Well, as it happens.. (rolls summoning)... from your microexpressions, I knew you were going to press a self-destruct button, and I already have a team of Pietium reactor engineers shutting down the reactor as we speak! How did I know it was a Pietium reactor? Simple, elementary even! it was the smell of almonds. which led me to believe.../

Basically roleplaying the character will be "post-hoc explanations and rationalizations: the game" to explain all his mundane summons and conjurations. Spending the entire sessions bullshitting every time my character does something, and having that actually be a mechanic, is going to be a lot of fun.
