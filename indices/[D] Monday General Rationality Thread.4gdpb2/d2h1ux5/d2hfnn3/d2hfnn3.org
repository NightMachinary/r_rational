I'm playing a vtm (or vtr, I can never remember which name is which) character who specializes in being crazy prepared. I just made a list and every time some mundane item would have been useful, I marked it down and simply had my character buy one from an ordinary store. By this point, it comes in handy several times a session.

You would be amazed how often vampires need duct tape and flashlights.
