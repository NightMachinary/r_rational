I know, right??!? It's going to be great, because, just like with Sherlock Holmes, every "explanation" for every "deduction" is going to be 100% pure post hoc retcon bullshit. Like, "now you're standing exactly where i planned - on top of that explosive barrel that's been there /this whole time/" after the villain walks forward. Obviously, I planned nothing, but I can just use my power to generate it, etc and /it will have been there/.
