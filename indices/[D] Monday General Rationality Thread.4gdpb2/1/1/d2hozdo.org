Sad to hear that. I hope things turn out well for you in both the short and long run.

When you do get on meds, if the ones you get don't work perfectly in the first place, don't be afraid to ask after different kinds. I had issues with that as a kid -- one of the antidepressants I tried out made it really hard for me to get to sleep, and another made me lethargic.

I don't know that it's particularly... relevant to you, but this is the kind of thing I'd rather point out than leave to implication: plenty of folks care about you, even just on this subreddit, and among your readers, so take care of yourself.
