[[/u/blazinghand]]: Thanks for the compliment. :>

[[/u/elangs88]]: I'm happy to answer any questions you have about Amazon. If Amazon is more than you're looking for, you could also put it up on a free blog. (Wordpress, Blogspot, etc). And, of course, there's always traditional publishing.

As to rights...anything you write is automatically under copyright to you, regardless of whether you put a copyright notice on it. I wouldn't worry about it too much; most writing doesn't get stolen.
