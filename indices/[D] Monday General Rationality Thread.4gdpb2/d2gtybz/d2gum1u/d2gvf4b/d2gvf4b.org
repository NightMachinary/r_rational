Well, in the [[#s][Fate First Grail War]]. Could be due to the familie's change of focus.

And I can see the mages going for direct combat and pride dueling like Kayneth but characters like Kiritsugu didn't seem that rational when he was supposed to be a pragmatist first of all. I still don't understand why he accepted playing with a Saber when there're much better options for the kind of warfare he uses.
