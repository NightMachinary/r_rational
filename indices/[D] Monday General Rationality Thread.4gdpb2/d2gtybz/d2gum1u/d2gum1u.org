A few of your speculations come from a lot of knoledge that the characters in the series dont have.

And the rest seem to base around the idea that in a rational Fate the characters themselves will be rational/logical/calculated/etc. Which doesnt necessarily follow. It just means that they will be consistant. You can be consistant while beeing prideful of your linage and understimating your oponnents.
