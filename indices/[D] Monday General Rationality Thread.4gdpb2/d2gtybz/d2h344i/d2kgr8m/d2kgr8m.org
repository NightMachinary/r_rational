In terms of mind magic the top of line stuff are Self-Geis Scroll which would require you to overwhelm gilgamesh with your own magic and command seals which suck at long term orders. Your best method to control gilgamesh would be cheating and getting ludicrous amounts of command seals like illya does, and even then it's iffy.
