Any Fate/Stay Night or Fate/Zero fans?

I woke up this morning thinking of how a rational Fate/Stay Night Holy Grail War would be. I assume either the masters would organize and sacrifice all the servants at the same time in the ritual to open the path to Akasha or grant the wishes without needless bloodshed or have some warfare Punisher style where everyone stays in their haven waiting for information on the other and doing lots of scouting.

I think learning the mystical and psychological weakness of the opponent would be essential and everyone would take measures to learn the enemy's identity without being discovered and procuring artifacts for scrying and mind reading/wiping.

I think as soon as a master was discovered the information would be made public and everyone would nuke the enemy haven to take him out and wait for another to be discovered to minimize exposure.

Either that or it would be about hiding all the time and wait for the other masters to slip and wipe each other although that wouldn't make for much of a compelling story.

Now as for the classes, I think a rational combatant would purposely avoid classes that require high upkeep or frontal assaults as that would expose to danger so no Saber, Berserker or Lancer classes. Probably Rider or Assassin would be the best bets given that most combatants are immune to Casters despite their sheer versatility and Archers have a certain knack for betraying their handlers.

Personally I think I'd choose a Rider given that they have high mobility which would be essential for scouting and hit and run tactics, generally good stats that make them able to hold their own against Sabers and Lancers along with a special and highly powerful ability which would be great as a last-resort/nuclear option in case there was no other escape and that would be a great end game.

Thoughts?
