It was shown that shirou was leeching off of archer's abilities. "Projection" copies not just the material item but the original user style and instincts, so shirou copying archer's blades basically resulted in shirou being uploaded with martial instincts he would have spent decades building specifically for him. Furthermore by the early climax archer was more less not really trying to kill shirou, while shirou was give it his all. Furthermore archer specifically is significantly weaker than basically every servant, in his fight with lancer he was described as being too slow to follow and fight the way most servants do, instead he has fighting style where he makes obvious openings for the explicit purpose of being able to deflect the obvious attacks there.

Basically archer is servant whose raw ability isn't that much on it's own, whose indeterminate on whether he really wanted to kill shirou, and was lacking peggy sue knowledge on shirou's abilities which were changed by his presence in the grail war.
