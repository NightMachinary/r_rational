Well, right now I'm not doing anything with neural nets, so I don't actually have to use a neural-net learning framework. Haskell has type-safety, which makes transforming data between different representations easier. It also provides a slightly nicer way to do generic probabilistic programming without custom inference procedures. It's also faster, and has deterministic PRNG state (reproducibility of results is important for stochastic stuff).
