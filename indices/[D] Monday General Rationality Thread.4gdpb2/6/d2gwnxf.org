I've reached the point where rewriting my code in Haskell, with a monadic EDSL, will probably make it clearer, shorter, and easier to use than the current incarnation in an interpeted language built on Python and a bunch of Python plugins for the interpeter.

Be very, very afraid.

Also, two hierarchical models so far have supported my hypothesis about why hierarchical models work. I just have to make a learning-curve graph with this second one and then cover the model from the paper by that Harvard guy from last month to show which way the causal arrow runs.

Cower, brief mortals.
