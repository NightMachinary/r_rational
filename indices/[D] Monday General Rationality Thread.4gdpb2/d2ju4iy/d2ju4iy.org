Hello there. I have recently found a dash of self-respect, which, as I retrospectively notice, has been a huge factor in my reclusiveness.

I've been lurking here and elsewhere in the diaspora for years now, but I'm inly now beginning to write something.

I heartily recommend this "getting your shit together and getting out there" stuff to everyone who hasn't tried it yet.
