Well... when your best argument for what makes it rational fiction is, "It doesn't, I was borderline on posting it," you kind of lose the right to complain about it being removed.

Past that, I don't think it was rational at all. It was just pretty basic political flag-waving. It isn't that it was a story with a political slant. It's that it was a story specifically designed /only to complain about anti-trust laws./ It reminded me of [[http://imgur.com/a/zh1s9][this laughable comic.]] (Skip to somewhere in the middle. The farther you go, the more laughable it gets).

Contrast it with "The Cambist and Lord Iron: A Fairy Tale of Economics," which is a story designed to teach a few points about economics *but also stood as a story on its own.*

Whether or not you personally believe in it, what you posted wasn't a story. It was a bad argument masquerading as a story.
