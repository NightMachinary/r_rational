That comic is a delightfully insane read.

I especially enjoyed the section where it talked about instituting a tax on voting, on the grounds that without it even people who don't care will vote.

It then goes on to preempt the question about whether the tax should be relative to your means with a resounding "no". After all, you don't pay more for any other service just because you have more money, do you?

Of course, for a wealthy person the relative utility cost of the fixed tax is negligible. This means that an apathetic wealthy person could vote, which would have exactly the same deleterious effect as an apathetic poor person voting.

It's all a hilarious mix of idiocy, really. In the next section it talks about how, when "the island" removed the voting tax it really degraded the political process. One big point it raises is politicians buying votes.

Never mind that they could have bought votes anyway, and indeed doing so would have been even more advantageous with a voting tax (as a smaller proportion of the population would vote).

There are so many little touches that are just adorable.
