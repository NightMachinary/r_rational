The poem was entirely political. If you can find another story posted on here that had an equally political tone throughout, I'll gladly give you my vote (for whatever it's worth) on your post being revived (and then downvoted). Or, alternatively, on the other story being removed.

Until then, I'm perfectly fine with the mods removing overly-political "stories" that are also not rational.

I believe you. It just doesn't matter. Your post isn't you, and your motives are irrelevant.
