I'm honestly not too worried about getting that poem re-instated.

I am worried about what I see as potential political bias in our moderation though.

I think if you sort by controversial, you'll see plenty of posts that fit a more reasonable reference class. One that wasn't specially constructed to narrow out this post, and this post alone.

If you want an example of a highly politicized post that /isn't even a story/, check out [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ed1cs/sam_harris_interviewed_by_godless_spellchecker/][this]] one or [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2td40o/rt_the_solution_to_world_poverty_by_utilitarian/][this]] one.

Both of those brought up some interesting discussion though.

If you want crap stories that aren't necessarily political, well there are plenty to choose from.
