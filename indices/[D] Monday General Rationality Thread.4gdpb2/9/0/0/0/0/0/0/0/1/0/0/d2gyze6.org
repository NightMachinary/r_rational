Judging by the moderation log, it's about 16 in the last three months, which is as far back as the moderation log goes. That's not including things like "I like to play with myself. You can see it here Qb8U9RKq" which AutoModerator sometimes fails to spam can. (Personally, I don't remove anything that's not obvious spam, partly because I'd rather let downvotes handle problems where possible, and partly because I prefer doing the fun parts of moderation like helping debug flair or telling people how to do spoilers.)
