  In the thread I linked to, [[/u/eaturbrainz]] put manna in the same category as this poem. You can see that comment here. About 1 year ago, manna was posted to [[/r/rational]].

Ok, I have a couple exams today. I've already spent too much time on reddit. I'll read Manna when I can (probably Wednesday, when I'm done with exams). If it is as political as the poem, you will have my vote (again, worth as little as it is) in removing Manna.

If, however, it was just irrational, as the linked post suggested, than I think down-votes would suffice.

I still stand by my support of removing highly political pieces, /regardless/ of the tribe it belongs to.
