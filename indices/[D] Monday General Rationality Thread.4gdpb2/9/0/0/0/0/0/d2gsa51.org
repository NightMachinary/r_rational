If you think that the reference class is unreasonable, tell me why. You think it's arbitrary? I don't particularly think so. Why else do we have "spider" tags if not for the realization that political pieces tend to short-circuit rational thought?

I, for one, and I don't think I'm alone here, would be perfectly fine with the mods removing highly political things, /regardless of which tribe it favored/.

Is it really so unreasonable to want [[/r/rational]] to avoid the type of thing that tends to make people irrational?

  I am worried about what I see as potential political bias in our moderation though.

Then, I ask again for you to provide something that shows that the mods haven't removed something equally political, and equally irrational, from something that isn't libertarian. If you can do that, again, you can have my vote.
