For Gretchen I can understand given that she was planetary or galaxy scale at most. It was never explained in the series how much energy she produced but if it was enough to continue powering the universe until a new race emerged that could make up for the lack of humans (like if it took a million years for humans to appear and Gretchen can keep it going for ten million years) then I can understand the intention.

Also in the PSP game its explained how the Incubators are getting energy from other planets too and actually shows [[http://wiki.puella-magi.net/Itzli][the witch of a magical girl from outer space]] so the lack of one of their resources while potentially bad in case no race like humans appeared again is not universe ending.

Walpurgis was like a metheorologic phenomena and was city scale at most. It was like a forest fire that burns established structures and causes suffering to force more contracts at certain time periods. It laid dormant at other times and makes me think of the Endbringers from Worm.

Problem comes from Akuma Homura and Madokami given that those are universal scale at the least and have unknown properties, not to mention its unknown whether they retain sentience or not. Incurring the wrath of something that holds the power of a god isn't the wisest or most rational thing to do. I think its doable but proper caution should be taken as its a massive endeavor. Not something you can do by just "observing" the force in action and monologuing what you plan to do to the person that can stop you while at the same time not setting any countermeasures.
