LOL I expected as much. Always get lots of flak from supporting the Incubators but if there's no other technique available the rational thing to do would be to continue the Soul Gem process until a more suitable form of energy became available.

Same with humans, we require coal and fossil fuels because we haven't yet developed a more efficient mean to power our machinery. We can't for example leave a hospital without energy just because the solar generator happened to work on a cloudy week.

And nuclear is a good option but we still haven't overcome the contamination and security risks (dirty bombs come to mind for example). Not to mention the economic interests at play that delay clean energy development.

Rebellion Kyubey felt even more like a bureaucrat interested in selfish gain actually. At least up to that point I considered their efforts as valuable and necessary but given that the risks involved in tampering with an universal and potentially conscious force were too big, there was no need to attempt it. Especially not in such a careless and direct way (explaining what was happening, not using escape valves or shutdown interrupters, something that is very common on industry and that an advanced civilization dealing with higher energy forms should have known even more).
