  they can probably do better by mind raping a large number of suitable girls (if they are technologically sophisticated enough to cause illusions of their choice)

Actually I wrote a fanfic like that once, its called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9516592/1/198Homu][198Homu]]. Problem was that I think I took it too far and could have improved it. I'm trying to remake all my fics into rational ones and improve the quality.

The Homura attempt was good although I still think even more precautions should be taken. I mean it becomes a problem when the being of infinite potential has a say in the matter. It would be like creating someone like Dr. Manhattan with Ozymandias ambition. Or someone like Punisher/Rorschach with Manhattan's power which while good, is a huge risk to let loose on the world without means to stop it.

And thanks for the To the Stars recommendation. Its on my to read list and plan to once I catch up with Mother of Learning and Power Games.
