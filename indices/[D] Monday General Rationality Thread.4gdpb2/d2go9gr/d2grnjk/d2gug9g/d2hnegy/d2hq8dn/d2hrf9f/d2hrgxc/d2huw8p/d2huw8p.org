I'll keep it spoiler free and just say that the checkpoints of his "ability" are tied to the reason he has this ability at all and how he was brought to this world.

Now about your Problem, which is completely fine to have by the way. I can't blame you for thinking like that since the content and character of this show only makes really sense to you once you see the result in Episode 5.

I guess you've noticed the various tone shifts from Light hearted And Genre-savy comedy to mysterious and dark, vice versa of course. It's always a back and forth.

This actually serves a certain purpose that the author plays around with at the start.

You could see it as two extremes clashing together.

On the one side you have Subaru's wrong expectations about this whole world and his situation. Due to his interests in games and such Subaru has the expectation of a cliche fantasy world, basically how it is portrayed in various games and other mediums. Episode 1A, parts of Episode 3 and the majority of Episode 4 were like that.

On the other side we have the harsh reality. Through moments like Episode 1B and Episode's 4 ending we have seen that this world is nothing like Subaru expects.

The fact that we still experience these light hearted genre-savy moments although we've learned how reality is in Episode 1B only leads you to one conclusion. We see the world in the eyes of Subaru.

Let's take Episode 1A. We had all this meta commentary and behavior because Subaru honestly expected this world to be like that, so we had an overall tone according to these false expectations.

Then Episode 1B happened and we got a climbse of how this world actually really is which resembled the other extreme. You could say that reality pushed back Subaru's expectations of a cliche Fantasy world for a moment, That's why the tone was extremely dark and tense for a short time.

Soon after that Subaru fell back into his behavior in Episode 3 because he thought he overcame this obstacle and he disregarded it as the enemy "the Hero from another world has to beat". He won in his book and that happens to be what is chsracteristic for cliche fantasy stories in his opinion.

Now to Episode 4. Subaru is still in this mindset of his and he actually believes that the whole thing with Elsa was the one thing he as the hero had to beat in order to get his happy end ( remember how he said he will get his happy end in Episode 3? ). Now what does Episode 4 resemble? It's basically him enjoying his supposedly happy ending. All he cares for at the moment are his desires which is basically Emilia, Emilia and Emilia. He even wants to earn his livelihood in a peaceful manner while he now enjoys his life to the fullest.

Once again Subaru's expectations of this world are a light hearted and peaceful fantasy world in which he will enjoy life. Sooner or later The episode becomes SoL like because this are his expectations now, to live a simple but peaceful life. Since we see life through his eyes we get a lighthearted episode.

Now what does the author achieve through this way of storytelling? He's basically setting up what will be major character development and a huge tone shift and episode 4's ending basically said to us "And exactly this will now begin".

The ending of Episode 4 shattered Subaru's false view on his own Situation in an instant. The exact opposite of what he expected from now on happened. He now realizes that he is part of something bigger, that the Situation he is in never ended.

You now might think: Why didn't the author do this earlier?

Well he didn't it earlier because the constant clashes of these two extremes serve one purpose. Making the shattering of Subaru's beliefs, expectations and dreams even more crucial. The author basically weighted Subaru in safety to make this whole Realization even harder on him.

If you don't expect anything at all and then everything is going to shit is nowhere near as harsh as having positive expectations and then getting these expectations destroyed in an instant.

So to sum it up, the author used a "show, don't tell" kind of way to build up to the moment he begins to emotionally and mentally break his character as well as introducing the true nature of this story.

You could say the author played Subaru and even us.

I Hope this helped :)
