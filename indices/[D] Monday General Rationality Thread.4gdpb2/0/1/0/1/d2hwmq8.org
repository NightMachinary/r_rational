When you say "What there is of it" I take that to mean that you have actually located a translation of some of the chapters? My understanding is that the story has been Licenced by Yen Press but nothing released yet, and that a fan translation of the first volume exists but has already been removed from some locations and fan translation halted.

Which is to say: Do you have a link for Volume 1's translation?
