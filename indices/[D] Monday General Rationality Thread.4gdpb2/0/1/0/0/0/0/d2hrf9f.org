Actually it's not the author who picks those checkpoints it has a valid reason within the story. The summaries in the Pastebin only scratch at the 5th and 6th arc in which more details about his curse are lifted.

About your problem with consistency. I think you mean the sudden tone shift to a SoL episode that seems to do almost nothing for us? If it's that, may I elaborate on that and tell you the author's intention behind that :)? You'll see that it isn't a case of lacking consistency but more like a way of setting something up in an unusual way.
