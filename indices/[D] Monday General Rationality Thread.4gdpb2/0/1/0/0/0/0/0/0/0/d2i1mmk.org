Thing is, the problem remains that Subaru's characterization is botched. He is a NEET and a long term gamer, yet it took him 3 restarts to even realize he was on a checkpoint system, despite him being characterized as so out of touch with reality that the moment he came into this world he started testing for superpowers...

Not only, but from your explanation itself Subaru's characterization doesn't make sense. Which gamer would EVER think the game is over after 1 boss fight, especially when the boss ran away? Which gamer wouldn't IMMEDIATELY start training after having died so many fucking times to the previous boss? Which gamer wouldn't be terribly curious on why Elsa wanted the crest in the first place?

At least for Kazuma (Konosuba) it made sense. He wasn't excited at all about being in that world. He just wanted to be left in peace to relax and enjoy life, which he did as soon as he could (in the novels). And every time he ended up fighting he did so unwillingly. But Subaru immediately and continuously shows enthusiasm and interest in the world, yet afterwards he doesn't push, in his growth, in his knowledge, in anything?

And even later, he doesn't act until his ass starts to burn, sometimes literally.

Plus, [[#s][which moron wouldn't wake up and stop behaving like a cretin after being burnt twice?]]

Though, now I would like to see Kazuma in this world. That would make for an amusing story.

EDIT: and let's not talk about the powers he absorbs being useless on him...
