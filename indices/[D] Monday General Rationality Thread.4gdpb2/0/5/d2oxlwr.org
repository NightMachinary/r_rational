I haven't read the light novel spoilers, but I have to say, the manga is pretty good. Not rationalist, but the main character comes across as much more reasonable and intelligent than in the anime so far. Also, if the anime and manga are reasonably close (They have been so far), then the next episode or two should see him step up his game a little.
