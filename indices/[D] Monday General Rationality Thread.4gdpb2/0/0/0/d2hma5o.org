I just experienced this myself. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood was my favourite anime for a long time. I've watched it twice now and the first time I didn't even know about modern rationality, let alone rational fiction. After watching it again, I was just... I guess more disappointed than anything. Part of the premise had potential, but it was filled with huge inconsistencies and terrible deathist / anti-progress morals. It killed my enjoyment of the good moments, and I ended up thinking that maybe anime just isn't for me any more.
