Anime\Manga suffer from this in general, unfortunately --- I think I would be hard-pressed to name even 10 different titles with actually consistent logic in this aspects. Often it seems like the writers just don't give a crap about plot consistency and are more interested in building (romantic) character relations, drawing backgrounds, etc.

I just don't get the point of things like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boku_Dake_ga_Inai_Machi][basing story's entire plot on time travel]] and then completely screwing up time travel and character motivations both. Urgh!
