I would recommend To the Stars ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406866/1/To-the-Stars]]) if you liked Madoka.

While Kyuubei's wish to lower the entropy of the universe is of course admirable, they can probably do better by mind raping a large number of suitable girls (if they are technologically sophisticated enough to cause illusions of their choice). Or really, just spawn someone like Homura, and gather immense amounts of energy from moving objects with 0 dt.
