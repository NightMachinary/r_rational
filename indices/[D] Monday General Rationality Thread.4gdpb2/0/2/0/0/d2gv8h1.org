Yeah the only rational one in Madoka seems to be Kyubey which I honestly I'm a fan of. I think he was right in his approach to the problem until Rebellion where he felt almost like another character. I hated Rebellion story so maybe there's some bias there.

Erased I liked due to the emotions but didn't really think it through as much besides the killer's identity. What did you find wrong about the plot?
