Escapement's answer is the only really rational one for someone with sane human values... but if my reasoning is skewed enough or my motivation is warped enough (i.e. like most Magi) I see some other options. First, I don't think there is a single right answer, even given a single consistent set of values/goals, because the Meta of the war can change so much...

If you are against six other Magi, proper Magi that is, a seven way geass scroll ensuring that all of you will fight "fairly" or at least to some prearranged terms would make it almost rational to participate in the first place. The geass would guarantee the kind of fight Kayneth was expecting. The Magi's servants fight, and each magi fights each other, matching mystery for mystery in a proper duel. When a loser surrenders, they are allowed to go to the church and actually be safe. For a no name magi like Waver Velvet its a great opportunity to build reputation (canonically he ended up as one of 12 lords of Clocktower, a pretty high rank for someone with no crest, no OP mysteries or special techniques, no connection). For an established magi like Kayneth its a resume builder (show some fighting ability, network with your competitors, etc.). For a serious magi, even if the other 4 times have been a bust, it is still a much closer chance to getting to the root than they would otherwise have.

If the war is like the canonical 4th war, then a ruthless strategy of hiding and trying to catch each other off guard would probably be dominant. Kiritsugu was really close to winning in canon.

If the war is like the 5th war... if you are fighting to save bystander lives make friends with the other masters and just promise not to fight. If you are fighting to win, hide and let the other masters kill a few servants, then bomb their school (or workplace, or whatever other public location they are stupid enough to go to in the middle of a war) with powerful conventional explosives.

In general Beserker counters saber (and somewhat knight classes: lancer/rider), saber (and somewhat knight classes: lancer/rider) counters caster, caster with prep time counters anyone except saber, assassin counters any master alone but loses to any servant, assassin is hard countered by caster with territory creation. Rider strategy depends on NP.

  I think a rational combatant would purposely avoid classes that require high upkeep or frontal assaults

If you are a powerful intelligent heir to a 8 generation magi family, I think the upkeep cost isn't an issue. If you possess some good defensive mystic codes, participating in the front line might even be a good trade-off for getting a servant without any kind of independent action.

  Either that or it would be about hiding all the time and wait for the other masters to slip and wipe each other although that wouldn't make for much of a compelling story.

I think this would be the logical dominate strategy. If all the masters try this though, the ritual will fail because it needs at least some of the heroic spirits to die to even manifest the lesser grail. If the rest of the master hide but two of them are dumb enough to fight I would try to gank the winner, and then steal the lesser grail while the other masters hide.

  Personally I think I'd choose a Rider given that they have high mobility which would be essential for scouting and hit and run tactics,

If I don't have a catalyst, assassin and try to gank the last surviving master after a week or two hiding. If I could pick any catalyst... maybe Gilgamesh. After summoning him, I would use all two or three command seals on a single order "Bind yourself in loyalty and obedience to me with the power of your treasures". Somewhere in the Gate Of Babylon I bet Gilgamesh has some obedience/loyalty inducing NPs. If he doesn't... maybe he will kill me quickly, or maybe I can blow the last seal and killing him. If he does... gg, I can then just have him Enuma Elish any serious competition. As for other servant choices... Nero can copy any skill, so if this war is jacked up and has more than 7 servants like Extra or Grand Order this might start to pay off in terms of shear number of skills copied. Emiya is a good choice for sheer versatility in an efficient package. He has a large array of NPs and can instantly identify other servants based on their weapon. Zealot Assassin from Strange/Fake has like the ability of all the other hassassins, if I can find some method guaranteed to persuade her not to instant kill me for being an infidel.

One more caveat though, I think the focus on raw power in a servant is only relevant prior to summoning. After summoning, its about teamwork and compatibility.

Edit: forgot to give credit that my idea with Gilgamesh was from a one-shoot fanfic snippet where Rin summons Gilgamesh. Can't remember where I saw it, so if anyone else has seen it and can credit author that would be nice.
