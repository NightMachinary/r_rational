The idea is that Gilgamesh should, in theory, have as least some mind magic Noble Phantasms somewhere within his Gate of Babylon. Given the shear number and variety of Noble Phantasms Gilgamesh has used in the various spinoff works, I think this is a reasonable assumption. You use the command seals to order him to use whatever mind magic NPs he has on himself to make himself loyal and obedient to you, presumably, the command seal effect can last long enough to force him to use at least a few NPs on himself. Given that all the NPs he has are extremely powerful, him just using a few on himself should create a lasting effect.

Of course, this is kind of a gamble. Maybe he doesn't have any NPs that are really good at imposing long term loyalty and obedience. Maybe Gilgamesh has a bunch of weak obedience and loyalty phantasms so he uses those first until the command seal effect wears off before he gets to the stronger ones, then he breaks the effect of the weaker phantasms through shear willpower. Maybe his willpower/rage is strong enough to kill you before he even starts binding himself. Maybe he binds himself with every NP he has, and then he resists there effects long enough to kill. Or he outright ignores their effects because they are his NPs in the first place.

Even so, I think that taking the risk is better than putting up with Gilgamesh's arrogant, self-sabotaging attitude.
