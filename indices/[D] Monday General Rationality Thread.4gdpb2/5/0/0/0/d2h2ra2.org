Besides his crappy luck stat (notice how almost all Servants with low luck end up getting the shaft, sometimes literally *cough*Lancer*cough*) which is an extremely important resource in the Nasuverse, Archer's problem was that he had very low stats compared to the other servants and the fact his main goal [[#s][Fate/Stay Night + UBW]] which was a goal that required considerable attention and left him with little time due to Rin's wish to maintain that alliance.

If it wasn't for that, he would probably have disposed of the enemy quickly and silently.
