You make some good points about the non-rational character flaws, but one question I have is that the Fate story seems moderately rational, the rules, etc all make sense. The only thing that doesn't make sense to me is how Archer was defeated in Fate Stay Night. I just felt like his defeat should have been foreshadowed or explained prior.
