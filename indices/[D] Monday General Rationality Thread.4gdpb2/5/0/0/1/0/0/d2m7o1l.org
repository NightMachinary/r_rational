Which Archer?

The time-looped one just let Emiya win. In his internal monologue it says he could have taken a step back and Emiya would have lost his balance and be vulnerable to counterattack.

The other Archer was just an idiot. At first it looked like his idiocy is from being corrupted by the Grail in a previous war, but in Fate/Zero he hasn't been corrupted and he is still (already) an idiot.
