First of all, it seems to me that if I had knowledge that the previous ~4 times that the ritual known as the Holy Grail War was undertaken, everyone died and got nothing... the real winning move is to go to some city preferably not in Japan and bet that everyone would die again and again accomplish nothing, if the grail war had started up again. It seems like if you want to do something really fantastic with the power of the grail ritual then Counter Guardians etc will show up and kill you, and if you just want something mundane and easy then using another method than the grail war is probably easier.

That said, as far as rational actions go - if characters just murdered each other without playing the "I'm going to show off how cool I am and how much you suck" game, like 80% or more of the fights would have gone the other way. Waiting for the heroes allies to arrive instead of just killing them instantly, explaining things to your victims, doing really horrible stuff gratuitously for no payoff, giving people a fighting chance for no reason... among the canon cast for either of F/Z or F/SN, anyone who could keep their pride + sadism under control for a couple weeks would have really good odds of winning. Like, if in F/SN any of Caster or Illya or Gilgamesh had read the Evil Overlord's List they could make a pretty good go of winning the whole thing trivially.
