You might well be right, I guess my reason for not wanting that is that I want something closer to standard copyright than most licenses provide. I don't really want an open source license I want something that's closed source with exceptions rather than open source with restrictions.

I realize copyright is complicated, but I'm not trying to do anything too complicated and I feel like if it fails some sort of legal test it would be likely to fail in favor of more restrictions rather than less.
