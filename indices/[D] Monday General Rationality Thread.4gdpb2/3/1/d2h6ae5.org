I strongly recommend just using a creative commons license - many programmers try to write their own, and it's uniformly a disaster. Using a standard licence means you can't make legal mistakes regarding unfamiliar jurisdictions, and users can be confident they understand it.

Feel free to add a notice explicitly noting fair use rights, declaring you won't prosecute $reasonable_behaviour, and that the work will transition to a CC0 license on $date (or public domain or best legal equivalent).
