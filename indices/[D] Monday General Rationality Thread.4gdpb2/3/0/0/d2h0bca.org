When you say 14 + 14, do you mean 14 years with the possibility of another 14 year renewal?

Regardless, I think we can agree lifetime + 70 years is way too much. I've seen arguments that 14 years is ideal, I think there was an economics paper on it, but in the end I think it's quite subjective, there's just too many variable involved to say for sure. If I was saying that all rights should be reserved during that period I think I would agree with you, but with strong protections for fair use or at least stronger protections than what exists with current copyright law I don't think it's that much of an issue.
