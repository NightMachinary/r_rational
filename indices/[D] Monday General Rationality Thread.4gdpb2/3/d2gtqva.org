I've been thinking about starting writing more. Nothing of the kind of quality that I would feel comfortable sharing at the moment, but it got me thinking about licensing for online fiction and copyright in general. I have, I think, a decently developed set of views on how I think copyright law should be in the US and I think it would be hypocritical of me if I didn't try to use something similar myself so I've tried to come up a license that would enforce the way I think copyright should work. How does this seem to you folks?
