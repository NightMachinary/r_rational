Authour of "Myou've" here.

In case you're interested, my initial goal was to see if I could write at least a thousand words a day, and post them; which I managed to accomplish for a few months. It also meant things underwent minimal-to-no editing; there is plenty I would change if I went back to it.

The plotline of what's posted is incomplete. I do have an ending in mind and plotted out, but it's been some time, and I don't know that actually writing it out will ever make it to the top of my priorities list; the whole Chessgame of the Gods group has moved in different directions since I was last a part of it.
