  Even after all this time, I think about it and consider it among the very best fiction ever. Not "best fanfiction" or "best amature fiction" or "best book because of not reading a lot" or anything like that. Literally better than shakespeare, tolkien, even some of Eliezer's work. Better than movies and games with teams of hundred and millions of dollar in budget, without renormalizing their advantages over any written text away.
