I just read through it all very rapidly. I have work which I'm peeping actively trying to avoid, but the fact remains this was good enough to be the sole subject of my attention for a few days. But... barely, I would say. I did consider stopping and I think I would have were it not for akrasia (which receives an honourable mention in-story).

It's pretty readable but not standout level well written. I enjoyed it a roughly similar amount to other fics I've read. Biggest caveat: it's incomplete, something I forgot to check for. I'm not normally a fan of incomplete stories.
