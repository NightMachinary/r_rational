I would like to echo the 'please continue' request. Due to the lesser ridiculousness of the self-insert and more believable characters, I consider this story superior to HPMoR, and even all this time after the last update, I fervently hope that you continue at some point. Because, as someone stated previously: In my preference ordering over fiction, this is at the top. Better than any original fic I've read, better than any non-rationalist fic, better than any other rationalist fic, it is simply the best. Even if we don't even get a chapter every month, that would be preferable. I lasted through HPMoR's update schedule, I can take 'a few chapters every few months if I feel like it'. Anything is better than a complete hiatus.
