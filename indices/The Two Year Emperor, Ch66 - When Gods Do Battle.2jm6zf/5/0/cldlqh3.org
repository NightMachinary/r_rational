I don't think that's necessarily what would happen. If I'm remembering correctly, you can sacrifice knowledge but sacrificing a secret is MUCH more powerful. So you could sacrifice the note but it wouldn't wipe the memory. If this is the case then I'd assume that Loki didn't sacrifice all his knowledge as a secret, as he would then lose it, but his knowledge is so extensive that even sacrificing it just as knowledge still outweighs everyone else.
