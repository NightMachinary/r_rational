Herrún appears to be a goddess made up by you, so the dad part seems unlikely to be any part of established mythology. So, it's presumably because the books Loki wrote count as his sacrifices. Loki's color is silver which is rare in Grofhamr and the books made a silver color, supporting this.

Loki earlier said that sacrificing to Herrún makes her part you, so this would make her mostly him, in which context the "Hi dad" makes sense, since Loki contributed most of her being. Plus, her diction seems far more casual than in our other meeting with her, which could indicate that Loki had influenced her personality. Could just be because she isn't telling off a mortal though

Also, that god battle was wonderful
