Around what divine rank is Loki? Im guessing it is safe to rule out him being an overdeity. From the number of worshipers I imagine he has I doubt he would have the millions needed for being a greater, but that would limit portfolio sense from seeing the future. Still, I would guess he is an intermediate as future-portfolio sense is hardly necessary for his xanato's gambit with the other magic he has access to.

I would guess that, except...Loki is the god of trickery and has two brain cells to rub together. If he wanted to he could create infinite worshippers within the timespan of a single immediate action and has demonstrated the ability to hide actions from other deities. I wouldnt be suprised if Loki's past chicanery resulted in the majority of the stuff god's have outlawed now.

I think that I will choose to believe Loki's divine rank is more than all the other god's combined (arbitrarily high in fact) and he is simply playing his role here.

So then, to pull a fast one on Loki and have any chance at him not automatically knowing about it, Jake must plan his tricks to take place before the beginning of time or after its end. I think that would be a good start. This being D&D, that isnt actually that difficult. Now, to find a psion and some immovable rods...
