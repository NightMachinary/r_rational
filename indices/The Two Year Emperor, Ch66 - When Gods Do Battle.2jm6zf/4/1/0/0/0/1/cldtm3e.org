He's actually fairly low-ranked. Not many people primarily worship a trickster god -- he's part of their pantheon, so he gets some charge off of them, but nothing like from a direct worshipper. He can't directly stop another deity from seeing something, but he can keep setting up things to distract them so that they don't choose to look. That only works for so long, though.

Also, the gods are fairly constrained on what they can do to mortals, and creating new ones is one of the most heavily restricted things. Can't just create new creatures ex nihilo programmed to adore you, and you can't use Dominate Person or direct divine power to force someone to worship you.
