  This is a self-insert litRPG portal fantasy, loosely based on my personal experience of falling into a portal to another world and discovering that I had a character sheet attached to my soul.

Another week, another four chapters, so if you were one of those people who doesn't read serials when they first start, you'll be pleased to know that it's up to 44K words now, long enough that /things/ have actually /happened/ (and [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][here's a link to chapter 1]], my personal preference on where to start).

Edit: Also, one of my favorite features of AO3, the [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249?view_full_work=true][entire work]] link so you can read the whole story in a single page load.
