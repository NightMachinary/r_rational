Okay, this is /really/ good. I was honestly not expecting it, but you're weaving in a hell of a lot of amazing things. I'm particularly digging the emotionally-deep RPG group asides; they're managing to be commentary of life and plot at the same time. That's really well done, sir.

Also, mad props for the rationalism of the main character - well, of all the characters so far. They feel really real; I can feel them thinking in every interaction. Joon particularly is a nice balance of "wanting to freak out", "if freak out then die", and "discomfortingly familiar".
