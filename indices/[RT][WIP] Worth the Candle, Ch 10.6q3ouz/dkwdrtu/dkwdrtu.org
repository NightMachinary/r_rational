I like it.

One thing; it's mentioned that food scarcity is a major issue, and that this has resulted in survival rates dropping a great deal. I assume this means that eating zombies isn't a good idea?

There's also cannibalism, but other humans appear to be much rarer than zombies, especially as time goes on. You'd have to be pretty sociopathic to immediately kill someone and then haul their carved-up corpse along with you as food.
