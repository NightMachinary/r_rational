Found two more errors in chapter ten.

#+begin_quote
  “I'd like to take them with,” I found myself saying.
#+end_quote

'us' should be after 'with'.

#+begin_quote
  While I was there, I tried to uncheck some of the options, like the one informing me that
#+end_quote

That line just ends immediately after the word 'that'.

PS This is a great story with a confusing game interface (so intriguingly different from the simple to use ones from other stories) and a genuinely fascinating world our protagonist is in.
