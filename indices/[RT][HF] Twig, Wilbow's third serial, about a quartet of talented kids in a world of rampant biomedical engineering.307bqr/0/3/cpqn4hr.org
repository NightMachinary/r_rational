  There's six chapters up in the very first arc, and I'd say Wildbow's at the top of his game again. If you stopped reading his work in Pact, now's a great time to start again.

Do people generally think Pact was less good than Worm? Has Wildbow said anything to that effect?

I'd agree, but I'd be curious to see if people discussed it anywhere.
