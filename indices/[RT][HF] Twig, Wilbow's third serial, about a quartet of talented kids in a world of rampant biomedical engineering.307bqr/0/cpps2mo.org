  The year is 1921, and a little over a century has passed since a great mind unraveled the underpinnings of life itself. Every week, it seems, the papers announce great advances, solving the riddle of immortality, successfully reviving the dead, the cloning of living beings, or blending of two animals into one. For those on the ground, every week brings new mutterings of work taken by â€˜stitched' men of patchwork flesh that do not need to sleep, or more fearful glances as they have to step off the sidewalks to make room for great laboratory-grown beasts. Often felt but rarely voiced is the notion that events are already spiraling out of the control of the academies that teach these things.

  It is only this generation, they say, that the youth and children are able to take the mad changes in stride, accepting it all as a part of day to day life. Of those children, a small group of strange youths from the Lambsbridge Orphanage stand out, taking a more direct hand in events.

There's six chapters up in the very first arc, and I'd say Wildbow's at the top of his game again. If you stopped reading his work in /Pact/, now's a great time to start again. Twig has some massive differences from both /Worm/ and /Pact/, since it begins with a complete party of main characters from scene one, and the protagonist absolutely sucks at fighting.

If you read the primer chapters Wildbow wrote after /Worm/, you'll recognize the setting as the one from /Boil/, however the characters and story have nothing in common. It has a little in common with /The Mysterious Benedict Society/ so far, but with more evil. Much more.
