Do we know that this /isn't/ the same setting as Boil? I'm rereading the samples now, and it seems like it could be a different focus in the same world. What with the rampant biomedical engineering based on "Shelley's codex," and the artificial life being called "voltaic." I'm pretty sure Twig used the same term, and the voltaic horses were "sewn together like patchwork." There's also a colloquial reference to "stitch" servants.

Boil could be later, or on a different continent, but I'm strongly suspecting it's at least kind of the same setting.
