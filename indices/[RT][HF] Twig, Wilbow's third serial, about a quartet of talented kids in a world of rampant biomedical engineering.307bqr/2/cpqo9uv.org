I've really enjoyed how much of an unlikeable cynic the protagonist is. In 1.3 he thinks some things to himself that make the setting seem like Crapsack World, but I felt this sense of optimism, that he was wrong about how shitty everything is.

The plotting and manipulation has been very fun to read, too.
