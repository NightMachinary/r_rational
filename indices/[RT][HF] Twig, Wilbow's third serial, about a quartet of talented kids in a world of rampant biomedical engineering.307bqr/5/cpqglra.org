My thoughts as I read 1.1:

#+begin_quote
  How does it go? The first lesson, something even the uninitiated know. For life to flourish on the most basic level, it requires four elements. Carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen.
#+end_quote

And phosphorus. I cannot think of even a single life form that doesn't use phosphorus. ATP. Phospholipid bilayer membranes. Phosphate groups in DNA/RNA backbones. The stuff is in fucking everything.

But okay. Go on.

  Kitties,” Lillian whispered, horror overtaking fear in her expression.
#+end_quote

/giggle/ Yeah okay, I know it isn't supposed to be funny, but it just reminded me about Tom Riddle and his jar of kitten hearts.

#+begin_quote
  As if to follow the thought, Lillian's foot skidded on the bottom of the trough, and she tipped forward, straight into Helen's arms. The creature stopped its slow consumption of the cat's litter.
#+end_quote

Lillian is going to be the Panacea of this story, isn't she?

#+begin_quote
  “You go second,” Lillian whispered to me. “I know you well enough to know that If you go before me you'll look up my skirt.”
#+end_quote

What? How does /that/ work? He'd have to go /after/ her to do that.

#+begin_quote
  She accepted Gordon's support in getting down to the downspout, and began her slow descent.
#+end_quote

Oh, they're going /down/, okay that makes sense.

#+begin_quote
  It all had an odor. There were smells that became second nature, and there were smells that were ingrained in the psyche as bad smells. Ones that spoke of death, of long sickness, and of violence. Rendered fat, decay, and blood. Each were heavy on the air.
#+end_quote

Bonesaw's lab?

#+begin_quote
  It wasn't the first time I had told myself any of those things. I'd heard it from Gordon. It didn't make it any less annoying.
#+end_quote

Getting a pre-Bonesaw!Brian vibe from Gordon.

#+begin_quote
  I let go, and enjoyed both the moment of utter terror and Lillian's gasp of horror, before my fingers caught hold of the window frame below.
#+end_quote

And an [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6kJKxvbgZ0][abridged!Kirito]] vibe from Sy.

#+begin_quote
  I was nodding before the word came out of his mouth. “You.”

  “You're clever,” I praised him.

  “Why?”

  I made the universal gesture for money, rubbing thumb against two fingers.
#+end_quote

Abridged!Kirito is a sociopath, in case you were wondering.

#+begin_quote
  “If you don't follow through, you won't get a deal like this again,” I said. “Think hard before you try cheating me. A big part of what we do is find people.
#+end_quote

Heh. Sy recruits for the mafia.

#+begin_quote
  Helen spoke for the first time in a while. Her voice was cute. “The Academy sends its regards, Mr. Snake Charmer.”
#+end_quote

And it's over. Ending with a bunch of victorian preteens killing a guy in cold blood. BEST FIRST CHAPTER EVER.
