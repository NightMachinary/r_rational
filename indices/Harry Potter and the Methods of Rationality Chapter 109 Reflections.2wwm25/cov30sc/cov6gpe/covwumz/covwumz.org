The immunity to fiendfyre is irrelevant, because I'm not talking about destroying the mirror.

I don't think the description of the mirror as seemingly anchored to the spot within the room was meant to be interpreted literally. How would someone be able to see something like that with human eyes?

Even if the mirror is anchored, all else being equal it seems easier for Quirrell to defeat Dumbledore's anchoring wards than for Quirrell to trick the Atlantean security protocols. And the bonus is that he would get a unique magic artifact this way.
