Isn't the obvious move here to steal the mirror itself? The puzzle can then be solved at leisure, and plus you get a super amazing magical artifact that survived Atlantis' fall.

Also, if Atlantis was erased from time, that implies Voldemort's horcruxes, even widely dispersed as they are, do not necessarily make him immortal. I wonder if he's done anything to deal with that threat area. I'd guess not, as if he understood secret time magic he'd presumably already have won.
