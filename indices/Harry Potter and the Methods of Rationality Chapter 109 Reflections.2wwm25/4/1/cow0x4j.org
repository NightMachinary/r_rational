I'm not sure the joke about Harry not acting as a real 11 year old was meant to be mean-spirited. Anecdotal evidence, of course, but to me it just came across as poking fun at the readers. (And Quirrell really is cynical enough to be plausibly indignant about it. He'd be cynical about the sun rising in the east if he had an excuse for it.)

Unfortunately, you can't hear the author's tone of voice when reading a text, so playful humor and indignant ribs are sometimes difficult to tell apart. Worse, we're hearing it told in-character by an villainous uber-cynic who considers the rest of humanity to be depressingly idiotic. At that level of encryption, jokes sound like insults and vice versa.

Anyway, since a joke and barb look very similar in this context, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to be /too/ offended. (Rather, one must be *precisely* offended. Given prior probabilities of EY telling a joke vs not telling a joke, I estimate this to be roughly 20% of base levels of indignation. /s)
