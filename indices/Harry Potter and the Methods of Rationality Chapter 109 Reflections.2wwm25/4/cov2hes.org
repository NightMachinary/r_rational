I'm unhappy with a few things here.

If EY wanted the Atlanteans to have built an AI, that's the kind of thing that should have been probably foreshadowed. Instead, Quirrell just gives an info-dump a few minutes before the story's end. Boo.

Also, the joke about people not believing Harry was a real 11 year old was not funny. It seemed kind of snide and indignant, and broke my immersion. The "coherent extrapolated volition" script also broke immersion. Within the actual story, the joke/criticism doesn't even make sense, as Harry has just learned the roots of his personality are actually decades old, so Quirrell is blatantly wrong to think otherwise, and it should be obvious to him that this contradicts his beliefs. And then he goes further and mocks people who would believe it. What?

Love the title of the chapter. Like the idea of the confundus but I feel like the Atlanteans, if as cautious as claimed, would have recognized that if people are allowed to alter their own mental states to control the mirror then people are opened up to potential coercion or manipulation.
