I agree that that's what it sounded like, but it came across as more of a jab than as self-deprecation. "Ha, you idiots, did you think I was just stupid? I was actually not stupid; you're stupid for thinking I was stupid."

It's not so much that I feel personally insulted, as that I think it was a jarring momentary shift in tone and--like OP of this thread said--broke immersion. It puts a bad taste in my mouth to see the narrative wave around its own recent twist like that. Like if at the end of Sixth Sense the guy turned to the camera and said "Oh wow, I sure didn't see that coming! This changes everything in retrospect, but it all makes perfect sense! What kind of crazy God would come up with this one?"
