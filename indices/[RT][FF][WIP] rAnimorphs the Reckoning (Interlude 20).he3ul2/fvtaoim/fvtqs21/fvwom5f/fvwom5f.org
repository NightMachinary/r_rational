I HAVE OTHER WORDS NOW

I remember going "another interlude???? what a ripoff" and then having my brain destroyed by this in a good way. it's great to have the perspective of a main coalescion for reasons everyone else have made abundantly clear

I'm really liking this, the whole moral dillemma that what the anis think is the right thing might actually be /wrong/ and more wrong than they can hope to comprehend

I feel this is pieces being laid down for the ending I humbly requested, where the anis work out what E/C are planning and double cross them and have the last laugh. Even if this isn't what ultimately happens, the fact that I'm anticipating it has me invested in the story, giving me the options of being surprised by the story (Yay!!! I WILL FEEL EMOTIONS) or my guesses being confirmed (which let's be fair is super validating because you get to feel like you're a galaxy brain genius and is why movies design for you to figure out the twist about thirty seconds before the MC does).

I feel like I know what's happening and I care about the characters, which is good because I was getting worried you were about to lose me in that respect.
