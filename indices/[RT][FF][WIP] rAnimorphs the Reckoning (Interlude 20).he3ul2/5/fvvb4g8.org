Ok I had my think.

  The thrill of movement, of power---the feel of muscles, of legs that walked and hands that grasped and teeth that gnashed and tore---of eyes that looked where you pointed them.

Is Visser One a shard of Hyruk?

I can't believe it's taken me this long but I finally appreciate the nod to The Sharing with...the sharing.

#+begin_quote
  And sour they turned, when Cirran---acting alone! Unthinkable heresy!---murdered Seerow and captured Alloran, launching the second---and greater---war.
#+end_quote

What is the fate of Cirran? Was it punished by the Council for its actions? It was at least around until the 'third wave'.

#+begin_quote
  There was an art to it, an art which Hyruk had mastered during the war years---to understand the nature of one's hosts, and impart one's shards with just the right properties to achieve a semblance of coordination and strategy, despite the unavoidable lag and the shards' inherent idiocy. Whole battles had been won or lost on the basis of a handful of hosts improperly aimed.

  Now, though, the waters were muddied, the barrier blurred. There were decisions being made outside of the pool---more and more of them, as the larger-brained hosts became an ever-greater share of the empire's population, and a correspondingly greater share of each coalescion's mental power lived beyond the immediacy of the sharing. More and more of them, as the fast-paced realities of space combat demanded ever-greater autonomy on the part of hosts that needed to be able to respond in the moment, without dependence on---or oversight from---the central mind.
#+end_quote

Hold up, this is sounding kinda familiar. The idea of the coalescion's mental power living beyond the immediacy of the sharing strongly reminds me of the superintelligence conversation that Perdao had with Aximili in Chapter 50. The shard-host intelligence/ability is outclassing that of the coalescion, and starting to consume the coalescion entirely:

#+begin_quote
  ‹Irrelevant. Don't focus on the details of the concept itself. Focus on the creatures that envisioned it---the human thinkers that dreamed up such a possibility. They were quite concerned about the prospect---at least, the ones hailing from California were. They feared that such an intelligence might expand without limit---that it would be unstoppable, outclassing human ingenuity as surely as human ingenuity outclasses that of cows, or insects. That its goals would almost inevitably be incompatible with the goals of humans, and that it would sweep them aside---or worse, consume them entirely.›

--------------

#+begin_quote
  With each new cycle of infestation and reintegration, the share of its experience drawn from this new way of life grew larger, such that it could feel its own reluctance shrinking, its hesitation fading---and this despite knowing that that was why, despite knowing that here was a process which would produce exactly such a shift in values regardless of whether it was correct in truth.

  It was nightmarish, horrifying---like watching oneself slowly dissolving away in acid. Worse---like watching oneself dissolve while simultaneously witnessing the birth of an uncanny doppelganger.
#+end_quote

Interesting that Hyruk and Visser 3 (original) share a similar fear. Although in V3's case, I suppose the uncanny doppelgangers have already been born?

#+begin_quote
  It was a problem Hyruk had utterly failed to anticipate---a problem none of them had anticipated, or things would surely have gone differently between Cirran and Alloran.
#+end_quote

While this refers to the idea of becoming ever more reliant on sentient hosts, I feel this also refers to the value-shift horror that Hyruk is experiencing. It seems that Esplin was able to look ahead and anticipate it as he's so terrified of it. But, it seems he decided to keep that bit of knowledge separate from the coalescions and perhaps use it to his advantage. No wonder why they don't trust him, he literally doesn't share...

Finally, we see the contrasting CHN/OUS argument in Hyruk. Seems CHN is winning.
