I'm not sure. Here's some reasons i retroactively came up with

-The chapter works really well /both/ as a standalone story (assuming the reader had read canon animorphs) /and/ has multiple satisfying ties to the rest of your story. I often forget crucial parts of the plot thread and therefore fail to appreciate important parts of the story, but that's not a problem at all here. At the same time the chapter organically connects to and sheds light on various aspects of the plot. For instance, you can really better understand how V3 feels as a result of this chapter - it's clear that the intro of sentient hosts has created an identity crisis for many yeerks, v3 is just the most extreme case of this because he has the smartest host. And you can understand the sense of "weird abberation of modernity" regarding v3's behavior from a yeerk perspective.

-Compelling world building regarding the culture, society of the yeerks /and/ a focus on narrative and individual characters in the story. Usually in fantasy fiction, worldbuilding chapters sacrifice on actual story and vice versa, but you've done them both simultaneously here. I especially loved the pairing of the journey in the desert with bringing new identity to a yeerk coalescence, it brought to my mind the hebrews crossing the desert paired with getting the stone tablets and birth of new culture.

-True alien perspective. E.g. I really enjoyed that Hyruk is uncomfortable because something has changed, but it's /not/ because of moral qualms about infesting sentient beings, it's because of the proportional role of the host. A lesser writer would have written a pang of moral conscience squashed down, or a depiction of cackling evil, but you wrote in a concern which fits within a consistent alien value system and culture. Yet, it's quite relatable, you can definitely feel the "oh no modern society isn't as good as it was back in my day" feeling, where the culture seems to be shifting out of control. It's extra cool because the nature of the species allows the Hyruk to talk about /themselves/ shifting out of control in the first person, whereas the human equivalent would be "kids these days".

-While it's not entirely clear what exactly the primitive yeerks are fighting over (I think that would be cool to know), I really like that they absorb the perspectives of their enemies, see the war from both sides, take on the emotional perspective of the traumatized enemy. I also like that the effect of this is actually to make them harder and less trusting, rather than softer and more empathetic - I'm not sure why I that concept, but it feels true to something.
