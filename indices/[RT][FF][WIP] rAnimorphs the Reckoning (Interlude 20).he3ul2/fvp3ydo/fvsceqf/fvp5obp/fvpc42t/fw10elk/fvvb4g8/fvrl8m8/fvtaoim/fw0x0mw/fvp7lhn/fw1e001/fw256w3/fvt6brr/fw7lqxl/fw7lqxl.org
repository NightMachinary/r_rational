I've been following this story since (almost) the beginning, and this is a top five chapter, at least. The Yeerks are a much more interesting species here than in canon, and it's sad to see part of what is making them unique totally dissolve.

I missed the boat by several months at this point, but I'm still going to point out my theory for what happened at the end of the last Rachel chapter: I think the "conversation" she saw while demorphing was an Ellimist/Crayak simulation
