  I still have an issue with Hyruk seeing such changes as unnatural dissolutions, regardless of where they were sourced, because minds don't really object to being changed--if they don't change, it's because the weight of the evidence and experiences don't stack up, but whatever, that's why I'm not changing my mind; whereas if they do change, it's because, duh, they do, and that's why I changed my mind. Maybe Hyruk noticed because of the relative suddenness of the change, or because of its different brain architecture.

What Hyruk objects to, I think, is that its hands and fingers have suddenly acquired brains of their own, and are making their own choices as fully autonomous agents.

Previously, yes, Hyruk was influenced by its shards, but those shards basically never did anything they weren't supposed to do and they never thought of themselves as independent beings. Now, though, they /do/, so it's less like "Watching Fox News" and more like "Somebody injecting Fox News into your brain," because Hyruk never /planned/ for its shards to act the way that they're acting, or adopt the beliefs that they're adopting.
