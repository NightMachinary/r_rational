This and wtc are the reasons I check [[/r/rational]] multiple times a day.

​

The fact that I have to scroll down to see if you've written anything is a criminal oversight by this community.

​

One note, and this is more of a comment than a suggestion or a complaint: While I really really like the many scenes where Fateful Decisions are being made under pressure (highlights of the fic and emblematic of the fic as a whole), it might be an interesting change of pace for a decision point to be more 'obvious'.

Obviously, they could still stress about why it's so easy to come to conclusion even when normally this would seem to be a tricky problem --- are we missing something? Is this a trap from Cr or El? Are we being thrown a bone again? Either way, the decision scenes are great, I just wouldn't want.. it to feel repetitive with too much of a good thing. (Unless you're trying to write the rationalist decision equivalent of Worm, in which case shine on you crazy diamond.)

​

And, not that I think I should get an input, but put me solidly in the "Visser 3 must be defeated/destroyed for a good ending to be possible" camp. If C&E's big computer can be smashed and their influence on the universe be eliminated, that would also be beneficial to the good ending cause. What they're up to is decidedly Not Cool, Bro.
