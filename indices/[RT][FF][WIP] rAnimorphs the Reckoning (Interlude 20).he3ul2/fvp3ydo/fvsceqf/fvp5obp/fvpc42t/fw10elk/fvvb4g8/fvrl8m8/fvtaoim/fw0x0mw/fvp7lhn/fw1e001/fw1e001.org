Wow, I loved this. The Yeerk homeworld is such an interesting setting. Hyruk leaving a child colony in its old pool was legitimately touching. It makes me reconsider the point when there were shards distressed that the Visser had destroyed a pool, sort of makes those relationships feel real and good and sad to lose (not to forgive the Yeerks for enslaving people of course).

Hyruk's origin story felt like a legitimate epic, I would totally read a Yerk Chronicles sort of book now haha. I'm very impressed this story has brought me from just hating the Yeerks when I read the originals, to hoping for a good outcome for them.

Getting more of a perspective from the coalescion side on the shard vs sharing issue was great, makes me want to go back and read the previous shard points of view again, particularly the Yeerk AMA, to view it in that light.

Thanks for another great chapter!
