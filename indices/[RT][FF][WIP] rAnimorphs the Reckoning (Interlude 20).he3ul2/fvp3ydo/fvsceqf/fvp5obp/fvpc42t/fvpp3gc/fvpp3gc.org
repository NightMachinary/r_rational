Seems to me that the Yeerks are /definitely/ being messed with, but in an entirely mundane way. Rather than the Ellimist/Crayak actually reaching into the Yeerks' minds and controlling their thoughts here, they've simply artfully engineered events so that the "seduction of the immediate lifestyle" is both something that is at play for the Yeerks as a species and is drastically accelerated by the events of this war. I don't think this decision itself is suspect, but I do think the circumstances leading up to it (including the fundamentals of Yeerk psychology and the evolutionary history of their homeworld) are.
