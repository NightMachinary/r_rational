  There was more---much more---but Hyruk could look no further, /think/ no further---physically unstuck itself from the courier Yeerk so that the memories would cease to flow while it processed what it had seen.

It looks that Hyruk was panicked into disconnecting /just in time/ to miss the Remote Sharing that would've solved all its objections (and, incidentally, showcased for us a real-time hive-mind, with access to all a coalescion's superintelligence). Now that the Control-Issues Coalescion is going into full infohazard isolation, it doesn't look like this negotiation is going to be resolved without bloodshed. Damn you, Ellimist and/or Crayak, and your 32D chess games!

Honestly, I kind of expected him to somehow realize immediately that the human agents weren't actually Controllers. For supposed superintelligences, Yeerk coalescions have disappointed me ever since they didn't try to tech up.

I see we've found the 20th century isekai. Shame what happened to him.

It's great to see this unexpected but totally-a-possible-issue-in-hindsight problem rear up. It's still /slightly/ weird to me, because isn't this just a coalescion's normal modus operandi? Gain experiences from hosts, change based on experiences. The revelation in this chapter was that more views are being shaped externally and only shared afterwards, due to bigger host brains.

I still have an issue with Hyruk seeing such changes as unnatural dissolutions, regardless of where they were sourced, because minds don't really object to being changed--if they don't change, it's because the weight of the evidence and experiences don't stack up, but whatever, that's why I'm not changing my mind; whereas if they do change, it's because, duh, they do, and that's why I changed my mind. Maybe Hyruk noticed because of the relative suddenness of the change, or because of its different brain architecture.

It's reminiscent of the issue I had with Visser Three's standards,

  But there was also within me a deep and unrelenting horror of unbecoming---of waking up one day and not even /noticing/ that I had ceased to be myself.

  Change.

  It was small---subtle---but it was undeniably there. The protections I had put into place---the entire value stabilization framework---they had failed. It was Kandrona no longer---it had been moved by the shadow of Kilgam, shifted by the smallest fraction, a degree insignificant---

which was that they seemed to be impossible. A person's value system can be completely flipped just by watching Fox News for a few years. Is the Visser /actually/ immune to such a thing (I'm not even talking about his Super-Saiyan intergalactic form, but even merely in the base form he's supposedly trying to preserve), or is he just grasping at straws?
