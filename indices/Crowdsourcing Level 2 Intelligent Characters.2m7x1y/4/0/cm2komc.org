I actually plan to have some failed experiments for the characters. What I would say no to is monsters exploiting the rules in ways that they can't be exploited. I would object to incompatible worldbuilding, not character actions that won't work. In fact failed and successful experiments by the characters will be a large part of the plot. My main difficulty at the moment is crafting tons of unique monsters of the week with a rational twist without becoming repetitive. I will probably also request suggestions for character actions at some point too, so for that I will probably be less likely to reject attempting ideas.
