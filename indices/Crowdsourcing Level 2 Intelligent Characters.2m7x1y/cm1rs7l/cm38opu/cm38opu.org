  Edit: The increase of benefit over time is not linear - it is very mildly exponential. Keeping an Oath for ten years gives more benefit than keeping ten Oaths for one year each.

Do you mean exponential, output(time) = 2^{small constant * time^{small} ^{constant}}, or superlinear, output(time) = time * some asymptotically infinite function which might be very slowly increasing indeed?
