I guess I'm confused about what you're saying, probably because it's been a while since I've had any reason to use non-programming math. Google did not help me. Doesn't superlinear just mean that it's increasing faster than linear?

At any rate, I don't think I ever figured out the exact formula, partly because there are enough variables that it's opaque to the characters (along with "time", there's also "desire" and the more nebulously defined "capability").
