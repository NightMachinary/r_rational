If the readers don't know the rules, they can't effectively solve problems, or come up with clever solutions within the constraints that they don't know exist. The first step for /anyone/ trying to solve a problem should be understanding the boundaries of that problem. Without boundaries, you're going to get a lot of solutions that rest on faulty assumptions. [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2j5q53/bst_the_magic_of_oathkeeping/][Check out this post I made a month ago]]. You don't need to read any of the comments, or any of the rules - just look at how many edits were necessary to bring the rules in line with what I had imagined. Now imagine a hundred people trying to solve a problem with rules that are much more poorly understood (if not more poorly defined) than that. I question how useful that's going to be to you.
