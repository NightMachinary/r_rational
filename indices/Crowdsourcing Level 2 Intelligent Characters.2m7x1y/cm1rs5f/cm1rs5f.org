Thoughts on point no. 4: If something seems smart to do in the eyes of your audience it's likely the smart move given the information the characters have. Discrediting solutions that don't follow the rules of the supernatural gives me the feeling that the characters have access to information that i don't, so if you want the story to have a puzzle like feel maybe have the characters try out things that are deemed smart by the crowd? The story might become unwriteable if you do this too much, but if the story can hold some failed experiments it could be fun.
