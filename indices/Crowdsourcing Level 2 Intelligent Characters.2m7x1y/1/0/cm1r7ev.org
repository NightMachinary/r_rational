This is an okay idea, but I have some modifiers/warnings:

- Typical forum game format is to let the audience vote on solutions. Thus intelligent solutions get ignored in favor of funny/more dakka/first posted solutions. You can avoid this by making clear at the beginning you are using non-standard rules and will only accept the solutions that you deem both in character and intelligent.

- Spacebattlers tend to favor... a certain kind of approach. If it is in character for you character to choose violent/sociopathic/more dakka/over-the-top solutions then this is okay. Lesswrong or [[/r/rational]] or a saner forum that is still intelligent might suit you better.
