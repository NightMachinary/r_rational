It sounds like you want to run a forum game rather than just fully write a book. The idea of that kind of collaborative work where many people act as the brain of a single character has been done like that. I would invite you to take a look through some of the spacebattles creative writing and role playing section for examples of this. There are even people who have compiled the completed story thus far to remove the comments and cleared the story up so that it can be read all at once.
