I have looked through several spacebattles stories like that. That is an angle I'll consider now. I do have a pretty good idea of the plot itself at the moment and the main actions the heroes will take. Honestly my main hangup is designing rational monsters that are interesting but not broken and how the heroes will respond. I am getting bogged down with the villain/monster of the week style that is a big part of supernatural that I don't want to lose.
