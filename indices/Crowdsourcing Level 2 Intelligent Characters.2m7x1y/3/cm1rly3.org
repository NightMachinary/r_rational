How well can you isolate the elements involved in the problems you want crowd sourcing on? Maybe you could post specific scenarios in [[/r/rational]] and get ideas for them without spoiling the entire story. (Or you could run it like a forum game as previously suggested.)

  I have a consistent set of rules the Supernatural universe runs on and I can't tell my readers the rules or I'll spoil it. Many ideas may not work with the rules. I could really use suggestions on how to handle that.

A few ideas:

- In your idea gathering posts, post spoiler warnings and let those who want to be spoiled be spoiled. If anyone wants to use spoiler information in their idea, require that they also use spoiler warnings.

- Give a list of possible rules (based on things the characters have learned up to that point or things that they have reasonably inferred). The solutions you get may use any combination of the possible rules. Of course this also means that really good ideas can fail because of hidden rules, but this is actually a good thing because it is more realistic.

- Keep in mind any solution that depends on these rules will need for the characters themselves to at least guess at the rules to use the idea in story. Thus it would be fair for the people giving you ideas to have roughly the same level of information as the in story characters.
