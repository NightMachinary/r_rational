I like these ideas. I especially like giving a list of possible rules based on what has been learned. That works really well for my story as the characters are going to be refining their theories about how the Supernatural world works as they go along and I already have planned in several working theories they'll try and which the readers will be completely aware of.

I will probably do this in this format now if I end up crowdsourcing unless something else comes up.
