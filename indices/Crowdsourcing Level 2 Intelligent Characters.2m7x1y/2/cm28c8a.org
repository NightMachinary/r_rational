As a specific answer, [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2a2vrk/q_if_you_were_jake_in_the_two_year_emperor_what/][I've done this]]. In addition, several of the things that happen in 2YE were at the suggestion of, or in response to, reader suggestions...the prime example being the way they finally defeated Neklos.

Even some of my characters are based on reader comments. Specifically, Suze got a lot more camera than she might have otherwise because the readers loved her so much. Of course, I kept finding that I enjoyed writing her, so I think she would have gotten a fair bit of camera anyway, but probably not as much as she did.

If you're worried about spoiling things for readers, he simple answer is to have people PM you their suggestions. Each reader then only sees their own suggestion, although then they can't bounce off each other's ideas.

EDIT: one problem with this is that you then won't get credit for your own ideas -- someone else will come up with them too, and it will seem that you used heir idea instead of being creative on your own. This may not matter to you.
