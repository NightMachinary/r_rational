You have my sympathies, my brain keeps bouncing between ideas for a cute and fluffy story and gothic horror at the moment:D

I know this won't help, but after you're done with Flicker's story, I would absolutely devour The Adventures of Luce Cannon and Belle Tinker.

Or anything else you write to be fair, because you're, like, really good at it?
