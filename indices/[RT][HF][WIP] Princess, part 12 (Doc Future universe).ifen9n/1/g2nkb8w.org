So Devon is/was the Volunteer, right? Works hard, no known(-to-Flicker) family, many years of service. And then of course, there are few other named characters known to be active at that point, and strong implications that almost everyone who /was/ active died between that point and the present (the Lost Years), so anyone still alive from that era would be notable just for that. Without Flicker's addition after realizing, I think one other person technically would fit, but he'd be too young at that point and would be noted for other reasons. (Gumshoe, Armadillo's son, not that Flicker knew that yet)
