The public view of the Lost Years is simplified over what actually happened, but they were a decade long period where a faction in the US (mostly) government attempted to (more or less covertly) kill or coopt all domestic superheroes/villains while conducting a PR campaign against them, with killing or kidnapping family and close associates to goad individuals into responses that they could use for PR as a standard tactic. The origins of the desire to do that are complicated, stretch back to WW2 and will likely be the subject of more than one story. The immediate trigger was Doc and a number of other superheroes stopping a war that they were all ready for and /really really/ wanted in the early 90s (you can probably guess which one). It ended when Jetgirl did something really dramatic, then gave a live speech which caused a sudden massive shift in public opinion, followed by a horribly inappropriate initial government response. They then realized they were facing a badly unpopular losing regime change war followed by war crimes trials and opted for resignations, conciliation and the Lost Years Agreement instead. The Lost Years Agreement was supposed to be a treaty, but it was never ratified by the Senate, so it remained as a cease-fire instead from the 'end' of the Lost Years until the Maker's Ark.
