Heh. I've had the story about the end of the Lost Years plotted out for more than 7(!) years, and no it won't stay necessarily stay short if I do it right 8-). It's called "A Different World", and it's /really hard/ not to spoiler it 8-). It's from Jetgirl's viewpoint and was intended to be a bonus story for the published version of Fall, the reason for everyone who already read the serialized version to buy it. I'm still undecided how I'm going to handle it at this point. The Nietzchean crediting Doc with ending the Lost Years is intended to show he was a misogynistic revisionist. "Never mind Jetgirl's part in it" was sarcastic understatement. Doc's part in the events ending the Lost Years consisted of: 1) Being very busy 2) Answering his phone 3) Losing his temper completely because people who should have been cooperating with Jetgirl weren't 4) Giving Jetgirl full Database access 5) Providing minor backup afterwards

The Volunteer was also busy, but he arrived in time to help a little bit at the end.

What were Doc and the Volunteer busy with? (Rot-13 spoiler) : Oenvajnir. Jul vf guvf n fcbvyre?
