I tend to use a lot of conjunctions, and Flicker uses even more. I usually write in 'very tight limited third person', the same style used by C. J. Cherryh, so all the narrative description in "Princess" is in Flicker's voice, not just her viewpoint. Flicker's idiolect is full of conjunctions, as she struggles with the competing demands of chronology, completeness, and coherence--she was not able to speak understandably to most people until she was ten, and wasn't able to pass for normal until thirteen. And as mentioned in the previous chapter, her verbal organization abilities took a hit when she was injured.
