Huh, I feel a little silly not realising that "One-Eyed" Jack plus magic user meant Odin archetype before you explicitly called it out:D So I'm guessing he either was taken out by the Wanderer to clear out a competitor for the archetype, or cleared out before he could be taken out.

Or, to put my tinfoil hat on, perhaps he was the Wanderer all along!!

Loving this look into heroic history, and also into the various ways a giant database does not lead to it's users knowing impartial and objective facts about everything.
