There's a very famous comic book super hero with a very similar archetype to V-man whose last name is also the name of an English County.

Edit: if there's a reference in the first name I'm missing it. The pattern I was trying to match would have had Clyde Devon be Cooper Devon or Carter Devon instead, since those are both first names that were originally surnames, and both come from professions, but probably they weren't first names yet 100 years ago, so they aren't really good matches either.
