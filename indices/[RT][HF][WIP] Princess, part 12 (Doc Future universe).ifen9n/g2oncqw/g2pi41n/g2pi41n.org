The picture was taken the year Doc was born, so he was far too young. Chandler Devon was the Volunteer's original secret identity--he was mentioned, but not as being in the picture. The Volunteer was who Flicker thought was the photographer but was wrong about. And don't feel dumb; I wanted this to be something that Flicker plausibly wouldn't get instantly--and her problem with the stories from the 'old days' was missing clues to things like that, that the Database would make clear.
