Thanks! One of many funny things about Jack is that the archetype was an unintended side effect. There are many folk tales about shapeshifters that have one feature they can't change, and I decided to use that with Jack (no specific one, just the idea). The feature he couldn't hide was the unusual appearance of one of his eyes, so he had to keep it concealed to keep from blowing his cover, so he had to have an /excuse/ to keep it covered. And if you're called 'One-eyed Jack' people tend not to ask why you're wearing an eyepatch because it's obvious 8-). The other part is if you have an essential tool that is bulky, you want to have some way to fit it into your look.

The reason he had disappear is a little clearer if you know when--Doc was off helping Zirjack, someone significant was about to show up, and Jack didn't want either Armadillo or Doc asking him for advice about this new person.
