Hmm. Combining this with The Old Man...

"Chandler Devon" was married to Luce Cannon? And started going on patrol more after her death from cancer, culminating in faking the death of Chandler and Volunteering full time?

And Luce was a reporter when she met him? I wonder, is it on purpose that Luce and Lois sound somewhat similar?
