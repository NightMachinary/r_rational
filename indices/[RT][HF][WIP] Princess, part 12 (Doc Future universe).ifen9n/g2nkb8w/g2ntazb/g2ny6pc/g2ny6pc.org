Incidentally, Armadillo and her chosen family reminded me of another story I'd love to hear. If you want a short thing to write after Princess (and one more likely to /stay/ short), it would be really neat to hear the story of the end of the Lost Years, as narrated by Jetgirl, probably telling it to Flicker long after the fact.

We know that the Nietzchean credited Doc with ending them, and that he was (largely due to misogyny) leaving out Jetgirl's role, which was as important or nearly so. And it's sort of hard to see how a technically-unpowered 'merely very fast by human standards' hero could be crucial to that kind of thing. Especially since I'd expect V-man to be more important than her /or/ Doc on that front and he was (implied to be?) uninvolved.
