We take it in turns. I write on Sundays, [[/u/Velorien]] writes on Thursdays. We coordinate via Hipchat, and each of us generally throws the other a plot hook at least once per update. [[/u/FuguOfAnotherWorld]] (who posts in the quest as Jackercracks) helps with worldbuilding and [[/u/AugSphere]] does that and game mechanics.
