You could try posting about your problem here. We mostly visit this sub for interesting materials relating to rationality or use rationality to investigate hypothetical scenarios. But what's the difference between dealing with hypothetical and real problems? Just post your problem here, and the worst thing that can happen is that no one can help or you'll be politely requested to not do it again. Mistakes should be forgiven, but I don't see why it'd be a problem at all in the first place.

Alternatively you could PM me, I'd be willing to give some free advice or a different perspective.
