I am primarily a reader, and write rarely.

The UI looks pretty good, though the focus on images rather than descriptions for the list of fanfictions is a bit unnerving. I prefer descriptions to book covers, but some may prefer that. The site itself is reasonably pretty.

I found a fanfiction that looked interesting, clicked on it, and was required to log in to read it. Seeing this, I closed the window.
