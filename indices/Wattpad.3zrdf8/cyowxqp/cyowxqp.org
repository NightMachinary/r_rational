If someone were to post a link to that site, I'd probably downvote the post and suggest the user post a link that doesn't require login. If it sounded interesting I may even try and google for it on a different site, then I'd make up some login info with a throwaway address and not bother remembering the password.

The search feature is practically unusable. From what I can tell it must search the entire story instead of the title and description. While this is an excellent feature to have, it is a horrible feature to force. Even if there's a way to use syntax to limit it, it shouldn't be the default.
