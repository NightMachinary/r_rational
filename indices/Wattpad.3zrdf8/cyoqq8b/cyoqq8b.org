I tried it out a few months back. The very first thing I noticed was that the site expects you to actually write the story using the site, and has no way to import pre-written stuff. Or if it has, it's sufficiently non-intuitive that I had been unable to figure it out in the short time I spent messing around with it. Copy-pasting things causes text to lose all formatting.

I pretty much gave up on the site after that. I will admit I was already a little suspicious due to never having seen a link to the site on any of the story recommendation sources I usually use, so I didn't try very hard. I just took a quick look and made a snap judgement.
