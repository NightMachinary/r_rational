Can't speak for anything but fanfiction, things might be different for other genres.

FF and AO3 have found their own definite niches. I just can't see Wattpad having the same draw, especially as its competition allows anyone to read and review anonymously. From a quick comparison of readership stats between popular fics on all three sites, this seems accurate.

Strangely, despite Wattpad's integration of social media features, it doesn't seem like there's as much audience feedback as on FF. Take all this with a grain of salt, though; I just eyeballed the numbers.
