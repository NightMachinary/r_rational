Discovery writers, creating a new "story" object on a site before the first chapter is yet written, have very little idea what they will end up writing about.

Once they /have/ written it and know, it doesn't occur to them to go back and update the metadata.

One of my favorite thing about adaptations, remasterings, etc. is that they already have all the content of the original available, so they can create really rich and lovely metadata: cover art that actually reflects the imbued themes of the text rather than the theme intended at the beginning; quotes from evenly-spaced sections within the story, rather than all clumped together from an introductory segment; etc.

Which is all to say: if you're writing a serial, sometimes it's best to write the first five-or-so chapters entirely offline, and only /then/ make a site, slap those all up on it, and begin with periodic updating thereafter. After five chapters, you'll have enough down on paper to know what the story---and thus the site---are actually "about."
