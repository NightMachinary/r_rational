Forced login is a bummer. If I'm posting stuff I wrote online, I want it to be as highly read as possible, which means getting the barriers as low as possible.

Wattpad is aimed at a slightly different market than ff.net and AO3; it's geared for heavy serialization and community interaction. ff.net does a piss-poor job at most things, but interactions with fans is a particular low point. I've only posted a few stories to AO3 in the past, but it's only a little bit better (and still obviously a labor of love). I find the interface for Wattpad to be better for most things, but that's partly because I like a clean, sleek, modern look.

I personally think heavy serialization in shorter chunks combined with heavy author/user interaction is likely to be the way of the future for web fiction, but I don't particularly like user interaction^{*} and I like my chunks to be large, so I'm probably not in the right demographic as a creator. As a reader, I prefer bingeing my way through long works instead of reading them spread out in drips and drabs, so I'm probably not their target demo there either.

* I love reading reactions and speculation, I like being able to get corrections and sometimes offer clarifications, but most of the time I want a work to speak for itself without me waggling my eyebrows or pulling back the curtain to show how the set was made.
