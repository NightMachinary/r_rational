"The cosmic horror of the game and the narrative are well done, though I'm not really a fan of the sorta intrinsic fourth wall break, and in universe forced narrative structure really puts me off... it just makes the events in the story seem meaningless and lacking in tension."

This is only really a fourth wall break if you assume the "DM" is the author. There are so many other, scarier options for that.
