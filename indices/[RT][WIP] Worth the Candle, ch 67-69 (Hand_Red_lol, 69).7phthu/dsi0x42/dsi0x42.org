I quite like this whole story.

I find the freaking out over Fallatehr after the fact pretty funny considering how casually they treated him before that (despite having good reason to be seriously concerned). A serious mistake by usually (somewhat) more cautious characters, but not too implausible storywise, as long as the characters actually learn from their mistakes.

Kinda sad that getting Fallatehr's help with higher levels of essentiallism and the locus probably isn't happening (especially since I happen to quite like Fallatehr). They are also being a little unusually ruthless... Killing him and all of his minions is practical but a bit disturbing. I kinda feel a few hundred years imprisonment might be enough morally speaking.

Jun might want to consider tamping down the 'level up' value. At the prison that was clearly working against his presumed meta value of 'living.'

Great world building in general. I'm not quite convinced its truly consistent, but its at least very interesting, and I'm always curious to learn more.

There's always difficulty writing characters that make mistakes, but aren't idiots or just unlucky. Juniper's blindspots do have some added explanations from just being 17, plus stress and inexperience. You've done a pretty good job, though Juniper is weirdly uninterested in actually learning magic. I mean, I wouldn't wait even a second to pursue time magic once I learned of it. I would wait -10 years. Also hells, exclusion, gods, etc.

Is Jun ever going to realize that going out without armor or splitting the party will always result in bad things? Seriously...

Amaryllis is actually probably my favorite character. Her values are a bit more meta, which makes sense to me. The back and forth of distrust from Jun was quite well displayed.

It seems like devils have, effectively, impossibly high social skills, but they were still limited a lot by no one trusting them. No seemed to take her claim regard Grak seriously before, so does her twinned soul mean that Valencia can now use 'game' logic when she's convincing someone? After all even the PC was apparently supernaturally convinced of a lie.

I'm still not sure about his previous 'nat 20.' insight, but shouldn't he test that? Get an actual success failure distribution?

The cosmic horror of the game and the narrative are well done, though I'm not really a fan of the sorta intrinsic fourth wall break, and in universe forced narrative structure really puts me off... it just makes the events in the story seem meaningless and lacking in tension.

I was actually confused when it turned out Juniper Smith was his real name, that just sounded like a fake name (something I would totally do if magic was suddenly real... true names being a trope and all).
