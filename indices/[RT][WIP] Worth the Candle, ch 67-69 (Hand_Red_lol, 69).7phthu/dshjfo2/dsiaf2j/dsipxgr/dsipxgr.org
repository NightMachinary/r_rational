I agree with your first requirement, we haven't seen one way or the other if Arthur had the exact same power as Joon. However, as to the second condition, I feel like it was stated somewhere in the story that the demons share information, but I'm not 100% sure. And for the third, the demons are scary competent. Minor tells like your vessel suddenly powering up several orders of magnitude along with the information sharing that I, again, am only pretty sure occurs means that if any demon had heard about Arthur's power (assuming it /is/ the same), even from one of his companions or someone else in the know, they would notice the similarities. I think the bar is much lower for the demon to have specific knowledge of PC abilities and recognize them when experiencing them, especially if Arthur and Joon are not the only two Protagonists that have ever been put in Aerb (nothing says they are, but nothing says they aren't, either).
