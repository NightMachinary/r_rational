Is Grak actually compromised?

After a very long talk, where Val doesn't think of the concept of lying, she doesn't mention him. Then right after Val discovers that she can lie and enjoys lying and is really good at lying...

  “So was Grak touched or not?”

  Valencia froze. “Yes,” she said. “What I said, last night, that was the truth. I was possessed when I said it, but it's the truth.”

Valencia wants Jun to kill Fallatehr and tries to convince him that he wants it too (and maybe he does). Lying to Jun about this is a great way to get Fallatehr put on the 'must kill' list.

Also, narratively if this were an RPG, Valencia the Red would be overdue for the first evil companion. She would be evil in the perfect CRPG manner: a total sociopath to everyone except the main character, to whom she is fully devoted. She particularly reminds me of One-of-Many from Neverwinter Nights 2; he was a gestalt ball of souls that could consume the souls of others and access their skills, with wildly varying personalities.
