It seems like nobody in Jun's party wants to put in a good faith effort with Fallatehr.

One of the problems of negotiating in bad faith is that if your partner is perceptive (and Fallatehr is perceptive), they have absolutely no reason to negotiate with you in good faith. Jun and co are practically forcing him to betray them and have been since before they left the prison.

They don't seem to have particularly good reasons to want him dead. Amaryllis knows he's innocent and was only convicted by ex-post-facto laws. Fenn hates him because of racist/cultural elf reasons. Jun should only hate him because he tried to kill them, but in Fallatehr's defense, he was literally minding his own business when some adventurers came into his house with the intention of abducting him, stealing his knowledge, and then killing him. Self defense, imo.

Since Fallatehr isn't stupid and knows they intend to kill him, this means he has to do everything in his power to betray them, sabotage them, and generally mess them up.

--------------

And if the party has no intention of honoring their deal with Fallatehr, they should at least be smart enough to pretend.

Right now they should be negotiating with Fallatehr for Val or brainstorming some way to stop him from overwriting others or something. The fact that they aren't renegotiating now that they're in the position of power is telling in itself.

I'm reminded of a quote from [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_uIQBnn6_A&t=1h3m5s][Firefly episode 1]] -

I'm sure Fallatehr is having exactly that conversation with himself right now.
