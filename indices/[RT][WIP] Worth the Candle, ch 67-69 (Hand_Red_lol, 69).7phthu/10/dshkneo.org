  infernal topology
#+end_quote

Yes! Math as a source of metaphors is something I like a lot in writing, and topology is a good field to choose for that.

So is infernal topology the study of the shape of hell or that of devils? To be honest, the second version seems more intriguing... but Chapter 69 implies that it will be the first :(

Now that's a point in support of devils being topologically interesting, because it seems like she flipped its normal orientation. I'm not a topologist, so I might be getting the term wrong, but that is essentially what happened, right? While she doesn't literally possess the devil now, she did invert the power imbalance.

Thank you for writing, as always.
