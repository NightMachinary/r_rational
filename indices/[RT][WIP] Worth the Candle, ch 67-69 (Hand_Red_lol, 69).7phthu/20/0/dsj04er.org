I feel I already read this comment before, at least the first part.

If you copy/paste your comment from before and then update it, you might get better results by linking to your past comment, and simply making a fresh update in the new thread.

I think more people would read it that way, since no one is reading an old comment they've already seen in the past, especially if it is this long.
