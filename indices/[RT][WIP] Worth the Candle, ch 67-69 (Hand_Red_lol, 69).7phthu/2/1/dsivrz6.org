That's why I didn't get why Joon just passed her comments by (she also casually mentioned Fallatehr "had such plans and to go against them -") and left.

The idiom /the devil's in the detail/ is quite literal here. Rationally, the only way to deal with masterful liars is to catch them on inconsistencies and contradictions with reality, i.e. the truth will out. Amaryllis said devils were bad at coordination, so if that's true, Fallatehr's method of averaging responses is sensible when you're working with imperfect information.

Val's growth will be exciting to witness. She's effectively a "newborn" so she isn't evil (yet), but her parental/authority figure was Fallatehr and now it's Joon and possibly her inner captive devil. *But* she's a newborn who can tell when you're lying and can lie perfectly. How do you guide a child under those conditions? Right now she's likely at that stage where children have absolute loyalty to their parental figure no matter what their flaws. Joon can use that and in all sincerity say that her lies will lower his trust in her. At least sociopathic devotion to a decent person is infinitely preferable to a devil.
