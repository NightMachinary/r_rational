Yandere would probably fit, although I'd assume that Val's stolen skills would let her avoid most of the cliche.

A socially master yandere is a lot scarier than Albedo, instead of just having physical power, someone like Val could seduce you in, emotionally isolate you, and create a codependent relationship without you even knowing.
