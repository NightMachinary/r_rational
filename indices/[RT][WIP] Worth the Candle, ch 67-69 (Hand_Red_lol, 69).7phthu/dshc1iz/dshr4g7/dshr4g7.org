ch. 67

#+begin_quote
  while Fallatehr's other two minions had grudgingly given leave to go into town by Amaryllis
#+end_quote

grudgingly given -> grudgingly been given

OR

->while Amaryllis had grudgingly given leave to Fallatehr's other two minions to go into town.

[OR something else]

#+begin_quote
  The specific materials necessary became quite a bit rarely following the Appetency War
#+end_quote

rarely -> rarer

ch. 69:

#+begin_quote
  The farmhouse had come with two car,
#+end_quote

car -> cars

Also in ch. 67, I don't know if this is wrong, but just my personal preference:

#+begin_quote
  I'd like for you to walk me through the process for fixing my hand,
#+end_quote

process for fixing -> process of fixing
