I'm pretty sure everyone of any importance already knows. Consider chapters 63-64. Juniper used the term "residual self-image", and mentioned that "'Valencia' means strength, where I come from". Given the level of cleverness we're talking about, that was as good as directly stating that he is dream-skewered.

Hell, if Fallatehr is half as perceptive as the devil Valencia is inverse-possessing right now, he should know too at this point.
