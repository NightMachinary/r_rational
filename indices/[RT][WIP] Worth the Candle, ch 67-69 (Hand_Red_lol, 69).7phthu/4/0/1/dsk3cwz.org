Fallatehr's demonstrated powers don't make him any more dangerous than any other hostile person.

Fallatehr can take your life if he's able to touch you for more than a brief period of time, but that's a super power easily replicated by owning a knife. During the time that Joon was looking at his own soul, Fallatehr could have just as easily killed Dahk and stabbed an icepick into Joon's brain. Sure it's a scary fate to be soul controlled, but that's less bad than literally going to hell.

Fallatehr can also raise an army fairly quickly among people you wouldn't expect to want to kill you, but that's not even as good a superpower as being rich. Eg, any scary mind control peasant mob is easier to fight than a hired assassin or strike team.

The most dangerous thing about him is that he's intelligent (which isn't unique) and that his easiest method of survival is to kill Jun (which could be avoided).
