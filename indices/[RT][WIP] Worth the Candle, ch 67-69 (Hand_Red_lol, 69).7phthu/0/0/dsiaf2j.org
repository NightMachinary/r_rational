  And Valencia confirmed afterwards that she knew Jun was shooting for a specific goal (twin souls) as a way to help her. So why did the demon allow this to happen? Was it unable to anticipate Jun's unique powers no selling the possession mechanism?

Valencia knew that Jun was shooting for some goal, but she didn't know /what/.

The demon was helping build up a relationship because a possessed loved one can hurt you /far/ more than a possessed stranger ever could.

The chances of the demon personally experiencing an analogous power from Arthur are basically nil without narrativium. More specifically, the following things would have needed to happen:

- Arthur had the same powers as Jun.
- Arthur /indicated/ some sort of specific demon/soul-related powers in front of /that specific demon/.
- The demon would need to know enough about Jun to recognise that Jun is Arthur v2.

So, given that there are presumably thousands of demons, and there's no guarantee that Arthur even /interacted/ with more than a handful of demons, and if he did, he would probably use some sort of weapon-to-the-face attack instead (like that warhammer), I don't think it's likely.

Of course, if demons gossip, then perhaps the demon would have heard of any Arthur-news through /that/, but again: there's no guarantee that Arthur actually did any demon soul-trapping anyway.

All in all, it's /possible/, but not highly likely, and it's basically irrelevant.
