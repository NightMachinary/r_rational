I really liked chapter 68 - it's always fun seeing new powersets get revealed and slowly fleshed out. Chapter 67 was nice because progress was made and Jun fencing with the soul mage is always gripping, and 69 was cool because it sets the stage for what appears to be a fairly unique story arc, but 68 was what did it for me.

I liked it because Valencia's situation seems to be evidence for the theory that Aerb's DM/OS/whatever allocates resources to individuals (be they "real" or NPCs) in accordance with their skill levels. Mary presumably spent a long time training her people skills, which would in real life manifest as skill at cold reading at peak levels but in the simulation just means she has high SOC scores and thus gets more processing power allocated to her "mind reading" subroutine. Fenn could shoot literally supernaturally well after her Archery skill got boosted - more evidence that skills aren't governed by the mind/body (and thus inherently capped) but by some inscrutable simulation mechanism.

And IMO if this theory holds water then Valencia is kind of OP. Going off what Mary said (killing skills of a thousand year old demon - - > unarmed skill of 200?) and how Valencia behaved (arbitrarily high INS score? to the point of being able to read past Jun lying to himself about his intentions to kill the soul mage and actually get a read on his subconscious/driving motivations?) she seems to be able to tap the skills of the demons that possess her. She's able to read people to a frankly ridiculous degree that may actually be a telepathy analogue (at least when it come to intentions, not so much raw info) provided by the game layer. She's able to lie extremely well - she didn't just control her reaction, she came up with a very plausible/unfalsifiable lie in the form of color blindness in like three seconds flat. We've only seen demons express social agitator skills thus far, but if their combat skills are polished to the same inhuman degree then Valencia could end up being really dangerous.

And I mean that in more than just the fighting sense. It was all but confirmed that the demon didn't get "chased off by second guessing", but rather played dead and facilitated Jun forming a connection/establishing twin souls. And Valencia confirmed afterwards that she knew Jun was shooting for a specific goal (twin souls) as a way to help her. So why did the demon allow this to happen? Was it unable to anticipate Jun's unique powers no selling the possession mechanism? Or - as we were reminded of by Jun's "is your skill unique" lie in 67 - was it entirely aware of the workings of Jun's power, since it was an old enough entity to remember Arthur running around doing the same stuff?

Exciting happenings! Jun's comment to the demon re "if I know you're untrustworthy I'll just not trust you" seems like a solid plan at first glance, but it brought to mind the "AI in a box" experiment. While I may not agree with all the conclusions drawn from the experiment, I do agree with the fundamental teaching that an intelligent enough entity has better odds at getting you to rub the lamp than you'd otherwise expect.

Let's hope Jun didn't just release a superintelligent AI equivalent into the world whose entire value system revolves around "loyalty to Jun". That's a bit too nebulous a concept to be trusted to restrain its behavior, IMO.
