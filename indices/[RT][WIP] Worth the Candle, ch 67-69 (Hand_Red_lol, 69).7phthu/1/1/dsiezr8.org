Err, they do control everything overtly. Literally and metaphysically.

Demons happen to cause some suffering on the mortal plain right now for fun, but they don't need to. Everyone that lives will eventually belong to them, which means they get to cause infinite suffering later.

To an immortal creature, the couple hundred or so years where people invented a way to annihilate their souls when they die is just a temporary anomaly (and vat grown souls might even make up for that).

From the demons' point of view, they're the absolute masters of Aerb at a fundamental level.
