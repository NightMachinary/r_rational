  Maybe "suffering maximizers" would get the message across, even if it doesn't fit into the utilitarian subcategories

Hmm. "Utilitarians" = "utility" + "-arians". If we're talking about suffering maximizers, then "disutilitarians" or "inutilitarians" are probably the correct forms. Or perhaps "[[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/p%C3%A2tir#French][patir]]itarians", if you want to backtrack [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/utility#English]["utility"'s etymology]] too.

I agree regarding the conspiracies. Albeit, hmm, if the devils only lied about the souls and are able to somehow subvert the infernoscopes (move people who got soul-killed to "deeper" hells? I think it was mentioned that modern infernoscopes are only able to see up to five thousandth layer), it wouldn't be /that/ complicated... but that sounds awfully like rationalizing away all inconvenient evidence.

Something to keep in mind, perhaps, but not the leading hypothesis.
