  Why isn't Aerb controlled by devils yet?
#+end_quote

I think that devils' possession has limits - not by other powers, but just in its nature. As Amaryllis stated in chapter 62:

  “It's short-term, hours at most, maybe longer if they chained it, but they're bad at coordination. If possessed, she'll only have the strength of a human,” Amaryllis had replied. “The kinds of devils that can reach up to puppet her won't be clever enough to be convincing, and if Fallatehr is smart, he'll have his people punch her in the mouth if she tries to convince anyone. I don't think she's a threat.”

So it seems like possession is only short-term, and that the kinds of devils which possess people are not "clever" enough to be convincing except in short spurts. And now that infernal topology has been introduced, my guess is that moving between areas likely has an effect on possession; perhaps devils are confined to certain regions, or moving away from an area close to hells makes possession even shorter. This would make it pretty difficult for individual devils to wreck much long-term havoc.
