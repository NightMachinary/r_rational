Well, if the level of insight that Valencia demonstrated at the end of chapter 68 is on the level of a not-clever devil, that only exonerates the problem. Knowledge that devils on deeper levels are more clever implies some information flow from there to Aerb; an entity as clever as these devils are implied to be should be able to exploit it.

Regarding infernal topology, yes, it seems reasonable. Though it still leaves the question of /why/ the devils are bad at coordination, and why the superintelligent deep devils can't make the lesser ones fall in line.
