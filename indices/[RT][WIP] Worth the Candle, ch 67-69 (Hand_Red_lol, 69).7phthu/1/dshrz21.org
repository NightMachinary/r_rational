Hm. Why isn't Aerb controlled by devils yet? If the devil Valencia inverse-puppetered here is representative of the general devil population, they're perfect actors and borderline-superhuman social experts, potentially also (going by Amaryllis' warning) brilliant warriors. Thousands of years of history and even brief periods of access to nonanimas should have allowed them to gradually take control of everything. Why didn't they? Possibilities:

- They are, in fact, bad at cooperation and/or long-term plans.

- Their influence is somehow limited, or counter-balanced by another power (read: group of (super)intelligent agents).

- They were much, much weaker for the majority of history.

- They don't want to.

- They do control everything, but secretly.

Additionally, did Valencia just make all other members of Juniper's group obsolete? Save Grak, maybe, given her inability to perform magic. She demonstrated cold-reading ability better than Amaryllis ever did, I think, is a better liar than Fenn, is likely a better warrior, and going by her comment about "making herself better"...

Infernal Capture must come with some major downsides to be balanced. Again, possibilities:

- Devils could still leave at any point, or there's some kind of time limit on possession: it's unreliable.

- Devils could choose which nonanima to possess, and simply stop possessing Valencia from this point onwards.

- This devil is an especially powerful one; regular ones are much weaker/dumber.

- Devils are heavily specialized.

- This is a ruse and Valencia isn't really in control.

Also, why didn't Juniper read the description of Infernal Capture? He was able to do it just fine with Symbiosis and Twinned Souls previously. That seems to be a major mistake, was he manipulated into it by Valencia, the devil, or Fallatehr? Or did I miss something?

Also, not mentioning to Amaryllis that Grak is likely to be truly compromised before leaving her with him for two hours seems to be another major mistake. Hmm.
