You know, I thought that was in the chapter. I think it might have been eaten during the course of editing. I'll add it back in once I'm done with typos (so, probably later tonight).

Edited: Updated. I think maybe I moved its position and deleted that when editing. Ctrl+F "companion passive" should find it.
