Ah, I didn't know that, cheers. Maybe "suffering maximizers" would get the message across, even if it doesn't fit into the utilitarian subcategories.

I forgot about the destruction part, that indicates that perhaps the demons aren't secretly in control. Unless they lied about used up souls not going to hell :O.

But it sounds like infernoscopes are easy to access for many people, so probably not. Otherwise the conspiracy would have to be so large and powerful there would be no point in keeping a secret. I think that as a conspiracy grows it becomes more costly/risky to keep the secret ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law][Metcalfe's Law]] in reverse). At some point it's cheaper to go seize the reins of government and publicly dictate what you want.
