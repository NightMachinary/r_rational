To be pedantic, "negative utilitarians" are people who believe that minimizing suffering is more important than increasing happiness, not people who want to maximize suffering. I'm not sure how to call the latter, though. Anti-utilitarians? Or even "negative anti-utilitarians".

No, no. It's optimized for /creating/ souls, sure, but not for sending them to the hells; they don't go there if they're destroyed, and the overwhelming majority of them is destroyed.
