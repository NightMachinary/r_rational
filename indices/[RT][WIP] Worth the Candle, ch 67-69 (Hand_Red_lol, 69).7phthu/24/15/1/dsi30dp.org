The debate is because ordinal numbers for dimensions were common in British English, whereas cardinal numbers were used in the USA. However, like "billion" (million million or thousand million?), modern computing has made the latter into an accepted standard everywhere except particularly stuffy university departments.

I do a lot of work with 4D data - satellite imagery often has x, y, time, and color dimensions, atmosphere and ocean have x/y/time/altitude - and this comes up surprisingly often.

So in modern usage the whole thing is /four-d/, and a line oriented along the fourth dimension is /fourth-dimensional/. The distinction is between saying number of dimensions in the first case, and saying which particular dimension (of some number) this one-dimensional thing is oriented along.
