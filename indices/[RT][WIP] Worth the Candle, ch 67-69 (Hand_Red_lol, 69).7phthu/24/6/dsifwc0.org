Chapter 69. Not a typo per say, but it left me slightly confused.

" Ropey stayed with me, on the theory that Ropey technically belonged to Amaryllis, and she could compel him to lie."

"*This wasn't something that she had mentioned* when I'd woken up in the morning, which made me slightly uneasy"

Should it be something "she had mentioned only this morning" instead of not mentioning?

Since both the Ropey and the situation for needing his unbiased opinion arised well before "this morning". Seems kinda strange for this suspicion to pop up just now, without a proper reason and the problem being not all prior instances of Amaryllis not mentioning it, but "this morning" exactly. It could be "she didn't mention it before", not just "this morning".
