Well, this is what made it confusing. It was 2 chapters after the fact, so i thought "in the morning" was a new day. Plus that exchange was so short, just a sentence with "clear", so i totally forgot it.

  to see whether anything had happened in the middle of the night, after Amaryllis had already been awake for a bit and was standing near him

If you mentioned that Juniper remembered the waking up to Amarylis standing near him, this would be a lot less confusing to me. I think recalling that short exchange is kinda hard, after two chapters of Juniper second guessing every move and with no clear indication of how much time has passed(maybe i just missed that).

Something like "This wasn't something that she had mentioned when I'd woken up in the morning *with her standing near me(in the room)*". I would have remembered or understood why he is worrying about it now.

But it maybe just me or reading this chapters after so much time has passed and not back to back.
