The Black Spire and White Spire have been foreshadowed in previous chapters as being something dangerous, as I recall they were listed with the mimsies and other excluded things. We don't know much about the Spires, but shit is about to go down.

Also the golden guy who's "leading" Joon and Fenn to the Spires is the equivalent of a Demi-God and is not a friendly.
