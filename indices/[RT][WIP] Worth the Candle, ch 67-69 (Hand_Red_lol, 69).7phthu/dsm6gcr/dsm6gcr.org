Just caught up with the story after the past few days and I've really been enjoying it.

I haven't seen any discussion about it here or in the thread on Chapter 64 (sorry if this has been talked about elsewhere). I am extremely bothered (in a good way) by how Joon's addiction to level ups is being portrayed. And maybe even more so by the fact that Joon /doesn't/ seem to be bothered by it at all.

He's observed himself getting more obsessive for the level up rush, to the point where he realizes that it's affecting his decision making in critical situations, but I don't believe that he ever actually thinks that it's a problem he should think about solving. I remember early on thinking that it's going to awkward when he explains to Fenn and Mary about the problem, but 300k words later and I'm pretty sure he never brings it up to anyone.

And with Ch. 64 he finds out that he values leveling up more than anything and just sort of glosses over it. (Also he doesn't say where he himself is ranked in his list of values, and I'm hoping that just means he didn't mention it and not that it didn't make the top 20 or so.)

At this point I'm wondering if the DM has literally put a mental block on Joon to make him not question the addiction.

...but at the same time as someone who has sunk a huge amount of hours into MMORPGs maybe I just want that to be true because the alternative hits a little too close to home?
