Unless you put in place that the cosmic narrative horror can make human mistakes. Or like in real D&D is forced to wing it. And just like D&D the characters can and will attempt to subvert what they can. This can lead to campaigns spiraling out of control of even the best Game Masters.

Like Jun said, there are unspoken rules in place to at least keep the appearance that it isn't just a straight up game or being railroaded.
