Yeah, i mentioned this in some prior parts and even here with my HUGE comment.

Maybe it's the "in universe forced narrative structure", but so far every conflict that the party was a part of tend to be resolved in murderhobo ways.

Wait, it just hit me now. I think there are literally 0 people outside of the party that they formed a friendly connection with. People they interacted with are either dead or betrayed them in some way. The only exception is the Bone mage, but it was just paid services and i don't count those or every clerk and shopkeeper would be a part of the story. I think it's a fun problem of the RPG to real world transition, people outside of the mentioned "sell\buy NPC's" do not exists so far. Maybe i forgot someone.
