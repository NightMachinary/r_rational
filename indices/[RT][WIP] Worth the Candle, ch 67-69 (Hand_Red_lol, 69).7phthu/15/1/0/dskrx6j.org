Up until the prison they hadn't killed anyone who wasn't trying to kill them. In the prison they quickly switched to killing allies because it would be convenient later, with little to no qualms. A simple explanation of this is that the prisoners were criminals, and hence it was 'okay.' I posit that a few hundred years should be enough to assuage the straightforward 'criminals don't count as innocents' moralization.

I mean that they haven't actually looked into what the prisoner's did or who they are, but are happy to kill them because it would be strategically beneficial. They all seriously hate Fallatehr and were planning to betray him well before he actually did anything to them (except for the void bomb but they actually don't seem to care about that at all).

There are several other explanations. One is that they are just that afraid of Fallatehr's mind control abilities. But they weren't that wary or cautious until experience bit them. One is that they think he is a monster who would wreak havoc on the world, but they talk about this and seem to agree that he is a fairly laid back scientist, not a megalomaniac.
