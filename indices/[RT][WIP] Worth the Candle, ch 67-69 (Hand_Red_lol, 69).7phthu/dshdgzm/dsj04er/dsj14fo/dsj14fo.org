You did, it was copied.

Thanks, for the advice. I doubt anyone would check the previous version. This would not have an update if i didn't remember it at the last moment.

I just posted it late in the Chapter 65 thread and thought people might have missed it.

Since no one responded to my points, i will just think of new ones if they appear or repost this after 40+ chapters, if it's still relevant. Maybe at that time someone would question\discuss them.

The only new thing is - Edits and the part after. I hope upvotes is a sign of people at least reading it, maybe partially.
