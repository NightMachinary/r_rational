I like this story and may be this is just a personality difference between me and the protagonist but if you're in a situation where there's a club of people offering to help you fix your time-warping super powers maybe you should hear them out, negotiate things. Now, I understand that psychological and physical stress and fatigue can make it difficult to make good decisions, and that's why I think the response is still realistic, but stupid.
