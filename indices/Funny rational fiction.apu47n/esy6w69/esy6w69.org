Very late addition, but: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-is-a-dragon-and-thats-okay-hp-au-crack.731548][Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay]]. It's not often laugh-out-loud funny (though it has its moments), but it is filled to bursting with whimsy and joy, and Harry has the unusual skill of seeing and stating the obvious. (Which even HPMOR Harry sometimes lacked!)

edit: Also, the author has described Dumbledore of the fic as "Havelock Vetinari doing a comedy old-man act", and that seems quite accurate.
