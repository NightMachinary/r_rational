[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Cook#Wizardry_series][The Wiz Biz book series by Rick Cook]] is hilarious, ingenious, and began my love of rational fiction. I have the first half of the series in storage somewhere, and intend to re-read and finish it someday.

Probably the most memorable non-magical moment in the series is when the Wiz travels back to Earth and attends a computer conference where new software is shown. He runs across some guys who wrote a computer program that interprets any sufficiently large/complex file into a still pornographic image. The concept intrigues him, and he asks how big the main executable of the program is, and what happens when they run it through itself. They ponder it for a moment, try it, and then wonder how many state decency laws they just broke.
