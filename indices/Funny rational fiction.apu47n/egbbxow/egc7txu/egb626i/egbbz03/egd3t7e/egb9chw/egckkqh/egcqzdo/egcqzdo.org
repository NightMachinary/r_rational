The early chapters are a little rough, but once the author finds his groove it gets really good. The mental duel with Baroness Kohl in [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/33512/60/myouve-gotta-be-kidding-me/battle-of-wits][chapter 60]] in particular is amazing (even though Kohl's power is literally just Tsukuyomi from /Naruto/). Shame it is dead, but if you ignore the last two chapters the story actually comes to something like an ending.
