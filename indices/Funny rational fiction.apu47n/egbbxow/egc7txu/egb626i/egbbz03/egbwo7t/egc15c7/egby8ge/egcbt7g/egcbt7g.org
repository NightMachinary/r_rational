Kind of related, but think of it as analogous to "what men think male objectification is" to "what women actually want to see".

The Hugh Jackman magazine covers:

So a male fantasy of a nympho woman might have the woman pursuing strong men, or possibly men who are actually the author's SI; a woman's fantasy is more likely to feature men who are attractive for reasons other than BRUTE STRENGTH. I mean, not always, not exclusively, but personally I'd rather sleep with Dad Hugh than Wolverine Hugh.
