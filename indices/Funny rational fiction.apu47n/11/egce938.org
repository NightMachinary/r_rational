I found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8078340/1/Postnuptial-Disagreements][Postnuptial Disagreements]] very funny. It's also rationalish in the sense that the main characters are intelligent and the story escalates very nicely. You might need some knowledge of the Fate/Stay Night series though.

I also second the recommendation of Seventh Horcrux but that's less rational I think.
