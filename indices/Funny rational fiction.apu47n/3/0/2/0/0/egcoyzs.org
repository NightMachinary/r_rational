Now I've decided to do a google search of [[https://www.google.com/search?q=hugh+jackman+magazine+covers&safe=off&rlz=1C1GCEA_enAU807AU807&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjY9aevy7fgAhUOcCsKHRB9AwwQ_AUIDigB&biw=1680&bih=917][Hugh's magazine covers]]. It seems, in general, he looks classy/friendly rather than "RAWR WOLVERINE".

Here's a summary of what showed up on my non-anonymous search (YMMV):

DT (spanish-language high-end men's magazine): wearing a nice suit, adjusting his tie.

muscle & fitness: muscles. wolverine.

ioacquaesapone: some sort of italian magazine. seems general, not aimed at a market. He's wearing a tux and adjusting his tie and showing off a nice watch.

good housekeeping: dad!hugh

GQ: men's fashion. he's looking very... stylish? he reminds me of a submarine captain

men's fitness: you can see his pecs and arm muscles, but he's not looking like a bodybuilder, just a standard built man

vanity fair: he's surfing(?) i think he looks pretty attractive like this with his hair wet?

tv media: smiling with a woman's hand on his face wtf. he looks cute?

men's fitness 2.0: tighter shirt, more obvious arm muscles

GQ 2.0: he looks like he's got a hunched back i don't even. he doesn't look like a dad, he looks like... a politician? idk

augustman (singapore high-end men's magazine): he's wearing a coat and kind of covering his face a bit with the collar? I don't understand this

men's health: arm muscles obvious, he's doing a kind of "claw" motion with his hand and looking grumpy

okay i think i've looked at a bunch of covers now and all I can really tell is that high end men's magazines show hugh wearing expensive clothes and looking fancy and fitness/health magazines show him looking a bit buff, and there is like only one women's magazine in the list so that was a kind of waste of time

note: i'm actually faceblind so I'm taking it on faith that all these covers actually depict hugh jackman

other note: my post was meant to be a demonstration of the sorts of differences one might detect rather than, like, a peer-reviewed paper.
