"I'm famous. I wear stylish, good-looking clothes. I'm well-built, but not unreasonably so. Perhaps this magazine will contain advice that will allow you to emulate my success on one of these fronts." With more of an emphasis on 'well-built' on the fitness magazine covers.

I haven't /seen/ these covers, but that seems like a reasonable theme, from your descriptions.
