Note that this sort of thing could easily be cherry picked by choosing what magazines to look at. Like, given that a magazine exists called "muscle and fitness", I don't think the fact that it sells itself with pictures of muscle bound hunks tells us much more.

I wondered if Cosmopolitan would have different pictures of Hugh than Good Housekeeping would. [[http://m.coolspotters.com/brands/adidas/and/magazines/cosmopolitan/media/1054009][It appears not]], so that corroborates your position.
