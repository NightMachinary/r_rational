Well, it's got one particular very-high-status man who ends up entangled with the female protagonist in a way that gives her tremendous power over the relationship, and this female protagonist is a virgin who does not have sex with anyone else or express sexual attraction to anyone else over the course of the story. But I can understand how this would confuse people into perceiving a male fantasy of a female nympho, since the female character has any sexual thoughts, at all.

Conjecture but not a confident one, since you can't read the minds or intentions of people from their writing: OP has never read a romance novel.
