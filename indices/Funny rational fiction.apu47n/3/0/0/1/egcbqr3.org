Nope; you're falling into the common mistake of thinking that a woman is just a gender-flipped man. Nothing could be further from the truth. Women don't fantasize about nymphos or harems, of whichever gender; those are male fantasies, as can be seen in porn and harem anime, both of which are aimed at men. To see what women fantasize about, read romance novels and watch romance movies; those are aimed at women, and make good money depicting their fantasies.
