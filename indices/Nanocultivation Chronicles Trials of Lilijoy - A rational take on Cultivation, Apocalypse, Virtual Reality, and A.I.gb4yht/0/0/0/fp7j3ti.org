its been a while but i thought it was explicitly stated the higherups in the VR academy were explicty listed as NPCs and their was generalized distrust of outsiders, yet the MC is respectful to her teacher and then it comes out her teacher is a super powerful special teacher who came back because of "reasons"?

also lots of the story the MC seems to be extermely reactionary; she is chased by people in the scrapyard; is chased by people in the shelter; is chased by people outside of shelter; is hunted by perople in the sancatury; enters the VR, and almost immeditaly just agrees to assault a high level enclave despite adkweondlging that people who get caught doing this are tortured for infinity and thus "torture banned" all well the MC is stil gaining SIGNFICANNT skills almost every week; and the entire justifaction for why theirs a time crunch is 1 of her accuqantices was "allocated/kidnapped/aquried" by a guild; yet shes fine with leaving all the other people she knew from that time period to be on the border of starving and scavenging in a toxic wasteland and dieing from exposure every couple of years; it just seemed absurd
