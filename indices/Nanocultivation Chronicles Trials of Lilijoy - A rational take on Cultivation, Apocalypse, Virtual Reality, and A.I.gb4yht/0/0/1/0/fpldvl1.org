Yes, the MC did help one such poor person. Happens in real life all the time - charities, individuals, etc. do help poor people that nobody else had helped before. Small-scale charity is easy. It would be irrational if she easily fixed the whole town when nobody had done it before.

They are trying to scale up in recent chapters, and I'm sure the associated complications are coming, too.
