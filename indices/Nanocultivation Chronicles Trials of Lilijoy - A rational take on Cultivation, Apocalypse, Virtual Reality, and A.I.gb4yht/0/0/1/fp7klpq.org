sorry i might have some details wrong but if the people in the village near the academy arent NPC's then that even strengthens the argument since the MC comes in with like no kwoldeghe of the system and "just so" happens to have tons of fortuitous events compared to someone who saved for multiple years and long term planned for the situation yet ended up like that.
