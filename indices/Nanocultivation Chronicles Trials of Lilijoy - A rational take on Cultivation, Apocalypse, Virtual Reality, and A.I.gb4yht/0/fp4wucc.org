I read this a while ago before I gave up following it; I don't think this story is rational especially the vr aspects it had a lot of tired tropes: the most glaring was supposedly people have been using the VR world for years yet no one thought to try and teach the NPCs skills, then the MC who is such a great person decides to treat the NPCs as people and gets massively rewarded.
