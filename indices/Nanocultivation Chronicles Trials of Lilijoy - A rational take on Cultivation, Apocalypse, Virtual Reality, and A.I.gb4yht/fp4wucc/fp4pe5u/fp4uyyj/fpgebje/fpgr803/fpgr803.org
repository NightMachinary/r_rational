It's a common trope to some Chinese webnovels that has been copied a lot recently in America web serials. It combines the character leveling and skill gain plot devices with Chinese mythology and Taoism. Sort of similar to dbz in some ways with their power ups.

General idea is that you breath in spiritual power and circulate it through a special vein structure specific to this power before storing it in an organ called the "dantian".

Overtime you learn to use, grow, and condense this power and it changes you from a normal mortal to an all powerful immortal capable destroying mountains with a single punch and summon blasts of lightning to strike your enemies.

Basically every main character is the Chinese version of the magic swordsman trope but with more historical and mythological context and less technology.
