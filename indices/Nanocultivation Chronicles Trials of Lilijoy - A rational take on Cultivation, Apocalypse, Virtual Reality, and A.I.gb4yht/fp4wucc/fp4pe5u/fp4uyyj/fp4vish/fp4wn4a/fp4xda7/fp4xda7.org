Some of the abilities gained their do transfer over, the ones her system is capable of replicating, though you are right that magic and some of the less natural ones don't.

I do believe that the, Inside is just as interesting as the outside though. Maybe I have a soft spot for LitRPG, but the idea of an alternate dimension (which Inside basically is) that influences the world in a social and economic manner, without taking away from it, is very interesting to me.

I agree that the Outside is more Original in setting and execution, but I don't think it would be that way without the Inside portion of the story.

The cultivation of outside doesn't go away while inside. By the end of book 1, the author has managed to tie the progression of both together very well.

To each their own though, as I said VR is divisive, I personally avoid it like the plague in most cases, so I don't blame you.
