Virtual Reality is always divisive, I personally haven't found another besides this one that does it for me.

The VR aspect in this story is fine with me cause I find it believable in a way others aren't, the fact that it is being controlled and run by what is basically a god like entity, it makes sense that it is so realistic and that there are actual, sentient, natives.

It all comes down to the fact that the VR element is actually tide into the themes, the Idea of Paradox and what makes something real or fake, if you didn't manage to get to the academy part of the VR section, then I Highly Recommend giving it another go, the characters introduced are important both Inside and Outside, and are just as good as any of the 'real' ones.
