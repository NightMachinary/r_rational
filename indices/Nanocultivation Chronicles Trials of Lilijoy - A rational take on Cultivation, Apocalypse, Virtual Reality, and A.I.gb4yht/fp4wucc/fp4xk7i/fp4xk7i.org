I don't know what you are talking about, plenty of people treat insiders as normal people, Lily is not unique in that, and if you are talking about the people from the academy village, then they /aren't/ NPC's they are outsiders who have been oppressed and lied to, that MC and friends are trying to help.

Also why can't a trope be rational when executed according to the rules of the world and in line with the goals of the characters involved? That is a core part of PGTE.
