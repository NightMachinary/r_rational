I believe I got to the start of the academy arc, so it introduced her roommate and the roommate's mission. To me, the author created this unique cultivation with nanotechnology which I was interested in with a cool post apocalyptic setting. The virtual reality just seemed too removed for me and the fantasy like abilities gained in the virtual world didn't translate into the reality that I cared about so it seemed a bit pointless to me.
