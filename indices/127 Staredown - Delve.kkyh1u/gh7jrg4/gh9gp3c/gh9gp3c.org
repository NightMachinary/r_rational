That's disappointing to hear. I'm sure many of us like Delve because it was originally one of the more rational litrpg isekais with an actual focus on optimizing builds instead of the usual lazy shit we see.

These chapters though, I feel Rain is getting more and more inept and irrational. From literally forcing democracy down people's throats(not a good way to teach and sell people on something new, asshole!) and now completely dropping the ball on the combat and planning aspects too.

I don't know the specifics of what you're talking about, but it's clear the Crimson Swords are definitely a major and risky potential threat. Rain has done zero preparations and countermeasures against these unknowns besides hoping things don't go to shit. Like Jesus Christ man, it shouldn't be this hard too for what is presumably a fight against the Crimson Swords, all you need is to bring Amelia, Tallheart, and Carten around, and perhaps keep the ranged, support, and healing members at a distance.

At this point I've read JP isekai series that are more rational and competent than Delve and Rain.
