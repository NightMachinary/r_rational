spoilers up to 134ch

​

I´m not a patreon but i read up to 134. The fight in ch133 is really bad writing. Forcing the conflict in a disadvantageous position with only Rain (a meh support) is the peak of stupidity and completly out of character from Ameliah. Are u telling me that 2 rational and competent people dindt discuss how to solve the crimson sword problem? if Ameliah was so set in fighting them Rain should know about it and support her beacause she is more experienced in such things. Why the fuck did they not fight next to their wall and with all the range combatants of the company to support them? why Rain was outside? Why Ameliah was so ill prepeared for the fight? everything that happened in ch133 reeks of bad plot device to get the love-birds badly injured. hell, even with preparation and an advantageous fight could end up all roughly the same with TH saving the day but actually being believable instead of the clusterfuck of bad writing it all ended up being.

This fiction dont have many good things going on for it but this was fucking stupid and the poorest resolution i saw in a long time. SS should get an editor ASAP and if he had it, then find someone better because an editor is there for making the author not falling for this kind of shit.
