100%. The whole situation in chapter 133-134 is just stupid and breaks any appeal of these characters for me. I did feel like chapter 135 /slightly/ improved the situation with Rain taking his immense shittyness seriously, but it's not enough. The whole thing felt like a setup to try and make Rain's pivot in attitude be more serious, but it's way too late for that to quite work. The author can't keep doing these /'and now the main character has learned his faults and takes things seriously'/ pivots and not have it just seem like bad writing, especially this late in the book.
