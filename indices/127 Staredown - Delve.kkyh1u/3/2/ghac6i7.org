These chapters definitely aren't the story at it's best, but I don't think they were really that bad. A lot of the stupidity can be reasonably explained in-character.

The MCs didn't know these guys were plate hunters, after all. Without all those Accolades, they wouldn't have been nearly as much of a threat. Ameliah might have been able to take on all three of them if it weren't for that. Not knowing about the plate hunting also led to the the MCs underestimating these guys' willingness to commit to a fight to the death. I interpreted Ameliah's actions as more of a threat display than an actual plan to start shit, not realizing that these guys were more than willing to go all in, even if it risked their lives and even if they didn't know what their opponents were capable of.
