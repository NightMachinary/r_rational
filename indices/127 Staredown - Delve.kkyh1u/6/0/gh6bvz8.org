Some shenanigans from the last chapter result in Rain having many new Accolades (although we don't know what most of them are yet), and also deciding to get Tallheart and Ameliah to take him into the Depths so he can finally start leveling again. He hasn't begun that venture yet, but he might start leveling again in the next few real-time months. He's also lost a great deal of that pesky naivete that has been turning me off the character for so long. I'm probably happier about him growing up than I am about the potential for System progress.
