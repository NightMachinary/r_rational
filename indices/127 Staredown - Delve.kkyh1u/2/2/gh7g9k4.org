  And just what the hell is Amelia doing?

Bailing.

She's been terrified of losing someone she cares about ever since her father died at a young age, so she's never allowed herself to grow attached to people. All her life she's moved around, never staying long with one party or making friends. And now she's realized she's grown too close to Rain and others in Ascension and that scares her.

So she tried to bail. Left her Ascension cloak behind and everything. Didn't even say goodbye, just flew off. But then she made a Crystal Slime on a whim and it didn't fist bump her and she apparently realized she it's too late, she's already grown attached and is now coming back.

Yeah, it's kind of Idiot Bally, but at the same time, Ameliah has been the most competent character in the story since literally chapter one. This is quite possibly the first mistake we've seen her make, ever, it's one that has had very little in the way of actual consequences (he said, ominously; not a Patron, please no spoilers), and it's one she's rectifying on her own. It's kinda heavy handed, but it is nice to see that the Perfect Jack isn't actually perfect.
