Given the spoilers posted here I think I'm going to drop this story. It isn't any one factor that makes it frustrating but a combination of a massive number of small problems. The primary problem is the pacing of the plot vs the amount of time between chapters and the very short nature of the chapters content wise. Sure there are like 5000 words a chapter but those words don't end up getting you anywhere. And the content we are spending words on is both the worst aspect of the author, primarily character development, and the worst thing to not be concise with, character development.

There's "slow burn" and then there's "no spark".
