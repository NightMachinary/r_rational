Hearing what I've been hearing about the recent patreon chapters, althought I'm not a sub, has been making me want to drop this story.

I've been reading it for the worldbuilding and the rational actions, and both are mostly gone in favor of shitty romance and lucky coincidences. Once Rain starts acting competent again (I don't care if he gets a blue or not, the lack of them is reasonable) then I'll repick up the story. Does RemindMeBot still exist?
