  Is every Guildie as malicious as the Crimson Swords?

Take any three men, take away all police or authority, and give them superpowers that make them absolutely untouchable over 751 people living in a city, and by comparison those three are saints. And if you think people aren't like that because you think you could be trusted with that power, imagine how much you'd trust just giving your bank card and pin number to three strangers on the street and expecting them to be moral enough not to take advantage.

That this city isn't their own little Lord of the Flies fiefdom says good things about them. That's what the conversation before the scene change is about, where Rain is getting information to see if they're ultimately good people or not and they /did/ save his life.

Rain & Co is their biggest threat to life they've seen in a while. So gathering more information and having a plan to kill him makes sense. It's only trying to follow through with it that makes it psycho.
