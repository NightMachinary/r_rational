  Delve has been marketed as a rational and number-crunching optimization litrpg isekai, yet these chapters I feel more and more dissatisfied. Rain is completely inept at managing his company and does nothing to mitigate risks, among many other flaws like still not telling Amelia he likes her after all the shit he's gone through, cringe-y dialogue, and a completely farcical method of introducing democracy and leading.

As a Patreon reader, let me warn you, it only gets worse. After the most recent few chapters, I'm done reading this. Maybe I'll go back and try it again after it's a lot further, but it's too annoying at the moment.
