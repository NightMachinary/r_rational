  Is every Guildie as malicious as the Crimson Swords?
#+end_quote

Nope. Spoiler for latest patron chapter it's discovered they're murdering other guild members for accolades, something so heavily against guild law that it carries the death penalty. So far worse than average.

But overall xachariah has it right. Power does corrupt, there's a reason the Watch exists entirely to police high level characters.

  All it takes is one decently leveled unhinged psycho to ruin Rain's company and dreams

Talheart brings this up in the latest patron chapter. His view is that Rain actually is too low level to run something like Ascension, but he and Rain both agree that it was the least bad option given the circumstances of a destroyed city. So they agree Talheart will take them blue hunting to try and make the best of things.
