Is every Guildie as malicious as the Crimson Swords? The first thing they think of when seeing other Awakened is killing them in their sleep and betraying them, and it's clear they killed quite a few people, at least with Anton and Hegar. Not to mention their overt hostility. Anton and Hegar are incredibly shady, malicious, and dangerous. Anton was literally about to shoot Rain. Kinda worried in that department.

It's starting to make me think Rain is even more inept than I thought. Any meeting with these loose cannons without a solid plan could potentially be a mess, if they decided to attack and kill Ascension they'd lose most of their members if not all of them, especially when they don't have any of their high level members like Amelia or Tallheart around to easily stomp them. What is going on here? It's so risky and it feels like Rain is still naively hoping everyone is cooperative and friendly in a proven hostile and medieval world, you'd think he'd learn after Velika literally killed most of the Awakened in Fel Sadanis.

I'd personally have been very worried and have both Carten and either Amelia or Tallheart with everybody to shut them down in case they attack, and given their behavior and thoughts, that's not too unlikely. And set up a contingency plan to kill them later as their reputation in Vestvall isn't exactly the most reputable, or maybe I'm just the crazy murderous psycho here. Is it just me?

And just what the hell is Amelia doing? She knows they're about to meet a trio of 3 DPS adventurers that are all higher level than everybody else in Ascension except Tallheart, why would she suddenly fly off to some mountain and not return before her expected time and ensure nothing goes wrong? Unless there's a very good reason for all this, I think it's a big idiot ball moment, but fortunately this isn't a tragic or super serious novel where mistakes get punished.

Delve has been marketed as a rational and number-crunching optimization litrpg isekai, yet these chapters I feel more and more dissatisfied. Rain is completely inept at managing his company and does nothing to mitigate risks, among many other flaws like still not telling Amelia he likes her after all the shit he's gone through, cringe-y dialogue, and a completely farcical method of introducing democracy and leading.

Case in point, I felt so paranoid this whole chapter that something bad was going to happen. Perhaps it's because I've read too many shitty xianxia and webnovels where people murder at the drop of a hat, or maybe it's just me. All it takes is one decently leveled unhinged psycho to ruin Rain's company and dreams, and given the technological level of the world and people like Velika and the Empire, there are a lot of high leveled pyschos in the world. Anybody else feel this way?

Looking forward to the next chapter, I suppose.
