Travel back 1 hour Portal gun 120 feet away, rinse, repeat for on hour / whenever your time turner refreshes

Distances are no longer an issue for you, except for burning lifespan.

Depending on the specific rules around Time, by temporarily placing your portal gun offscreen an hour beforehand, you might be able to use this to temporarily have two or more portal guns, so depending on whether 120 is a limit of the portals or of your firing range, you can have someone else (maybe evil twin, if you feel bold) burn the lifespan instead of you.

I /think/ someone needs to burn lifespan no matter what though.

Also, you /can/ meet your future self, if you precommit to meeting your past self, but you'll need to be supernaturally good at mimicking any of the interactions you saw. Your players may get into endless precommitment issues unless you make precommitment schemes fall under Messing with Time. (since as a dm, you'll have to role play what they do in the parallel time-line, and that's complicated if it has any impact at all on the running time-line.)
