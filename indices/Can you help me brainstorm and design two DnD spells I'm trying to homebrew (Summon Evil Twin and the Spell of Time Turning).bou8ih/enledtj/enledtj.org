*Summon Evil Twin:*

This is really vulnerable to munchkinry, and it's not hard to get around the downsides.

Is the evil twin affected by copies of all the spells affecting you? Depending on how the targeting works you could cast Dominate Person on yourself beforehand or use a similar effect to force yourself, and by extension your evil twin, not to be evil.

Does the evil twin appear with equipment? If so, they can use consumable items recklessly and cast spells with expensive material components for you at no cost. If they appear without equipment, that's a lot more bookkeeping and it removes the ambiguity of which one is the twin.

The evil twin can be given suicidal orders, which means you can use them to activate abilities and cast spells that would be too costly to you to use otherwise. For example, in 5e an evocation wizard could have their twin cast spells and use overchannel every turn at no cost to themselves, and an evil twin's castings of wish, while dangerous, might not come at the cost of using up the original's three wishes.

Also, what happens to the evil twin of someone like a Cleric, Paladin, or Druid, whose abilities are at least partly tied to their beliefs and morality?

I'd make this spell similar to Simulacrum, so give it a permanent duration and have the twin appear without any spells prepared for the day, ongoing spells on them, or any equipment. That cuts down on some of the most obvious tricks. Giving the caster and twin a negative level each might also help the balance.

Alternatively, if you want Precisely Bound Demons, why not just include some literal demons that have been precisely bound, and let the players find the item used to issue commands? That way you get around a lot of problems, in particular the issue of players disputing how the evil version of their character would respond to their character's orders.

*Spell of time turning:*

Wish can change the outcome of a single roll that happened last round. Time stop, the closest time magic I can think of, has a duration of rounds. Compared to these, I think making this 9th level and going back 1 minute, rather than 1 hour, would be of similar power.

Also, the restriction on stable time loops could be easy to get around with spells like Modify Memory and illusions, if you just need to convince your past selves that what they saw was real.

*Open Portal:*

D&D is not a good physics engine. I'd suggest instead describing existing spells and effects in terms of how they work with portals. Feather fall? Produce a portal below them that's linked to ground level as soon as they start falling. Reverse gravity? You're juggling people with portals so they're constantly falling. Telekinesis? You're using portals to produce the same effects. Classes that already use a lot of teleportation effects would be a good starting point.
