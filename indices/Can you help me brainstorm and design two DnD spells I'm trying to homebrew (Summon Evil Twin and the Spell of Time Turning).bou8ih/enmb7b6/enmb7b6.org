The simplest way to handle time travel is the save/load version. When you go back in time, everything that happened within the last hour is undone except your memories, your mind/soul return to your body wherever it was one hour ago, there is no second copy of you, history begins recording from where you left off and does not have to do the same thing as it did the last time, you do not have to travel back in time a second time at the end of an hour.

This is not how Harry Potter time turners work, but is much more sane and consistent.

Note that if you do it this way you will want to have just their minds travel back (and maybe health/spells/experience) but prevent them from duplicating items.

Summon evil twin seems overpowered if you can just summon it in combat and give it one command per turn, as you can just literally specify which target it attacks and which skill it uses on it. I would suggest having this be a more long-term thing where you have to give it vague directions that can lead it for multiple turns. Maybe you have to give it all of its commands in advance as soon as you summon it, like "kill all of my enemies", which then is vulnerable to the DM misinterpreting what an "enemy is", so to be safer you might say "kill every goblin near me" if you're in a combat where the enemies are only goblins, which backfires if there are friendly goblins, or you want to take prisoners, or a boss that isn't a goblin shows up.

So either you can only give it commands at the beginning of the summon, or once every so long, A more extreme version is if you're making the evil twin be part of an artifact, you could have the evil twin be a permanent member of the party that is always following them. Maybe it has a list of commands that it's following, so you need to have them be general enough to govern its everyday behavior, but you can only add, remove, and modify commands at sunrise or whenever you get new spells. This way, if players make a mistake and the evil twin is exploiting a loophole players have to restrain it rather than being able to instantly modify the command to stop it. This also prevents the players from spending several minutes out of game arguing about the perfect command in a round of combat that's supposedly 6 seconds. Players only give commands during a long rest period, when it makes sense for the character to have a long time to think of something.

In any case, I would suggest both of these to be a legendary artifacts that cast that spell, rather than something any caster can learn. They're kind of really powerful if used right, and so you want to control how many times the players can cast them, and explain why the bad guys aren't using them to do the same things. A world in which any sufficiently strong caster can time travel would have soooooo many differences. Every sufficiently rich and powerful person or group, especially kings and millitaries, would have as many casters who could use this spell as possible, and you would need to figure out how to handle bad guys anticipating your heroe's every move (especially since you yourself can't time travel). A legendary artifact shuts all of that down and gives an excuse for only the players to have this power.
