Honestly I'd allow /Open Portal/ as a reskin of /Dimension Door/, if you add some caveats. I'd put in that one portal must be on a surface within five feet of yourself, and it can only transmit a total of 2x your carry weight before the portal collapses.

It's got a bit more tactical utility than DD (you can pull someone out of danger from range, or get rid of a monster that's right next to you), but a bit less strategic utility (you can no longer teleport blind).
