What this guy said.

Summon evil twin with precise wording will make players waste a lot of time. Also it is overpowered, you are giving yourself double action for the whole fight. Not so bad if you are playing 3.5 where high level fights are bullshit and losing one full action (not one turn cause only n00bs have one full action a turn in 3.5 high levels) could make sense.

/Spell of Time-Turning/ Players will create pardoxes. They will try to make them no matter what even just to see how the DM reacts.

Open Portal. I would say it is fine, but be prepared with dungeons and castles being destroyed by it (Players do not even need to be original, just rip Portal 2 ending: portal to the moon)
