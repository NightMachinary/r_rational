Also, it's worth bearing in mind that Time Turner presumably doesn't let you move in space... so if going back an hour to where you are now would cause a paradox, casting the spell fails.

Say the PCs are infiltrating a castle and stumble into a guardroom, alerting lots of elite guards and getting into a fight they can't handle. If they cast Time Turner right there, they'd go back in time and appear in the guardroom - but if that had happened, all the guards would already have been on alert an hour later and they'd never have been able to sneak in.

So this gives the DM a right to veto using the spell if it would cause an instant paradox.

But smart PCs can use this another way: observe the unalerted castle, go back in time and sneak in, and they can't fail any sneak rolls, because otherwise they wouldn't have seen all the guards snoozing an hour later. So maybe it's too easy to abuse.
