The time turner spell runs into the issue that you can't actually see the future.

E.g. say the caster says "in 1 day I'm going to come back and tell myself everything that happens tomorrow so I can prepare". What do you do? You don't actually know what will happen over the course of the session, that's half the fun of role-playing. So you have to:

- Tell them your best prediction, then railroad them through it. (Boring.)

- Nothing happens, then you prevent them from casting it somehow. (Implausible that this always happens.)

- Lie, then railroad them into lying (worst of both worlds.)

None of these options is particularly fun, especially if it keeps happening.

Here's one way to simplify: play as normal, with no time travel apparent. Then when they cast, say that they can do whatever they like in the past, but if they do anything that would be apparent to their past selves then the spell ends and they return to the future.
