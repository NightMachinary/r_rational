I'm interpreting these as 3.5 rules. (use [[http://d20srd.org]] )

Open Portal is simply Teleportation Circle, a 9th level spell, with less range. Spell of Time Turning is simply overpowered. There's an Epic spell, Time Duplicate, that allows you to get a copy of yourself for one round. Does Evil Twin create matching magic items? It's comparable to Clone, an 8th level spell.
