For Time Turning: the spell fails if it leaves evidence that time travel happened.

The player has to make the altered timeline look like "just ordinary good luck," or the spell fails.

That is, "the spell fails without effect, unless the altered timeline looks to all current and subsequent intelligent observers like something that happened without time travel, and with no more than an ordinary level of coincidence or strangeness."

So it's on the player, not the DM, to avoid paradox. What's more, it's on the player to basically justify everything they set up in the altered past as something that could have happened without time travel anyway. And the more the opponents might suspect this spell, or just employ divination/detection in general, the less the player can get away with.

Thus the caster has to be very sneaky in the past, and make sure that everything that does happen... is something that could have, well, "just happened."

So it becomes retroactive luck, instead of something that lets you make the impossible happen. Because if anyone in the future is going to think "that makes no sense! it's too coincidental, too weird! how could that happen?" -- then the spell fails in the first place.
