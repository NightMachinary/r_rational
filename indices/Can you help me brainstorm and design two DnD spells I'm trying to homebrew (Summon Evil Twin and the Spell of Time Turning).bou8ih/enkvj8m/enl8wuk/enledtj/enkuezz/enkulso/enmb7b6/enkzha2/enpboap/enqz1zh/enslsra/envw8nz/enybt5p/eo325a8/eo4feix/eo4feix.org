The time travel one is inherently game breaking because of all the opportunities for abuse it opens. Like let's say the party does the chronotrigger thing of clearing a dungeon, going back in time to do it again, and repeat 3 more times. Or they do it to a merchant's house. The timeline has to repeatedly self correct and drop a bunch of money and artifacts in his lap so that he has the stuff they end up stealing and the party's wealth by level goes out the window. They don't even have to spend it in the present so whatever tracking spells on the loot there are won't matter. You end up having to change the rules on the fly to keep any sense of balance at all and it creates a frustrating experience for everyone involved.

You could do the chronotrigger thing of only allowing jumps to certain eras but it's pretty likely to still cause frustration if the players realize they can get an easy win against the big bad by finding out where the big bad has been, setting an ambush, and casting a spell to let them track him on a piece of his gear, hiding a scrying target on his person or something he takes with him as he escapes their future encounter, and use that to get him after the timeline fixes itself, but then they find out the only thing stopping them is a bit of gm railroading.
