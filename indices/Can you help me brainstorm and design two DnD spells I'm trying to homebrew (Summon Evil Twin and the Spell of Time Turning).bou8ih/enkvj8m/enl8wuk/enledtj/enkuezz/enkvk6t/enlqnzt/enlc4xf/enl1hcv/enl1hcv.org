That seems like the most fun way to do it. The other thing to specify would be that you can't chain Time Turner spells to go further back than an hour (unless you want that to be possible).

EDIT: also,in terms of being fun to play, the spell should be capable of sending the whole party back, not just the caster. Maybe it sends back anyone you're touching when cast.
