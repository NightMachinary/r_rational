I'm not familiar with summoning in D&D, but wouldn't that make the "Good Twin" disappear?

Also, if the evil twin is actually the opposite* of you, then in some ways they might be a better person than you - it is only if you are perfectly good, that they are perfectly evil. Additionally, while good people might not want their evil counterparts running around (and I'm a tad suspicious of the idea that everyone knows whether they're good or evil), evil people might have something to gain by having good counterparts running around - it might make it more likely that people trust you. Additionally, if your duplicate has duplicate money, then we might have a scenario where people who are good are sometimes caught robbing their identical twins, while evil people are caught giving their money away, or to good causes - and reminding bystanders that they are a terrible person who cannot be trusted. Stories like Jekyll and Hyde pop up, but with a twist - sometimes both of them have been spotted in the same place, at the same time. People become suspicious of twins who are the same sex, especially identical twins...
