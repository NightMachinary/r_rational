/Summon Evil Twin/ will grind your game to a halt unless your players are very supportive about Rule 0. You (and your players) be trying to adjudicate (and argue about) wish-like clever phrasing *every turn while in combat*.

​

/Spell of Time-Turning/ is a 9th level spell, most likely. It sounds like a lot of fun, but I would have in mind a reason for it to be temporary, since "I teleport home and bring everyone I know to the fight" is a pretty funky mechanic. Meanwhile, it is non-paradoxical for a player to announce , "I arrive from an hour in the future and tell myself everything that happens in this dungeon," as long as in an hour they remember to do so. But Divination spells are already broken so maybe it's fine?

​

/Open Portal/ is pretty great. 5th level probably? You've got two sessions before someone reroutes a river into a dungeon or castle -- the solution to this is elevation changes within the dungeon to stop water flow.
