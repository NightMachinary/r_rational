You should probably specify what happens in-world if players using the Time Turner spell try to do something that creates a paradox, either wilfully or by accident. Suppose they try to go back and warn themselves anyway: are they prevented from moving close enough to their past selves by an intangible barrier? Do they just find themselves unable to maintain the will to keep walking in the direction of their past selves, and compelled to walk away as their past selves approach? Or does fate intervene in a way that seems like an accident?
