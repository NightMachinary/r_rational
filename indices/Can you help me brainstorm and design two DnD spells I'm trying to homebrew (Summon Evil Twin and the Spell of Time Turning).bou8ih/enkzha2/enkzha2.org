  Summon Evil Twin
#+end_quote

Reminds me of Ice Assassin, but I suppose that would be someone else's evil twin.

You could just order your Evil Twin to summon another Evil Twin. Which would be good (or whatever your alignment is), and also is the first step to having a massive army. It seems OP.

You could cast Modify Memory on yourself to trick out time. Or erase your own memory before you go back, so you don't have any memories to contradict and anything could happen.

  Works exactly like portal gun from the portal game. You open two 10-feet wide portals on any surface within 120 feet you have a line of signt to.

I'd add that it must be unobstructed even by transparent objects, so you can't open one end to the bottom of the lake. Though there's so many other ways to abuse that it seems pointless.
