Good points!

I don't think Evil Twin army would work though. There's some kind of time limit on his existence, and when you cast Evil Twin you spend a spell slot, so he will have one spell slot less.

Although, if Evil Twin summons his own opposite, you will have a copy of yourself aligned with your goals =) But it would have to obey Evil Twin's commands. Hilarious =)
