Evil twin - lvl 6 and shares your spell pool. If he casts a spell it uses a spell from your spell pool. If you die, he becames you. Duration...minute/lvl ?

Spell of time turning - just no. Perhaps for a villian. No on players. Max level spell for a villian, usable once per week. Chance of pulling heroes close to villian into the time loop.

Open portal - cool spell, it would be cooler as a new class feature. Duration round/lvl - about lvl 4.
