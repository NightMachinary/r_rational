Good concept. That means that, thanks to Azkaban, digi-heaven is full of psychos and criminals who have been effectively de-psychoed by having their negative thoughts and memories left behind in the physical world while their good sides get uploaded into immortality.

This reminds me a bit of the TNG episode "Skin of Evil" where they encounter a manifestation of the residual negativity of an entire species that ascended to a higher state of existence.
