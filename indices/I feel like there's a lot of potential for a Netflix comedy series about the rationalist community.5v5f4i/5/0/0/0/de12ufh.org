It's like the old joke: "60% of the time the product works every time!" In the case of Gary the Schizophrenic Rationalist, there is no reason to separate out a bunch of meta-prior distributions. They should all collapse into one prior distribution as you say. If you are 60% sure that you are 100% sure of something, then you are definitely /not/ 100% sure of that thing. Other people have mentioned the Lesswrong article about probabilities in different models, or Jaynes' Ap distribution, but I'm not convinced that they apply in this case. Gary is trying to save face by inventing a new distribution out of thin air, and pretending that was his /real/ belief the whole time.
