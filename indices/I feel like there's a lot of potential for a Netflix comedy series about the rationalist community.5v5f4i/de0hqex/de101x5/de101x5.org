I actually don't mind laugh tracks for this style of humor. There are certain jokes that work better in front of an audience and aren't as funny when you don't hear a crowd chuckling with you. I wouldn't say it's my preferred style of comedy, but there are funny shows out there that wouldn't have worked as well without them. Frasier is probably my favorite, though it's produced and acted in the style of a stage show and has the high-brow wit you'd expect from that.
