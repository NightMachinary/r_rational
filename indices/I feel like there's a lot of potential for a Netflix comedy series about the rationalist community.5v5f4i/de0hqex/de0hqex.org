Some suggestions, in no particular order:

- add scenes and events describing how their “community of 4” gets split into /smaller/ communities because they keep having holy arguments about the finer points of things.

  - add scenes where they discuss how to design their bureaucratic hierarchical power structure.
  - Maybe Gary tries to arrange a coup but drops the project because he gets distracted or bored?

- make one or several characters be annoyed by Charlie's obsession with HPMOR, have them criticize the story from time to time with varying end results.
- explicitly ban usage of laugh tracks.
- add more side- and background characters.

  - a character that's aware about the community and its principles, and even finds them somewhat useful, but thinks that the /mind/ is the plaything of the body, and that just analysing your own emotions and reasoning patterns is not enough to develop emotional control or escape some emotional responses.
  - a character that's trying to prepare for various apocalyptic scenarios (e.g. undergoing related training programs, constructing a bunker, foraging for supplies, etc) but is having a number of unpredicted difficulties with their projects because of their anxiety.
  - a character who likes identifying as a member of that community because it makes them feel smart.

- use xkcd-style stick figures as the show's format?
- a scene or plot arc about them trying to design their own constructed language. The priorities they come up with (e.g. no biased words \ grammar structures), their successes and failures with it, the end result, etc.
