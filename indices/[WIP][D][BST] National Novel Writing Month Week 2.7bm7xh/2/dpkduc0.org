I have managed my word count every day, but just barely, and I know there'll be a day or two later in the month when I can't write, so any advice on creating more words in a day would be welcome. It's not that I'm short of time, juts that I start to lose focus and everything feels stale about 1500 words in every day. Of course that could be because it IS stale, but I'm going to worry about quality next month...
