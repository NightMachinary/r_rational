I have a couple of other projects on the go at the moment (completing an Esperanto course, proofreading With This Ring), so not taking time for NaNoWriMo this month, but I'm considering trying it in another month. Anyone's thoughts on which plot idea to run with?

1) Alternative story set in Mother of Learning universe. This is one I'd quite like to do, but I'm not sure about the writing format. MoL is so carefully planned out that I'd hesitate to follow it with any kind of rush job.

2) Filling in one of the many untold stories from the Obernewtyn series. There's surprisingly little on ff.net, and what there is is quite short. Maybe explore how the world gets rebuilt afterward, maybe write something from before their apocalypse.

3) What if the physics of The Skylark of Space were slightly more realistic, resulting in the abrupt deaths of the protagonists /and/ the villain when their respective spaceships promptly crushed them into goo with massive acceleration? They left behind technical details of what they actually built, but what would a lowly engineer actually do with a substance that can turn a teaspoonful of copper into an atomic-scale bomb?
