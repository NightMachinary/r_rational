Just passed the 15,000 mark today, and I'm realizing that I'm going to need a lot more than 50,000 words (or even the 64,000 I'm on track for) to finish up my outline. For context, I'm working on the same book I started in NaNo of 2015 and continued in NaNo of 2016 - against the NaNo RAW, I know.

So I'm about 135,000 words into my plot, and it feels like I'm only now tipping over the peak and on my way down. I.e., half way through. I've already gone through Part 1 and Part 2 and cut about 20,000 words, and I don't write a ton of filler to begin with. I think this book is just destined to be real damn long.
