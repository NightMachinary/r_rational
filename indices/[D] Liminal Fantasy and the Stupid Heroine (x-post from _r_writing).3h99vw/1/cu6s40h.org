  Death Note does this well.

This is probably nitpicking, but I would say comparatively well. A few of the "rules" of Death Note are made that way only the plot can progress to a certain direction as the author demands it.

In addition, the author of Death Note did not grasp the full ripple effects of his own rules, in that the shinigami eyes are *freaking time machines*.

Example: You have shinigami eyes, you kidnap a homeless person at 7:00 am. You trade a leveraged ETF and will make a lot of money by the end of the day. At the end of the day after the market is closed, you check if your chosen ETF has gone up in prices, if so, kill your homeless guy at 7:00pm, if not kill him at 8:00pm. Earlier, you used your shinigami eyes to see his remaining life span, it was 12 hours, you bought the ETF. Had his life span been 13 hours, you would've shorted the ETF. Either way, money is not important, you just discovered a way to send information back in time up to a few decades.

(Of course /DO NOT MESS WITH TIME/ clause apply in this setting, as the guy could've just died of a heart attack, or a shinigami could've intervened and killed him unexpectedly)

This is not really a criticism of Death Note, it still is one the most rationalist works in anime/manga (though it does have other flaws). I guess I wrote this to illustrate how seeming boring or unimportant rules could be physics-universe shattering. And it takes a certain quality in the author to recognize when it happens - after all not everyone can think of using a time machine to prove P=NP.
