The main point of this post might seem obvious to regulars of this sub - that characters with superpowers should apply some common sense to their use and not be limited by the way the plot requires them to be an angsty highschool teenage audience-surrogate.

I think it's interesting that BlondeRJ has felt the frustration of dealing with such idiot characters, and essentially re-derived the rules for writing rational fiction, even though she hasn't been involved in rational/ity/ at all. It shows the universality of what we call "Level 1 intelligence", presenting it as an obvious rule of good writing rather than a specific subgenre.

There's also a few good examples of how a rational character can end up not being a munchkin at all, which is something I haven't seen often.
