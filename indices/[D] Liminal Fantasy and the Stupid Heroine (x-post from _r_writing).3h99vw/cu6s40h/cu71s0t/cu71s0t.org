I don't think that works. It's like playing Newcomb's paradox with transparent boxes: the predictor predicts your actions, but your actions are affected by the prediction. Depending on how your actions are affected by the prediction, this may end up equivalent to the halting problem, where the predictor predicts X if and only if it doesn't. Having the prediction always work is literally impossible.

Considering that it's /already/ known that the lifespan shown by shinigami eyes doesn't count early deathscaused by the death note, it's not too big a stretch that it also might not count early deaths due to the use of other shinigami powers, including death that is causally related to using shinigami eyes.
