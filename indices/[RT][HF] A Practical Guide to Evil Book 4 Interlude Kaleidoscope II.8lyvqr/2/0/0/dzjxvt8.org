It would be oddly amusing if it turned out that the grey pilgrim is sexist.

He's supposed to be the old wizened hero, that dispenses wisdom the protagonist. Now most old fantasy was pretty heavily set in the gender roles, so we can find some basis there that the women are pure princess and victim of manipulation, but PgtE world so far seems relatively egalitarian on the gender issue. Like, there are some things like Goblins being a matriarchy but unless procer is a hotbed of it, there isn't much of a basis for the grey pilgrim to fall into that trap. (Though the title "first prince of procer" being a kind of weird about it, why not first princess?)
