I believe that this story is using an unreliable narrator, hence the flat descriptions. What we are seeing now is Grey Pilgrim's inability to fault women, while discerning only greed from male motives. Definitely seems plausible judging by the past chapters and some details that have been reinterpreted after the fact.
