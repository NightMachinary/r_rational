I think instead of assuming it's a flaw you should attempt a charitable reading. There are plenty of Non-Procerean male secondary characters in the story that don't fit your mould so I doubt this is a simple oversight. Adjutant, Robber, Ratface, Black, Warlock are all hyper-competent.

So what do we know about Procerean society? We know Procerean Princes are scheming because that is the nature of their reality. It's scheme or be out maneuvered and killed, game of thrones style. We also know Cordelia being a woman as First Prince is novel and she purposefully didn't take the feminized title to project power. This implies that while women rule in today's Procer they aren't normally considered Claimants to the grand prize of the throne. Likely, this means women rulers generally do not have to play the "game" of scheming as much as long as they can avoid getting usurped up by a neighboring kingdom during the decades of civil war. Hence a general competence and martial prowess being required for Procean women rulers.
