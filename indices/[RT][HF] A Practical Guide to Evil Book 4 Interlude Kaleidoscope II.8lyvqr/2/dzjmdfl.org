I know I've complained about this before, but it's becoming really weird that every single male Proceran Prince we see is shown to be a scheming, overconfident hypocrite, and every single female Prince is flawed-but-honorable pragmatist.

More generally, I feel like these secondary characters aren't varied enough. We don't really get much personality out of any of them besides "this one is an asshole" or "this one is principled". I wish we'd get more insight into their personality that isn't whether or not they like to scheme, or whether or not they're racist; most of them show very little self-awareness, if any.

Stuff like "This character has no military experience, but he has spent months before the campaign reading every military book he could find. He hope that's going to be enough".

Or "This character usually doesn't like working with Chosen. She's seen them upset the balance of power all too often during the Proceran civil war, making what should have been a sure victory turn into a defeat in a blink. She's been told that such was the natural order of things, for there was no higher arbiter for a war than the Heavens, and that wanting to decide battles through pure armies and logistics was Evil, but she couldn't help empathize with the perspective. It's funny, now that she's facing Evil, with Chosen on her side and logistics on theirs, she still feels drawn to the same perspective. Is it insanity, that she thinks her side ought to lose the coming battle? She tries push out the thoughts, as she addresses the other Princes."

My point is, I think the story should have more characterization that's orthogonal to whether or not they're Evil or honorable or racist; characterization that's no meant to make us like them or dislike them. ([[/u/ErraticErrata][u/ErraticErrata]])
