I read it as he has a 1/Day /Resurrection/ power that recharges as dawn, very much like something out if a pen and paper RPG.

However, the fact that he can bring them back just means that the villains will have to desecrate the hero corpses as a matter of survival (probably while being lectured as to how that makes them Evil by the side that gets free One Ups). Can he Rez them if they are missing a head? Not sure. Prettt certain they can't come back from Goblinfire though.
