  Queen Catherine had brutalized the children, but not beyond repair. Antoine's arm had been reattached, and another greatsword found for him to wield. With the coming of dawn, Tariq had been able to Forgive the death of Mansurin. The young man, displaying the famous fortitude of the Champion lines, had only been spurred to greater zeal by his stay Above. Little Sidonia, with her laughing eyes and quick wit, would have to remain under shroud of preservation until tomorrow.

I'm really starting to sympathize with Black now. Evil has quite a few dangerous weapons on their side, but the amount of trump cards and last-minute saves that the Good side can pull out is getting ridiculous. Fighting against Good does not appear to be the same thing as fighting Evil, and even though the Pilgrim and the Saint are arguably a special case, I'm not sure that Cat has gone up against any truly Good characters so far. (The Lone Swordsman was too edgy to make a good opponent for Cat (get it? /Get/ it?), and most of the other heroes she's fought so far have been relatively insignificant.) This is new for her.

I actually have no idea how Cat is going to wriggle her way out of this situation. She'll probably manage it somehow, but the Pilgrim and the Saint are not opponents she can beat through direct confrontation, especially with the Pilgrim being as genre-savvy as he is. She'll need to come up with a way to cripple the rest of their army before the heroes can engage her again or exert some form of pressure to force them to retreat (threatening future supply lines, political stuff, a more indirect weapon than absolute positioning), but I can't think of any obvious solutions. She's already used her big secret weapon.

Can't wait for the next chapter!

  The Pilgrim looked up at mockingly sunny skies. There would be a time, after the war turned here and the Red Flower Vales broke, where the Heavens would assemble their sharpest blade. The ancient forms would be observed. Five heroes, sent into the breach to quell the howling dark.

A random thought I had: What if Cat ends up replacing one of the five heroes? She's not Good, so whether or not this is possible is iffy, but it would certainly be in character for her to volunteer for this mission. Also, as the Pilgrim has noted, she tends to toe the line between Good and Evil; there might be enough flexibility for her to fit into this niche. Plus, the Good guys might be forced to pick her if Cat keeps murdering her way through the weaker heroes. (If anyone gets replaced, it'll be the Valiant Champion.) Not sure how likely this outcome is, but I'd still love to see it--the interactions between her, Hanno, the Pilgrim, and possibly the Saint would be glorious, even (and perhaps especially) if the Saint snaps halfway through the journey and tries to stab Cat. Which is pretty likely, given that Cat's typical response to aggression is to double down on the sass.
