My best guess would be making peace with Pilgrim and having Saint refuse to cooperate. Then both sides would come down on her. Even then, though, idk if she'd go down. She could probably take Pilgrim in a direct fight, and Cat isn't gonna be able to make much of a difference with what we've seen her display so far
