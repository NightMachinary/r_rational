> There would be a time, after the war turned here and the Red Flower Vales broke, where the Heavens would assemble their sharpest blade. The ancient forms would be observed. Five heroes, sent into the breach to quell the howling dark.

This is prophetic enough that it will probably come to pass, but it could apply to the Woe. None of them have overtly Evil names, and if they win here they are by definition the sharpest blade. The Red Flower Vales (and the Calamities) fall to Empress/Dead King, and The Woe have to stop them. I can see Cat et al crossing the floor if needed.

The problem with this is that there are a ton of ultimate tier heroes they have to surpass/kill to get the spot.
