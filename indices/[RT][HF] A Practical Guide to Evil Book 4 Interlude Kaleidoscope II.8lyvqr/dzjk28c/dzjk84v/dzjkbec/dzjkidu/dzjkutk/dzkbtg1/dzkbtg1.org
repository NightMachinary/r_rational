The Kensai needs to go down /hard/ before her OP-ness breaks any potential of an enjoyable story.

Armies, magic, siege engines, and Named-tier special abilities that even work on Demons have all had zero effect on her.

She either needs a weakness or a relatively equal opponent to appear soon, because it's really stretching believability as to why she doesn't just jog over to the villain side, assassinate all the Named and ranking officers, and then just wander off for the Muggles to clean up the mess.
