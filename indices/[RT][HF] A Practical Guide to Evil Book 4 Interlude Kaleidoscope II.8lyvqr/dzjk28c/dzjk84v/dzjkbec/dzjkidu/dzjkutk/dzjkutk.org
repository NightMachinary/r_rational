I agree that they're an immediate threat, but in the narrative sense, I think it would be pretty strange if she succeeded in killing a decades (centuries?)-old hero with a long history with a cheap trick or even a clever scheme. Maybe if she had already fought the Pilgrim on multiple occasions before and everything was building up to a single massive showdown, she could do it, but even then, it seems unlikely. Pilgrim is basically Gandalf--the wise old mentor who helps the heroes along but isn't necessarily the person to land the final blow. He's not going to die to a villain who isn't really that evil; he's going to go out at a crucial moment, sacrificing himself to let a younger, powerful hero go on and defeat some greater threat. It wouldn't really fit with his character.

The Saint of Swords is more vulnerable in that sense, but she has similar levels of power, experience, and narrative weight. I'd be surprised if Cat was able to kill her without insane amounts of preparation at the very least, which she doesn't appear to have at the moment. IMO, it's more likely that she manages to cripple the army in such a way that they're forced to retreat, either through killing enough troops or more subtle means (politics, supply lines stuff, etc.).
