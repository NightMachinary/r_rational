The Patreon rules have been like that since the beginning as far as I'm aware. Being a Patreon member gets you viewing access to the chapters a bit before everyone else, not sure how that translates to having concerns that the author doesn't have a "transparent business model" or worrying about financially-motivated delays? As a non-Patreon reader who's followed this author for a while, I haven't had any issues yet and this comes across a bit paranoid.
