"Another"? Didn't even think of that, but it makes sense. From the Patreon(portion visible to us beggars): "Early access to new chapters of Worth the Candle, 24 hours in advance, plus access to a channel on my Discord for discussion. Chapters will be posted publicly as normal the next day." Does anyone know if he had a patreon right from the beginning when he started writing WtC? I'm kinda concerned that there's gonna be more delays and nickle-and-diming towards the end of the story. Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful for the free content and a guy has to make money, but I much prefer a transparent business model and I'd further argue all the 'leeches' contribute a lot by word-of-mouth, reviews and finding typos -so it's odd to have to find out like that we have to wait longer. :/
