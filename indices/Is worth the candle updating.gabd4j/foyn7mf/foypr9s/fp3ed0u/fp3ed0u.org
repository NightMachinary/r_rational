He is now maintaining the story on 3 separate public platforms (ao3, royalroad, and his own website) so I imagine it's easier to give the patrons an extra day for consistency checks/typos while he still only has to fix it in one place. Things were presumably more convenient when any edits only had to be made on ao3.
