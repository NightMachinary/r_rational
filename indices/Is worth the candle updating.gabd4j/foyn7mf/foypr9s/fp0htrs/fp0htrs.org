This batch was going to be nearly the length of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, over 70,000 words, after the last batch (of 28,000) was released in March.

That's why this release is different. He asked his (free) Discord what they wanted, and I saw both of these ideas coming from people there. I know earlybirds do a ton of editing work, from typos to consistency, and I think that was part of the calculation in the longer lead time for this huge batch, too.
