This analysis immediately melts for me because it completely fails to take into account the fact that Gondor and Mordor have been fighting over Osgiliath for decades and the latter has more or less total control of their side of the river. The orcs probably already figured out the whole logistics thing by then, and the distance between Osgiliath and Minas Tirith is, like, a work commute.

He's acting like the entire army is just going out straight from Minas Morgul instead of the guys who see coming from there just being reinforcements to make the final attack. Which requires just taking what you see at the movie completely at face value and not making inferences of any kind.

Also the logistics thing is kinda dampened by the fact that, well, they're /orcs/. You don't necessarily /need/ to keep them supplied. The big more elite ones need to be fed. But for the rest he can just march them hungry, and throw them at the nearest source of food. E.G. Minas Tirith. Where there's a whip there's a way after all.

Also while it's more of a joke, this image subtitle at the very end annoys me.

Uh, because they're hiding? Because we already saw in the movies that the fighting in Osgiliath is basically urban guerilla warfare at that point? That's literally what rangers are for.
