Well...orcs have been out from Mordor for years fighting Gondor and we see massive reinfocements arriving from Faramir POV. So his discussion how Sauron marched 200k orcs from the Black Gate at once is wrong.

We see orcs running non stop for days, and surviving by eating each other. So his idea that supplying them would be next to impossible is wrong. They eat humans and each other and can survive long periods without food and still be active.

His idea that without roads orcs would be ineffective is also wrong, since we see them running for days on non roads when carrying hobbits and running from Aragorn. On top of that conflict has been going for years so the roads were probably already built.

Towers being prebuilt is mostly cinematographic and not a logistical issue.

An idea that Sauron wants to shut down Gondor as "administrative center" is laughable. He is afraid of ring bearers and one ring. That's the only reason he is attacking Gondor en masse. He does not give a crap about regular humans at all. He wants to draw out heroes before they are ready.
