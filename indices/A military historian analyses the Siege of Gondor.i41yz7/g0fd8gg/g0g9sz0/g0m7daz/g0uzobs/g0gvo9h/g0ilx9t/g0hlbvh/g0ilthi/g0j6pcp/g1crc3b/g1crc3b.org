Books/lore say there's a part of Mordor that is actually farmland. It's not all just a fuming toxic wasteland. I think you also get to see it in the Shadow of Mordor game, the second part of it, if I don't remember wrong. Orcs are basically just selectively bred elves, they may be ugly, stupid and angry as fuck but they still need to eat.
