Right of the bat hes so wrong, its like he didnt even watch the movie.

Boromir litteraly said Gondor has been fightning orc invasion for years, and Faramir was literaly shown the reinforcements from other parts of the world.

That means what when we see orcs marching from black gate, we actually only see elites. They number in thousands, but majority of the army is already deployed and providing infrastructure.

And while i agree that the army marches on its stomach, we have been shown the Mordor as a literal wasteland. I dont think orcs need much food, and they probably survive on canibalisam and replenish numbers from magic.
