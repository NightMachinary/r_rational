All blog posts of that author I read (Gondor , Helm's Deep, Case for Humanity) are quite weak. Average amateur military history, not even advanced amateurs which you find at dedicated forums. Surprisingly [[https://foreignpolicy.com/author/bret-devereaux/][his articles at FP]] and quite insightful and [[https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/concern/parent/3r074v31f/file_sets/5d86p0623][his PhD]] is interesting and informative. I guess he is well versed in Roman History but not so good at everything else.

PS from his PhD his specialization is Roman weapon and armor mostly. Logistics and mobility not so much
