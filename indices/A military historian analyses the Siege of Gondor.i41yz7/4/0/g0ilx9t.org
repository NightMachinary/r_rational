  And while i agree that the army marches on its stomach, we have been shown the Mordor as a literal wasteland. I dont think orcs need much food, and they probably survive on canibalisam and replenish numbers from magic.

Surely you've not seen /all/ of Mordor.

In the books, after Sam speculates that they must be getting their food from /somewhere,/ the omniscient third-person narration says:

"Neither he nor Frodo knew anything of the great slave-worked fields away south in this wide realm, beyond the fumes of the Mountain by the dark sad waters of Lake Nurnen; nor of the great roads that ran away east and south to tributary lands, from which the soldiers of the Tower brought long waggon-trains of goods and booty and fresh slaves."

So there you have it: a large fertile agricultural area in southern Mordor, plus an extensive transportation network.
