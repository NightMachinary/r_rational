Spells in the sense of a typical tabletop RPG don't appear very frequently in LotR. Those who use spells (such as Gandalf) are in possession of one of the Rings of Power.

It's possible that there are some examples in works such as The Silmarillion. Even then, the magic is either in an artifact, or else is indistinguishable from incredible skill and talent.
