What's the evidence that orcs are magical? Everything I remember about them suggests to me that they are as magical as the average human.

Canibalism is an interesting suggestion. The average human is about 80 kg and eats about 2kg a day. Assuming a similar mass to food ratio for orcs they would need to eat 2,5% of their army each day to survive surviving on canibalism alone. After 11 days the army would then be at 3/4 of it's original size.
