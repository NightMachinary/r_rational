Good article, although I wasn't really onboard with his star wars examples. Was Snoke's identity ever a big mystery? He appeared to just be a dude named Snoke and in the end that's who he was. It's been a while since I've seen it, so maybe I'm forgetting a part where a character says "wow! I wonder who Snoke really is", but otherwise, it doesn't seem like much of a mysterybox to me. It's missing the part where the story shines its focus onto it for no payoff. (And Rey's parents--well, I always just figured they were randos to begin with so I never got invested in that one, but I guess I'm in the minority there.)
