I'd /love/ to have a conversation with you over coffee. You seem to have an interesting life and seem really nice to talk to. Buuuut, I'm all the way over in New York City. The closest I'm getting to you anytime soon is the summer vacation to London I'm planning.

Good luck on finding interesting people in Sydney.
