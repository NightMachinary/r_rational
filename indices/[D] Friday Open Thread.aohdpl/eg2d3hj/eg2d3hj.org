I didn't realise how much bureaucracy exists in the world until I decided to apply for a French long-stay visa.

Did you know I have to fly 3,200 km (2,000 miles) to have a ~20 minute interview as part of the process? And that flight along with accommodation/etc will cost me about $1,000? And it needs to be on a weekday so I have to take two extra days off work to do it?

Australia is big, dang it. I overlaid Australia on Europe and I worked out it's like asking someone from Paris to fly to Georgia/Russia/Turkmenistan. (OK, except I won't need to travel internationally).

Oh, and when I get to France I have to validate my visa by going to some special office and also getting a doctor's appointment as part of it (!?!). I AM ONLY GOING FOR SIX MONTHS.

In other news: anyone in Sydney want to grab a cup of coffee? I don't have many friends there and could always use more.
