The main problem I see is that the vast majority of humanity believes (instinctively or otherwise) that confidence is convincing. The idea that "if someone is confident enough that they will bet everything on something, it must be true" is pretty pervasive, to the point where people literally treat confidence as an important criteria to look for when hiring new employees or choosing a romantic partner.

And unfortunately, this thinking is horribly wrong. For two reasons:

1. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect][Dunning-Kruger effect]]: people who do not know a lot tend to also not know that there is a lot they don't know, which makes them more confident because a greater fraction of the world seems to be things they know about. In contrast, people who know a lot tend to also know that there is a lot more that they don't know, meaning the fraction of things about the world that they know appears much smaller, making them less confident. (And rightfully so, since human history is pretty much the history of us being wrong about reality, over and over and over.)
2. It is usually easier to train to be confident than it is to train to be competent enough to genuinely deserve that level of confidence. And seeing as both methods reward people socially by the same amount, it is obvious which path is typically chosen. As a result there's plenty of people everywhere who appear super confident while not actually knowing anything.

So if we want to be more convincing than people who know less, we first have to convince people to stop treating confidence as something that is convincing. Which is a catch-22 kind of situation since we aren't confident enough to convince people that confidence isn't convincing. And hiring confident people to convince people that confidence isn't convincing doesn't seem likely to work since the message would contradict its delivery.
