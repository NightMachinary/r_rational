-W. B. Yeats, The Second Coming

Anyways... for myself, I don't think it's possible for me to consistently act in a certain way and also privately remain unaffected by it. If I constantly try to affect a certain demeanour and persona, I find myself shifting to become what was once a disguise I wore. If I act cheerful, upbeat, and happy, I often find myself feeling that way; to convincingly affect an emotion, I need to feel it on some level. I don't know about your internal experience of this sort of thing - but in mine, I can't imagine a stable situation where I long-term preach A and at the same time am rational about the actual merits of A.

And if this is the case for me individually as a person, it's far more true for group dynamics. Any group that tries to maintain a distance between rhetoric and actual practice is inviting people who take the rhetoric seriously to gain power and take over, or coming to believe their own rhetoric as a group. If you preach extremism outwardly, and internally discuss how it's only to counteract other groups' even worse extremism in the opposite direction... don't be surprised when you convert people to extremism who then join your group and take every word seriously.
