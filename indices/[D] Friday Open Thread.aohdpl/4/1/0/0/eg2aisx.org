I keep seeing stuff about cencorship these days. Isn't cencorship generally state-sanctions bans on certain topics? Does it really count as cencorship if some website says 'we don't want content related to this topic on our website'?

In terms of actually adressing your post though: I find that cencorship always have some negative utility but in many cases this utility is outweighted by the consequences of banning some content. On the concept of drawn child sexual content, the question is whether allowing it will increase or decrease child rape rates. I would suspect that it would increase it and if so I definitely think it it's cencorship is warranted.
