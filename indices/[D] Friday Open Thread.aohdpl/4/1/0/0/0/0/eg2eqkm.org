I did in fact miss-type. Thanks for catching that and for engaging with me.

It isn't really feasible to do a controlled study on this. The closest thing to a study that you can do is to ban it now and do a time series analysis to see how much the act of banning it changed the rate compared to the predicted rate change. So I guess my vote goes in favour of enforcing it unless a rationalist with with a anthropological background tells me otherwise.

I'm half Danish, half American though culturally Danish. I wonder if the reason that Americans places such astronomical utility value on freedom of speech is the part of it as a cultural identity. In Germany there is a state cencorship on nazism as a political party, and of the people I know I honestly only think that the Americans would say that's a bad thing.
