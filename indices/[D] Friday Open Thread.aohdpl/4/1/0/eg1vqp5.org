I get what you're saying but I've always thought of censorship as inherently bad. You don't care about it until they censor something you care about, so it's easy to feel either apathetic or grateful. But if there's really something wrong with it (generic 'it') there should be discussion on the topic rather than just shoving it under the rug.
