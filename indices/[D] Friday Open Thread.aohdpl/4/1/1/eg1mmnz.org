I mean I'm not particularly invested in it myself either, I'm more just a bemused onlooker at all the drama. But it does have wider implications for Reddit as a whole if the admins are banning significant users who don't seem to have actually done anything wrong as false positives in their crusade to appeal to advertisers. This sets precedents for future action against subs like [[/r/the_donald]] and how much the admins are going to micromanage Reddit as opposed to letting mods do their own thing. It shows the Reddit cares less about their userbase and more about advertisers. Maybe those don't actually affect you and you use Reddit very narrowly, but it does affect a lot of people.

Also like I said, my stake in it is that it's just interesting to see what corporations do and how the masses react.
