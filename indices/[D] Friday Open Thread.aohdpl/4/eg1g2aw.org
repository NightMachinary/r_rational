The reddit anime community has been in quite a tizzy lately over the recent admin crackdown on lolis(sexualized young anime girls. The exact definition is debated and that's part of the problem, but they're definitely always U18). On the more reasonable end of the crackdown is banning users for posting drawn pre-pubescent girls committing hardcore sexual acts, which while most in the community seem mildly upset about, big emphasis on the 'mild' and they're accepting it. On the less reasonable end and what the community is very upset about, is banning users over drawn teenage girls in somewhat sexual poses/outifts. E.g This [[https://np.reddit.com/r/Holofan4life/comments/ao8ujj/he_fuckin_dead_lmao/?st=jrvyvxbm&sh=996aed26][pic of a anime girl in a bikini]] apparently got an active member/mod of [[/r/animemes]] banned and there's a lot of discussion/memes about it.

The general consensus in [[/r/animemes]] is that if characters are fictional, any sort of drawings should be allowed, and the fact that the drawing was more or less SFW just makes things even more outrageous. A lot of users are talking about making their own Voat of some sort or just moving to Voat, but there are concerns about "when you take a principled stand against witch hunts, you get 3 principled activists and 10 000 000 witches" and they don't want the new community to be filled with Nazis like Voat. Notably they, from what I've seen, don't seem to be concerned with the idea the new community would be full of people posting child hentai, just that the new community would be full of Nazis and homophobes.

Thoughts?
