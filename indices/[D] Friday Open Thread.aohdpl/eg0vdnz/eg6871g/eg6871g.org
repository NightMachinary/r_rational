#+begin_quote
  Do emotions/feelings have an associated sensation that goes beyond the physical symptoms and the urges/ changes in behavior they cause?
#+end_quote

For me, the answer is 'yes'; but it's hard to explain further. I can explain why it's hard to explain by metaphor.

Imagine that I had come to you with this question:

#+begin_quote
  Do flavours/tastes have an associated sensation that goes beyond the physical texture of the food on my tongue and the amount of energy I feel after eating it?
#+end_quote

Now, I imagine you'd say that the answer is 'yes', but you can't tell me how honey and a lollipop are similar without referencing the qualia of taste.

In much the same way, I can't really accurately describe what various emotions feel like to me without speaking in either roundabout metaphor or directly referencing the qualia of emotions. But they do /have/ qualia, that much I can say.

I could try the roundabout metaphors if you want, but I'm not sure that they really help.
