  Imagine my surprise when instead all the replies said that 'No, the texture of the food on the tongue, along with the reactions of my body to it and the way it makes me want to eat more or less of it, is exactly what taste /is/.'

Yeah, I have to agree. That is odd.

I do tend to find that, for me at least, the qualia of emotions are usually fairly muted, quiet things; nowhere near as obvious as (say) the qualia of taste. But they are noticeable when the emotion is strongly felt.
