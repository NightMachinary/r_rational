Not quite. It was more that I was disqualifying things like "feeling hot" or "clenching fists" as being candidates for what "anger" is. I don't think you're going to get a set of necessary or sufficient conditions for "anger", so analyzing your own feelings and sensations when you're angry is going to be your best bet. If you trace things backwards from the "symptoms", you should eventually find the source.

Why are your clenching your fists? Because it's a way to (1) redirect your impulse for action into something harmless, and (2) it helps reinforce your willpower that's restraining you from taking impulsive action. Okay, so there's an impulse toward action without planning, often of a violent or destructive nature. Since it's an impulse that doesn't come from rational thought, then that impulse itself (along with it's associated suppression of rational thought) can be called "anger" or maybe the "qualia of anger" since I do think it's unique enough to be an identifier if it's not the emotion itself. I think that's a good enough answer for most purposes.

If you want to go one step deeper, then you could backtrace one more time and ask yourself "what causes that impulse?" and then call the answer to /that/ question "anger". It's just that when you get that far back, you're no longer really pointing at anything within your conscious awareness. At that point, you're probably pointing at instinctual social response patterns in your animal brain related to aggression, dominance, and fight-or-flight. Having those response patterns helped our ancestors survive, so we inherited them, but those are so low on the stack that it's not something you can see or feel. We only know they exist and where they come from because of neuroscience and evolutionary biology. It's the "source code" for anger, not anger itself as an emotion.

Is there anything /in between/ the "source code" for anger and the impulse for violence/destruction? I can't really think of anything. Therefore, I think the most fundamental /manifestation/ of anger is probably that impulse. Everything else is either a side-effect of your brain running the "anger" algorithm (blood rushing to the head, adrenaline spiking, etc.) or of trying to suppress that impulse with your rationality and willpower. The side-effects of running the "anger" algorithm are similar each time you run it, so there's a set of symptoms and sensations that often occur together when a person gets angry and we eventually learn to recognize this naturally occurring set of symptoms and side-effects as "how anger is expressed" both in ourselves and in others.

Any individual element is not sufficient for anger, and /just the sensations/ without the underlying impulse is also not sufficient. That would be closer to "pretending to be angry" if your body fully cooperated with you. Similarly, if you were to somehow experience the violent/destructive impulse of anger /without/ the associated physical symptoms, that would probably still be real anger, but it would /definitely/ feel strange. Imagine you were really sad and you were crying, like literally sobbing, but for some strange reason no tears came out and you didn't get choked up. That would feel weird, right? It doesn't mean you're not sad, but it would definitely be strange and you'd start to wonder.

Overall, I think you're worrying a bit too much. Emotions are universal within humanity, barring outliers, which means they're part of our brain's hard-wired circuitry rather than something learned. If there's no conscious mental aspect to a piece of hardwired circuitry, we call it a reflex. If it's a pure mental influence without any associated /feeling/, it's usually called a bias. It's the hard-coded algorithms that are a bundle of conscious mental influences, behavioral impulses, and physical symptoms that we call emotions.

The unique part of each emotion is probably a behavioral impulse, because the only reasons emotions would have manifested from the process of evolution is to create behavioral patterns that increase an organism's likelihood of survival, but the signature bundle of physical symptoms or sensations that comes with each emotion is relatively consistent, so they're often the easiest way for others to recognize emotions in a person.

You might say that anger lacks a "distinct qualia", literally the "feeling of anger", but I don't think that really makes sense. A "face" is made up of a bunch of elements, but when you look at a face, you judge it as a "face", not as a combination of elements. I think the "feeling of anger" is, similarly, the combination of all of the things that usually come along with it. Eventually you learn to recognize that as the "feeling of anger". There may be shades or variants or types that fall into certain patterns that are common enough to get names or descriptors, like "burning" or "cold" or "explosive", but those are, again, just patterns in the variation of how the anger algorithm is running at that time or if there are other things mixed in with it, like "also feeling fear" or "trying extra hard to suppress any reactions" or "anger mixed with regret". There doesn't need to be something more fundamental.
