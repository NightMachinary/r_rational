I think this falls under being normal, some emotions I can only tell I am experiencing them from physiological response. Heart rate slightly increased, taking shallow breaths, walking less naturally than normal. Yep I'm feeling anxious. Although I think people range differently on how in touch with their emotions they are, I never need to check my face to see if I'm smiling, although I can smile without knowing.
