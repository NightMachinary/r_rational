Yes. Emphasis on feels "as if" - the anger behaves /like/ a fire, in the sense that if someone goes near you, they may be caught up in the flames (that is to say, lashed out at. In the verbal sense, usually, because most of us don't carry whips.) And afterwards, once you are no longer angry (having "burned" through your emotional fuel) what's left is typically regret (ash).
