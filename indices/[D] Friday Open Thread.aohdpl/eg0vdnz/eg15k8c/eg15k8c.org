Burning [passion/anger] is just a form of metaphor. It doesn't /actually/ burn, but it certainly feels as if it's a consuming fire, turning everything it touches to ash. You can thank literature for the phrase becoming a cliche. The distinction between hot-vs-cold usually describes how dissociated you are at the moment. A cold rage is one that is in the background, influencing everything you do, but never coming so far to the forefront as to make you lose composure. Fiery rage is the opposite of that, flying off the handle at the slightest provocation.

Other times, the description relates /literally/ to a physiological reaction. "Butterflies in the stomach" is a cliche way of describing a fight-or-flight response. A pit in your stomach, similarly, might relate to tensing up your diaphragm and not giving yourself enough room to breathe, etc. If you get the chills, that could either mean that you're cold, that you're startled, or that you've experienced some form of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisson][Frission]]. (Speaking of frission, as one of the people who gets that feeling when listening to music a lot, I was actually pretty shocked to learn that not everyone experiences it.)
