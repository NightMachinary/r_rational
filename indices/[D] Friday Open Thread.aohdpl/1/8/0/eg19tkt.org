  In contrast, anger is a very real emotion of which there is only one type (as far as I know).

I take it you meant to say 'anger is a very real sensation', to go along with your earlier 'love isn't a real sensation'?

  I can pinpoint exactly which of my emotions is anger, though describing it is somewhat hard, like trying to explain what the color blue is to someone who has never seen blue.

Yeah, I feel like a color-blind person who doesn't know whether other people actually /see/ colors or if there are specific shades of gray that everyone else just agrees to call a color.

Especially since I'm (sexually) anhedonic, so I know for a fact that there is at least one part of the human experience that I am missing out on. I just can't figure out if this is another one.
