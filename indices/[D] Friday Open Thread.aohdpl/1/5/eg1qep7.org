The distinction imho is similar to a sharp pain vs a dull pain. Sharp would be getting hurt, the pain you feel then and there. Dull pain is more like a headache.

​

Cold and hot anger are basically the same thing, and imho can be applied to most emotions if you are not pedantic with semantics. Sharp love would be like being very horny now. Dull love would be liking your SO. Sharp anger is screaming. Dull anger hate.. Sharp sadness the moment you learn somebody you liked died. Dull sadness mourning..

​

These of course are not 1 and 0s more like a scale and you can have anything in between. But that's imho the basics on how emotions vary, you can also see them as a lack of specific words for similar things being grouped together, sometimes these words exist and people can more easily distinguish between them when appropriate.
