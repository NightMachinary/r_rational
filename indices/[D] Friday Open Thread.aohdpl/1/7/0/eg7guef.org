...man, I wish I had thought of the taste analogy. Might have made this whole discussion a lot less awkward.

But yes, your answer is exactly what I was expecting when I made the original post. Imagine my surprise when instead all the replies said that 'No, the texture of the food on the tongue, along with the reactions of my body to it and the way it makes me want to eat more or less of it, is exactly what taste /is/.'

And now I am confused again. Either you are wrong, which would be strange since the question was whether you /experience/ qualia and not what those qualia /mean/, or the phrasing of my OP has led to a vigorous round of talking past each other, or the ability to experience emotions instead of just having them is a lot less common than expected, at least in our little corner of the web.

Maybe the issue deserves a clarified post/poll in next friday's thread.

And thank you for the reply, by the way.
