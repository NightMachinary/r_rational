This might a "everyone assume everyone else's experience is the same as theirs" thing, but my answer will be radically different the other posts: yes, to an extent.

When I'm angry, there's often a qualia to it. Obviously expressions like "burning rage" or "it leaves a bad taste in my mouth" are kinesthetic; being angry doesn't /actually/ feel like tasting a really bad thing. But there's /something/ that lingers, some "taste" to my thoughts that is very perceptible beyond the physical symptoms and rash decision-making.

The most extreme cases feel like a cord going taut. When I'm so angry I fail at self-control, it feels like there's a "rope" between the anger-brain and my actions, with no slack between the two, such as any reaction by the anger-brain immediately results in me doing /something/ (obviously the kind of actions I've done in this state of mind aren't ones I'm especially proud of).
