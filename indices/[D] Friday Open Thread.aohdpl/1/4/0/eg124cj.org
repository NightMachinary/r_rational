I understand that when it come to the gradation of intensity, ie 'anger' vs 'rage', but how do you distinguish between the types of an emotion, here 'hot' and 'cold', if there is no distinct sensation to them?

Is it just that in one case the urges they cause are short term (hot), while in another you are more likely to make long-term plans/decisions (cold)?

edit: so the terms 'anger', 'fear' etc. are just shorthand for specific sets of physical reactions?
