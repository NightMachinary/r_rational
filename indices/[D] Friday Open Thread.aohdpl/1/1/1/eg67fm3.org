Some descriptions are literal, some are metaphor. The interesting thing is, not everyone agrees on whether a given description is literal or not.

For example, as someone who's never experienced frission (and that's a new word to me!) from listening to music, I had always assumed that the phrase "That music gives me the chills!" was a metaphor meaning, more or less, "I have a strong emotional reaction to that music!".

Burning anger might not leave burns on the skin, but it can certainly leave the person who experiences it feeling a degree or two warmer than they otherwise would - so perhaps that's more literal for some people, too.
