Madoka's not a great show, imo, but it's an interesting premise. It feels like it's a sincere attempt to deconstruct some of the magical girl tropes, but ends before it gets going.

TTS is in a really weird place for me though. It's sort of a vampire fic- thousand year old superbeings with a secret society that manipulated world events, mostly concerned with policing their own, etc etc. But then it sets it all in the middle of what is essentially Halo- giant space war, humans losing badly, incomprehensible alien motives. Magical girls reveal themselves and start getting thrown into the meat grinder and off we go. It's got a lot of themes of child soldiers, utopian world building, war and trauma, but it has this kind of detached tone that never quite lets it get grounded enough to hit home for me. I'm interested in where it's going, but it is one of those fics I wouldn't outright recommend.
