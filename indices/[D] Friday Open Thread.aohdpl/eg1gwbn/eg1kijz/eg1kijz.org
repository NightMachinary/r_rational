Disclaimer: I am a huge Fate fanboy and nerd.

OK, first of all - the original VN has tremendous problems, as noted. The VN is in three major different story arcs, and the first and shortest arc is the worst of the three; the second and third are much better, but it's literally 10 hours or more of reading before you get to /start/ the second arc. Even then, the second and third arcs are longer than the first (more like 20 hours of reading each) - it's not that they don't have the same number of bad bits like the first arc does, it's more that they are supplemented by a much larger portion of awesome bits as well. It's not quite as bad as, say, Muv-Luv in terms of 'gigantic pile of garbage in front of the bits people might want to read' but it's awful close. In arc 2, Unlimited Blade Works, we get a Shirou who actually develops some confidence and ability of his own, and also a lot more focus on Rin as a character; in Arc 3 we get a bunch of real horror and despair and so forth and also a focus on Sakura. However, both are still told from Shirou's perspective. If you decide to bail on the VN before it gets there - I /understand/ and sympathize, and don't blame you at all.

You could just start from Fate / Zero the anime. There is no way to read the Fate franchise where one work won't spoil another to some extent because of the way prequels and sequels are interwoven, and Fate / Zero has reasonable animated fight scenes and characters and so forth and is generally considered decent. Then maybe hit the Unlimited Blade Works anime and the Heaven's Feel movie series (currently being released). You can avoid a lot of the low points of the story if you do this.

On the topic of Nasu-created stuff, go watch Kara no Kyoukai if you haven't already. It's got some gorgeously animated scenes and also the soundtrack, by Yuki Kajiura, is fucking fantastic. It's only loosely tied to Fate properties but I wholly recommend it to everyone.
