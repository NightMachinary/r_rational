Personally, I think it is better to watch/read Fate/Zero before any other Fate material, because most other Fate/X material looks like utterly generic high school battle romcom on the surface. Fate/Zero gives it all perspective as the continued tragedy of Emiya Kiritsugu, an MC who is definitely not generic.

Spoilers for Kiritsugu's beginning: When Kiritsugu was a young boy, his crush Shirley got infected with a magical zombie virus and begged him to kill her before she becomes a zombie. Kiritsugu, having a generic shonen protagonist mindset at this point in his life, refuses to kill the one he loves and runs away instead. When Kiritsugu returns, pretty much everyone has been infected and the entire town has been set on fire to try and limit the spread of the zombie virus. All the places he loved? Gone. All his friends? Dead. Almost all the people he knew? Dead. All because he refused to kill someone he loved. That gave him a lifelong trauma that allowed him to kill and sacrifice literally anyone with no hesitation, whether he loves them or whether they are innocent. He spent the next several years as a utilitarian murder machine: weighing lives on a scale and killing the minority side everywhere he went, until the events of Fate/Zero began.

In some sense, Kiritsugu is a white knight that wants to save people. Except his method of doing so is by murdering everyone on the minority side of the utilitarian scales. By the end of Fate/Zero he has murdered almost everyone he ever loved for the greater good, and lost the rest. Now imagine how messed up Shirou from Fate/Stay Night actually is, as an amnesiac kid that Kiritsugu adopted and raised.

Watching Fate/Stay Night from the perspective of "How much more tragedy did Kiritsugu cause?" is far more interesting than from the perspective of "When will this dense MC finally wise up?"
