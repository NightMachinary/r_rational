Right, I agree and would actually go further and claim that most fiction I have read recently is just the MC being forced into action by circumstances with squat agency.

I was bringing suggestions to ways it could be done differently since someone in this thread was considering writing a story around that. I was referring to government run prisons rather than villain run, and for many modern governments there are incentives to not succumb to pressure from single powerful people, and for said people not to openly say that they'll break into a prison to rescue a friend.
