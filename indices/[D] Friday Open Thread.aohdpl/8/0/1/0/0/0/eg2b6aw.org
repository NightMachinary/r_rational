I feel that you could do it believably. Conflict should arrive from a clash of interests such as, the MC knows people who are unjustly in prison and wants to get them out/ the MC wants to redistribute wealth and the top 1% wealthiest notices the threat eventually/ the MC wants to change the system by getting majority in congress.
