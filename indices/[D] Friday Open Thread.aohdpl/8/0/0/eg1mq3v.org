So the point of this story is NOT balance of power and action. think about one punch man - not necessarily to that degree, but imagine a character who knows he'll be one punch man after a couple months/years of grinding. This is NOT an action flick idea beyond any necessary action - it's an examination of powers, societal structures, the will and opportunity to change the world OR NOT, and how to live with where you are in life.

It's more of a coming-of-age story of a man slowly becoming a diety in the modern world, through the ui of a game. MC doesn't HAVE a goal, until he gives one for himself.
