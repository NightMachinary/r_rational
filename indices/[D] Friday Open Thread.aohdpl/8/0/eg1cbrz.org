I'd give it a chance if you wrote it. Just remember balance of power. The reason for magical underworlds and secret organizations in these kinds of stories is because the modern world becomes unthreatening pretty quickly with fantasy power creep (also rule of cool). If you don't want to use those tropes, then depending on how high-profile the MC's actions are, you'll need to go pretty in-depth with how the modern world reacts to the MC's actions and make sure that it's a realistic and significant threat to MC's success, wellbeing, and anonymity.

Things that would make me avoid or drop such a story: MC is exposed and is constantly hunted by someone/everyone, it turns out there's actually a bunch of people like MC who pop out whenever it's convenient for the narrative, MC just steamrolls everything and there's no challenge, or MC's biggest problem is the military might of those opposing him rather than their effectiveness as national/global intelligence organizations.

What would be the MC's goal? If I can get behind that part of it and then see the MC do research and make plans, raise money, attempt strategic operations, fail (but not catastrophically), revise those plans, take advantage of normal non-super things that have new significance or importance now that MC's a super (and probably rich), try again in a different way, etc., I think it could be interesting.
