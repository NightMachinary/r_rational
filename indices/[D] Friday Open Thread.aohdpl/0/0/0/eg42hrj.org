Not necessarily. There are a lot of subreddits that start out with a fairly clear sense of what's what that get overwhelmed by people who don't really care if what they're seeing matches the sub, only if it gets a reaction out of them. In most cases, it is simply that the modding can't or won't keep up with the growth, so posts increasingly off-topic become popular before they can be pruned, and the sub loses its focus because of it.

This place is a little more protected by the nature of its topic, which doesn't produce a lot of low-effort consumption memes, but if you got a bunch of people coming in who started posting and upvoting links to increasingly non-rational scifi/fantasy/etc stories, then it could happen.
