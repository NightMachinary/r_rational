Some things got resolved, yes. I certainly can't argue that. But I would say that a lot of the things that were resolved were short-term mysteries that were added just so that they /could/ be resolved (and to ramp up the mystery & cliffhangers rather than serving an actual purpose [this is part of the randomness I'm talking about]). Virtually none of the overarching mysteries are answered satisfactorily -- in fact, when they're addressed at all, the answers either raise more questions or only address the *what* and not the *how* or the *why*. Which is /excruciatingly/ unsatisfying when the *what* is "magic" and the *how* this magic works (what are its rules? - yeah, remember all those mentions of 'rules'?) is never explained and the *why* is likewise never explained beyond a vague Manichean struggle.

My main beef with the show is that I wasn't watching it for the drama or the characters. Maybe that's my fault? That I put too much expectations on the show? But no, as I was saying before, I think it's the show's fault. It's the show that put so much time and focus on the mysteries, I only followed along. It's really unfair to build up things that much and then hand-wave them away.

But honestly, I don't even think I can give the show a pass on the characters. The newcomers to the island are somewhat well characterized, I'll give you (when they're acting consistently, which is not all the time) but everyone else? The fact that we don't know why the heck anything is happening is horrible for characterization. Characters need to have background and motivation to be believable (let alone relatable).

I swung back and forth several times on liking certain characters, as did you, I imagine. But in my view this is not good characterization. The only reason this happens is because why they're doing what they're doing is clouded in mystery and my imagination is filling in the blanks to make their actions fit the circumstances. It falls really flat when it turns out my imagination was wrong because there was no reason behind their actions or their reasons aren't logical or rational. (Which, incidentally is largely why I think a lot of things go unexplained.)

To your first point, the writers may have tried their hardest to give a good ending, but they utterly failed as storytellers because they wrote themselves into that corner to begin with. To give a really bad analogy, I'm not going to give a drunk driver credit for swerving at the last second to try and avoid hitting me when he was driving drunk in the first place.

Sorry for the rant. I'm trying to stay out of specifics so I don't get bogged down but if you're confused I can give examples. Though now I reread what you wrote I will address your two examples:

- The polar bears. We didn't ever find out why there were polar bears there beyond "Dharma brought them". Which is a non-answer. Obviously either they were brought there or they didn't exist in the first place... you can't answer "why were there polar on a tropical island?" with "because I brought them there."
- The hatch. The answer is that it's there so that people can live there to save the world. This is an example of what I'm talking about where the show addresses the *what* but not the *why* or the *how*. Why is this happening? Why does it need to be underground in a bunker? Why do people need to live down there? Why can't it be largely automated? Why was all this necessary if there was a fail safe? Why are there blast doors and quarantine signs? Why didn't Jacob fix things? Why didn't The Man in Black ruin things? How did this electromagnetic pocket come to be? How does it work? How does the bunker work to fix things? How does the failsafe work? How does the electromagnetism relate to all the other mysterious things on the island? How the heck do the numbers relate to all this? ... ... My point is, the whole mystery behind the hatch -- beyond the fact that it's initially found on what was otherwise thought to be on a deserted island -- is that it's really weird for there to be a random underground bunker in the middle of a forest. The provided explanation does not make sense beyond the superficial (like, faced with a similar situation as the Dharma guys did, there's no way rational people would have come up with a similar solution). Which basically means the hatch was there to be mysterious. Yay?
