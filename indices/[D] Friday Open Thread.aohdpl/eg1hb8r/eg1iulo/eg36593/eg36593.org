it's arguably already jumped a small shark in terms of popularity. There have been some seriously low quality posts/comments that surprised me by somehow still having net positive upvote ratio. It's fairly easy to create/find new places to discuss things though, so that doesn't bother me too much.

I'm more worried that the gradual growth of the people aware of and interested in ratfic hasn't resulted in more content. Offerings seem pretty sparse.
