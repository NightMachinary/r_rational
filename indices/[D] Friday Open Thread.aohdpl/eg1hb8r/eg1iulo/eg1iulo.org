I mean, if there's new posters who bring new content and discussions to the sub then that's a good thing. It's sad when I sort by new and there's, like, 1 new post a day for several days in a row.

But yeah, obviously if popularity brings in a lot of people who aren't like-minded then that would ruin things... I don't think that will happen though. I feel like the subs that got popular and morphed either never really had a concrete sense of what they were about or the name of the sub itself was vague enough to be about too many t disparate things.
