It's definitely not one-to-one, especially with fanfic- sometimes a whole lot of people are compelled to write fic about some really terrible shows. But usually if they're compelled to write /rational/ fiction, I can trust that the foundation is at least solid (or there's been one really compelling take on it and everyone spun off of that).
