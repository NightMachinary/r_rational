Doing anything to save anyone you come across is basically the most shounen thing ever. It's /always/ portrayed in these stories as an incredible handicap that all the other more ruthless characters think is holding the main character back, and it /always/ ends up being the one thing that makes him so incredibly good at befriending all his enemies/ saving the day/ being a superhero or whatever. See for instance Naruto/My Hero Academia/Dragonball/etc etc etc

The problem is that any victory from this morality feels so /un-earned./ If you really are committed to maximizing positive outcomes for /everyone/ you'd damn well better work at it, but the heroes in these stories are always kind of bumbling fuck-ups and everything works out for them because they are literally the /first people in their worlds/ to go "Hey but what if I was just genuinely nice to everyone though?" That or they are just so goddamn ludicrously OP from out of nowhere that they're the first people who aren't really subject to the usual zero-sum rules.

That's why I want him to get hit by a bus, but I don't feel like (so far) this is the kind of story that's going to subvert the trope. Sure hope I'm wrong though.
