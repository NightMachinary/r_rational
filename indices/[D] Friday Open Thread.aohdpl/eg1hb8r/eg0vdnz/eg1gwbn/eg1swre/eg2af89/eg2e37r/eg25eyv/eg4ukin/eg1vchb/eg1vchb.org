I don't know that I have an answer for you, at least not about whether we should or not. But speaking for myself, if I know I'm not sure about something, I wouldn't be able to speak towards it with 100% certainty. It would be disingenuous of me to do so and it would make me feel bad.

If someone is arguing a position that they're not sure of but putting themselves forward as either an expert or as someone who /is/ sure of their position, it doesn't make for a very good discussion as any real follow-up will fall apart. This is partly why [[/r/changemyview][r/changemyview]] has a rule against playing devil's advocate - it won't work in a real back and forth discussion.

So while it can be effectice as a throw-away comment where it's not expected that there will be a debate, I don't think it's useful for actually changing someone's mind.
