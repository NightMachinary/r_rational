It kind of depends. If you have one opponent, randomly selected, and you know nothing about them, and you can only execute a predetermined strategy, then I'd say that rationality's principles for accuracy should be ignored. The reason for this is that the average person has no rationality training and thus no respect for its principles. Instead, they respect things that sound or feel convincing.

​

"Climate change will result in 98% more tornados in Kentucky because of the interaction of unusually hot air with the jet stream." Is this true? Maybe. I pulled it out of my ass by jamming together a bunch of complicated-sounding words to make a story. Now, /you/ can recognize that it violates the conjunction fallacy, and you might even know enough about climate change to call me out -- but if you don't have that training then all you can go by is how plausible the story sounds. Telling a story with a built-in uncertainty is setting it up for failure.

​

If it's a randomly drawn group etc, try to dominate the argument. Speak loudly, interrupt people, etc, depending on the norms for the setting. The objective here is to starve your opponent of the chance to defend yourself. This works even better if you outnumber them (you can take turns tearing them down and think of avenues for attack faster than they can defend). The goal here isn't to convince them. That's probably not going to happen, because they'll look weak if they back down in front of everyone else. But, you can convince everyone else who hasn't decided yet. Don't waste time trying to be accurate or "rational", just focus on defeating your opponent. The best defense is a good offense.

​

If it's just one person, then you have the greatest chance at convincing them. I would suggest avoiding outright argument here and instead work on figuring them out and manipulating them into changing over to your side very, very slowly. Be their friend, not their enemy, and slowly drive a wedge between them and their view. Or, if you luck out and they're reasonable (and you actually have reason on your side) then you can do what you suggested and just be accurate.

​

Of course, I'm far from an expert in this matter, but this is the way I understand things.
