  It's funny, I deal with this problem every day. I teach young teenagers. The subject is big and their ability to think abstractly is limited. In this case, accuracy hurts engagement and understanding. Imho, optimize for your audience which normally means being convincing. Just never lie, and tell the audience you're simplifying things when you do; if you do it in a self-deprecating way, it comes off as honest rather than condescending.
