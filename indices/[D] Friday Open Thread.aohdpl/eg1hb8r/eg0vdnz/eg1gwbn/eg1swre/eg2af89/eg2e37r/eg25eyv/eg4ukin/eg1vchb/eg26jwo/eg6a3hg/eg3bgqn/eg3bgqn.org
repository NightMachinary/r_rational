  Or is my entire premise flawed and our way of speaking is actually more persuasive than others?

I'm of the opinion sometimes being accurate is more convincing, and sometimes speaking with absolute confidence is more convincing. And anyone can, and many do, speak with absolute confidence. But fewer people can be accurate because that requires more work and knowledge. So I'm of the opinion that we can let the uninformed/unethical people on our 'side' do the absolute confidence role to convince the people convinced by that, while we do the accurate role to be convinced by that people convinced by that.
