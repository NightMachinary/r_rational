  The Dunning-Kruger effect: people who do not know a lot tend to also not know that there is a lot they don't know, which makes them more confident because a greater fraction of the world seems to be things they know about. In contrast, people who know a lot tend to also know that there is a lot more that they don't know, meaning the fraction of things about the world that they know appears much smaller, making them less confident. (And rightfully so, since human history is pretty much the history of us being wrong about reality, over and over and over.)

  " I don't mean to suggest the phenomena isn't real ([[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2702783/][follow up studies suggest it is]]), but it's worth keeping in mind that the effect is more “subpar people thinking they're middle of the pack” than “ignorant people thinking they're experts”.
