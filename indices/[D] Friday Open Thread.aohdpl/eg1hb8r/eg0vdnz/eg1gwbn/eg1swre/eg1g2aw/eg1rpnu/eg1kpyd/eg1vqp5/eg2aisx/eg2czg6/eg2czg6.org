Did you miss-type? You think censoring the drawings will decrease child rape so you WANT censorship? I'm of the opinion that it would decrease such things so censorship would be bad. I'm guessing you meant to say it would /increase/ it and that's why you would want censorship of it?

But see, this is my point. We're talking about whether or not it's bad. We could maybe do a study on it to find out who's right! Can't do that if it's censored. /But wait/, you say, /does that mean when it's found to have a negative effect on society, you'll be OK with banning it?/ My answer would depend on why it's bad, I suppose.

To address your first questions: Censorship is censorship. Certainly state censorship is worse (and I'd be bring up constitutional rights if I knew you were in the U.S. like me) but yeah, it's still censorship if a site says they don't want something on their website.
