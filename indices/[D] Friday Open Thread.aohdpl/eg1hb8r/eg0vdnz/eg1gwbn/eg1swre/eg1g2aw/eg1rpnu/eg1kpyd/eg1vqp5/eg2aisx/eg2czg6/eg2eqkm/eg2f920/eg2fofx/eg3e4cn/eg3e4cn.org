Several reasons that boil down to "The Internet is American"

- The English-speaking Internet is dominated by American companies that must obey American law.
- American free speech rights are famously strong, and thus a good legal basis to couch defenses of objectionable speech in.
- Even among non-Americans, much of the Early Internet was American, and that cultural bias may have affected non-American Internet Culture in approaches to free speach.
