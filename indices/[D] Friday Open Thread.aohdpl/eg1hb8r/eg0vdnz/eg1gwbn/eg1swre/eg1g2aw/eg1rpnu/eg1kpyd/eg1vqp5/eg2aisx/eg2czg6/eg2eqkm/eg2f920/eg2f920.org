On a different note, and I fully recognize that I might be stepping on sacred cows here, why do people keep referring to the U.S. constitution in debates about freedom as if the presence of a concept in a 300+ year old document implies moral superiority? I get that it's a useful tool to have a codified structure for governance and broad expectations as well as acknowledge that it plays a big part in American identity but it used to have a blanket stamps of approval on slavery and treated women as subhuman, and still allows slave labour as long as it happens in prisons.
