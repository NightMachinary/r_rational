Calm down Satan.

Five years ago we had to deal with this for about a week. Could not figure out which of the installed smoke alarms was causing it. Eventually realized that it was a battery powered one buried under a bunch of junk we'd forgotten about.

On the plus side we found out that the brand we had installed had been recalled in the late 90s and got some new ones for free, which is definitely in the better half of ways to find out your smoke alarms are defective.
