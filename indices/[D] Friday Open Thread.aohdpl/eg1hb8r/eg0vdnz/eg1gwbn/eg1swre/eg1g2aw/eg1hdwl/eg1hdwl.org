You know, I've always hated how the TV show LOST ended - both because the ending itself sucked but also because it didn't serve as an ending to the series. But I only just realized I hated it so much because the show ended up being anti-rational.

I dislike magical realism I enough as it is, because it's basically where magic things just happen randomly and inconsistently with no central structure or principles. Often just to drive the plot forward.

And LOST is so atrocious to be because it doesn't present itself that way. When you watch the show there are tons of cues for this, from the breadcrumbing clues to keep people hooked to the attention the camera pays to the mysteries. And the payoff is nonsensical. And nothing gets resolved. At least in something like One Hundred Years of Solitude (my go-to example for magical realism), the author doesn't pretend there's a 'why' behind all the random magic.

I'm curious to know if there's any fans of rational lit who liked LOST.
