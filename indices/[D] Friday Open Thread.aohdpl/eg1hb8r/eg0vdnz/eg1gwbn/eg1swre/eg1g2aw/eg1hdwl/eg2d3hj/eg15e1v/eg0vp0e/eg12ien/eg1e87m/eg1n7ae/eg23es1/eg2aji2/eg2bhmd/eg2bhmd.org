Ebert was wrong. It isn't two hour's worth of fun surrounded by 45 minutes worth of mush and sop, it's about an hour and thirteen minutes' worth of fun (from 1:04:23 to 2:17:13) surrounded by about an hour and twelve minutes worth of mush and sop.

You could easily skip the first 64 minutes and the last 10 minutes without really missing out on much of anything because the rest of it is an extended frame story; the fun stuff is meant to be understood as happening in the kids' imaginations while their dad tells them a story, and it'd be a shame to miss out on the fun stuff just because they over extended the surrounding frame story.

There /are/ some fun scenes peppered into that first hour, but there's just so much Nothing between them that if you aren't in the mood to indulge the movie its padding then it's not worth getting bored and abandoning the movie before it ever gets to the fun part.
