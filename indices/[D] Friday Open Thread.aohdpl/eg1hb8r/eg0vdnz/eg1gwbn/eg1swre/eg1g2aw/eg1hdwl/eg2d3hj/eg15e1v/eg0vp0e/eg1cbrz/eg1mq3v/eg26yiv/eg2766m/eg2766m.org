Haven't read Jumper so I don't know, but mostly I was referring to the "ah, he's got a special power/object/etc. that nobody else has! let's hunt him down to [learn it's secrets / force him to work for us / dissect him / steal it from him / etc.]". Really common trope in amateur fiction. Gives the author an easy way to have there be action and conflict and to drive the plot, but removes almost all agency from the MC and forces them into a reactive state.
