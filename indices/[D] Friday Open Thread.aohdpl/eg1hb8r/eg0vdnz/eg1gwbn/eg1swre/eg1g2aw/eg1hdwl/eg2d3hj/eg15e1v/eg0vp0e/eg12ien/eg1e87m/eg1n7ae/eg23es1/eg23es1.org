Well, it's a kid's movie from like fifty years ago. The songs were written by the Sherman Brothers, the same writing team who did the songs for a lot of Disney movies (including Mary Poppins). But these songs are a bit flatter and less fun than they'd be in a Disney movie. And a lot of the musical numbers could've probably been half as long as they are and nothing would've been lost. The movie doesn't move at a particularly snappy pace, just like a lot of movies from long ago.

Individual shots in the '30s averaged about 12 seconds, and individual shots now average about 3.5 seconds ([[http://people.psych.cornell.edu/%7Ejec7/pubs/cutting&candanProj15.pdf][source]]), and it's been close to a linear decline over that period of time (ie people didn't just all of a sudden become ADHD, it's been a gradual change). I looked it up, and CCBB has an average shot length of 6.43 seconds, almost twice the current average. It makes the movie feel even more drawn out than it already is at two and a half hours long.

Honestly, it probably won't be of much interest to anyone who didn't watch it when they were younger. Like, I find it /fascinating/ because I haven't seen it in over 25 years, and the last time I saw it I was so young that a lot of the meaning just went right over my head (I think I used to watch it a lot when I was three and four years old, and presumably I went the entire intervening period without watching it again).

Just from an anthropological perspective, I think it's interesting to consume content you normally wouldn't, y'know, just looking at things the humans have made. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

EDIT: I mean, the movie is still /quite/ delightful, if you allow yourself to be carried along by that sort of thing. I wouldn't've recommended it if it weren't worth watching, I just thought it should be noted that the slow pace might be off-putting, especially in the beginning, if you don't have childhood memories of it stuffed away somewhere up in your brainhole.

EDIT: I went and found Roger Ebert's review of the movie from when it was released 50 years ago. He had this to say, and I'd agree with him wholeheartedly:

  "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" contains about the best two-hour children's movie you could hope for, with a marvelous magical auto and lots of adventure and a nutty old grandpa and a mean Baron and some funny dances and a couple of moments when you've just GOT to cover your face and peek between your fingers, it's so scary.

  But the trouble is, these two hours of fun are surrounded by about another 45 minutes of soppy love songs, corny ballads and a lot of mushy stuff.
