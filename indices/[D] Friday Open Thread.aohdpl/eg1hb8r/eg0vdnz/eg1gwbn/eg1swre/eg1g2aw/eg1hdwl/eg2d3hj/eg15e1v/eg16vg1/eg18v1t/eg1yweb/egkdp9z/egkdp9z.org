So I just read the entire trilogy thanks to [[/u/badewell][u/badewell]] â€˜s recommendation, and let me tell you, the first two and a half books are an amazing peice of rationalist literature, and the last half of the third book is the most nonsensical woo bullshit cop out of an ending that I have /ever/ read.

I am actually angry at how badly the author fucked up everything that was good about the story.

If you do decide to read the third book in the story, just put the book down when they introduce the woo bullshit about souls... you will know it when you see it. Message me if you want the spoiler for the end when you get there
