Smoke alarms are large and distinctive enough that they'd probably be found relatively quickly, unless they have an uncommonly messy house.

Ideally you want to install a noise generators in something they already own so that they won't be able to tell what's out of place.

Bonus points if the noise generators have proximity sensors so they mute themselves if somone is nearby (say in the same room) so in aggregate the effect should be that any time you go searching for one you only hear the one(s) that you aren't nearby enough to find.
