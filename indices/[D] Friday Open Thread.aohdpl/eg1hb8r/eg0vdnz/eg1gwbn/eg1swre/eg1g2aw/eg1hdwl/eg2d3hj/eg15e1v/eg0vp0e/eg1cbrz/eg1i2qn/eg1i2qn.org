Honestly, this is why The Gamer was so intriguing to me originally! I got much less interested once the whole secret history and secret underworld things were revealed.

I think you totally could have an OP MC, too - maybe he becomes a superhero like Batman or Superman where (originally) there aren't other superheroes or villains with superpowers.
