Me, I liked LOST.

I hated the ending originally, but eventually I realized the writers tried their hardest to give the /characters/ a decent ending at the cost of the plot, which was a lost cause anyway.

Half the remaining questions were mystery box shit that just were never going to be properly answered, and I agree with you the ending is basically anti-rational, but it's still a great show if you don't treat S6 as the conclusion to a mystery show but to a drama show. Horrible by [[/r/rational]] standards? Of course.

I will say though, I think you're doing the show a disservice in claiming "things just happen randomly", the show got increasingly worse at it, but small mysteries /did/ get resolved. We did find out what the hatch was, why there were polar bears...
