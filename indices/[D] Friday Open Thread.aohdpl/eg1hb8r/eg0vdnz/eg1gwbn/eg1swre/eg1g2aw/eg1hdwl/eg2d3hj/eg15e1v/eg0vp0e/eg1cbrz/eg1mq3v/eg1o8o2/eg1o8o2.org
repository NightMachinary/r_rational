Then, is there any reason for the MC to take action at all before reaching the point where the modern world can pose a threat? I guess not if you don't plan on having the MC engage in any "actiony" conflict. But if the MC is not working toward their goals as they grow in power by tackling larger and larger goals that lead up to the eventual goal, then all you're really left with is reflection, analysis, and internal conflict along with overkill conflict resolution in trivial day-to-day situations.

I'm sure it's possible to write a good story like that, but it will be highly dependent on execution, since you won't get much mileage or BotD from the concept alone. Even if it's not "action", you absolutely need conflict between the MC and certain aspects of society or else you won't be able to do a thorough "examination" of them. I mean, I guess having the MC just experience things without taking any action while thinking about what to do about those things /later/ could be interesting, but progressive conflict is important to storytelling, even if it's not an "actiony" type of conflict. That's hard to do with "man vs himself" style conflicts, but it's not impossible. Good luck!
