Wanna watch Chitty Chitty Bang Bang?

No?

Well, you /should/ want to, [[https://ia601605.us.archive.org/9/items/ChittyBang/Chitty.Chitty.Bang.Bang.1968.mp4][so here it is anyway]].

(The first 6 minutes are pretty skippable, it begins with almost a literal full minute of a black screen with engine-revving noises bouncing back and forth between the left and right audio channels, followed by like 5 minutes of opening credits played over a car race).

EDIT:

Honestly, if you never saw the movie as a child then you might want to skip the first 64 minutes of the movie entirely. There's really two movies here that are both roughly an hour and 15 minutes long. From 1:04:23 to about 2:17:13 is the fun stuff, and then the first 64 minutes and the last 8 minutes are a frame story that's all mush and sop and feels bloated and padded out. If you watched the movie as a kid, indulge the movie its padding for nostalgia's sake. If you've never seen it before, go ahead and skip the first 64 minutes, because it'd be a shame to miss out on the fun stuff just because they over extended the frame story.
