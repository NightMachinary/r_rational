  You seem to have an interesting life and seem really nice to talk to

I'm honoured but you can rest assured that I'm actually kind of loud and obnoxious and self-centred IRL. I'm sure I'll wind up meeting up with [[/u/CouteauBleu]] in Paris and he can provide an objective assessment

  The closest I'm getting to you anytime soon is the summer vacation to London I'm planning
#+end_quote

I'm planning on being in Paris over the summer, but with brexit looming I don't think I'll be able to count on making a trip through the chunnel. That said, if I can, I might say hi, or if you feel like popping over to Paris for an afternoon/day.

Alternatively, you're welcome to PM me, exchange email addresses, and we can email or chat on signal/telegram/whatsapp if you want to become online acquaintances.

I like meeting random people from the internet so this coffee offer is pretty open to anyone who I might be anywhere near and don't get creepazoid vibes from.
