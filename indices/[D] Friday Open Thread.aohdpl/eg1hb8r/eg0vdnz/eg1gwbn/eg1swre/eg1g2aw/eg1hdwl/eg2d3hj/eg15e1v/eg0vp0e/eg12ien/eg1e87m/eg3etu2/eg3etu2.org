Trying to remember the name of a manga but can't for the life of me remember the name. Hopefully this is the right place.

So a bunch of people get kidnapped and gifted with abilities, before being pitted against each other in fights. Everyone had a different ability, but the main characters ability was 'whatever ability your opponent believes you have.'

They took advantage of this by making it seem as though they have the same ability as the big bad, the ability turn their arm into a cannon.

It was recommended in one of the monthly recommendation threads a while back but I've trawled through a bunch and can't find it.

Any help would be appreciated.
