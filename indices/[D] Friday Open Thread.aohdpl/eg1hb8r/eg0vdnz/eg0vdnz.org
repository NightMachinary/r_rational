So.

I have a question that has been bothering me for a while, and which may or may not out me as a badly prepared alien infiltrator:

Do emotions/feelings have an associated sensation that goes beyond the physical symptoms and the urges/ changes in behavior they cause?

As an example: say I get angry enough at someone the outer bounds of my self control are tested. This means that my heart-rate spikes, my face distorts, my hands clench and I find myself imagining smashing his or her head against the nearest surface.

Is that all that anger is? Or is there some kind of sensation/qualia to it that I am missing?

I ask because both fiction and common usage implies that there is ('burning rage', 'cold anger', 'blazing love'), but if so, then I have never experienced it, or any other associated with anything but pain. (Ye Gods, that sounds ridiculously edgy.)

I'm confused even further by the fact that it is a common trope for someone to not realize that they're in love, which seems bizarre if there is actually a distinct sensation associated with it.
