You already said the bounds of your self-control are tested when you're angry. So wouldn't anger be "that which threatens to escape your self control" in that situation? That's a way to point a finger at it and say "this is anger". The symptoms you mentioned are all manifestations or side-effects of that impulse or of your attempt to suppress that impulse, but the impulse itself should be "anger".

Edit: I'm sure this isn't a /complete/ description of anger and it isn't meant to be, but it's at least something real that I think is not a symptom or side-effect.
