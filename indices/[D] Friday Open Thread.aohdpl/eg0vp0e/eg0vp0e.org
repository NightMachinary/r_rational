Thinking of a gamer story taking place in the modern day.

No hidden magical underworld, no secret orgs, just a dude(tte) that gets some powers that grow bit by bit and has to rationalize and use his (rather magical/reality breaking and offensive) powers... however they can be used.

I know the erogamer is very much similar to this, with its own funny little twist. I haven't finished erogamer (like 4 arcs in), but is erogamer pretty much this? Or are there others around similar in this regard? Based on level progression, a level 50 gamer in almost any ratfic-ish story I've read is basically invulnerable to modern weaponry/military capabilities short of nukes/massive bombing. Figured that'd be an interesting investigation into what-do with powers
