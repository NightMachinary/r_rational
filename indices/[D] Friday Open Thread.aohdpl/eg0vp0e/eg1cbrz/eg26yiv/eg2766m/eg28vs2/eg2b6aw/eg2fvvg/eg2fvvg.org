Those are all choices though, which is what [[/u/Cuz_Im_TFK]] was complaining about. The MC acquires power and chooses to carry out the prison break, which has the consequence of making them a wanted criminal. In the cliche, it's the other way around. They get power and that immediately makes them a criminal, even if the only thing the enemy knows is that the MC has some weird power.

​

Certainly there are cases where a competent villain wouldn't want to take the risk, but in most instances I think it would be better to at least figure out who the MC is and what their goals are. If all they want is for you to let their buddy go, then that's a pretty cheap way to buy loyalty, or at least get the MC to let their guard down so you can slip some poison in their beer.
