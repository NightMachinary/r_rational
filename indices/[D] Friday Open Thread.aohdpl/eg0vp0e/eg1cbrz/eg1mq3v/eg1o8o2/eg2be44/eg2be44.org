Different types of Gamer franchises have different power sets. Paragamer(worm/gamer) almost exclusively have mundane abilities but just levels them up rather quickly.

Though even if you wanted to give the MC more powerful abilities the insentive structure of the reward system could require the MC to initiate in actiony conflict to increase XP. IIRC in WtC MC can only level abilities past lvl 20 by being in combat rather than self-study.
