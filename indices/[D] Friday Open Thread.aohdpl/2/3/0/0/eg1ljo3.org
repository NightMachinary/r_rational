Ehhh, sorry, I'm going to have to disagree with you again. There can be a cool premise without the actual story being any good.

Just to give an example (and I know many will disagree with me, here), I kept seeing how popular To The Stars was on here so I tried rewatching the source material. I found it incredibly boring - I ended up having to watch most of it on 2x speed and even then just read a summary of the last few episodes. There is kind of a cool, if cliched, premise -- which is what makes for good fanfiction (I assume, I haven't actually read To The Stars yet) along with a good story and good storytelling, of course. But the show itself was predictable and way longer than it needed to be for the story it was trying to tell.
