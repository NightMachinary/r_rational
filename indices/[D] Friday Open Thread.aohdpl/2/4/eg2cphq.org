I loved the Fate/Zero anime, which was the first Fate thing I have watched. It is one of my most enjoyed anime, and I felt it was unusually maturely handled for the medium.

In contrast, I wouldn't object to calling Fate/stay night: UBW a semicoherent, generic weeb show, and I didn't enjoy it hugely outside of some flashy animated fights. I think it handled the core message vastly less competently than F/Z, and I largely agreed with your criticisms.
