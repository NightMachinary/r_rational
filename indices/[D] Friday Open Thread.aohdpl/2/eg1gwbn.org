Can someone tell me about the Fate series- specifically, when it gets good/interesting? I keep seeing fics and discussions related to it, and while volume of discussion isn't /always/ an indicator of quality, it's correlated enough that I would like to get into it. But so far the first one... oof. I'm reading an LP of the original Fate visual novel and I'm about 57 updates in and it's the most tedious shounen garbage ever.

The premise of the story is that there's some kind of dragonball-esque war for a wish granting mcguffin and all the mages engaged in this war get some kind of legendary hero from the past incarnated as a spirit to fight for them, and you win by getting rid of all the other spirits or killing their magi, and nobody starts off knowing the identities of the other competitors. This sounds /interesting/ and like the setup for some decent action and/or intrigue but so far the story literally has not done anything with it.

In reality the entire story has been another harem-fic with the wet blanket dumb-as-a-post main character gradually accumulating this gigantic stable of women who are all, for some reason, compelled to hang around him or live with him or mentor him or just really want to bone down. Of course he does not recognize any of this, being your typical misogynist Japanese protag player stand-in. He wants to fight but not hurt anyone, his justification is the usual poorly translated run-on stuff like "A man must fight to protect what he believes in so if that is my destiny I will be the Emiya Shirou who is the hero and choose to save everyone even if that becomes the proof of my existence." Everyone else constantly tells him he is a dumbass. I have no doubt that the story will prove him 100% right in the end, somehow.

He has no skill in magic, he isn't in any sense cunning, his only real ability seems to be that he is inexplicably charming to every woman in the story. He constantly orders them around, has no ability to discern or navigate his own emotions, orders them not to fight "For their own protection because they're women" despite easily being the weakest and most inept cast member himself. The VN goes out of its way to do the awkward bath scene, and the innapropriate-underage-child-in-bikin-bottoms thing, and just generally be as creepy and awful about women as it is possible to be. There is literally a scene where the main character learns a classmate was chased by some kind of molester at night and he says out loud "Good, she needs to learn to be more feminine and that's the only way to teach her." It's exactly the kind of shit that has seen me move away from most manga/anime.

Whew! Okay I didn't mean to rant for three paragraphs, but back to my original question. When does this pick up and get interesting? When does this MC get throttled with his own wet blanket, and replaced by the cool and good lady mage who has moved in with him? Why does every VN assume that I want to read everything from the viewpoint of the most ignorant, least competent character in the series?
