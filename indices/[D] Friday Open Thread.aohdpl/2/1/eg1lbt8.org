Most of Fate isn't very good. It /is/ very shounen and has tons of fanservice fluff, and Shirou does have a lot of women falling over him while being clueless it's happening.

But for his naive "white knight save everyone in the world" view, it's very explicitly an insane viewpoint even within the setting, unlike Naruto. One of his character facets is that he's /not sane/ - he will do anything to save anyone he comes across, even if it damns everyone else, and is manically focused on being a "Hero of Justice" and what that means to him. It's explored a lot in Unlimited Blade Works. His viewpoint does cause him severe problems.

I'd recommend watching Fate/Zero instead. It has a more interesting story and you'd probably enjoy Kiritsugu as a main character a lot more, since he grapples with ruthless effective altruism and grey morality throughout it. Fate/Hollow Ataraxia is the "interesting" VN, but I think requires you to read Fate/Stay Night to understand what's going on (and is famous for being mindscrew-y).
