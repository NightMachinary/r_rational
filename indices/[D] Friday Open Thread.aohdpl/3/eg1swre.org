Should you be accurate or convincing ?

​

This community in general has a lot of statistical knowledge, this tends to lead to more nuanced and less full certainty comments. In general people here speak, at least when commenting here, in the way I'm doing now, without 100% certainty. If this was written as a normal person would the previous phrase would have been "people here speak without certainty". The way of speaking we tend to use here is great, humble and more accurate, but some would say less likely to change people's views.

​

*So my question is*, seeing that rationality can be defined as playing to win, *should we when trying to convince, someone not from this sub, of something optimize for being Convincing or Accurate ?*

​

Or is my entire premise flawed and our way of speaking is actually more persuasive than others?
