Identify your end goals.

If one of your long term goals is to promote rationality then I encourage you to include your convidence % in your statements and in generally seek precision in your statements. The chance that someone might be interested in rationality due to you increases if you do this.

If you value promoting rationality less than you care about winning the audience, present your case in whichever way you believe have the highest probability of convincing your audience.

On a tangent, I would really like it if rational people would talk in probability rather than just writing it. In the latest bayesian conspiracy, someone said something like: if we do X then something undesirable happens but if we do Y then we achieve the desirable outcome, rather than saying both X and Y have some probability of achieving the desirable outcome but my best guess is that Y have 40% higher chance of succeeding so that is the desired course of action. And I see this trend so so often. It even happened at my local EA meeting today.
