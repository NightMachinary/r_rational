My ongoing work [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9233966][Programmer at Large]] basically fits the description.

The economic and political side of it are softly utopian (the society in question is adapted for undergoing regular resource bottlenecks when they travel between stars, but within that constraint it's pretty utopian), but socially they're aligned quite differently from us. They're also probably dystopian along a few axes (it's not a great place to be a non-conformist or a loner).

The big axes on which the society is weirdtopian though are:

- The society in question is normatively agender and asexual.
- They practice ubiquitous mostly benign sousveillance - their level of privacy is drastically lower than ours (even in comparison to say a small town which is much closer to their size of community)
- Their daily schedules are fairly heavily regimented by software. The software is under their control to /some/ extent, but is mostly there to enforce a large number of norms.

On balance it's a pretty nice place to live if you're born into it, and there are definitely people for whom it would be a dream place, but it would feel very weird to most.
