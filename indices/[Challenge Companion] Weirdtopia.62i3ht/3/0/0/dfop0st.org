The Overlords theoretically could just arbitrarily delete the citizens, but doing so wouldn't make much sense. They want to maximise technological improvements, which means (a) enabling a wide variety of perspectives to exist, and (b) not instilling fear in the average citizen that would undermine their ability to concentrate.

  Everyone except the shareholders is replaceable, with those who are unable to compete effectively murdered.

Even the Overlords are replaceable. They're outnumbered 999:1 in terms of processing power, but the citizens are generally happy with their situation and so nothing happens.

As for being murdered, it is more like starvation. The citizens do not age, ail, or die, but resources are finite and anybody that completely fails to do anything useful for that long is taking up those resources.

Because growth is exponential, even infinitesimal improvements in growth rate result in massive simulated-time gains over the long term. The opportunity cost of supporting the freeloaders is immense.

  There is no way to survive except to neuter and lobotomize yourself, to give yourself wholly to the generation of more time credits.

I think your conclusion here presumes that it's a dystopia already. It takes a long period of inactivity to be archived, at least a personal-perspective decade (potentially longer, if capacity outstrips population growth). The mechanism is mostly there to deal with people who refuse to contribute, and some "indolents" are sponsored by wealthier citizens anyway (it's effectively another weird job).

It's true that if you want more simulated time than you could naturally achieve, you may need to take the drug analogues (or get lucky with an independent contribution), but generally people just reach an equilibrium they're happy with.

  If you've ever worked for a company, and felt relieved when you finally clocked out, imagine that you can never clock out.
#+end_quote

But you can clock out. If you devote half your time to leisure, you sacrifice your earning potential and slip down the scale, but you won't die. It's just that most citizens find enjoyment in their work, or devote a smaller portion of time to leisure.

#+begin_quote
  No matter where you go, no matter what you do, you are in a space controlled by that company, relying on it to decide whether you exist for one millisecond more.
#+end_quote

Isn't that true of literally every society? Even in a true utopia they could decide to kill you. They simply wouldn't, and neither would this one.

#+begin_quote
  Unless the shareholders are collectively the entirety of uploaded humanity, living in a simulated world, the shareholders are responsible for the genocide of the human race, having inevitably replaced them with better performing AI which don't require sex, companionship, leisure, art, superfluous sensory streams, or anything else critical to the human experience.
#+end_quote

What makes you think they don't require sex (or an analogue), companionship, leisure, or art? Is it because they're digital organisms?

Further, why do you think those things are critical to the human experience? Isn't that the entire point of a weirdtopia, to explore perpendicular approaches to happy societies?
