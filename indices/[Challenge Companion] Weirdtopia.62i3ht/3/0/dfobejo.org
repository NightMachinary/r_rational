No, that's just a straight up dystopia. You've described a corporation that has successfully managed to completely destroy society and put itself in it's place. There is a board of directors that controls all of the resources available to society. It has successfully formed a single universal form of currency, without which it is impossible to survive. Owning the very substrate their workers are made of, they can completely control every aspect of their employees lives, including the deletion or censure of employees that work against the shareholders interests. Everyone except the shareholders is replaceable, with those who are unable to compete effectively murdered. There is no way to survive except to neuter and lobotomize yourself, to give yourself wholly to the generation of more time credits. If you've ever worked for a company, and felt relieved when you finally clocked out, imagine that you can never clock out. No matter where you go, no matter what you do, you are in a space controlled by that company, relying on it to decide whether you exist for one millisecond more. Unless the shareholders are collectively the entirety of uploaded humanity, living in a simulated world, the shareholders are responsible for the genocide of the human race, having inevitably replaced them with better performing AI which don't require sex, companionship, leisure, art, superfluous sensory streams, or anything else critical to the human experience.
