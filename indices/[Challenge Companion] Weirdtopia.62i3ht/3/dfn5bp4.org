There's a very short story I wrote in a comment a while back that might fit the bill. I didn't go into much detail in the story, but I thought about it a fair bit.

The premise is that it's an uploaded society with no direct physical analogue (i.e. no simulated "world"). The Cloud has a physical reality (server farms, solar cells, bot fleets, etc.), but its inhabitants do not.

The Cloud is ruled by a group of minds with drastically augmented processing power (in total, maybe 0.1% of the total pool is allocated to them, where there are trillions of citizens dividing the remaining 99.9%). They monitor the real world (directing the bot fleets and the like) and the citizens (reviewing what they produce, checking for sedition and anti-social behaviour). Currently I'm calling them Overlords, but I'm not attached to the name.

The digital citizens develop technology, software, and plans for the Cloud. There's a variety of different jobs here, from pre-processing data through to architecting a new processor or bot. Only the final product is actually paid for by the Overlords, but they can in turn pay other citizens for their contributions (and if a citizen did rip off their employees, they could complain to the Overlords and get them punished).

Pay isn't given in the usual sense. It's basically your timescale. If you get paid a lot, you may get 100Ã— more simulated time per tick than the average. If you get paid very little, you may be in the inverse situation. If you don't produce anything useful for sufficiently long, you may be archived entirely (which is functionally death, except in the case that too many other citizens are deleted and can't be restored from backup).

There's no traditional sensory data. You don't see images or hear sounds, you receive information. You don't have a face, you have a profile.

Physical distance is meaningless. You can talk to anyone, anywhere. Of course, there's plenty of privacy settings (e.g. "never", "ask first", "always") that can be set with complex filters or on an individual basis.

There are drug equivalents which are all free (and side-effect free, beyond potentially being psychologically addictive). You can narrow your focus to concentrate on work, or expand it to take in a breadth of information. You can hallucinate (which is, again, non-sensory; it's information hallucination, not visual/audio) or feel happier or sadder or nothing at all. People partake if they can, but a lot of people couldn't afford to take time off working to really enjoy it; even in their downtime they'd rather learn useful things so as not to slip down the heirarchy.

Actually getting this across to the reader is difficult, because we're so used to things rooted in physical reality. Even something that's now commonplace (like using the internet) has been, and still is, represented terribly in media because it is hard to relate to the things that human brains are really good at.
