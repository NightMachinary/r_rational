I'd appreciate feedback on my posted story, with regards to both the elements of fiction as well as how well it fits the theme (bit broad and esoteric this time around). In my personal life, I have a number of science fiction shorts floating around, mostly half-finished, and in my professional life, I have a few publications which use analogy to describe emerging concepts in the field to my peers. This is my first time attempting the bridge the two, not sure if the obfuscation or twist makes it more fun or just hard to read.
