I just got hired for a job for when I finish my last semester. It's nice to finally stop worrying as much about that, although it is weird that I've been hired for something that won't happen for a few months.

Lately I've also been getting into SCP's a lot (from the gateway drug of qtnm), does anyone have any favorite SCPs or SCP-like stories to recommend? I love the idea of things/concepts that you can't comprehend safely.
