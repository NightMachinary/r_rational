  does anyone have any favorite SCPs or SCP-like stories to recommend?
#+end_quote

I have quite a few.

- First, note that [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/system:page-tags/][tags]] exist. If you want to find articles about a specific concept, you could likely narrow the search space down by searching tags.

- SCPs (roughly sorted by interestingness):

  - [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3211][SCP-3211]]: an antimemetic object with an interesting shtick.
  - [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2521][SCP-●●|●●●●●|●●|●]].
  - [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2747][SCP-2747]]: a very unique high-concept threat, similar to but distinct from antimemetic threats.
  - [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2470][SCP-2470]], [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3999][SCP-3999]], [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3812][SCP-3812]]: some of the more interesting end-of-reality Keters.
  - [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4000][SCP-4000]]: the forest of unspoken titles.
  - [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3930][SCP-3930]]: it genuinely doesn't exist, which is why it's interesting.
  - [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3309][SCP-3309]], [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/sandrewswann-s-proposal][SCP-001/Swann]]: metafictional objects. The second is my favourite [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-001][SCP-001 proposal]].
  - [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3148][SCP-3148]]: a memetic threat; showcases one of the Foundation's main weaknesses.
  - [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1968][SCP-1968]]: a memory-altering anomaly.
  - [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3002][SCP-3002]]: the ultimate memetic threat.
  - [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-093][SCP-093]], [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3003][SCP-3003]]: portals to interesting worlds.
  - [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2195][SCP-2195]]: a particularly disturbing take on biological weapons.
  - [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1173][SCP-1173]]: two mutually-exclusive countries.
  - [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1000][SCP-1000]]: yeti.
  - [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-140][SCP-140]]: a reality-warping book.

- Tales:

  - You're already familiar with [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/antimemetics-division-hub][the Antimemetics stories]], I take it?
  - Tentative recommendation: [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-cool-war-hub][/The Cool War/]], a series about the /Are We Cool Yet?/ Group of Interest. I found it interesting, but it may not be what you're looking for.
  - [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/visionsofabetterworld][/Visions of a Better World/]]: why the Foundation doesn't usually exploit SCP objects.

I would appreciate if you later replied with feedback: which of these you liked, and which didn't?
