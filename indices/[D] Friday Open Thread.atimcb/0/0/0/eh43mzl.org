  (overall, I'm not impressed with the Dark Magic plot; watching it after reading /The Dark Wizard of Donkerk/ feels like watching BvS after reading /The Metropolitan Man/; alexanderwales really needs to stop raising our standards so much)

So true... I'm also disappointed, there is a lot of potential there, but the dark magic in dragon prince is very flat and obviously "Evil" .
