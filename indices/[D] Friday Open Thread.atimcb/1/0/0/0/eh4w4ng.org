I think as well, another thing about it is that it kind of "reboots" after each season (not literally, but each season has a whole new reveal / new stakes/ etc that changes the show), so it stays fresh, and there's new stuff going on. Like, it's one of the rare shows that seems to maintain quality (or even /get better/) as time goes on.
