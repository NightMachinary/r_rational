I've watched The Good Place recently due to it being recommended here.

How do I put this......I'm simultaneously disappointed and in love with this show.

It's a show that explores the idea of a undeserving person who gets into Heaven (aka The Good Place) and I just /love/ how it brings up ethical considerations and moral dilemmas. But every /single/ time that they raise a serious concern about what Ellen should do, the show goes with a joke instead of the ethical argument it could raise.

Basically, it's a sit-com with very interesting themes that are only noticed if you are already in the mindset of thinking about such things. My mother says that she wouldn't normally watch it since it comes off as a typical sitcom which bores her, but she likes watching it with me because we would then have interesting conversations about the ethical arguments that the episodes reference in the background.

So, while I think it's a decent recommendation to this subreddit, just be aware that it's a sitcom and the interesting ethical considerations are very much a background aspect of the show and not the main focus.

PS I've only seen the first season and have no plans to watch anymore of it unless I'm watching it with a friend or family so we can talk about the ethics involved in each episode. By myself, it's too boring to watch.
