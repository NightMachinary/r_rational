To anyone who thinks the internet is a special bad place full of censorship where people just can't seem to sit down and have a good-faith debate, don't worry. It's not just the internet. The entire world has always been that way. As evidence, I give you the [[http://cpdp.debatpublic.fr/cpdp-montagnedor/images/CR-bilan/montagnedor-compte-rendu-debat.pdf][Montagne D'Or debate]] (Golden Mountain, a controversial mining project in French Guyana).

Relevant excerpts from the conclusion, translated:

  The first impression that dominates is that of a misunderstanding of what a debate is, which implies a progress in the knowledge of a project and in the argumentation. For none of the protagonists could the debate be a journey in which things could evolve. The sole objective of the bulk of the opponents was to make their views heard wherever meetings were held. They did not come to debate but to demonstrate. On the opposite side, the project owner presented a monolithic project, without any proposal of evolution that wasn't marginal, presenting the project in a "take it or leave it" fashion. This is what was expected of them from opponents who did not want to discuss the content of the project, who even blamed the owner for changing some of his presentations from one meeting to another to take into account the comments presented and questions asked, this attitude being denounced as a way to deceive the public through a variable geometry speech. For them, the only change that the owner could make was to withdraw the project.

  In this context, the neutrality of the CNDP was challenged by both opponents and supporters, each considering the other party as having been favored. It has unfortunately been observed that the demand for democracy could coexist in the same people with intolerance towards other people supporting a party different from theirs. Booing, anathemas and even attempts at physical aggression may have discouraged speaking engagements in the meeting of people who are in favor of the project, who, very much in the minority, have expressed themselves more on the participatory platform and in the action books.
