I was thinking of the moratorium mentioned in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/8fzdwx/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_april_30_2018/][this post:]]

  /A four week experiment .../

  Effective at least from April 16-May 13, there is a moratorium on all Human BioDiversity (HBD) topics on [[/r/slatestarcodex]]. That means no discussion of intelligence or inherited behaviors between racial/ethnic groups.

But it does look like it only lasted a month, for reasons that aren't clear and I don't want to spend the energy digging into.

Edit: Also, you go outside the three week window that Scott picked and you get comment threads [[https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/9174vt/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_july_23_2018/e2wa38y/?context=1][like this one]], where I think the commentary and upvotes speak for themselves, and help explain why people would report back to me and say that they perceived there to be a transphobic (or transhostile) bias.
