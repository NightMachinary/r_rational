If you want to do a better analysis, then you could look through [[https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/arzglg/a_statistical_analysis_of_the_rssc_culture_war/][this analysis]] and use it to categorize users. Specifically, you could look at [[https://i.imgur.com/dR4QJlQ.png][this image]] and profile who the most active voices in the CW threads were. (If you do so, please do it without pinging anyone.) My own quick-and-dirty random sampling of names on that list confirms my bias on the matter, but I don't have the time/patience/energy for anything more rigorous.

Edit: You could also use something like the (currently nonfunctional) Mass Tagger or Reddit Pro Tools to cross-reference users based on their karma in other subreddits, though you would have to pick those other subreddits and the karma threshold for them carefully, and it all might be better done by writing your own tool. Either way, I think that Scott's analysis wasn't very good, and didn't get to the heart of what people like me were saying about the CW thread (and the subreddit as a whole, which the CW thread bled out into).
