  His research conflicts strongly with my personal experience in the threads

I understand what you are saying, but there is a reason why people should not pay attention to anecdotes. Memories are strongly biased and impressions can be very different from the reality of a situation.

For example, what if there are very few right wing comments, but you think it's more common than it is because they stand out (aka more memorable) than the more common left wing commentary?

If you want to convince people that the CW threads are more right wing than what Scott says, you should investigate where you think his research failed to properly investigate and run your own survey to prove it, instead of simply saying "I don't agree with your survey, because it doesn't fit with my experience."

Personally, I actually think Scott's survey is flawed in one serious way. While it was worthwhile to investigate the political affiliations and opinions of the commenters, I wish that he had created a pie chart of the /issues/ debated in the threads and whether or not more debates were about left wing politics or about right wing politics. Unfortunately, I can't do this myself because I'm not very politically savvy and I wouldn't know any better if I tried to categorize the debates myself. I feel like a majority of the debates are about agreeing with or being against right wing politics, but it's only my impression and it's a fairly subjective division to make as well.
