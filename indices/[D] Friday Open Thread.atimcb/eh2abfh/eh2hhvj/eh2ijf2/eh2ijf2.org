Scott himself made a blog post on it recently and explains it far better than I could. If you want more regular user thoughts there's a discussion thread in the subreddit right now.

The only point where I disagree with Scott is that I definitely think the Culture War thread was decently right wing. And it's not just that I've never been anywhere else right wing, I've spent a fair amount of time browsing [[/r/the_donald]] and such and know what conservative opinions are. But it can be hard to judge, since the Culture War thread didn't fall on the most typical left/right dividing lines. Like would a post defending praising Trump for pushing for the decriminizalation of homosexuality internationally count as right wing or left wing?
