"Culture war" refers to any ideological struggle between two or more factions. In American politics, where the term was coined, it usually refers to the most contentious topics like abortion, gun control, race, gender, sexuality, religion, etc., specifically, where different values and beliefs on those issues come into conflict.

The culture war threads were originally set up as a place to observe the culture war, a goal which, in my opinion, they've abjectly failed at, instead becoming primarily a place where culture warriors wage the culture war.
