Note: I will be attempting to adhere to this subreddit's policy of "No U.S. politics whatsoever" while still answering the question.

  If you're against witch-hunts, and you promise to found your own little utopian community where witch-hunts will never happen, your new society will end up consisting of approximately three principled civil libertarians and seven zillion witches.

In this case, it was a little more than that.

1. Scott had/has a habit of going after "the left" for various things that he dislikes and steelmanning the far right because he wants to engage with them in a spirit of mutual understanding and charity. (By most reckonings, he would be fairly far to the left.)
2. Scott's [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/03/03/reactionary-philosophy-in-an-enormous-planet-sized-nutshell/]["Reactionary Philosophy in a Nutshell"]] tract attracted a lot of reactionaries, in part because he was presenting a better, more coherent political philosophy than most reactionaries. The follow-up [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/10/20/the-anti-reactionary-faq/][Anti-Reactionary FAQ]] came almost half a year later, and didn't really do that much to dissuade the reactionaries.
3. Moderation in both the SSC blog and the SSC subreddit was of a particularly rationalist mode of free speech, where no idea is too obscene or dangerous to be heard, so long as it's reasoned moderately well. This naturally attracts people with fringe views, and naturally drives out a lot of people who are unwilling to tolerate fringe views (whether because they find them that distasteful, because they get tired of feeling compelled to argue against the same fringe viewpoints week after week, or because they don't like being associated with that sort of person).
4. The Culture War threads in particular attracted a lot of reactionaries, especially during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Because it was one of few relatively inviting homes for reactionaries, a lot of them showed up relative to the normal population. Included with those reactionaries were plain white nationalists, or people who had made the jump from being reactionary to white nationalist.
5. This drove a fair number of people away (myself included), which intensified the problem. The "human biodiversity" subject was banned from the subreddit sometime last year, IIRC.
6. Both Scott and the mods of the subreddit have gotten pressure to get rid of the culture wars stuff, in part because it had a bad reputation, and in part because it seemed to be generating a lot of heat and very little light.
7. Scott got harassed and threatened, with every indication that this would continue into the future.

Personally ... as a mod of this subreddit, which is for the sharing and distribution of rational fiction, I somewhat often remove posts that are strictly about rationalism, usually from people who are apologetic and just saw "[[/r/rational]]" and then didn't look any further before posting. People would ask me where to post instead. Similarly, we banned discussion of U.S. politics in these Friday threads (mostly the heat and light issue, partly because it was making this place unpleasant), and people have asked where they can talk about such things instead.

I've directed a handful people to [[/r/slatestarcodex]], and a few would come back with "wow, there's a lot of racism, transphobia, etc. there", a sentiment which I agree with, and which has helped reinforce my negative opinion of the place, specifically the culture war threads. From my perusal of the replacement subreddit, it doesn't appear that their particular slant is much different than that of the culture war threads, at least from look at the highest upvoted comments.
