I didn't say that I agreed with Scott's research. In fact, I even point out a flaw in his survey in the last paragraph of my comment.

I don't think Scott's research should be trusted. It was just that the rebuttal seemed to be more along the lines of using anecdotes rather than pointing out the flaws in Scott's investigation.

It may have seemed like I support the research because I was arguing against GeneraIKenoA instead of agreeing with him and arguing against Scott.
