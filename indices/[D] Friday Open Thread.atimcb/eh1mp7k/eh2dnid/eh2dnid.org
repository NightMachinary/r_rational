It's pretty good.

The pacing is still all over the place, but the story gets deeper, and we get a pretty good idea of what the motivations of the different characters and factions are, how they got where they are, and what's at stake if the protagonists fail.

The characters are all compelling and fun, even Viren (whose behavior still makes no sense). The child-queen-who-turns-out-to-be-a-hardass character is a bit of a clich√© by now (hell, /She Ra/ did it too this year), but she's still a treat to watch; I like how in her scene, she's both clearly intimidated and unsure, and yet she stands her ground in an extremely stressful situation.

Also that one scene where Claudia goes Palpatine is amazing.

(overall, I'm not impressed with the Dark Magic plot; watching it after reading /The Dark Wizard of Donkerk/ feels like watching BvS after reading /The Metropolitan Man/; alexanderwales really needs to stop raising our standards so much)
