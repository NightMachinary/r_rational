Yeah, no one should have recommended the show as focused on ethics. It's not accurate, but it is remarkable for bringing up any ethical discussions at all.

The main reason I liked /The Good Place/ was that it's a great comedy show with actual forward momentum. The second season is even better in this regard. The sci-fi and ethics jokes are the cherry on top.
