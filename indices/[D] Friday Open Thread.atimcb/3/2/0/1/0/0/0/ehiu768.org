Yeah. Note the title of the threads was "Culture War Roundup" rather than just "Culture War". Each post of it explained this:

#+begin_quote
  Please be mindful that these threads are for discussing the culture war---not for waging it. Discussion should be respectful and insightful. Incitements or endorsements of violence are especially taken seriously.
#+end_quote

But that all fell apart pretty much immediately, especially since moderating those threads was a hell of a job, and there are a lot of ways to wage the culture war without having anything that the mods would find actionable.
