  If you want to convince people that the CW threads are more right wing than what Scott says, you should investigate where you think his research failed to properly investigate and run your own survey to prove it, instead of simply saying "I don't agree with your survey, because it doesn't fit with my experience."

I agree with this but from what I understand of rationality, a proper rationalist wouldn't take Scott at their word either because as [[/u/GeneraIKenoA]] rightly pointed out, it's hard to say whether the comments Scott used are really right wing or not because they weren't provided. So, while you seem to be implying that people should believe Scott's research, I think it makes more sense to maintain a neutral belief until /someone/ presents research that has the source comments as part of it.
