This is a very disingenuous summary. In [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/22/rip-culture-war-thread/][Scott Alexander's post on the subject]], the central thesis of it is that people opposed to "racists, sexists, and nazis" were following him around and constantly doxxing him on twitter, harassing his real life friends, and called his work and lied to try to get him fired.

Scott wasn't worried about a bad reputation from people posting in a thread; he was worried about an organized campaign of hate and lies against him.
