Just read through from the beginning; you had me at the 'literally inside the Internet' lie.

What he's trying to maintain regarding his local city is /terrifying/. (Social life, job, suspicious equipment.)

I find myself quite curious about how he originally got in touch with (and received equipment from) Doc. Also whether Doc's equipment is able to effectively confound people (capes or otherwise) who try to trace Delphic's communications.

Taking another moment to contemplate how terrifying his lifestyle is: 'I could live in a luxurious isolated location with zero human contact, splitting my time between recreation and changing the world for goodness and profit. Instead I will now go do my job, which involves frequently climbing in locations which would be dangerous if I were to slip or were a foothold to break. I do my job as a cover for planting suspicious equipment in various places. I've set up a balancing act that requires me to do all maintenance associated with these locations, and if I'm unable to do this for a few days my suspicious equipment will be discovered. For the sake of this job, I will now head into a neighbourhood which will surely respond to my presence with fear, violence, and/or calling down upon my individuals who have a good chance of using violence against me. I do this frequently, though all this about my lifestyle is optional, and (as far as the reader is aware) I have no personal-protection powers to safeguard my body.' AHHHHH. (Terrifying.)
