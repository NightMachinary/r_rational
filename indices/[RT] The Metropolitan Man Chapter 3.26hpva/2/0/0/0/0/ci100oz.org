I think it works well in the background. I just (on my second read through) noticed the amendment number and it didn't ring true to my understanding of conlaw. I learned that the way I think the law works doesn't match up with how it worked in the past. I'm going to guess that your spoiler above will provide that education to any future readers, and it doesn't need to be changed, since the new chapter is due on Sunday.

Not that I would object to an early release. :)
