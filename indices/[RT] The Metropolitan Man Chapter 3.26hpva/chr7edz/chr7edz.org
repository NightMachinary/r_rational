Interesting. I'm really enjoying this look at Superman's abilities and how Lex could counter them, since they really don't make much sense. I'm guessing that Superman's abilities work the way he believes them to work and that's why he can't see through lead even though he's probably not actually using X-rays. It would also explain being able to hear things from very far away. It'd be funny if Superman accidentally destroyed his world as a baby because he had a temper tantrum and no reason to think that it was outside his capabilities.
