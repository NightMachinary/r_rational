The case of Shoe vs New York discusses unreasonable infringement of the right to liberty under the Fourteenth amendment in reference to probable cause resulting from Superman's "x-ray" vision. The Fourth Amendment protections against "Unreasonable Search and Seizure" would be the more appropriate amendment to sue under in such a case, in my opinion.
