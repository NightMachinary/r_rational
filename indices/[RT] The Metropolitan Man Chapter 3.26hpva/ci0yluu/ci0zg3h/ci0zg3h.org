With the caveat that I'm not a lawyer or historian:

Due to the fact that we're set in 1934, the 4th Amendment hasn't actually been incorporated and doesn't apply to states. In our timeline it was ruled in 1949 (/Wolf v Colorado/) that the 4th Amendment partially applied to the states through the "liberty" clause of the 14th Amendment. Full incorporation of the 4th followed in 1961 with /Mapp v Ohio/.

I may change the passage to indicate that it's both the 4th and 14th in play, but it's hard to write about how history diverges without resorting to a more omniscient point of view, and I'm a little bit leery of writing more about conlaw when I'm just a conlaw enthusiast rather than someone with even a scrap of legal education. I also have no idea what the level of average legal knowledge of readers is, nor of how much anyone wants to read about an alternate history of the law in light of the arrival of Superman.
