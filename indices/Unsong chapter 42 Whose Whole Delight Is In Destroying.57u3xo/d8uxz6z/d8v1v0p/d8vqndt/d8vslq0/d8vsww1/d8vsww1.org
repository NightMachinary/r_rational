Yeah, right after Madrid happens, TCK shows up on Uriel's cloud to talk to him and Sohu about what happened.

I don't think we have an exact timeline for the siege of hell, but Madrid happened in 1991 (as it did historically), and the chapter where the crew of /Not A Metaphor/ meets up is in 2002, and says that the Comet King went to find Metatron 5 years before. So the siege of Hell and TCK's death happened between 1997 and 2002.
