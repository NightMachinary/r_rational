Being a diplomat, probably. Once his invasion was thwarted, it seems that Thamiel spent most of his time chipping around at the edges of the world - the Madrid Conference and so on. Time is on his side, after all.

(I don't think we've seen him since Madrid, though. Which leaves over 20 years for him to start up some new machinations.)

The gateway to Hell is in Russia, and the Other King is based in the Southwest USA, so I don't think he could attack directly. He's in a good spot to push back the Drug Lord, though. If he's interested in that - he apparently lets people sell peyote in his capital.
