Hard to imagine, given that the internet can't do video or audio. Given his statements, I would imagine images work (Unless he's /mailing/ those pictures) so I suppose the old tradition of passing along the tapes still exists.

Still, given that broadcast TV isn't a thing, either there's a lot more direct-to-video anime than in our universe or there's a large enough demand for playing anime in theaters.
