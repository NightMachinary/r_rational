  Furthermore, I am a placebomancer. These things have their own logic. When a young woman with a mysterious past comes to you bearing strange secrets and offering to join you, you take her. If she has no apparent skills or abilities, you super take her. If you hurt her, bad things will happen to you. If you take her, then, when all else is lost and your own power avails you nothing, she hands you victory in some totally unexpected and hilariously ironic manner.

Excellent decision, Mr. Alvarez. But most of those guarantees are centered around the protagonist - and considering how long it's been since your last appearance, I don't think you're the protagonist of this story. How does that play into your trope-centered morality?

Though, placebomancy does line up quite nicely with Ana's recent revelation in Panama, which strongly hints everyone's the protagonist of their own story. But even then, the p-zombies of Africa can't be protagonists, so is there anyone else who isn't?
