I was doing a bit of re-reading and came accross this in Junipers notes from chapter 105:

#+begin_quote
  A Manxome Foe - Post-Arthur campaign, set in a decaying, dying world full of horrible things. A frightening number of exclusion zones come from this campaign, meaning that it's one of the most visible parts of Aerb. Lots of names from Jabberwocky, mostly because that's also where “vorpal” comes from. Lots of character deaths. Fel Seed.

So the Mome Rath is from the fucked up campaign that Fel Seed came from?
