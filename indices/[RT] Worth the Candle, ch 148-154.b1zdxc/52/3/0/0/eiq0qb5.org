Ah, I guess the useful aspect here is to offer some insight into the mind of some proportion of the people who will read this story because of the litRPG tag, those stories tend to scratch a very specific kind of itch, which WtC did in the beginning, but doesn't really do now. Also, some people can't really just quit a story midway after tens of hours of reading, so reading this story especially past around chapter 100 has kind of been like having an itch at the forefront of my attention that doesn't get scratched.
