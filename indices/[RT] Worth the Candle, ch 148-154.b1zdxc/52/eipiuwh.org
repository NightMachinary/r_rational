Unfortunately, it is at this point that I finally lost the remaining enjoyment i got out of reading this series. The constant paranoia, meta-narrative stuff, the romance, and Juniper's lack of Ambition and determination have slowly but surely eroded my enjoyment to nothing. I was desperately rooting for the Level Up value to makes it's way up Juniper's soul, the powerups and leveling were a bit more satisfying early on, but now there isn't a hint of that.
