This is great. The ending is pretty awesome, and the whole scenario feels real cool. Lots of cool stuff going on here. I'm getting a few Lovecraftian vibes out of this whole 'droning summoning evil monsters' thing. Too bad they don't have a steamship to ram into Mome Rath's head, which is the 'traditional' solution to this sort of problem (see Call of Cthulhu...). Maybe Bethel can arrange something? Or they can find a similarly large vehicle?

The bursar being he'lesh and the bit about hallucinatory drugs - is that a Pratchett reference?

I'm gonna start a reread of WTC pretty soon. I haven't reread from the start in a long time...
