Claret Spear!

Still magic!

Vibration magic!

Blood magic spell that almost immediately gets superseded by still magic!

Bethel being snarky!

Interpersonal drama!

Confirmation that Amaryllis didn't soulfuck Joon and all that discussion was overreacting!

The burning dude is called Harold!

Really, just fantastic chapters all around. I'm glad that we didn't get 20k more words about Joon going to class, because that would have dragged on quite a bit. I wanted to see Joon actually using still and vibration magic, and he had a chance to use still magic, but I'm content to wait till next release. I'm also wondering if still and vibration magic will extend to people through symbiosis, which will again have to wait until next release.

I sure hope that Bethel stole some books on still and vibration magic from whatever library S&S has, because Joon has been hampered in the past from not knowing abilities that someone of his skill should easily be able to accomplish, as seen in this batch.

Valencia's loyalty up came because Joon had previously said that she shouldn't ever look at him with a devil in her or he would never speak to her again, and he implicitly gave her permission to do so again.

Maybe the Space Plate plus Warder's sight or just Bethel could recover Pallida's hat? Kinda doubt it though.

So Uther knew: Blood, Still, Star, Warding, Soul, Spirit, and probably Vibration magic. Possibly Flower magic as well.

I really wonder how Joon plans to fight something so enormously huge. Maybe there's some weakness only he knows about, some part of its nature that makes it easier for a single person to kill?

The Claret Spear should allow Joon to teleport longer distances with the Ring of the Broken World, if the spear counts as part of himself. That could allow some neat tricks.
