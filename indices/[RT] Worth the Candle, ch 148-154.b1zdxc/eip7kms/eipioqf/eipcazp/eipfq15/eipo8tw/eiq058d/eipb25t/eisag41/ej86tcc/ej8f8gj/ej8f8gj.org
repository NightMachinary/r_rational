Fair. You should still be able to find some though; it just won't be nearly as easy. That said, there should still be books to take him up 10 or 20 levels without crazy amounts of effort, though probably not to 100, or something like that.

Also, you gave me a crazy surprise with your comment, since mine was almost a week ago. I had no idea what you were talking about. Lol.
