Where is the thumbnail image for this post coming from? I decided to add WtC to my ebook collection, and I could use a decent cover.

Edit: I found it [[https://s3.amazonaws.com/otw-ao3-icons/icons/1706366/standard.png][here]], although it's still not a great image...I guess the better question is, is there fan-art which would be suitable for a cover?
