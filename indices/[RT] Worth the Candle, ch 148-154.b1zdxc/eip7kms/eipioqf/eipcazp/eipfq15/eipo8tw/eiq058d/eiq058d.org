The ethics professor basically told them she had an exit-strategy, and they did not catch it. - She said she knew it was a risk when she took the job, she lied when she said she did not see it coming, and she was completely calm about the whole thing. I take the sum of all this to mean she set up a highly reliable escape plan either before she took the job at all, or pretty much immediately upon arrival.
