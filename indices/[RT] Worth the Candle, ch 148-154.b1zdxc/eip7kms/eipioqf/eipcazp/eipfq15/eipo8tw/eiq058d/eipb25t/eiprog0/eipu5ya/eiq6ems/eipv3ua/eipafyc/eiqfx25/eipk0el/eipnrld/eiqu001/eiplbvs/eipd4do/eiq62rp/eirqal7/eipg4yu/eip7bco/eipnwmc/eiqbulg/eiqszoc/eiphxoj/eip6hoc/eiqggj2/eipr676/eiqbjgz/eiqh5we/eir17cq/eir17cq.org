Random thought through the read:

- Valencia takes on HP seems clouded with Devil's point of view.
- I think that most Bethel's action as of late is influenced by Ropey
- Reimer is ... damn, Reimer-like if that's a word.
- Using magic to solve poop problem... hmm.... why this sounds familiar (just kidding, lol)

*The Burning Man*

So the mystery so far:

1. Murder in the temple: it's probably people who know the Burning Man existence when they meditated. But get killed in their way out because they haven't converted yet and know too much about it.
2. There might be other people who also know but keep themselves silent. Don't know if this is a valid assumption.
3. But if point 2 above true, this informant might tell this info to other group/people in secret, afraid of getting detected by the burning man.
4. The ethic instructor, Malus Lartin, might know this information too from other mouth, hence she refuse June's help worrying if that was a trap from the Burning Man, or telling them in the prison might leak the information to the Burning Man.
5. The group that know the burning man existence might also the one who saved her at the Demon-Blooded Festival
