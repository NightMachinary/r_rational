Huh, there's been a conspicuous spike in 3rd person omniscient narration for the non-Joon characters in the last dozen or so chapters. It's really nice to get into the heads of the companions because I have the feeling we'll never see these sides of them if left to Joon's own devices and AW's narrative constraints on fitting in all the Joon-on-1 interaction combinations. However, like usual, fancy theory time! Besides the expository convenience, the increasing frequency in these short vignettes seems to coincide with Joon's own determination to be more empathetic to his companions (Pallida is an outlier here, wonder why) and, inversely, with a eerie reduction in the Earth DND vignettes. I'm guessing pronpinquity's at work again. But it also feels weird, because Joon is /not/ part of these interactions and he can't possibly know about them unless they recount it to him (IIRC the first secondary POV was Mary's during the Fallatehr arc and that was a recounting). Doesn't seem to be the case here, with how personal these episodes feel. And if we go full meta, the story's a self-insert - where's the meta-knowledge coming from, DM?!
