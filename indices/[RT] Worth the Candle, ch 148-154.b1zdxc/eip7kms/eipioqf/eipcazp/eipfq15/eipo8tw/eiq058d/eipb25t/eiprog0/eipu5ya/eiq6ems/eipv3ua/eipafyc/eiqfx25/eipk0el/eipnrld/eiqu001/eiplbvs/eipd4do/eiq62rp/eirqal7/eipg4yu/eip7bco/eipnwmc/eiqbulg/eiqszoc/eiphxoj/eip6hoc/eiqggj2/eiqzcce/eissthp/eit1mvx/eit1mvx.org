Void weaponry and lightning species are both pretty good counters to still mages, and then they have strong werewolf man to keep him from moving too much. Vibration mages don't have much in the way of defenses, so I don't think special accommodations need to be made for fighting them, except of course to not use the few types of attacks that they can nullify. It was honestly a pretty good plan, they just didn't account for Joon being strong as fuck and as good an unarmed fighter as he is.
