  “What does that mean, ‘multiclassed'?” asked Reimer.
#+end_quote

did you mean for it to be reimer asking this? i could see it being intentional or a mistake. he knows the jargon so why ask, but maybe you meant it as a more targeted question about how their game maps to real life. either way, bit weird

edit: ah, i think this bit a couple of chapters later covers it. "asked Reimer, once again betraying an astounding ignorance of the norms and terminology of tabletop role-playing games"
