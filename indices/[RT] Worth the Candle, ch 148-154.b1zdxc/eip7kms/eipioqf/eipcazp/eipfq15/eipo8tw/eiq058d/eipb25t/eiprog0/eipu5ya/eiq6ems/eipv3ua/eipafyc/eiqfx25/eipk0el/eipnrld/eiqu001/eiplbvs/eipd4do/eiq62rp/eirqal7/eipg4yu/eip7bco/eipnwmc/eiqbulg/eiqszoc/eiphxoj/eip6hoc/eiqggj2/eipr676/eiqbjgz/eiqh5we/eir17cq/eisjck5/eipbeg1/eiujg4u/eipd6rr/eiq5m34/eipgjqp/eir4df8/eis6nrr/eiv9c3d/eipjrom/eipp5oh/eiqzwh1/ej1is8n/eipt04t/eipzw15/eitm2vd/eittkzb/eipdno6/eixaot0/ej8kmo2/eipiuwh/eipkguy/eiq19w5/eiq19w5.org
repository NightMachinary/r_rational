Nevertheless, I did get a total net positive enjoyment out of it, so thank you for writing it. If you ever decide to make a quick buck and write a powerleveling litRPG series with an infinite-determination protagonist set in an original world, I would throw money at you, those stories scratch a specific kind of itch that other (better) stories don't. I wish you a happy life.
