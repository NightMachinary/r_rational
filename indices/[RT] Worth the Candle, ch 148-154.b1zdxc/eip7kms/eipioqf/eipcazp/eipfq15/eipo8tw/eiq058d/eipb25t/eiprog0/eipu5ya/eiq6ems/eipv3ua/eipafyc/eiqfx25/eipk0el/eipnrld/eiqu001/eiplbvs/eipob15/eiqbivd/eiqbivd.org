Depends what a World Lord is.

The Herald Harold's definition of This World could be in terms of an epoch. A new world is an new age. The new World Lord would be the next savior, a new Uther.

Remember the Library doesn't see Harold as a future extinction event and the major thing thats changed from that timeline is Joon coming back into play.

I do also wonder if Harold is an echo of Uther.
