People are allowed to offer comments about why they're losing interest in a story as they lose interest in it. Not every post here should be from fans praising it, regardless of how deserved that praise may be.

Admittedly, in this case, the comment in question is not particularly useful, since it boils down to "not enough protagonist powerwanking for me," but it's the principle of the thing.
