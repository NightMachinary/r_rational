But wouldn't Joon and Uther more accurately fit the title World Lord more than something that, almost by definition was otherworldly?

As for the second part, you're assuming that Harold is only describe parts of a whole want, rather than many different wants. It's deliberately vague so I'm not hanging my hat on it by any means, but Harold could mean that he wants the end of his own life in limbo, waiting as the Herald for the next World Lord - Joon. The world ending threats that never end the world Harold hangs around could instead be challenges meant to LVL UP Joon and push him to ascendancy as the next World Lord.

All I'm saying really though is that there's definitely wiggle room for interpretation.
