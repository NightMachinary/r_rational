  "The idea that you'd be touching me, and that it would be no more pleasurable for you than touching a piece of wet cardboard ...” I trailed off. “I guess for me that would be worse than nothing, even if there was a physical response.”

  “You understand that's what it would be like for her, don't you?” asked Bethel.

  I sat in silence for a moment. “Yeah,” I said. “Maybe. To be determined.”

  “And then?” asked Bethel. “If you love her, and she loves you, but there's still no spark of sexual love between the two of you?”

  “Come on,” I said. “What is this? You're going to go from propositioning me to relationship counseling?”

  “Just curious,” said Bethel. “It might be my imagination, but part of the reason you've turned me down is that your moral code dictates that you would, one day, have to explain it to her, if we had sex? And you imagine that she wouldn't take kindly to that.”
