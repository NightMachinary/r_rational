The image is available at [[http://www.alexanderwales.com/candleIcon.png]]. When I post a chapter, I'll usually post the following in a chapter note on the first chapter:

=<img src="http://www.alexanderwales.com/candleIcon.png" height=0 width=0></img>=

... which reddit then grabs as a thumbnail within two or three minutes after the chapter has been posted here. Then I remove the image link. It's a hack to get around the fact that AO3 doesn't have custom thumbnails for stories.

Edit: [[https://imgur.com/a/Ge7cKgo][Larger/darker version here]]. If you want better than that, I'll have to go find the physical copy and scan it in. The icon is a lighter version of that one.
