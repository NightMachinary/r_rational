Interesting deconstruction of the soul-battle thing. Normally it's depicted as either a pure battle of wills or as what Gaiman called, "the oldest game" in /The Sandman/. Here in WtC it's frantically destroying braided energy creeping towards June a la Space Invaders.

Also interesting to see just how much Lisi gets under the skin of the normally unflappable Amaryllis (and over the skin of Reimer, heh). I can't think of an interaction the Mary and Lisi had in this set of chapters where Mary didn't express some sort of frustration in the narration about it. She seems to react almost more emotionally to her than to Fallatehr trying to soul-rape her; although it has been a while since I read those chapters and might have glossed them in my memory.
