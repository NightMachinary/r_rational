Thanks for the chapter! I've been really looking forward to this. :)

Three random thoughts:

1) It /really/ surprises me that they read Lisi and Reimer in so thoroughly. I was expecting them to recruit Lisi by saying something along the lines of "We run an island nation full of fish people with impossibly advanced technology, want to be on our good side Y/N", then have her pump Reimer on their behalf (I'm so sorry :) ). Being completely up-front with new, random assets who are not companions seems like a recipe for instant blowback.

2) Is Bethel trying to two-time Ropey, or are Bethel and Ropey trying to rope (heh) Juniper into a threesome?

3) I find it a little hard to believe that Amaryllis isn't aware that Juniper is head-over-heels for her. I know she's been shown to suck at interpersonal/selfish stuff before, but holy freaking crap- even the house and the bottle deer know that he's into her by this point.
