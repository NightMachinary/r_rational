He's still the Hero That Leaps Into Action though.

I tend to see the difference's between Joon and Uther as differences of genre. Like the difference between an English Tea Room mystery and Crime Noir as to how likely the protagonist is to get beaten to a Pulp.

Arther was always a participant in the Great Adventure, the typical Fantasy hero, working the story from the perspective of a player, never knowing how far the DM would go and so more willing to Sally Forth which meant that the DM had to hold back to keep the game going. Joon being from the other side of the cardboard wall, thinks that in the DM's place he wouldn't hold back which introduced a very different meta-tension and allows for threats to be applied in a different way.

Both of them fill the same role however, even if the genre is different, so the likelihood of them holding back is small.

And in any case, she believes in the Narrative from her own perspective, regardless of what Joon thinks, which makes it strange that she would invoke the challenge of the threat like that, unless she's deliberately playing a role to fulfill Narrative conventions and create a MetaImpetus for Joon to defeat it?
