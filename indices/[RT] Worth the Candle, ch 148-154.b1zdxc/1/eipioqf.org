  [Juniper, I know you might want to, but we can't fight it. It's hundreds of feet tall, dropping down from the clouds then going back up. There are dozens of legs and eyes that must be the size of human heads to be visible from street level. Joon, please, I'm telling you now that if there was ever a chance to stop this thing from being called down, we failed at it, and we can't even begin to think about fighting it. This is bigger than us. The Empire is going to get called in. They've got thousands of mages and magic beyond anything that we do.]

You can /taste/ the despair of Mary realizing that Joon is almost pathologically incapable of understanding "run away before the thing kills you", and that he's going to get killed trying to do the boss fight.
