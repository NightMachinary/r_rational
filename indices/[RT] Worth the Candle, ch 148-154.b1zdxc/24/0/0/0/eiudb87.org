I mean, the Man (and the Temple) are non-denominational for good reason. If you want to think of the effigy as a scape goat, or a stand-in for a person, float your boat. Neither myself nor anyone I know thinks of it either of those ways. Might be interesting to try...

Festivals that involve immolating a humanoid figure are many, and if that's the only overlap, I really would not say there's a connection.
