What I was suggesting is that lower density means that people are more likely to congregate in cities because of urbanization. But since I'm not an anthropologist either, that's just a guess. I can't model the effects of increasing the area of earth by an order of magnitude, but given that the teleport network has already spread across the hex and that there's been several empires of unification efforts, I don't think it's that surprising to come across a larger diversity in cities (especially since Joon's been visiting athenaeums, which have the means to gather all sorts).
