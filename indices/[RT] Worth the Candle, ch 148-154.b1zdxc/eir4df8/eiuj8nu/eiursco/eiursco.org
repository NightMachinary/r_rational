Honestly, having 14x lower population density sounds like it should make isolation even more common, not less. I'm not an anthropologist, but the Earth was pretty darn racially isolated for a long time, and even still is: you're not going to see very many black people or native americans walking around Moscow, and that's with us living in a pretty global society with cheap international travel [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/26623638][This]] says that the teleport network is basically their best travel system, which 1) has a planar cap of 54,000 per day 2) costs $10,000 per head.

And Aerb is /ten times bigger/. Slowly shifting tribal travel or small scale empires that lead to co-mingling, or even forced racial mixing via slavery systems, aren't going to have as much of an effect. They didn't have world-spanning empires before Arthur came around, and who knows how recent the teleportation keys were created. And according to the renacim, Aerb is only 30,000 years old, and I'm not even sure how advanced of a society they had before Arthur arrived.
