I was surprised by the line that there's only 200 different species. It feels like Joon has mentioned or seen several dozen of those already, just by going to a few major cities or from asides, and Aerb is /ten times/ larger than Earth is. That seems like a really low number, or at least a really high rate of co-mingling.
