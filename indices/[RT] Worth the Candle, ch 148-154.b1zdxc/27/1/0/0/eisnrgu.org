It's easy to Monday-night quarterback, but the simplest and most simulationist answer is that Joon intellectually knows still magic but has not yet integrated it into his combat reflexes. He's had a lot of practice punching people and dodging things, and none using the brand new form of magic that he just learned. In an actually rational story, people are not perfectly rational at all times, nor do they instinctively think of the perfectly optimal answer.

Personally, I would have been annoyed if he /had/ used it.
