Exciting chapters as always. Thoughts:

- Seems like a lot of character development for Bethel. I wonder if Bethel's decision to help out at the end was driven by guilt over not being there to help when Fenn died and Amaryllis's talk about apologies not being enough. (Where she doesn't have a duty as a house, maybe she has a duty as a friend?)

- For some reason I just found the Juniper/Sonee/Valencia scene super adorable, even though they were all just lying the whole time. I want a spin-off now where Valencia and Juniper are roommate-buddies at college.

- If Juniper sees an exclusion zone occurring in person, it might strengthen his drive to solve the world's problems. (Especially if some of the people he's met get trapped in it.)
