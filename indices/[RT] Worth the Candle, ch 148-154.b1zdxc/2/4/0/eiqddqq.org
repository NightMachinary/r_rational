It means that Amaryllis would have had to take upon herself all the risks associated with manipulating Joon's soul for the benefit of only one week of soul fucked Joon (he was always very likely to spend the second week in a 'coffin'), a week in which his schedule was mostly tied up at the athenaeum. There were many possibilities put forward regarding what Amaryllis hoped to gain and why such a risk would be justified. Those possibilities have been greatly reduced, especially the possibilities with the most benefit.

I think those still unconvinced would be mostly limited to Word of God at this point to have their minds changed but further evidence from the chapter was that the SOC superbeing Val spent time with Joon on two different occasions (and Amaryllis too) and noticed nothing awry. Circling back to the previous point, this limits Amaryllis to changes to Joon's soul that Val can not detect and requires a world in which Val can not read the treachery on Amaryllis' face.

Then from the doylist perspective, AW wrote Joon checking his soul with full knowledge of the soulfucking discussion. It was either intended to clarify that Amaryllis did not mess with Joon's soul or it was intended as a fake out. I guess people can decide for themselves if such a fake out would feel like a cheap trick or enhance the eventual reveal.

FWIW too, going forward there is no stronger evidence that can be given in future chapters than Joon having checked his own soul just under two weeks out and noting nothing amiss.
