This is Mr Wales answering the question of whether Amaryllis tampered with Joon's soul.

And Bethel was the star of this batch for me, her POV was so much fun, right up there with the first Valencia POV chapter. AW does a great job with her internal narrative and 'voice'. Her plan to write an entire book listing all the ways she could kill someone, to give to people annoying her, was hilarious, as was her struggle not to declare war on the locus because it prevented her from spying within it.

  “Perhaps another time,” said Bethel. “I believe I've gotten something from this conversation, more than I was seeking, in fact.

I was puzzling over what Bethel meant in regards to that final sentence but the reveal that she's into Joon clarifies it a lot.
