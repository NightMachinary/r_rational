New theory. Partially patternmatching on bad wordplay, partially on plot twists from Terry Pratchett's /Moving Pictures/. In that story, there was a magic sleeping person that the protagonists kept trying to prevent from awakening and it turned out that they were being actually counterproductive because the man awakening would act to restore order by stopping eldritch problems. His awakening was a response to solve the problem, not a symptom of problems and there was great dramatic irony when the reader realised the protagonists had ironically prevented a solution to their own problems.

What if Harold is radically misunderstood - instead of causing or being drawn to crises, instead he is trying to /prevent/ them, to stop them from arising or slow them when they escalate or limit the damage they can cause - which is why the incidents he precedes are always limited... Until now. To use a metaphor... there are two types of people you find running around near fires disproportionately often. One is an arsonist. *Harold could be a [[https://macysthanksgiving.fandom.com/wiki/Harold][fireman]]*. (no I don't think that link is indicative of anything - just amusing). I told you about the bad wordplay - the man made out of fire. Is a fire-man. A fireman. And juniper may have just killed the fireman in psychic combat.
