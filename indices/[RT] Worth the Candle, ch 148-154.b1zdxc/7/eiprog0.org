  As I was watching, a giant leg came down from the sky, knotted and gnarled, ending in claws as big as cars that dug deep into the earth. A second leg joined it, seeming to come from the clouds themselves, this one piercing straight through Canis Building some distance away. The creature descended slowly, but with the slowness of immense weight, other legs coming down to join the first two, until finally its bulk descended down from the cloud cover. People around me were screaming and running, and all I could do was stare. It had hundreds of eyes, long legs like a water strider, and a coating of short hair that moved without regard for the wind. Its head swept from side to side, and its many-jawed mouth let out inhuman screams in a handful of different pitches.

Mome Rath is from Jabberwocky, "And the mome raths outgrabe". But Juniper says they never made it into a game.

  Raven nodded. “There's an island where the trees grow,” she replied. She looked back down at the poem, then up at me. “What's Mome Rath?”

  “No idea,” I said. “It was on the list that Uther had your father read to me. It sounded familiar, but I don't know if I was just thinking of the poem, or if it's extrapolation from the other stuff, or whether I thought up something and then forgot it. So far as I know, it never made it into a game, so maybe it just never stuck. But it might be a novel creation of the Dungeon Master.” I shrugged. “I'm kind of curious how Arthur knew about it.”

There are several [[https://aliceinwonderland.fandom.com/wiki/Mome_raths][different depictions of them in media]]. Obviously none city sized, but interesting to speculate about.
