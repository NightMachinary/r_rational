  I sure hope that Bethel stole some books on still and vibration magic from whatever library S&S has, because Joon has been hampered in the past from not knowing abilities that someone of his skill should easily be able to accomplish, as seen in this batch.

100%. I'm pretty sure Reimer mentioned something about the learning status effort also being applied with a book (really almost anything), not just a teacher. It just can't be ex nihilo. I'm not sure how much that leaves experimentation, theorizing, and the scientific method on the table, though.
