Long time, no see! Been wondering what we've been up to over on *[[https://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Worth_the_Candle_Wiki][the /Worth the Candle/ wiki]]*? ...No? Too bad, I'm telling you anyway...

First of all, the *main page* has had a bit of an overhaul - there's now a widget for the Discord server (where most discussion for the wiki takes place), a little fanart gallery, and a "roll the dice" button that'll take you to a random page. Speaking of fanart, we've recently had [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/File:GrakhuilLeadbraidsSpiral.jpg][this artwork of Grak]] - courtesy of spiral on the Homestuck Discord.

Daniel111111222222's been diligently putting out more *chapter summaries,* rounding out Book I with chapters 11-14 ("[[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/A_Winding_Course][A Winding Course]]", "[[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Life_of_the_Party][Life of the Party]]", "[[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Time_Out][Time Out]]", "[[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/ELEVATOR_facts][Elevator Facts]]"), starting on Book II with chapters 15-20 ("[[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Whys_and_Wherefores][Whys and Wherefores]]", "[[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Kindly_Bones][Kindly Bones]]", "[[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Voting_Blocs][Voting Blocs]]", "[[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Communal][Communal]]", "[[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Montage!][Montage!]]", "[[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Desert_Course][Desert Course]]"), and skipping ahead to some more recent chapters ("[[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Piece_of_Mind][Piece of Mind]]", "[[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Commingling][Commingling]]", "[[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Monty_Haul][Monty Haul]]"). [[/u/Makin][u/Makin]]'s made a full summary for /[[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/The_Council_of_Arches][The Council of Arches]]/ - the side story. And for the [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Council_of_Arches][Council of Arches]] - the organisation.

Wondering who [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Karen_Dowler][Karen Dowler]] and [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Lena_Kordrew][Lena Kordrew]] were? We sure weren't, but MiddleTwin and Daniel have made pages for them anyway. Some more important *characters* - [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Tiffany_Archer][Tiffany Archer]], [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Thomas_Clint][Thomas Clint]], [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Craig][Craig]], [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Maddie][Maddie]], [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Larkspur_Prentiss][Larkspur Prentiss]], [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Heshnel_Elec][Heshnel Elec]] and the entirety of [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Fireteam_Blackheart][Fireteam Blackheart]] - have received pages courtesy of Makin. Newcomer Lumbjack has contributed a page for the biggest of bads - [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Fel_Seed][Fel Seed]]!

Some good headway's being made on the pages for *magic,* thanks to MiddleTwin's contributions of [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Bone_Magic][bone magic]], [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_magic][blood magic]], [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Essentialism][essentialism]] and an overview for [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Magic][magic]] in general. They've also contributed a page for [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/The_Host][the Host]].

Makin's done a page on the [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Dream-skewered][dream-skewered]], and Daniel's done a pretty comprehensive write-up for [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Void][void]]. Together, they've finally tackled one of the big pages we've been putting off - the [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Game_layer][game layer]]! You might also want to check out Makin's page for the [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Party][party]], his [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Achievements][list of achievements]], and his [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Quests][list of quests]] too. I mentioned his [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_entads][list of entads]] last time, but it's had some significant edits since then.

Now, I won't say his name... but, after countless hours of research and the deaths of several D-Class personnel, [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Shia_LaBeouf][the cannibal]] finally has a page of his own. Visit at your peril.

The Discord widget was made possible with the [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Template:DiscordIntegrator][DiscordIntegrator]] *template,* which also lets us place the widget in the sidebar of every page. I've added a [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Template:Speculation][speculation]] template for citation - please don't use it unless you have to! On the opposite end of the spectrum, you're encouraged to use the new [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Template:Spoilers][spoilers]] template on every page that spoils the story's big twists. Oh, and there's a new template for formatting stuff in the scary red font used for [[https://worththecandle.fandom.com/wiki/Template:Gw][game warnings]].

Whew! It's been a busy couple of months, but we still need all the help we can get. As always, I'd like to point people to [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WorthTheCandle][the TVTropes page]] for the story - linking to that page from various trope pages can really help the story's audience grow. As for the wiki itself, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/al7z2v/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_147148_terrorsvibrations/efbnpat][it's now at the point where CRJ himself can start using it as a resource]]! If you can spare the time, contributing to the wiki is a great way to show your support for the story - those of us on the Discord would be more than happy to guide you through the process.
