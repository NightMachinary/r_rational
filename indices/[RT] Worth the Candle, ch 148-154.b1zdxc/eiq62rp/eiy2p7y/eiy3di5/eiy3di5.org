Cyclamine is the name of her great-grandfather, who currently resides in the amulet. Note that he isn't /built/ into it:

  “It's a copy of my great-grandfather,” said Amaryllis. “Wearing it allows the facsimile to converse with me. *I'm fairly certain that I could push my own essence into it*, which would clear him out and make the copy one in my own image, but I'm understandably reticent to do that.”

The entad allows its owner to make a backup copy of his/her mind, Cyclamine is just the last person who did that. Amaryllis wasn't very fond of him, though; I'm speculating that she decided that having a backup/copy of herself is more useful than whatever utility Cyclamine offers (or fails to).
