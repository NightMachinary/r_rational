Well after evil-Joon reverted back to normal-Joon, normal-Joon used soul magic to nullify his desire for level-ups, and spirit magic to make that permanent. So that's probably why it wasn't a big deal.

As to why he didn't feel any of the side-effects of actually leveling up, your guess is as good as mine.
