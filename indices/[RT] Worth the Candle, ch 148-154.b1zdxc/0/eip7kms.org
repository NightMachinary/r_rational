Apologies for the delay on this one; this was probably the worst month and a half I've had, as far as sickness goes, particularly with a bout of norovirus going through my family, then a different cold a few days after that. (/Worth the Candle/ has been running for quite a while now, through weddings, family vacations, a number of times being sick, and two seasons worth of seasonal depression, but I'm usually better able to manage it.) This is also a pretty big batch of chapters, which is a contributing factor to the ~46 days between chapter releases.

You can [[https://www.patreon.com/alexanderwales][support me on Patreon]], as many fine people already have. If you'd like to track chapter progress and get ETAs, there's a [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PaLrwVYgxp_SYHtkred7ybpSJPHL88lf4zB0zMKmk1E/edit?usp=sharing][spreadsheet]] that gets updated roughly every night ([[https://discord.gg/8MdWg2r][the discord]] is also fairly good for that, but quickly descends into insanity when there's a drought).
