In chapter 149:

#+begin_quote
  “More fool him,” said Bethel.
#+end_quote

I don't know whether this is technically correct, but I found it difficult to parse, perhaps moreso than I would have if it said something like "More the fool him," or "All the more a fool," or something.

#+begin_quote
  beyond just the change how the voice
#+end_quote

"beyond just the change *to* how the voice"

Chapter 154:

#+begin_quote
  too powerful for Grak or I to break
#+end_quote

"too powerful for Grak or *me* to break"

#+begin_quote
  I'm going to be sensory deprived
#+end_quote

Shouldn't this be "I'm going to be *sense* deprived"? Unless that's just how Juniper talks.
