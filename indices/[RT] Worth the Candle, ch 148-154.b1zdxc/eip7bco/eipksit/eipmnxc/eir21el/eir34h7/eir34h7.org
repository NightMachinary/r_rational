Probably a difference in how "Harold" is pronounced. Behind the Name [[http://www.behindthename.com/name/harold][gives these two pronunciations for Harold:]]

  HAR-əld, HEHR-əld

The second pronunciation seems identical to the IPA that Google gives for "herald", "ˈherəld". The first pronunciation would be different enough that you might be able to tell, if you were listening closely.
