Chapter 148: The numbers of names and colors do not match; there are 10 of the latter and 9 of the former (I am assuming they are meant to match, and that Fallatehr is known to Lisi but not to Reimer).

Chapter 149: The spelling "hand job" is used twice and the spelling "handjob" is used six times. Which one is it?

#+begin_quote
  He and Solace are current indisposed.
#+end_quote

Should be "currently".
