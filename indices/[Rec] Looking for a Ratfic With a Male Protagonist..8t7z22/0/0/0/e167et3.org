Hey man I was drunk last night and I wasn't thinking correctly, crap, it's been six hours, do NOT look at the fic I linked. I mean, I really hope you'd have enough sense to read the notes at the beginning of the chapter, specifically "*you're gonna have the entire ending of HPMOR spoiled if you try to read HPIO first*."

I mean, Jesus Effing Heck, all the spoilers in that story are centered around /exactly/ the part of HPMOR that you haven't read yet.
