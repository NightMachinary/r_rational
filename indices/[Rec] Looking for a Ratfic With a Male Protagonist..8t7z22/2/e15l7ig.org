Oh god, you have no idea whether you like The Metropolitan Man or not. You liked the first 90%, but that's a different question entirely.

Read to 98% at least, the Finale chapters are very important. In fact, I'll recommend just the two Finale chapters to you. It meets every criteria except "long", and a slightly-faded memory from the reading the other chapters earlier should be sufficient for background info.
