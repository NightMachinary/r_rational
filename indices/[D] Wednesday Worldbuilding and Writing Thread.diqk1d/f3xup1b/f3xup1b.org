I've been pondering a possible story background, with one essential question.

What tasks cannot be accomplished without a theory of computation? And which ones are possible, but far too impractical?

The obvious one is no emulation. Any "code" would be converted directly into physical circuits, with no room for arbitrary execution.

Every other example of a thing I might want a single - task machine to do seems possible though. Routing in a network is possible but clunky, math of all sorts is easy, Terminal style displays are doable, with a limited symbol set and fixed commands.
