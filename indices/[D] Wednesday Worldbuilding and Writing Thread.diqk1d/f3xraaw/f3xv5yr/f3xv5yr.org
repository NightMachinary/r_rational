  what software do you use for illustration?
#+end_quote

I use Inkscape for vector art, Gimp for photo manipulation, Gimp for pixel art (though I'd like a better tool there), and Paint Tool Sai for painting. Vector art, photo manipulation, and pixel art can be done with a mouse (hell, I use a trackpad), but I'd never do free hand illustration/painting without a pen. I use a Wacom Intuos 4 for that. If you don't have/want a graphics tablet, another option is pencil and paper and a scanner. The process there is sketch, scan, ink, color, and I can go over some of the details if you like.

  is it better to do 50 thumbnails, or 1 complete work, when testing whether illustrations are necessary for the story?
#+end_quote

You need at least one complete page. You can fill in with (full-sized) sketches for the rest; sometimes even Placekitten.com is an adequate substitute.

  are pixel-perfect mockups necessary for phone UI, or can the interface details be gestured at and readers be reasonably expected to interpret them as necessary?
#+end_quote

Is this part of your story? Is the thing you're illustrating a phone UI? If so you use Inkscape. I doubt being pixel-perfect matters. Being complete would help a lot, but you only need to be complete in the foreground.
