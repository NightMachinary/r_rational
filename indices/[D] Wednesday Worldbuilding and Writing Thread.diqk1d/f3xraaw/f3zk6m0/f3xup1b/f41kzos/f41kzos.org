look at what people do with dwarf fortress. can your gears align into a system for the defense of the mountainhome, possibly with lava for the outside world? pressure plates, doors and bridges and floodgates. and levers.

or look at minecraft. what can redstone really do?

there will be enough builds you can google, to get a start on crazy ideas.
