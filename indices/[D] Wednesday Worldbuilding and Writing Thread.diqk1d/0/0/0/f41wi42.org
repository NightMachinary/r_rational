    is it better to do 50 thumbnails, or 1 complete work, when testing whether illustrations are necessary for the story?
  #+end_quote

  You need at least one complete page. You can fill in with (full-sized) sketches for the rest; sometimes even Placekitten.com is an adequate substitute.
#+end_quote

The format is text interspersed with occasional illustrations, similar to the illustrated-abridged classic novels that came in little 4" square paperbacks. It's a web-first story, which means that there aren't really /pages/ as a logical separation of content. It's just hypertext.

  Is the thing you're illustrating a phone UI?
#+end_quote

I'm illustrating a phone UI at one point, but like how Wile E. Coyote's TNT-detonation box in the Roadrunner cartoons is sketched as a box with a handle and wires, the various views on UI in the story only need to show specific actions, rather than being a workable UI.

And honestly, if I needed pixel-perfect UI I'd make it in HTML+CSS and screenshot it.
