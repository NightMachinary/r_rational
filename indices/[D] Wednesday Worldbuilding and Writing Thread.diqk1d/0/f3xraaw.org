I have a story that's mostly written, but when I wrote it, I wanted to accompany it with illustrations. Now I'm at the point where I have maybe one illustration (out of ~50) and would really like to publish the story, but am not sure if the story would hold up without the illustrations. And I know that the illustrations I'd want for the story are beyond my current illustrative skill, whether that be in pencil-on-paper or in The Gimp.

So I have a bunch of questions: - what software do you use for illustration? - is it better to do 50 thumbnails, or 1 complete work, when testing whether illustrations are necessary for the story - are pixel-perfect mockups necessary for phone UI, or can the interface details be gestured at and readers be reasonably expected to interpret them as necessary? - what can be done to make sure a story written for illustration works well without illustration?
