Dwarves haven't really gotten enough coverage. There's just so many plotholes with how they're commonly portrayed. What's their food supply? How do they handle ventilation? Do they have problems with flooding - if so, how do they deal with it? What do they do with the mining debris and sewage? Do they have draft animals or is everything manual labor? Etc.

Rational vampires could also be a thing. Sure, turning everyone into a vampire would mean the vampires have no food supply and go extinct as well, but communal problems arising from selfish individual actions [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons][hasn't stopped people yet]].
