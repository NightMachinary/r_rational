What kind of linguistic features do you think would occur in a species of not dieing from age or anything short of near total splattering and immolation would develop?

The ones I've already determined is a lack of gendered/sexed words except purely reproductive verbs.

A highly directional addressing system that can function to pinpoint an individual in most crowds and more or less replace the need for names when dealing with strangers (names are still useful when referring to an individual that you can't point at).

It's kind of a verbal equivalent of pointing right at some one.

The entities in question generally can vocalize around 14 seperate voices if pressed, but prefer to keep it down to five or six for normal comunication and the language effectively is impossible to pronounced without at least two-three separate voices.

Their speech resembles woodwinds/violins. When they speak human words it sounds kind of choral/musical and in skilled speakers this accent is tuned to be considered very 'beuatiful'
