I always get upset when this thread has no posts so here's a nice little general urban fantasy question.

We all know about werewolves, vampires and zombies. There was a mummy fad for a while, in the 70s or something. More recently True Blood has given us werepanthers (we don't talk about them), and faeries. Harry Potter gave us hippogriffs, which I am sure most people had never heard of before.

What are some creatures in mythology that you think are ripe to become the next big supernatural fad?

Personally I don't know why centaurs aren't more popular, as well as minotaurs. Both very classic humanoid creatures that you could probably tell some amazing stories about.

And then there's obscure folk tales - after all zombies are ultimately from an obscure (voodoo?) myth. Does anyone know an obscure folk tale creature that would be interesting to see in the modern society?
