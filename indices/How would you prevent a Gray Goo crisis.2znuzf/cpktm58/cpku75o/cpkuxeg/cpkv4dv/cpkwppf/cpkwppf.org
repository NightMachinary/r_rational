  I thought it was somewhat obvious that intentional human design represents an entirely different sphere of concern.

Intentional human designs still have to actually out-compete naturally evolved organisms for energy and materials. You would need a whole /ecosystem/ of designed "goo", that wouldn't always work together properly, which would be subject to evolutionary pressures and would exert evolutionary pressures on regular life to adapt and compete... and at that point you've basically just recreated regular, old life.

I mean, hey, go read the link about how Eric Drexler, Mr. Nanotechnology Will Totally Work Real Soon Now, now thinks gray goo wouldn't work.
