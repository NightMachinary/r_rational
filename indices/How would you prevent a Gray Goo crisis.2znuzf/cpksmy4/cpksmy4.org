Make them require several atoms of Technetium per nanobot. It's cheap, and not found in nature, so growing more is easy and limiting growth is as simple as cutting of the Technetium supply.

You'd want to make sure that the function of these nanobots relied on some property unique to Technetium, of course -- the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technetium(VII)_oxide][binary metal oxide it forms]] would probably give the central Oxygen some fairly unique properties (180 degree bond angle), so that might work.
