Build a second grey goo entity with better safeguards and have it eat the first one.

More generally, it depends on whether the goo has any exploitable weaknesses. If it was released by accident, it won't be perfect, so there's bound to be something we can use against it. Nuke it for the EMP and the radiation. Contaminate its food supply with chemicals similar to what it normally eats, but different enough to fatally damage any replicators built out of them. Move to a different continent and hope it can't cross the Atlantic.
