  Don't bother further , it's way more likely that the grey goo scenario comes from a person than from an accident.

I agree that this is the most likely scenario for reasons brought up by [[/u/eaturbrainz]]. Grey-goo has to compete with existing microbial life for much of the available energy/resources. Thus it wouldn't be any worse than a particularly infectious disease (bad but not guaranteed world ending) or a particularly bad algae bloom (ecologically disruptive, but again not instantly world-ending). However, if the grey-goo was engineered intentionally, it could be made to take advantage of resources or materials that existing life can't. The big ones I can think of are electricity, oil/products derived from oil (gasoline, plastic, etc.), and metal (unoxidized reactive metals are rare in nature).
