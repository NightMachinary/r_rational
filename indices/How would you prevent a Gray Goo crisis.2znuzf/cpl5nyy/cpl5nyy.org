Be carefull about possible incidents , make an abundant number of detector.

Don't bother further , it's way more likely that the grey goo scenario comes from a person than from an accident. The person would make nanobots *with the purpose* to create grey goo , so the only truly "safe" way is using "police nanobots" , or using nanobots to alter the consciosness of every living human being to follow base ethics.
