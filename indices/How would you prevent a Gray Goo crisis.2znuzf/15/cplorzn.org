You don't really have to worry about grey goo if the nanobots don't have an internal energy source. The worst case scenarios only happen when the nanobots have access to matter-energy conversion or nanoscale fusion. If they have to rely on the environment for energy they will not be able to spread fast enough to avoid clean up.
