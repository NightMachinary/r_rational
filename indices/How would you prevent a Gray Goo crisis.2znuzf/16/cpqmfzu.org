I think this solves the wrong problem because the real danger of nanobots isn't self replication /alone/.

The real danger of nanobots is self-replication plus resistance to shutdown. Where would resistance to shutdown come from? Presumably if all nanobots replicate themselves perfectly we need only find one mechanism to shut them down and we can effectively shut all of them down relatively easily.

The true danger of nanobots is when they have self replication /and/ variation (errors) in replication. In other words, evolution. Add that in, and now any of the features you list would be selected against pretty strongly by any attempt to shut down the swarm.

The survivors replicate back up to numbers and now our problem is worse--you basically get synthetic bacteria except they can eat different (a presumably important) stuff.
