This is a pretty complicated setup to jam into something a few nanometers long. Then you run into questions about how it works -- what exactly is it that makes them fail if the signal stops? What if that something gets jammed, or a fault in manufacturing produces a single self-replicating nanobot that /doesn't/ have that feature? All of its brethen would die, but it would survive and breed.
