Not so sure about that. Humans have a lot of long distance transmission lines. If nanobots were to be able to draw supplemental power from transmission lines, they might be able to move at rather impressive speeds across the entire transmission network very rapidly. This does require that nanobots have the means to draw power from electrical transmission lines for travel, which should be something to specifically guard against, but I would hesitate to say it is an impossible scenario if nanobots are capable of mutation.

If such a mutation were to occur, nanobots could literally be everywhere power lines connect to, very quickly, and be a complete nightmare to control, even if the power grid were subsequently shut down.
