  out-compete naturally evolved organisms for energy and materials.

If the design is able to take advantage of properties or mechanisms that evolution didn't have a gradual path to evolve towards, then it could out-compete existing life. Hmmm... I can't think of any obvious and plausible examples. For an implausible example... biological cold fusion for energy would allow artificial organism to out-compete existing life.

If the design is able to take advantage of resources or materials that weren't common in the evolutionary environment but are common in the modern world, it could out compete existing life. For example, if you had nanomachines colonies designed to draw from energy from electrical sources, you could get grey goo that siphons energy from power lines, as that is a niche that didn't originally exist for life to evolve to take advantage of. I think consuming oil for energy is another big one. Metals in refined forms (i.e. non-oxidized) are also pretty uncommon in nature... Artificial bacteria that consume iron and leaves rust could be pretty destructive. Same thing for plastics. None of these are quite in the destroy the world overnight category, but they could cause economic losses that would be significantly disruptive.
