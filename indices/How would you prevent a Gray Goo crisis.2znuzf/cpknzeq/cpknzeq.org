1) Have it automatically shut-down in response to a pre-determined signal as a last resort. It'd be hard to keep some criminal from potentially hacking it, but that's what the field of cryptography is for.

2) Standardize the set of programs/commands to run the nano-machines such as 'Break down 5 units' or 'Move 25 nanometers'. This way with a series of simple commands where no combinations of can lead to a run-away reaction, they can be limited. Don't allow a system where anyone can tell the nano-machines to do anything. If there needs to be a different command, then it goes through rigorous trials and testing. This is very limiting, but if nano-machines are powerful enough to cause a Grey Goo scenario, this is necessary.

3) Don't allow them to be self-modifying.
