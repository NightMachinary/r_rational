Yeah, "sometimes" not killing civilians isn't a gold star from me. It's like not committing genocide on some days, but not others. :P she definitely kills noncoms on several occasions I've seen so far and even enjoys taunting them while she does it. She's clearly driven by revenge and hate, not any strategy to make things better, or there would have been progress in 2000 years.

And again I'm not criticizing the author for creating a nuanced and flawed character, just those that cheer her as a hero.
