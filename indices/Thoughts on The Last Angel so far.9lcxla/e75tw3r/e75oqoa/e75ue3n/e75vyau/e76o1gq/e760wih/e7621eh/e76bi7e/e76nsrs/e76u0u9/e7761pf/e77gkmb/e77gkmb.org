You are so incredibly wrong on this that it hurts.

But... it's not your fault. You haven't read to the end, nor have you read any of the sequel.

She /very much/ does have a plan to make things better. And when you see what kind of 'progress' has been made, it'll be quite interesting to see your comments. Because you *REALLY* are not going to like it, in the philosophical sense (it is very well written, however).

Also, she is a hero. You seem to think that heroes are pristine, perfect, and without flaw. You can have heroes who flawed, and you can still admire someone for what they do, warts and all.
