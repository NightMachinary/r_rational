There is lots of rancor. You brought it with you.

Also, your sad little attempt at an appeal to a majority does not work here. This is /Rational.

  She executed a first strike that achieved nothing. She already had deterrence in the form of her superior technology and firepower. SHe could have simply said "no" and left.
#+end_quote

Do you know what Deterrence /IS/? Having something isn't deterrance. Having something and /being willing to use it/ is. They decided to negotiate in bad faith, expecting her to either commit suicide and give them her resources and knowledge, or they were planning on killing her and taking it. If she just left and did /nothing/, they would simply try it again and again--because there is no penalty to do so.

She showed them that it was a /really/ bad idea. And yes, it resulted in them having worse odds against the Compact than when they started, further pushing them to not mess with her in the future. It set a nice precedent for them: Negotiate in good faith or be punished.

#+begin_quote
  This is an absurd strawman and oversimplification. The four things above are obviously not equivalent.
#+end_quote

You need to read up on what a strawman is. I did not make a false argument in your stead and tear it down. I pointed out the obvious similarities and the /fact/ that different categories of people can have the same cause. The important bit is /HOW/ they go about accomplishing that cause. The athlete (in theory) does so in an honorable fashion without harming his opponent, the soldier does it in an honorable fashion while harming his opponent, the politician does it in dishonorable fashion whilst not harming his opponent, and the terrorist does it in a dishonorable fashion while harming his opponent.

  Red does NOT avoid civilian casualties, this is a blatant misrepresentation.
#+end_quote

Reading comprehension fail. I said she makes a point of avoiding *pointless* civilian casualties. If civilians happen to be in the area of a military operation, they're going to be collateral damage. You /DID/ read my part about human shields being immoral, yes?

#+begin_quote
  She executes several system-wipes - bigger genocides than any in real human history
#+end_quote

Mass death by collateral damage is not a genocide. No race or species is wiped out. There is a distribution of various species well represented throughout the Compact.\\
Please stop misusing simple terms.

#+begin_quote
  and there are multiple graphic descriptions of her tearing apart non-coms as they try to flee and reveling in it
#+end_quote

Again, ones who are part of the military operation. Also, she is a /warship/, as she points out repeatedly. She enjoys defeating her opponents. But if you want to prove your case, by all means, link to a section where she goes out and kills civilians willy-nilly and cackles about it, showing no remorse or not using it as part of a greater plan to stop the military's advance. The only instance that comes close are the various mining operations set up in former Confederate space--mining operations which go toward supplying the construction of warships.

#+begin_quote
  I am citing real world history and actual events
#+end_quote

You are citing events and infusing them with your /extremely/ biased interpretation. My patriotism is just fine, but again, thanks for trying to spin it as something weak or bad. The fact that you're doing in this reply the /exact same thing/ I called you out on in your original post is rather remarkable.

#+begin_quote
  The genocide of native americans happened.
#+end_quote

Genocide is intentional. Conflicts between the colonies and NUMEROUS tribes which also fought each other doesn't really qualify as 'genocide'. The only way it's close is if you scale back the window to count centuries, and then lump vastly disparate groups into two seperate sides and /then/ assume ill intent by one to cause the elimination of the other. At one point there were higher-ups in the Army that specifically wanted to eradicate certain Plains tribes, as said tribes were of the 'raiding' variety. That was intentional genocide, motivated by racism, and was obviously bad, but assuming that was typical of the entire nation and its people is folly.

#+begin_quote
  The trail of tears happened.
#+end_quote

Yep. This one is a legitimate thing, because some politicians were greedy for land. The fact that it was done even to allied Tribes was particularly shitty. Is this the fault of the nation as a whole, or a thing that later generations should feel guilty about?

#+begin_quote
  The slave trade happened.
#+end_quote

You mean the one that had been going on for hundreds of years in Africa and Asia prior, or are you focusing on the one particular part of a particular trade that was equal parts guilt in the native lands, the European shipping industry, and the American colonies? Because I'm sure you're /not/ wanting to go into detail as to the slave trade that happened during and after in the lands to the other direction.

#+begin_quote
  Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Dresden happened.
#+end_quote

All military goals in a situation a step away from total war. The former two were calculated attacks to stop what was perceived to be a better option than millions of deaths (purple hearts still given out today were MADE back in WWII in anticipation of the massive casualties the US military was expecting if they invaded the mainland). Atrocities of all sorts were committed by all sides, but you seem to have a particular hate-on for only one nation. I wonder why.

#+begin_quote
  CIA interference in banana republics and the Iraq war and Vietnam ALL HAPPENED.
#+end_quote

Yes, and KGB interference in socialist 'revolutions' and Russian and Chinese interference in Vietnam and Korea also ALL HAPPENED. Good for you. BTW: Equating the actions of an agency that keeps its motives and methods separate and secret from the nation's populace at large is hardly the fault of that nation or its populace. Especially when it has actively acted against the nation that it is supposed to serve. They had an important purpose back when the Cold War was raging, but they should have been divided up and portioned off to other agencies after.

#+begin_quote
  the Compact are simply The Bad Guys and killing their civilians is justified because they are racists. If that were the case you should have a very different attitude toward the US.
#+end_quote

Why would I have that attitude? First, I've been arguing that she doesn't kill random civvies for no reason. Second, the US fought against itself to stop that very thing, and ended it at the cost of their own blood, and later with laws--something the Compact will /NEVER/ do.

#+begin_quote
  that one moment you can be justifying terrorism as just another means to an end, and the next complaining that I'm criticizing Good Guy America too hard by citing historical events.
#+end_quote

Now *YOU* are pulling out the Strawmen. I've shown how it isn't terrorism, but /you/ claim that I'm the one justifying terrorism--How about you /show/ how it's actually terrorism first, hey? Because you haven't yet. In addition, I didn't say you were criticizing them too hard, I simply called you out on your obvious bias. At least own it rather than trying to refute arguments nobody has made.

#+begin_quote
  By your logic an Afgani terrorist would be perfectly justified in blowing up whole US cities because they contained manufacturing centers used by the US military.
#+end_quote

This sentence shows you have no clue what a terrorist is, nor how civilized warfare is conducted. Go look up what makes the difference between a soldier and a terrorist, because apparently you don't grasp that little detail.

#+begin_quote
  You seem to be arguing that AI are a huge threat
#+end_quote

I didn't say they are all a huge threat. I said how they can be a /terror/ even when done right.

#+begin_quote
  militarized AI is most likely an existential threat and should be resisted by all possible means. This is one reason I think an Empire like the Compact could be a reasonable best-case scenario for organic life.
#+end_quote

Yeah, and to me, that seems like an organic/synthetic form of racism, as shown terribly in the Mass Effect series, a series which has /actual examples/ of organics and synthetics getting along while beating the drum that one can only exist at the cost of the other. This series has a good example too, in the form of Red and humanity. The short version is, once the Compact is done and no un-invited aliens enter Confederate space, Red will no longer be killing anyone. She has a VERY specific defined goal, and so long as that isn't threatened, she isn't a threat.

#+begin_quote
  If the two options are Compact conquers the galaxy and rogue AI destroys all organic life, I pick the former.
#+end_quote

But, see, you've already put yourself in a false dichotomy. Functionally, you have strawmanned /yourself/ by assuming the argument has only two answers.

#+begin_quote
  My point was to show it's more nuanced than simple "villain hero" dynamics the story invites on its surface.
#+end_quote

Then why is your attitude on AI so (pardon the pun) incredibly binary? Why does nuance not apply to your example?
