To support Red not going after civilian targets, its part of why she doesn't go near Rally. The Compact knows, and Red states this, that if they go after Rally she WILL start targeting civilians indiscriminately. There is a bit of a Treaty between the two, with the Compact being able to wipe out Rally and that stopping Red from some actions, namely recruiting large amounts of humans from Rally or other places, and, on the other side, Red has stated that if the Compact ever does wipe out Rally then she will start considering civilian targets to be on the table.

Therefore I think, we can say that [[/u/wren42]] 's assertion in the original text of saying that Red targets civilians is wrong. Although it is true many civilians have died because of Red.
