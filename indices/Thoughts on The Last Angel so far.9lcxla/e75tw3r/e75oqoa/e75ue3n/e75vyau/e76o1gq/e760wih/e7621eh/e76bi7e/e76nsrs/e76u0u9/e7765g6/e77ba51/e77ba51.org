  She wipes out entire planets including civilians and humans.

Oops. I accidentally posted without including any text besides the quote!

Anyway, I would consider the above quote to imply that there is no restraint from Red, and so I thought my post did a good job of arguing the point that Red isn't discriminately killing as many civilians as possible, and that if Red wanted to be as effective as possible as a terrorist then the current tactics weren't actually that great.

That is, to me, still a major point of restraint. And considering that the Compact (and yes it was thousands of years ago, so its difficult to see how important this is) literally committed genocide and killed billions, if not trillions of civilians, I don't think you can say Red's current tactics are as "strong" as the Compacts.

If you see it as splitting hairs, im not sure i can convince you otherwise, but i see it as very significant.
