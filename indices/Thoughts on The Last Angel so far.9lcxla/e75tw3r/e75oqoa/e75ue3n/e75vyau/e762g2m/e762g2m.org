That side is mostly perception. She isn't by any means a terrorist, merely a very well equipped guerilla.

Of course, the Rally thing is part of that, because that 'hostage' means she can't just go nuts and attack their homeworlds... but also means they can't kill off Rally unless they /want/ her to attack their homeworlds. It's a little Catch 22 that keeps both sides about as honest and honorable as can be, given the setting.

EDIT: Note that, in the sequel (Last Angel Ascension) she /VERY MUCH/ qualifies as a Terrorist. My above post refers to the original story.
