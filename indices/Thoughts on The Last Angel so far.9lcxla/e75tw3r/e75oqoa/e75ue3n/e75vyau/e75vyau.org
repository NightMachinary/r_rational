Oh yeah no, there's definitely a side of the story where Red is the villain, a terrorist out for revenge.

As you get to know more of the history of everything - there's a chapter with a Triarch that covers a lot of the history - you get a lot more sympathy for who everyone /was/, and a lot less for who they /are/.

I also don't remember Red going after civvies for the sake of it; /everything/ feeds into her larger goal. She fakes the torture a lot, and doesn't fake it all the time, but it's basically always for bait and/or psyops.

She's also kind of stuck. The Compact has absolute control over Rally, and if Red tries to break or help it, they'll kill their hostage.

Everything else is spoilers :D
