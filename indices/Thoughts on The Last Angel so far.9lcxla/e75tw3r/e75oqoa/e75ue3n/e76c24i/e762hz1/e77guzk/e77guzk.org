Justice is subjective. The reason the author doesn't go into it is because they'd rather tell a good story than get lost in the swamps of philosophy and interpretations of morality.

Besides, the assumption is false. The Compact is provably NOT the only safe course for the universe. The Principality is equally against AI, and has a different governmental system. The only difference in power between it and the Compact is that the Compact started several centuries sooner and has been aggressive about conquering other species rather than slowly integrating them.

The fact that the author also indicated the Compact will get utterly trounced if the Naiads (semi-spoiler, the name alone is meaningless unless you know) decide to migrate through their territory also proves they aren't the best or only option.
