The rubber forehead alien thing irked me too (especially when they were classifying extraterrestrial species using Terran taxonomic terms).

Another complaint: I can't remember a single human character that hasn't been white and Anglo-Saxon, other than Captain Sudoki in the prologue. Nearly every cultural reference has been from Western Europe or the US. The whole population of the Earth worked together to build three warships... and they all get names from Greek mythology.

With Kursk, we're being exposed to some more variety of names from different human cultures, but those were chosen by Red One; does no one else remember that there were cultures on Earth that didn't speak English?

One of the biggest advantages written fiction has over visual storytelling (like TV or movies) is that you can depict anything that can be imagined. You're not limited to having bipedal, four-limbed, sexually reproducing beings with bilateral symmetry. And you're certainly not limited to drawing from one culture of humans. That the author has so chosen to limit himself (except for the Naiads; they're cool) is disappointing.
