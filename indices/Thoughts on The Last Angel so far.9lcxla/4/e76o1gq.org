To add to some other points, I would add that not only did the Compact successfully perform genocide on the human race, the story strongly hints that the Compact is culturally indoctrinating humans in addition to running a breeding program to ensure obedience.

On that scale of deliberate, targeted killing, Red's planetary destruction is more on the level of collateral damage. She had a target and everybody else was unlucky enough to be in the same planet, since a star sear is hardly a pinpoint weapon.

On the other hand, if Rally didn't exist as a hostage, I suspect that Red would happily go genocidal.
