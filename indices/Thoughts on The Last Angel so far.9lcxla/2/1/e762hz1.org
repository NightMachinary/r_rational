the only actual reason for justice to be meted out is to disincentivize repeat transgression - so in this case, the compact should face justice if the goal is to stop them from subjugating more species. Since OP argues that they are acting correctly in this ("only safe course for the universe") disincentivizing that kind of behaviour would run directly contrary to OP's take. Thus, I'd say the issue of justice is not accidentally left out, but rather ignored on purpose as it would be unhelpful.

Now of course Red One might disagree, but that doesn't change the neutral-observer PoV that OP represents. Of course the rampant AI thinks she is right in her actions, everyone always does.

(Disclaimer: I am not OP, and don't entirely agree with their take, merely continuing the thought process.)
