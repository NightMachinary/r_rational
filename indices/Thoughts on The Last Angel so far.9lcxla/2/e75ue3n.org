Not taking a stance in terms of judgement, but it seems you are entirely overlooking an axis - that of Justice. Of correcting a historical wrong of such immense proportions that its wound cannot be allowed to heal over and fade from consequence. Of retribution.

Compassion, forgiveness, and healing may very well be Red's character arc (I stopped only a bit further than you). Regardless, I think the text does justice to the idea that she is /insane/ and unstable and just may topple in the direction of a redemption she badly needs. In real life, insane, unhealed hostility often cohabits with crusades for justice, and have been the drive for much good and progress. There is a reason humans have a natural instinct for retribution, after all.
