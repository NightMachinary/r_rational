At least for me, the only people who are owed capital J Justice are those who have been reasonably directly injured by a wrong. I think that mercy and justice are at odds, and that mercy is almost always the better option - but that there are cases where a lack of justice is a greater burden to a victim, or when reasonably criteria for mercy (e.g., repentance or a plausible path to redemption) are not met. As in situations like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_and_reconciliation_commission][Truth and Reconciliation]], the best healing, arguably, happens when forgiveness can be granted (though how we got from there to today's troubles is something I haven't thought about).

In the case of Red One, I think their continued suffering, and the ongoing perversion of the last remnants of humanity under imperialist rule, is a strong case that blanket forgiveness is premature. But of course, Red's actions do not lead towards resolution either. I cannot fault them, as, e.g., I do not fault "rioters" who turn violent during protests - I think policing victims' actions and deciding from afar what is and is not acceptable is a tool for reframing the discussion away from the more important issues of people-destroying wrongs which need redress / to be addressed - and so the whole thing becomes complicated. Much more so than most in discussions about the real-world situations tend to respect.
