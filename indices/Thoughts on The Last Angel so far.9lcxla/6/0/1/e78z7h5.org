  SHe could have simply said "no" and left.

I disagree. Arguments in good faith and rationality only work when the other party is also operating with the same principles or when there's an "audience" who is. A government in a desperate war can not be relied on to act like a polite party in an argument. Considering they secretly brought the mind-killer to the meeting in the first place there is absolutely no reason to believe they wouldn't continue to do things like that in all future meetings except then they might get clever and succeed. The only way to prevent that is to make any failed attempt carry a very high cost.

They're still going to work with or in parallel to Red because neither of them have much of a choice, but this was the best and fastest way to ensure that there would be no further attempts at betrayal/assassination.

  This is an absurd strawman and oversimplification

While you're right regarding that specific argument, this isn't anything like a conventional war. The Compact threw any kind of protection rules of law/Geneva convention carries when they attempted to commit genocide and destroyed Earth. When one side completely and utterly spits in the face of mercy and any kind of rules of engagement, and the other side is conducting guerrilla warfare and has no benefit from adhering to said rules, things get nasty. There is a reason why people stick to these kinds of rules other than empathy and it's because as long as you don't cross them, the enemy won't either.

In a war where one side tries to completely exterminate the other to the point where they hunt fleeing victims and destroy their planets, terrorism stops being a bad thing. You might say that the war is pointless and therefore wrong since Red isn't protecting anything, but the way the war is carried out is entirely justified.

  Red does NOT avoid civilian casualties

I'm not sure where this comes up in the story, but she only ever engages military targets. The story goes into why she completely destroyed some places and...well maybe it's not justified but it's understandable.

  By your logic an Afgani terrorist would be perfectly justified in blowing up whole US cities because they contained manufacturing centers used by the US military.

The problem is that the US military hasn't actually comitted anything even close to what the Compact did and the Al-Qaeda/ISIS forces are only doing less monstrous things than Red because they lack the ability. A better example would be: "during the first Rwandan genocide, would it be okay for a Tutsi fighter to blow up a Hutu military building with a bunch of civilians near it?" My answer to that question is, I have no idea. I'd like to say no but...I honestly can't imagine myself in that situation. All I can say is that even then there is no comparing what happened in Rwanda to what the Compact did because it pales in comparison.
