  There is lots of rancor. You brought it with you.

Um, not engaging with the particular arguments here, but no - the tone of the OP and his reply is completely different to yours. OP has been reliably addressing the content of the arguments; your posts are full of personal implication, which makes then much harder to engage with.

I expect you know that, but in the unlikely case that the 'you brought the rancor' comment was ingenuous, I figured I'd let you know.
