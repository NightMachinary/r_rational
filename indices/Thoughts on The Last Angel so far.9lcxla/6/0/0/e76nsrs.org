  They gave her the terms and gave her time to consider.

They also brought a gun to the negotiating table. Their mindkiller was specifically designed to be sneaky and unseen, a surprise weapon to kill her and steal her body. This, rightly pissed her off just a smidgen.

I know this is [[/r/rational]] but Red isn't 110% totally rational, shes very human, ironically. She's a character. Could it have been done in a better, less moon-shooty way? Sure. But it wasn't.

  Red does NOT avoid civilian casualties

She does sometimes. I don't know how far you are but at (mid-late book 1 spoilers) Invidia and on Bequeathed she very much does kill civvies and innocents. System kills are usually reserved for military systems if memory holds, and even then very rarely. But in a short from book 2 she orbital bombs a non-Compact planet but only the military, even though they likely angered her more than the Principality in the previous example. And i believe a WOG stated she doesn't intentionally target civilians. In a war collateral is expected. Red may be The Last Angel, but shes not a harp and gift bearing angel, and more the angel of death.

A lot of your points and questions are addressed in later WOG's and the story proper. Keep reading, you got some very good scenes coming.
