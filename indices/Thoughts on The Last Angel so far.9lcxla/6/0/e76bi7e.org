Wow, lots of rancor here. I'm going to try to respond in pieces, but your acerbic response to citing universally accepted historical atrocities shows you are probably too "patriotic" to listen at all.

  > Red's attack of a manufacturing base wasn't an emotional temper tantrum, it was a calculated act of deterrance. The people who were 'negotiating' with her were doing so in bad faith. She had to demonstrate that doing so was a bad idea to discourge them from doing so again.

Disagree. They gave her the terms and gave her time to consider. She executed a first strike that achieved nothing. She already had deterrence in the form of her superior technology and firepower. SHe could have simply said "no" and left. Destroying the manufacturing station was not required to make that point and hurt her cause. It weakened the Principality's ability to continue to wage war on the Compact and it sets a precedent of hostility that will make future negotiation much more difficult. Nothing about this helps her, it's a completely irrational move and in fact is evidence to justify the Principality's fears about her unhinged personality.

  > "her fundamental cause is that of a terrorist" Uh... sure. The fundamental cause of a terrorist, a soldier, a politician, and even an athlete are all the same: Win by defeating the opposition.

This is an absurd strawman and oversimplification. The four things above are obviously not equivalent.

  > Incidentally, she qualifies as #2 on this list, because /she makes a point of avoiding pointless civilian casualties/. A terrorist doesn't.
#+end_quote

Red does NOT avoid civilian casualties, this is a blatant misrepresentation. She executes several system-wipes - bigger genocides than any in real human history - and there are multiple graphic descriptions of her tearing apart non-coms as they try to flee and reveling in it. Your characterization of her has flat out wrong.

  > I was expecting a reasonable list of grievances. I did /NOT/ expect the ham-handed attempt to cram real-world political commentary into this list of 'thoughts'. We get it, you hate America. Good for you.
#+end_quote

​

I am citing real world history and actual events, it has nothing to do with "hating america". If your patriotism can't stomach facts maybe you should do some soul searching. The genocide of native americans happened. The trail of tears happened. The slave trade happened. Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Dresden happened. CIA interference in banana republics and the Iraq war and Vietnam ALL HAPPENED.

The author even states specifically in commentary on the forums in several places that he modeled Compact attitudes and propaganda off of American racist thinking during the slave trade.

My point in mentioning all this was to shock the exact type of thinking you are exhibiting - that the Compact are simply The Bad Guys and killing their civilians is justified because they are racists. If that were the case you should have a very different attitude toward the US.

I find it amazing that one moment you can be justifying terrorism as just another means to an end, and the next complaining that I'm criticizing Good Guy America too hard by citing historical events. By your logic an Afgani terrorist would be perfectly justified in blowing up whole US cities because they contained manufacturing centers used by the US military.

  > Oh, you want to see justified fear for "Neverborn"? Go read the very first post of the sequel, Last Angel Ascension. Don't worry, no spoilers, just the little italicized story at the beginning. That'll show you how AI can be an absolute terror even when done /RIGHT/.

I'm super confused by this. You seem to be arguing that AI are a huge threat. I agree...militarized AI is most likely an existential threat and should be resisted by all possible means. This is one reason I think an Empire like the Compact could be a reasonable best-case scenario for organic life. To be clear, no I don't like the facism or racism or xenocide. The part I'm suggesting is reasonable is their crusade to oppose strong AI in general, on the grounds that the Friendliness problem is hard or impossible to solve, and the best case for the universe is to ensure a self replicating ASI never ever gets off its homeworld. This mission is important enough that it could be worth massive militarization and colonialism, draconian policy, and even xenocide of races that threatened to create ASI

If the two options are Compact conquers the galaxy and rogue AI destroys all organic life, I pick the former.

My attitude isn't "the Compact is Good" or "The US is evil like the Compact". My point was to show it's more nuanced than simple "villain hero" dynamics the story invites on its surface.

  > On the whole, Last Angel attempts to make something that would be closest to a Horror movie villain into something relatable, perhaps even letting you understand its motivations and even side with it now and then. The writer has accomplished this well. Since I favor the old Asimov-style approach to AI, I don't see sci-fi universes as some modern Mass Effect inspired "race war" of organics VS synthetics that seem so common. I'm glad this one presents multiple views and approaches, while also being an awesome, detailed story.

​

I completely agree with your final paragraph.

The story does a good job of humanizing what is at its root a horror-movie AI villain, and presents characters that are both flawed and justified in their actions and reasoning on all sides.
