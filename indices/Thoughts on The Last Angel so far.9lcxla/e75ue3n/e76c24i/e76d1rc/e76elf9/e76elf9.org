that is a very interesting question, it occurred to me briefly as I was replying to you before. What if you time traveled or resurreected someone from 1500 to present day? would their pain and outrage weigh more heavily?

Is that the criteria for justice though? The survival of victims? That seems to have some strange consequences...it makes complete annihilation less reprehensible than leaving someone alive.
