I'm not sure that's horror, it doesn't really evoke the same feelings. My problem isn't any technical problems with the writing, but that it takes the lazy way out of getting emotional investment by making readers mad at the villains. Very little in the way of character development, overarching story, etc. Lots of HFY falls into that trap.
