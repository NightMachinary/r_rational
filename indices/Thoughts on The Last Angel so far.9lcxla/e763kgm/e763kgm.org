I get annoyed by stories that are blatantly trying to hit (tribal) anger buttons, and the portrayal of AI and aliens as humans in suits doesn't help. It's well written mechanically, but to me just came off as a low effort project with little character development or overarching story, and emotional investment coming from trying to make the audience mad rather than any investment in the characters. I got through the first book, but was pretty "meh" about it after the point where Red was repaired. After that the only good part was worldbuilding, and that wasn't enough to get me to read the sequel.

The fact that it' published on SB should explain the readership.

I should point out that the Compact is basically a fascist class system, they are pretty bad.
