Red's attack of a manufacturing base wasn't an emotional temper tantrum, it was a calculated act of deterrance. The people who were 'negotiating' with her were doing so in bad faith. She had to demonstrate that doing so was a bad idea to discourge them from doing so again. But if you disagree, please provide an example of 'diplomacy' where one side agrees to give up all their resources and then let themselves be executed without any sort of backup mechanic to ensure what they got out of the deal was actually followed through.

In addition, Diplomacy is a two-way street. The Principality had plenty of time to attempt to reopen diplomatic channels despite their previous treacherous intent, but chose not to do so. The 'fault' isn't hers alone.

"her fundamental cause is that of a terrorist" Uh... sure. The fundamental cause of a terrorist, a soldier, a politician, and even an athlete are all the same: Win by defeating the opposition. This isn't inherently a bad thing. It's the methods involved. Incidentally, she qualifies as #2 on this list, because /she makes a point of avoiding pointless civilian casualties/. A terrorist doesn't. And no, putting your military base in the middle of (or underneath) a civilian population does not grant you immunity to military retaliation--the use of human shields is immoral.

I was expecting a reasonable list of grievances. I did /NOT/ expect the ham-handed attempt to cram real-world political commentary into this list of 'thoughts'. We get it, you hate America. Good for you. /IF/ you'd like to compare bits of the story to specific historical events, feel free, but if you could avoid comparing it to your idealistically propagandized version of a modern nation, that'd be even better. I mean, unless you want "in the current state of affairs they are actually in the right" to also apply to your example as well.

The Compact has no problem against wiping out civilizations that won't bend the knee. The /only/ reason Humanity still exists is due to a series of lucky flukes--/one/ group escaped, was lost for centuries, settled and had a disaster they barely survived, and then was eventually "found" by a group of Compact scientists rather than soldiers who sent out the news to the Compact as a whole /before/ the soldiers could deal with the problem. If any of these chance occurrences not actually occurred, they *would* have been wiped out, and this is stated directly by the writer as canon. It was not the first time the Compact had attempted Xenocide, just one of the few instances where it failed.

Any reasonable organic lifeform is going to question whether or not a rogue AI is actually harmful to them, not embark on some sort of synthetic Crusade to kill them all. When said lifeform comes to realize the AI is only harmful to them should they be oppressing humanity in some way, or hindering its goals to destroy the largest and most powerful Empire in known space, they will either choose to fight against it (if they are allied to that Empire) or simply get out of its way. There's no reason for them to draw the ire of a sapient planet-killing dreadnaught when it wants nothing to do with them and will happily leave them alone.

Oh, you want to see justified fear for "Neverborn"? Go read the very first post of the sequel, Last Angel Ascension. Don't worry, no spoilers, just the little italicized story at the beginning. That'll show you how AI can be an absolute terror even when done /RIGHT/.

As for the Compact, yes, their institutionalized racism that only allows slave species to go up X number of bottom 'rungs' of a very large societal ladder is clearly a good, free culture. So long as you stay in your 'place' that you are told you belong. Nevermind that this is done in such an Orwellian way that most people either don't realize its happening or--once they've figured it out--realize its off to the gulags for them if they speak up.

On the whole, Last Angel attempts to make something that would be closest to a Horror movie villain into something relatable, perhaps even letting you understand its motivations and even side with it now and then. The writer has accomplished this well. Since I favor the old Asimov-style approach to AI, I don't see sci-fi universes as some modern Mass Effect inspired "race war" of organics VS synthetics that seem so common. I'm glad this one presents multiple views and approaches, while also being an awesome, detailed story.
