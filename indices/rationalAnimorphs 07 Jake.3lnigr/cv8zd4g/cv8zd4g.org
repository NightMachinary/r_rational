  Marco was silent for a moment. ‹Just make me one promise,› he said finally. ‹If it turns out you are right, don't go nuts and start thinking you have some kind of spider sense, okay? Because right for the wrong reasons is only a tiny bit better than flat-out wrong.›

But remember, Marco - the signature of a "right reason" is that it works consistently. /Anything/ that works consistently, even if only statistically, is structurally based on a /right reason/.

I guess what I'm saying is, don't throw out a working tool just because you don't understand how it works.
