I mean, the animorphs canon really didn't leave much unexplored - as far as exploring the idea space and munchkin goes, they did it quite well - on the heroes side, at least, the aliens could likely have done far better with a bit of creativity and common sense. The divergences are all going to be plot or a result of different rules in this world , I doubt there's much in the way of unexplored hacks.
