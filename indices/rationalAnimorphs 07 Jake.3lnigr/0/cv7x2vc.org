Hmm. I notice that it's not following the canon rule of morphs not being able to be acquired from other morphs, which makes me wonder if there are other rules which don't apply in this story (Visser Three thinks about bacterial morphs, for example, which aren't supposed to be available in canon).

I /really/ like the self-morph hack. It's even supported by canon (ignoring the acquire-from-morph rule)!
