I mean, Jake to an extent already got an Ellimist upgrade in the form of his "automatically subconsciously integrate all data available to him and spit out valid seeming conclusions".

It's not unreasonable for a person to be able to do, but as presented, it's still an extremely high improbability. Remember though that the Ellimist hand picked each member of the team (at least in canon) for some special ability they have, making each person (save Rachel) a low probability character, so I'm willing to let it slide, and am in fact curious to see what abilities the others gain.

It's possible Marco will still have his Visser One mother, but I'm hoping Cassie being an Estreen will come with some more power upgrades (such as more interesting hybrid morph hacks).
