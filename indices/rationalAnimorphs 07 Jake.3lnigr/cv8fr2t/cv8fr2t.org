Well I just bombed through all 7 chapters in one afternoon and oh holy crap yes. And yet also several points where I want to metaphorically slap the characters about a bit for being stupid (in entirely believable/realistic ways, but /still/)

Especially Rachel in Ch3, revealing way too much to the enemy - you do /not/ just casually give up the element of surprise, put the entire opposing faction on high alert against morphing opponents and then not even mention it to the others... not if you have any intentions of winning the war. Also got the Chapman's killed, so yeah, /great job Rach/.

Personal sympathies currently situated with Marco, who seems to be the only one who /really/ "gets" the idea of being serious about the situation because you are fighting a goddamn war against bodysnatching aliens. Tobias seems to think he gets it, but for my money he's too far deep into his distrust of everyone to realise that splintering the group, even if the group is suboptimal, is not improving the situation.

Honestly not sure how far regular-grade humans can be expected to get against actually-competent yeerks. Seems like they're already reeling from what amounts to a causal backhand from a couple of yeerks who didn't even know what they were doing; if Visser 3 is full-on /intelligent/ I do not see an outcome where they are anything less than flattened.
