Albert could do a great deal, and does do a great deal by human standards, but he typically takes the path where least resistance meets easiest to compute with high degrees of certainty.

There are more optimal paths, but they are more computationally complex, which means he would be risking insanity sooner, or have to take the risk of duplicating himself and sharing resources or conflicting with the alternate self.
