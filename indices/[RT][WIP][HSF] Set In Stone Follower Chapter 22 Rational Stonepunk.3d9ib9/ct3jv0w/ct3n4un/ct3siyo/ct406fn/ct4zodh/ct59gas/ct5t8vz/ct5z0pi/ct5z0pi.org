Authorial fiat. I might have to touch things up if it seems like Albert is lying (about the fact he's a Lazy AI). He does avoid using a significant part of his capacity.

For the insects and other microfauna that consume free metals, a lot of that work was already done by humans, as part of the locust research. Still, he did put a lot of effort into it, because it was needed for his plans.

This doesn't appear in the story, but running a nanite healing process would certainly require a good bit of computational capacity. I figure that Albert would deliver a little iron to the body with the nanites and form a tiny whip antennae on one of the long bones to allow easy communication to anyone being monitored. After that's done, directing and receiving data from nanites would not be that much more computationally expensive than talking to a human. Power could be provided over the long term by induction around nerve bundles and/or ear-canal piezoelectric generators, and over the short term in an emergency by a few tiny high capacity batteries injected into the body. Does this make sense, or were you referring to something else.
