Um. . . I want to say authorial fiat is okay and go with that, that's what I should do as a good reader, and in that vein I'm trying to think of things like Albert disregarding all inconveniences below a certain level making him very patient.

That said my futurist geek is kicking and screaming like HJPEV watching McGonagall change into/from a cat and travel back in time while slamming a handful of uranium into a handful of anti-uranium, because medical nanites and several hundred years implies to me that an arbitrary percentage of the moon Albert +lives on+ exists as, is made of thinking matter, and he has had lots of time to go *FOOM*

Despite these tacky little assumptions of mine, the type of thing that almost made me walk out of devergent when they had direct neural interfaces powersupplys dense enough for ubiquitious hand held gauss guns, and were stuck in a city instead if colonizing Jupiter's moons, please keep writing. You have a believable characterization for a Singleton, good characters who are sympathetic and yet alien enough to make us question, and I greatly enjoy your story.
