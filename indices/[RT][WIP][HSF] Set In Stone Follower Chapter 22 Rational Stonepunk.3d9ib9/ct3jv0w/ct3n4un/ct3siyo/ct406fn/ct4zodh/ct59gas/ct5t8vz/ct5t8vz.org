I figured it's either, authorial Fiat on how AI works to make it conceivable-ish to write convincingly, or disinformation from Albert, so I'm usually just looking for evidence one way or the other, which are both Good enough for me. Since the last two chapters I've been well on the latter side though, because . . . well:

1. Albert apparently engineered an improvement to insects and unless I missed that they were deliberately left out of the biosphere *they out-bred their un-modified variants, so that they are now a persistent metal consuming swarm *
2. Nano-tech has practical implications, even if you are limiting your computational substrate to a single moon.\\
