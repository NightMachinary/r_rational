So, my partner is finally beta-reading my supernatural romance novel, and he reads /very/ analytically, so he's been a god-send for levelling up the rationality of the story, and I don't feel guilty about making someone read 50k of gay supernatural romance because, you know, he's my partner and humoring me with this sort of thing is his job.

Here's some examples of the things he's caught that will improve the rationality of this story:

- Human Love Interest acts too intelligent, both IQ-wise and socially: turns out it's kind of hard for two millennial women to write a 1940s steel mill worker? Subject to revision.

- Vampire seems to be lacking some very obvious insight, e.g. being easily able to interpret human body language and mental states, finding out the Human's Big Secret because of his resources and connections, consenting to ultimatums made by weaker people that are obviously to his detriment. Fortunately, fairly easy to fix.

- He thought one chapter was hitting the reader over the head with an analogy/metaphor that I didn't get from it when writing it, but in retrospect is a pretty cool metaphor. Turns out sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, but hey, maybe in this case the cigar isn't just a cigar.

- Vampire gives Human a silver dagger in one scene, saying it's to defend himself from a rival vampire. There's no situation in which Human attacking the rival vampire with a silver dagger is /in any way/ remotely helpful. So why would Vampire give Human the dagger? I like the dagger scene so I kind of don't want to have to remove it, but you know, kill your darlings and all that...

- Human, who is on the run from the law, after briefly using an alias, uses his real name in public for the rest of the story. Now updated to have him continue using the alias.

- Human's Special Talent is being very good at vampire, uh, coded communication (do your tie a certain way and it means something, wear a certain colour of shirt and it means something, etc). Vampire's first assumption seems to be that Human has a Special Talent rather than Human has been coached/dressed/etc by a rival vampire. This needs to be addressed.

I don't know why I'm sharing this, but here you go. I guess it's a testament to the power of beta reading by analytical readers.

EDIT: turns out writing the above gave me plot bunnies that [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fAzhlM60MqHzWzpG9wCxAhv2sQaSnwWQXHBVTqxUq6g/edit?usp=sharing][made me write an interlude]] that does quite a lot to enhance the early part of my story, so thank you, general rationality thread for existing!
