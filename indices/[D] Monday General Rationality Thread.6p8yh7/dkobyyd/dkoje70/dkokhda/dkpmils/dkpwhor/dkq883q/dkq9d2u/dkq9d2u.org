You're right, thank you. That said, making William /more/ immoral when, well, um, he's a vampire and regularly murders people and doesn't see any problem with slavery and is actually spending much of the story manipulating Red's feelings as his own feelings grow more genuine... it's a tough one. But I suppose the reader doesn't know Red's being lied to until far later on, it actually makes him look kind and trusting if you don't know any better.

Red feeling vulnerable and asking for a security blanket --> William gives him a silver knife because Vampires have a policy of Giving Trusted Humans Silver Weapons to Perpetrate the Myth, and to make him feel better --> William tells him not to use it, but explains the Gevaudan thing anyway.

Then in a later volume, Red can mention having the silver dagger as a way to protect him/them from a vampire, and William can apologise and tell him it's useless, but there is no way he can have power over a vampire and which would he honestly prefer (again, another lie: My Vampires are weak to gold, but like they'd tell a /soul/ about that!). Actually... we need something to happen to Red to have him consent to being turned into a Super Power Human From Vampire Blood, and a scare involving another vampire, and an impotent silver knife, could very well work.

I might try and rework the scene. A lot of Red's actions are motivated by fear of death, so begging for a weapon of sorts should be doable.

Thanks again!
