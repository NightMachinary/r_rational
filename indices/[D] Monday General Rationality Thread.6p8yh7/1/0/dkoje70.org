  Vampire gives Human a silver dagger in one scene, saying it's to defend himself from a rival vampire. There's no situation in which Human attacking the rival vampire with a silver dagger is in any way remotely helpful. So why would Vampire give Human the dagger? I like the dagger scene so I kind of don't want to have to remove it, but you know, kill your darlings and all that...

Does the person giving the silver dagger have an incentive to lie, even if non maliciously? This could be security theater - "Don't worry dear, your blanket will totally protect you from the storm."
