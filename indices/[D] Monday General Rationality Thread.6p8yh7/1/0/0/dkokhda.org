Thanks for your thoughts! The problem is, if the human (Red) uses the silver dagger on the dangerous vampire (Elodia), it's going to cause a hell of a lot of problems for the vampire who gave him the dagger (William).

Like, in other words, let's say Elodia tries to kill Red. If Red draws the silver dagger on her, it makes things worse: not only has Red done whatever made Elodia want to kill him, but now he's trying to kill her with a silver dagger (which he doesn't know is harmless to a vampire). So he's in more trouble than before. The best course of action for him in this situation is to shut up and let William handle it.

And why would William give Red a dagger, tell him it was harmful to vampires, when it really isn't? It means William is telling a lie that could very well lead to Red being killed.

My partner suggested that it be part of a vampire ritual (they like their rituals), to give a human a silver dagger as a gesture of trust, for the dual purposes of making the human feel trusted and for also perpetrating the myth that silver hurts vampires. It's less a "use this on other vampires" and more of a "I trust you so much I am going to tell you My One Weakness and give you a way to exploit it".

In the end, whatever way you twist it, it seems you really have to /twist/ it to make it fit, so I think it's going to have to go.
