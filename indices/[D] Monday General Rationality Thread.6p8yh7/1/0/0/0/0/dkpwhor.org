1) Tension: William is telling Red Elodia's upcoming visit is harmless, but then he gives Red a dagger to defend himself. This suggests it's maybe not so harmless, and, well, it isn't - Red very nearly gets killed due to what occurs. (This logic doesn't really work from William's PoV since the dagger is useless)

2) Worldbuilding/TWIST: I want readers to ask themselves, "why would a vampire give a vampire-deadly weapon to a human, no matter how much they like smooching that particular human?" so the eventual reveal that silver is harmless and that vampires decided to perpetrate the myth that it wasn't so their real weakness wasn't discovered makes people smile and nod and go "ah-ha! Now that dagger scene makes sense"

Like, I'm pretty sure that the scene isn't good enough to be worth trying to rescue. Any rescue job I did would probably make things worse since it would need twisting to get Rational'd.

I'm considering having Red worried, begging for a security blanket, and William finally just giving him a damn silver dagger and telling him under no circumstances to use it because he'll take better care of Red than a silver dagger could - but then I don't think it's right for William to lie that the beast of gevaudan was a vampire who was weak to silver. And Red is very, very trusting so he would probably accept William's repeated assurances that no weapon was necessary if that conversation were to occur.

The scene in question since it's short (optional):

--------------

Although his knowledge was far from perfect, he did feel prepared [for the other vampire to visit]. William had assured him that nothing bad would come of him, though the fact he felt a need to reassure Red was itself rather unnerving. More unnerving still was the dagger that William had given him: not the dainty stiletto that was meant to fend off pickpockets, no. This dagger had a strong, thick handle made of dark wood and a blade whose edge seemed to be as thin as a hair. More surprising still was the caution with which William stored it. It was not only in a small scabbard but in a secondary sheath, too. The sheath had an extra bit of fabric that looped around the quillons, preventing the weapon from being easily drawn. When William handed it to Red, he gently released the dagger from its sheath, revealing the shining silver blade.

“Though I doubt it will be necessary, I feel that it is only fair to provide you with a means to defend yourself from Duchess Elodia, should you require it.”

Red looked at the four inch blade and wondered what harm it could possibly do to a vampire. “Is it... magic?”

“No.” William gave an amused smile; it amazed him that to this starry-eyed human, everything seemed supernatural.

Red's mouth fell ever so slightly open as he made the connection. “It's not silver, surely?”

“It is, indeed.”

“But... I thought that was for werewolves?” Red asked, somewhat worried that William might somehow be offended by the comparison. He hadn't thought to ask William about other supernatural creatures; on some level, given vampires were real, he guessed that there must be griffins, mermaids, and werewolves lurking in the shadows. On another level, he knew that they had nothing to do with each other.

“The legend comes from The Beast of Gévaudan. That creature was one of us. Your legends turned him into a wolf.”

Red nodded; he would have to look up werewolves in his encyclopedia. “That makes sense.”

“I doubt you will require it,” William continued. “But one should always be cautious.”

Red nodded. He certainly would feel safer, with the now unsheathed dagger in a scabbard hidden in his clothing. But at the end of the day, this was just one of William's colleagues coming to visit. She would surely be patient and understanding, especially considering it was his first time appearing at such an event.
