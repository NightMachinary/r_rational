I suspect the main thing is not to try to make it sound witty. If I was in the market for a partner I'd be looking for someone who actually likes rationality and optimisation and knows what that means, and while I may be in a minority there, I think it's the minority you're looking for interest from. Also I'd suggest toning down what you claim to be able to do and making it clear you know you make mistakes - so something more like 'I try to be less wrong' than, 'I prefer world optimization'.
