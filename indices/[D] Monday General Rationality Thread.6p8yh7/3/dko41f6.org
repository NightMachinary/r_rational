LW is said to be lower traffic now than it used to be. People talk about the Rationality Diaspora because lots of the community is on different sites (facebook, tumblr, ssc, like 5 different discords, several IRC channels, and some even still post on LW). A post about this:

More recently and highly relevant:

Some say that it would be valuable for the rationalist communities to have a hub or a hinge, a more centralized site where they all intersect. Where a newcomer can find a well-organized set of introductory texts, but also see links to the latest and greatest of blog posts and articles. Some argue the that LW is the right place for this. Does this have value? Is it worth doing? What do you think?
