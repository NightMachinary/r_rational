  How dark and deadly would you want this world of Medics and Magics to be?
#+end_quote

Depends, are you planning on mostly having Osler play around with and learn about ways to +abuse+ use biological abilities? Keep it light-hearted and funny. Is he trying to catch a criminal? Make it mildly dark with a fair amount of danger. Is he trying to actually cure a plague? Make it */grimdark/*. /Anyone/ can die from disease. I recommend killing off Xavien, if he becomes Osler's best friend or his love interest if he has one in the middle of the investigation. In real life, there's no such thing as plot armor. In a rational fic, that should also apply. Although, the logical extension is to kill off Osler halfway through the plot-line, I get that would be too hard to maintain the story, but everyone else is open game. Don't just kill off the NPCs, the more player deaths, the better. For example, Wildbow's character deaths in his books are part of what makes it such a gripping story.

  How much mystery should I reveal on stage vs keep behind the curtain?

Eeeeh, this is your call to make, but let Osler's thoughts and motivations be transparent at all times since he's the main character. Go with whatever works best for you.

I'd strongly suggest combining enhanced smell and taste into one race, because the two senses tend to be strongly linked. I'm imagining a race of wolf shape-shifters who have extremely good noses and tongues. Since you seem to want abilities that can be exploited for medical gains, dogs are known to be able to detect [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_response_dog][changes in blood sugar levels]] and even [[http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/dogs-that-changed-the-world-medical-dogs/1277/][cancer cells]]. This way you can still take advantage of introducing medical knowledge in terms of how one can detect disease early. They can be extremely focused on the past, since they rely on understanding people through their scent which indicates past actions and feelings. This encourages strong traditions and keeping grudges for a long time. They are very good trackers, very at noticing subtle clues, loyal, and group-orientated. I'd imagine that they would think like a wolf in wolf-form as a way of giving them a weakness, since all of the races mentioned have a weakness of some sort.

Thanks for such an interesting story idea. I had fun thinking of advice or suggestions to give.
