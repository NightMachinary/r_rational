Re:shapeshifter wolves - that's basically going to be the werewolf idea I have. Werewolves will be more natural and feral, whereas vampires will be more refined and haughty, but their powers will definitely overlap with taste, smell and chemesthesis. Vamps will basically be the equivalent of a Coulter Counter if you're familiar with lab equipment.

Frankly, we don't know much about how smell actually works from my research on the subject poking around casually on Google (it mostly links to trash pop-articles on how dogs smell things) that I have a hard time even conceptualizing what that super sense would be like. (Maybe Professor Farnsworth is onto something big with his Smell-O-Scope.)
