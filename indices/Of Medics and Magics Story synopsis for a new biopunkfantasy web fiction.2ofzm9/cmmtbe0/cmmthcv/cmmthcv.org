Thanks! I was listening to Writing Excuses, Sanderson's podcast and they had a recent episode on "killing off characters." I'm figuring that if this is going to be about discovery, Xavien will probably die after the first act like Obi-Wan Kenobi. And there won't be a Yoda. Going full grimdark might make it Games of Thronesy with a brutal end by a lynch mob... or tragedy of the caregiver like Father Damien.

[[http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_Damien]] (I'm from Hawaii, so I realize this reference to a Catholic priest who dies of leprosy after helping a leper colony may be obscure. I'm also realizing why I crossed the names Xavier and Damien unconsciously when I came up with the idea of "recruiting for a new medical school" in my first iteration of this story!)
