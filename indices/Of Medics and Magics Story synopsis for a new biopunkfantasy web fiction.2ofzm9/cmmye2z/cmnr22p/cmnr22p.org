Nice -- my original idea was that there would only be the friendly fantasy races, but it makes sense to expand the universe out more and have all the fantasy monsters and apply rational principles to them as well.

Trolls are going to be "cancer" in my world -- with immortal, replicating malignant cells all hungry and all consuming.

Ogres -- not sure. I'll think about it more. I like your idea with the smell fetish!
