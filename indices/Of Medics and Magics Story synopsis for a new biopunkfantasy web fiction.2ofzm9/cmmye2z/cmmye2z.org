Well, Trolls can be your enhanced smell race, and ogres your enhanced taste race.

Trolls are so enamored of all sorts of smells that they keep fetishes of strong smelling things round them all the time. Most people don't want to be around them, because some trolls develop affinities for some unfortunate scents. Like limburger, for example. Or rotten eggs. However, as mentioned below, it's possible that they might be able to smell cancers or other chemical imbalances.

Ogres, well, ogres are foodies. They make incredibly good tasting food, but you might be a bit disturbed about what actually goes into it if you ask. Their sense of what chemically goes together to get the taste they want is uncanny. They are so in tune with chemistry in general that a few of them have lost some of their interest in cooking and moved into alchemy and making medicines.

The above ideas are yours if you want to use them :)
