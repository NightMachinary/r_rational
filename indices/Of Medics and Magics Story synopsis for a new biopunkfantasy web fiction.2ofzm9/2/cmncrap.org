Huh, I'd totally forgotten about that thread. Anyway ...

  How dark and deadly would you want this world of Medics and Magics to be?
#+end_quote

I like my worlds dark and deadly, but my /stories/ somewhat less so. So it's totally fine if there's a zombie apocalypse that's wiped out 99% of humanity, but I don't really want to read about people raping and killing each other and getting slowly ground down as they inevitably betray and sabotage one another while they get overrun by the living dead. Instead, I want a story where people find safe havens and rebuild - where there's still some heroism, and where that heroism isn't universally punished. I like dark worlds that aren't so damned cynical about things, if that makes sense. It's a matter of personal preference though.

  How much mystery should I reveal on stage vs keep behind the curtain?
#+end_quote

If you're listening to the Writing Excuses podcasts, then I'll assume that you already know Sanderson's Laws for magic. If the powers are being used to solve problems, the reader needs to understand the powers (though my preference is to see the power in action once or twice before it's probably explained). An antagonists powers don't need much in the way of explanation, but I think it's generally good if they have some limits so that the audience doesn't feel like you're copping out. Generally speaking, infodumps are boring, and people don't like them, so if you're revealing things, do it in some clever way (like two people arguing with each other about some manner of specifics), incidentally (while someone is using their power), or in bits and pieces.

  biopunk
#+end_quote

Aside from super senses, what do you mean by biopunk? When I hear the phrase, I'm imagining transhuman stuff (or transhumanoid in your case, I guess). Subdermal implants, augmented biology, grafted limbs, transplanted eyeballs, etc. The "punk" aspect is about that sort of grittiness - carved bone and jacked muscles. Are we using the term in the same sense?
