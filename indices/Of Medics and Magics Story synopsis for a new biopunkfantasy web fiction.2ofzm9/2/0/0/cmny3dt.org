So if you wanted to have wizards in your setting, then they could be the humans who were alive before the fall. They would have used their mastery over biology to make themselves immortal and the long, long years have forced them into towers of isolation where they spend the decades fruitlessly trying to recreate the miracles of the past.

It's not a very rational behavior for them, but it's a way for you to have near immortal sorcerers. You could limit them by only allowing them to be wealthy citizens who received all sorts of post-human perks but don't actually have the knowledge or skill to recreate it to give to others.
