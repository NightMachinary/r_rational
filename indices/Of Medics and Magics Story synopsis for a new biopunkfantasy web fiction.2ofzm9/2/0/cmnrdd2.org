I read The Mistborn series last year and read about the Laws of Magic then -- I'll have track back to the podcast episodes that they talk explicitly about it though!

Behind the curtain, it IS biopunk. Except that civilization crashed and burned about 800 years prior. So... I guess it is post-biopunk or proto-biopunk depending on how you look at it. The ancient magic items are going to be the types of devices you are talking about in a different guise.

Similarly, the super senses are amplified sensory organs powered by new magical organelles (not quite nanotechnology, but microbiological genetic technology.)

If I use Worm as an example, this would have to be a late reveal by a creator, since the characters would not be privy to any of this advanced knowledge.
