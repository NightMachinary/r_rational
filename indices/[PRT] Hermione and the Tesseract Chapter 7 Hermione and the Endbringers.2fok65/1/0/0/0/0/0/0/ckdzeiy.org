You don't have to incorporate it into the fic as it is now, since you have an awesome plot and alternate versions could interrupt the flow, but yeah if I could read that again I would appreciate it because I laughed for 10 minutes.

But I really love the story both ways, so /internal conflict/ It's your thing, do what you want
