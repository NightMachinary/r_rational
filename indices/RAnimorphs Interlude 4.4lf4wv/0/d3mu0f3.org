Presumably the second interlude is from the Chee. But the implication that there are 139231 of them seems somewhat bizarre, since I thought there were very few of them. Canonically, are the Chee distributed amongst many planets, or just on earth? A bunch from the middle could all be dead, but it seems unlikely to manage to have the first 6 in that case.

The last interlude sounds like Jake. That can't be healthy...
