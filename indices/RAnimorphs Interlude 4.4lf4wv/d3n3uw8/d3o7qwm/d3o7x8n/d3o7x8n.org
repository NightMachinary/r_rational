In Dishonored, one of the missions consists in taking out Lady Boyle, the Regents girlfriend/financer. The non-lethal way to do so is to kidnap her and giver her unconscious body to a nameless guy who says he will sequestrate her for the rest of her life. But hey, she'll probably learn to love him at some point, right?
