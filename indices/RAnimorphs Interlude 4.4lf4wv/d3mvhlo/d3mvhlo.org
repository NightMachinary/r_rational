Yeah, an update! This almost-but-not-quite makes up for the last 23 reckoning-less days!

- Booh, Ellimist/Crayak! Save-spamming is for the weak! Stop cheating and do a one-try playthrough now!

- Also, being manipulated by godlike entities suck, especially if you have no way to know you're being manipulated. Though I'm hopeful Jake and Marco will be on guard next encounter, and less likely to get influenced.

- Marco was right, by the way: they shouldn't have indulged E/C and entered the pool. Doing so put them on a unfavorable mental footing, both because they were surrounded by pain and destruction and because the crumpling building probably gave them a sense of urgency that led them to make impulsive decisions. Like Marco said, no matter how bad you think it is, you don't go in the car with the kidnapper.

- The Chee have weird communication conventions. They call dogs by their human names, but saying "World War II" is too much for them? Also, wow, not only do they all expect to survive the asteroid blast, but they're taking the time to rescue loads of dogs at the same time? Man, Chees are unstoppable.

- "I'm n and I didn't move. Did n+1 move?" Awesome moment of alien robotness here, though I'm not quite sure why didn't they just say "Did anyone else move?" and spare them the super-long sounding off.

- By the way, Cassie's sacrifice really was in vain here. Erek could have gotten to safety easily by himself. She could have save the nameless kid, or another family member, and gotten to safety in the snipe morph without leaving the forest and getting shot. Man, this story is not kind to emotion-driven heroic sacrifices.
