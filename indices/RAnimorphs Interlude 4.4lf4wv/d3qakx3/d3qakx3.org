The dawning of the Chee realisation (from utter confusion) was beautiful.

Curious about what the intended aim is, regarding what's going to happen to Cassie.

People morphing their lost loved ones: Even without the mind backup, an interesting concept that wasn't touched on in the original. Here, there's also always the interesting temptation to not demorph.

I liked the Ellimist Chronicles -like state of it as a 'player'. I might argue that, if they were fine with using (and terminating) that sort of simulation while planning their war, that they might as well just use a special copy as the main board without involving the massive resources to manipulate the real universe (unless that's actually exactly what they're doing, Animorphs unaware...).

(Edit: --Ah, I didn't realise that 63481 had one fewer digit than 139321 until I wrote them numerically. Now the order makes sense.)
