  Part two is the Chee. Looks like the narrator is Erek, and he just doesn't use first person at all.

I think the narrator is all of them -- they're interconnected and thinking together. I would guess that Erek is 63481, as he got transported along with the animorphs. So Erek takes immediate action to prevent the controllers from hurting Ax, while the other Chee go on to play with the dogs for a while until they realise they have to flee.
