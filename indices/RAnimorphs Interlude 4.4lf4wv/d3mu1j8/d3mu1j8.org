Okay, so. Part one is the Ellimist (or whichever god we saw last time). He's putting a lot of effort into getting exactly the outcome he wants. So does that mean he wanted Cassie to die? But Cassie is one of the ones who was meant to be there.

Part two is the Chee. Looks like the narrator is Erek, and he just doesn't use first person at all.

Jake, Marco and Garrett get names. Tobias isn't mentioned - presumably he got sent back to DC? "The female" is presumably Rachel, but whether it is or not, why doesn't she merit a name? Are they annoyed at her for tricking them? Seems uncharacteristic.

The four kids are essentially demorphing, but without having morph bodies to demorph from? Perhaps it was easier for the Ellimist to move only the tech, especially because they were all in morph when he stopped time (half-morphed, in Garrett's case). Less mass to deal with.

"The human" - the child Cassie tried to save? But he was in Cassie's snipe morph.

There are over 100,000 Chee. I guess not all live near the Animorphs.

Part three I guess is Jake morphing Cassie, because it's the only way he can be with her, because she's dead.
