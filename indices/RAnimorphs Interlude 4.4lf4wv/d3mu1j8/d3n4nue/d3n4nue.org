Perhaps the Chee have some sense of PC vs NPC? Creator vs Created? Influencer vs Influenced? All the Chee are numbered rather than named, and the closest human analogue is to call Rachel by her gender, as Eric is called by his serial number.

Though giving all the dogs names blows holes in that theory, unless it is some kind of homage to the ultimate creators the Pemalites as it was in canon.
