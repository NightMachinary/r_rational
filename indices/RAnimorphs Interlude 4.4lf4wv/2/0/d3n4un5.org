  â€¢ "I'm n and I didn't move. Did n+1 move?" Awesome moment of alien robotness here, though I'm not quite sure why didn't they just say "Did anyone else move?" and spare them the super-long sounding off.

As a programmer, this process has at /least/ two purposes: indicating who moved, and indicating who has been incapacitated. If suddenly the sound-off ends at 56, whelp, it looks like 57 is in a bigger bind than just having moved to an unexpected place.

Also, a loop like that would take like 2 milliseconds on current hardware assuming a wired LAN. I'd bet it was actually on a scale of microseconds or less.
