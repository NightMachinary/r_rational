No, I'd say rationalist fiction is pretty rare. In fact, I'm struggling to name a mainstream novel that's rationalist off the top of my head. It's certainly not an almost full Venn diagram overlap between the genres.

Think of the focus of the story in terms of solving the puzzle vs actively trying to become a better thinker (and then /maybe/ solving the puzzle).
