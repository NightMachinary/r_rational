It will probably be something, but as to what ... that's hard to say, and depends upon a lot of different factors. A lot of what people are talking about it doing is just total, complete bunk that we don't even have the frameworks to talk about doing, let alone the technology to do them /at all/, let alone safely.

But in a few years (largely depending on regulatory agencies, though there are a lot of unknowns) it will start to be put into people who really, badly want/need it, namely those with some specific impairments or disabilities. Because it doesn't go very deep into the brain, the applications will be fairly limited.

After that, when people are having one put in on an elective basis ... it's hard to say at this point. Because it can read and write, it's possible that they'll develop the software and understanding necessary to do a proper brain-computer interface of some kind. My guess is that this won't be particularly good, but it depends on how well they're able to distinguish neuron spikes, and how that translates to specific thoughts or other brain activity. /In theory/, thinking some specific mnemonic hard enough produces some pattern of spiking that Neuralink can recognize, and once you have that, you can hook it up to various apps running on Neuralink itself, or in your phone.

More speculatively, the ability to "write", which is to say, electrically stimulate part of the brain, might have a number of uses, but it's fairly indiscriminate from what they've shown, and the actual effects are a person's brain are questionable. There are some existing therapies that use similarish techniques (two I know of are for depression and Parkinson's), but those are both much deeper than Neuralink is planned to go, at least for the moment.

Overall, I don't think that it's nothing, but this is the ground floor that they're starting from. My guess is that progress will be quite slow. Anyone talking about more mature uses, like copying memories, inserting new memories, mimicing or spoofing senses, altering mood ... you should assume is talking science fiction, rather than science fact.

(This is based on what I know of the state of the art, and what I saw at their presentation, but I was watching with my son, who was very interested in talking about pigs, so I apologize if I missed something key to their approach or what they currently have working.)
