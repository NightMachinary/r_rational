Having thought about it a bit more, LIPC is probably your best bet. For one, as long as your civilization has a sufficiently robust lasing medium, a LIPC has all the advantages of a laser rifle while also having a practical stun setting. Just keep the laser on longer and don't dump electricity down the muzzle to use it as a highly lethal cutting laser. Furthermore, the only thing your civilization needs to make them which we don't have is mass-producible ultracapacitors, which should be doable with mass-producible graphene. You would still need to worry about heat dispersal in such a weapon, but I would expect such a civilization to view cryogenic cooling of superconducting electronics as relatively normal anyway.

You'd wind up with a recoilless rifle which can switch instantly between lethal and nonlethal operation, with "clips" you can recharge by plugging into the wall. It would probably have tons of awesome-looking heat sink fins protruding off the barrel and lasing medium cartridge, just in case the active cooling system failed, which might also make this thing into an effective mace-like melee weapon if the fins were sharp and strong enough. If these things are common enough, the heat sink might be shaped more as a shield for deflecting shots from other people firing them at you. Or perhaps the fins themselves are mirrored and arraged to diffuse incoming laser fire.

Basically, you actually can justify some seemingly stupid sci-fi weapon tropes with this technology. Go wild.
