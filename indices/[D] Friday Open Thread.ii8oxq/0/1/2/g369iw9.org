I think the white lie of free will is actually because without the presumption of free will it's basically impossible to talk about morality which is the bedrock of legislation. As far as I understand the issue, that's the purpose of dualism, to redefine free will so we can still have philosophical discussions while recognizing that free will, in the more colloquial sense, doesn't exist.
