Convincing people to recycle and not litter, it's good for the environment but it's outsourcing the cost of cleaning things up to the public and let's businesses blame consumers.

I think getting an accountant for the lottery is still sound advice, you're suddenly in a tax bracket where you can spend large amounts of money to save/make even more money through all kinds of tricks. I don't know about elsewhere but things get very messy in the USA once you're making enough money that the costs of legal and financial instruments are relatively small.

My personal break point would be >$1,000 dollars to take the effort to adjust my 401k contribution for the month, otherwise I would just deposit it to be invested later.
