I had some thoughts over the week I wanted to share with this community

What are some of the white lies that we tell society and are useful to propagate? For example a media campaign to promote recycling may say you can't recycle black plastic. But actually you can, it is just very difficult to and will more likely end up in landfill. Or you might tell people wearing face mask is to protect you from disease when actually it is to protect other people, but saying it this way might encourage more people to wear them.

On a mostly unrelated note I've often heard that if you win the lottery the first thing you should do is hire an account to help manage your money because most people lose their fortune relatively quickly. However, I think this is selection bias and actually people who play the lottery enough to win are more likely to have bad financial sense so that advice is not good for most people, but it is good for most people who would win I guess.

If you came into a large sum of money what would you do with it? If your answer was invest how large of an amount would that need to be?
