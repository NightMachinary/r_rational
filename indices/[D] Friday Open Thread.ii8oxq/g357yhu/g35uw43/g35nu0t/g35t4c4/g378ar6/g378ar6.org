From a materialist perspective, if free will means that I am able to make choices and act on them, and my brain is me, then I clearly have free will.

From a dualist perspective, if free will means that I am able to make choices and act on them, and I have a soul which is me, then I also clearly have free will.

So I don't think this counts as a white lie. It's just the truth.

(edit: this is a simplified argument, and plausibly the real conclusion is we have free will /some/ of the time, since we don't always actually do what we want to do. In this paradigm it would make sense to think of your own will not as free, but as a scarce quantity. If this became general knowledge (and was true) I believe the world would actually get better, as people would be able to utilize this understanding to their advantage to spend will more wisely to do the things they actually want to do.)
