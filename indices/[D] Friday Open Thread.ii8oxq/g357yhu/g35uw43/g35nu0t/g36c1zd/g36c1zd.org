I think most are all too ready to propagate white lies. I would guess, however I have little supporting data, that usually the result is simply taking the nuance out of discussion, propagating harmful misconceptions, and convincing people that most topics are simple and straightforward. Not complex and requiring deep thought and knowledge.

This, I think, is harmful to the long term mental & intellectual health of civilization, as well as the legitimacy of sources of authority once the “truth” behind the white lies is revealed.

This outweighs the relatively minor benefits of white lies in aggregate mostly. The negatives of the no-white-lies approach appears in the form of people coming to conclusions not supported by the mainstream culture. These conclusions are likely generally correct, but can often be wrong (ex. literally all of history). So the benefits of white lies are small at best, a priori.
