  I've often heard that if you win the lottery the first thing you should do is hire an account to help manage your money
#+end_quote

this is true regardless of how good with money you are. If you win the lottery you should first hire a lawyer to pick up the money and create a protected fund for you, and THEN hire a financial advisor to manage it. It is not only to protect the money from your own irrationality but also from:

- loss due to divorce, litigation, alimony etc

- being blackmailed to part with the money. You can secure the money in a way that makes blackmail pointless.

- protection of your money in case of your death, so it is not scavenged by extended family but stays with your chosen heirs.

- last but not least, safe and secure re-investment, so that your money make more money over time, instead of being spent.
