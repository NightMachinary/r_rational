I did some further reading after posting the question and came across one (theoretical) design that seems kind of neat.

Essentially, you have a chamber that's filled with a gas and that's given a nice jolt to turn it into plasma. Using some coils you push this ball of plasma down a barrel where it runs into a piece of metallic 'cloth.'

So the cloth wraps around the plasma (like dropping a rock through a tarp) and fires away like a more or less normal projectile, only its a ball of superheated not-gas.

It's... probably less effective than just shooting a bullet.
