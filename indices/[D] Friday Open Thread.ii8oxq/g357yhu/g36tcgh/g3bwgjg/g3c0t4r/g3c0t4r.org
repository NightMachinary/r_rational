[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolaser][Laser-Induced Plasma Channel]] weapons are actually real, if wildly impractical with current energy storage technology. They work by firing a laser powerful enough to ionize the air at a target, then firing an electric charge down the newly-conductive air wire to incapacitate them. They're basically taser rifles which don't require finnicky wires and contact points, or they would be if they didn't require huge capacitor banks to fire even once. However, they have the capacity to transfer far larger amounts of energy into the target than a traditional wired taser because their plasma wire won't burn out like a fuse, so they can be made lethal far more easily. They would also obviously be highly lethal to androids and/or cyborgs, and don't fire through walls, making them relatively safe weapons for urban combat in high-rise slums and the like. You don't have to worry about shooting the kid through three units down.

Also you might recognize this mechanism as being similar to the way lightning works. That's because it basically is a lightning gun. It will cause thunderclaps, and would be impossible to silence.

Beyond that, the problem with plasma weaponry is that plasma doesn't tend to be very dense. As a result, very hot plasma often has little actual heat-transfering capacity. Furthermore, because it's a gas, it will be interrupted by the atmosphere and will probably lose most of its energy before it hits a target. It also doesn't have much kinetic energy, so it won't punch people the way normal guns will. Traditional bullets work because they are dense and have momentum, but plasma just doesn't.

However, if you had some technology which could directly manipulate magnetic fields, you could probably do interesting things with plasma. If you had the means to project a magnetic containment field at near-lightspeed, you could pack in plasma at temperatures and densities just below fusing point and fire that packet at the enemy. This would be far more dense and hot, akin to scooping out a bit of the Sun's core, and would obviously be quite destructive. You wouldn't be able to look directly at it without a welding mask, though, and it would probably be closer to an RPG than a gun. You don't want to be anywhere near the target when containment fails. Though it might be safer than an RPG for your internal organs, due to the lack of an explosive shockwave.

The problem with this interpretation is that it's Clarketech which any civilization smart enough to develop could use for things far better than handheld weapons. There's nothing I can think of between the realistic, but energy-chugging stun gun and the unrealistic mini-sun-chucker, though.
