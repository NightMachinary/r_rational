Plasma Guns!

I'm writing a sci-fi story (Stray cat Strut) and the main character just got her hands on some nifty plasma weaponry. She hasn't fired it yet, mostly because I want the weapon to be somewhat realistic.

Which means I need an idea of how a 'realistic' plasma-based weapon would work (where 'realistic' means I can bullshit a believable enough answer that the reader will nod and accept that the awesome gun does awesome things). I've been looking at a few ideas, but none of them really jive with me.

I was wondering if anyone here had a better idea on how a weapon like that would work?
