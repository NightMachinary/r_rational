Margaret Atwood's /Oryx and Crake/ series has elements of this buried among the more traditional dystopian images. They're great books, though not exactly uplifting.

Ditto for Peter F. Hamilton's /Commonwealth/ books, specifically the ill-fated Rand Town experiment and the Archangel organism-city.
