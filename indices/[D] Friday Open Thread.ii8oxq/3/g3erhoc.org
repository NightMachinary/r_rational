So Bobiverse. It's not rational.

It has elements of rationality, sure. But the main character himself is not rational.

I made it through the first book, but I couldn't go further since the author started talking about uninteresting stuff, and ignoring obvious solutions.

Spoilers from the first book..

#+begin_quote
  Enemy AIs, one of the first things he should've done once he realized FAITH still had codes to control him, was wonder if the other factions had codes for their own AIs. This should've been a major consideration, considering the Brazilians tried to wipe humanity out.

  Destroying his drones just to get a single kill in. Like. What? That's a very short term solution at best, and assuming railguns wouldn't work. And he hates explosives. What about something as simple as a crossbow. Instead he's exploding his work all over the place.

  Self modification, this might be something Bob hates. But he's already gone through his code before. But it's never brought up again. The closest he's gotten to self modification is that Australian AI, but that was handwaved away.

  Evacuating Earth. Oh no, he can only evac 15k people at a time! So many people are going to die :( We have stasis pods, which were not shown to have any downsides. If only there was a way to sardine pack humans away. Ah well, guess you lot are dying.

  Terrorist Attacks. So the world's network has been brought down right? So signals should stand out. Which means logically, they're focused on a certain part of the world. Which means he should focus attention there. Going from that, the basis of attacks and how they're spread out, drones can be deployed to track movement patterns and narrow down the search field with cameras. It doesn't have to be identifying information either, just a few pixels showing someone moving around can be worlds of info.

  Survivors talking to each other, so if I recall correctly they mention 50 or so groups. And 15 million survivors. That's kind of a weird number, especially when they're talking about the food production being an issue and 25 cows dead from terrorist attacks as crucial.

  Bob the Introvert. Yet he loves chatting for ages to people that he's closely related to. Ok. But those people love talking to him? And remember, they're raised in a society where replicants are slaves. The minister would never approve of Bob being accepted as human, he wouldn't encourage this large scale of behavior. And even, why is he leaving the minister alive when he'll clearly regret it in the future? It's like I raise a lion, but never attempt to teach the lion not to prey on humans.

  The high ratio of worlds at similar stages of development. Yes, I'm including humans and the giant ocean world in that. The only way it makes sense, is if they were seeded.

  Hippogriffs, just use IR.. You should've been capable of that already.

  Describing alien lifeforms, I haven't seen actual descriptions of alien life yet. Just modifications of stuff on Earth. The first aliens he contacted? Described as a cross between bat and pig. The animal they like to feed off? Described as a pig but shaped as a bear.

  They talk about backing themselves up, but I seriously have to wonder. Why the hell are they backing themselves up? I can understand backing themselves up outside of their hardware, but when they are the software themselves... On Earth they would've been backed up to roll back mistakes. But here, if their mainframe is shotup they're instantly considered a loss. Because they backup to the same place as their OS.

  Space is vast. So very vast. But there's people that want to kill them :( If only they could live in outerspace, if only they had a way to generate power without involving the sun. If only they had a way to move giant planets to a location in the middle of space. Apparently this isn't viable.

  VR fasination with creating only what he's familiar with. New flavors? New sights? Weird scenes? No no. Lets just remake other peoples ideas and remake stuff we know. And lets theme everything on being in a tiny room with different scenes. Because floating in outerspace is impossible, a swimming pool is impossible, etc.

This is a story, but the author doesn't consider rationality very much. The main character also describes himself as rational, but doesn't follow the rational path.

That said, "Post Human" on Royal Road is a better book.
