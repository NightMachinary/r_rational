You're Superman. Your superpowers are to be able to go at a max speed of 99% the speed of light. You can output at a maximum 10^{21} joules of energy before dying. Safe power outage of let's say 10^{18} Watts. Other powers are pretty much the same. Is there any possible way to move Venus into another orbit over a period of a year at most? He can't physically move the planet as he will go right through it. At most he can push a kilometer wide and thick asteroid. His goal is to move Venus to Earth's Lagrange point on the opposite side of the Sun. Thanks for reading.
