But wouldn't the highly dense object just go through Earth anyway if he's pushing it? I guess making a gravitationally dense object to attract Venus might work. He'd have to condense the object to the size of a kilometer which would introduce new issues but I'd probably be able to work around them. Thanks for the answer!
