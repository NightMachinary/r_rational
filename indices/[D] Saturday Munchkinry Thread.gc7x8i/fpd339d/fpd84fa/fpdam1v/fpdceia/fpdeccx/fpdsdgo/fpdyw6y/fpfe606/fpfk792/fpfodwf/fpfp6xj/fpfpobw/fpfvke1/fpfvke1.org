  Of course, they weren't expecting a human to turn up out of nowhere. But they could have taken any number of precautions against wear and tear, or against unexpected equipment failures.

Yes, that's the essence of the question. As a practical matter, humans have been a non-issue for millennia, so it's inefficient to spend too much time and resources worrying about something that just can't happen. The reason why it is that... basically something very very /very/ unlikely happened, and that's why the story takes place at all. So the idea is, what would be a reasonable way of cheating around those sort of precautions or exploiting them. Something as trivial as "breaking the antennas" seems only step one, since any kind of space debris would do that, and they'll obviously have contingencies in place.

The story isn't necessarily going to be /too/ strictly rational, I'm leaning towards a slightly different focus. But I'd still like to think it in a way that isn't completely unbelievable either, so I'm trying to think about ways in which this could work. Maybe sabotage the communication /and/ the system used to repair it? Or perhaps exploit the fact that the AI expects that it can not be damaged from the inside without undergoing outside damage first, and start creating /false/ faults by meddling with the sensor system's own outputs? This might fall again under "the humans might have a root password of sorts" idea, something that you can use to both alter the system's functioning, erase the logs of your activity, and exploit the surprise effect to its best.
