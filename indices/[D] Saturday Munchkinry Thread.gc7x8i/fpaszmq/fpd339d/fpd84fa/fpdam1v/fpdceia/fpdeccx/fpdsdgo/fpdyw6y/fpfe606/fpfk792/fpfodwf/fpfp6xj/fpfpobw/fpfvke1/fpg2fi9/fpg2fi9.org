Hmmmm. A lot of that comes down to exactly what the criteria are that the computer systems have to fulfill, and exactly what the human wants to get from the system.

The computer's criteria might include any of the following:

- To make a safe living area for the species that originally built it;
- To investigate questions of science and improve its own technology to better fulfill its other aims;
- To more efficiently use the power output by the star it is orbiting;
- To hide from some other species of marauders (perhaps also long extinct, or perhaps not);
- To safeguard and keep alive the culture that originally built the place

And the human invader might want to:

- Find out more about the aliens who built this place
- Find out more about the place itself
- Simply stay alive
- Find a way to get back home with futuristic technology from this place
- Retroactively change history in some manner
- Use the resources here to live a life of hedonistic luxury

...and so on. Different aims need different methods to get there; some tricks the human might pull could include:

- Being a live organic creature (only helps for some possible AIs that value organic life)
- Persuading the AI that you have the equivalent of root access
- Using psychological attacks (to e.g. try to convince one core that the other cores are plotting against it)
- Taking advantage of poorly designed systems (likely not many of those around anymore)
