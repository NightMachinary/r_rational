Makes sense. What about the centrality of control? On one hand, it seems like having a single, central core to handle all main processing is a vulnerability. On the other, on the scale of a whole solar system, lightspeed limit for radio communications is a problem, so preventing goal drift would be an issue if the AI had sufficiently intelligent subsystems - which meant they might want to have some sort of central core that goes "hey, you guys, this is our line, stick to it" now and then to keep everything coherent.
