I'm not sure why the different mass affects the orbit of the planets, could you explain? As I understand physics at this scale, everything falls at the same rate towards whatever it's orbiting, regardless of mass, so the orbits can be the same as long as the planets are far enough away from one another.

Using my understanding, Venus can be moved to a new, higher orbit through expenditure of lots of energy. Google gives me numbers that tell me Earth is about 18% faster than Venus, and assuming the change of velocity can be applied over long enough that the orbit changes just from that, would take (I think) about 3.4E52 Joules, or just over 10^{27} years at OP's safe power output of a billion billion watts.

I did use the equations for circles and not ellipses, but the eccentricity of the Terran and Venusian orbits are 0.006 and 0.007 respectively, so I feel reasonable in that regard.
