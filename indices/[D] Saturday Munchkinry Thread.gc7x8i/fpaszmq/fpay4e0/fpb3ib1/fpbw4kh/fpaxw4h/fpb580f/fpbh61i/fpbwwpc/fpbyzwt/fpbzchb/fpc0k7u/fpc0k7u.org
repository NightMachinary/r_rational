The foundation of non-relativistic physics, especially orbits, is the three laws of motion and Newton's law of gravitational force. The second law is the one that comes into play here, but it says that F=ma, or better said here F/m=a, or the acceleration of an object is equal to the ratio between the net force acting on it and its mass. The law of gravitation is F=Gm1m2/r^{2,} where G is the universal gravitational constant, m1 is the mass of one object, m2 is the mass of the other, and r is the distance between them.

Using the equations together, we get that the acceleration of an object in free fall (that is, gravity is the only force acting on it) is equal to the product of G and the mass of the object it's falling towards, divided by the distance between them squared; the mass of the object itself cancels out.

On your last point, planets aren't really on the same scale as the sun. In terms of mass the earth is to the sun as two regulation FIFA balls are to a blue whale.

Newton's equations work marvelously to describe everything most humans do in their lives. They only really break down when something gets on the level of an atom or something gets close to the speed of light.
