Who said that Newtonian physics only work on the surface of a planet? As I recall, Newton successfully used his models to explain why the planets orbit in ellipses rather than circles, making independent predictions that fit Kepler's conclusions. I think you might be thinking of Aristotelian physics that only work close to a planet, except Aristotelian physics just don't work once you can tell the difference between 2 and 2.3 seconds.
