I can't really calculate it, but if you can output that much energy, then you can construct anything you'd like, almost instantly. The limitation that you'll go through the planet is easily mitigated by smashing a bunch of asteroids together to make a highly dense object, then pushing that. But then you have another problem: This object is also very dense. Its gravitational pull might be an issue.

You have a second issue to contend with: Earth and Venus cannot be on the same orbit because they have different mass. Of course, you could just add some mass from your asteroid construct, but if we're doing that, why not just destroy Venus and remake it?
