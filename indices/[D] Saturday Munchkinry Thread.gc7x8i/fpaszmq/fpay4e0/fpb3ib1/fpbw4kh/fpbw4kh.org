Since no one else has considered the fact that he can move at 99% the speed of light yet, I'll do that here.

Accelerating a 1 km^{3} asteroid (of average density 3 g/cm^{3}) to 99% c will result in it having a relativistic mass of 3 g/cm^{3} × 1 km^{3} × 1 / √(1 - 0.99c / c) = 3×10^{13} kg.

We can increase the orbital radius of Venus to Earth's by changing its velocity by Δv = √(GM☉ / [average radius of Earth's orbit]) - √(GM☉ / [average radius of Venus' orbit]) = -5240 m/s.

The most direct method would be to just throw the asteroid straight at Venus opposite to its direction of motion. Plugging in the numbers, we get the change in velocity of Venus to be Δv = ([mass of Venus] × [velocity of Venus] - 3×10^{13} × 0.99c) / [mass of Venus] - [velocity of Venus] = -1.829 mm/s. So, he'd just need to toss about 2.9 million cubic kilometres of asteroid at the planet for it to work. Since there's an estimated 3×10^{21} kg / 3 g/cm^{3} = 1×10^{15} km^{3} of asteroid just in the Asteroid Belt alone, it should be plenty. It's just a matter of how fast he can do it.

As an addendum, let's have a look at what the crater would look like if we threw a 99%-light-speed cubic kilometre of rock into Venus. According to [[http://www.convertalot.com/asteroid_impact_calculator.html][this calculator]] (multiplying density by √(1 - 0.99c / c) to account for the relativistic mass increase, and converting a 1x1x1km cube into a 1.24km-diameter sphere, and impacting at 90° to the horizontal), we get a crater that's about 6400 km wide and 1600 km deep, with a volume of 2.6×10^{10} km^{3.} The diameter of Venus is 12,104 km, and its volume 9.4×10^{11} km^{3.} So, really, in about 36 asteroid throws we've already annihilated Venus, and everything after that would just be adding fuel to the newly-forming asteroid belt.

So, yes. Superman might be able to move Venus into Earth's orbit, but it probably won't be intact enough to be of any use.
