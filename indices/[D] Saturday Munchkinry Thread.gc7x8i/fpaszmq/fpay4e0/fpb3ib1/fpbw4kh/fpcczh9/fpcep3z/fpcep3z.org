No, not really. Well, slingshotting asteroids around Venus /would/ change its angular velocity, though probably orders of magnitude less than throwing them directly at it. The latter would be transferring all its kinetic energy straight into the planet (barring energy lost through heat), while the latter would only transfer enough for the asteroid to just change direction.

Increasing the rotation of a planet wouldn't have much of an effect either - there's nothing for it to rub against to induce "friction", and an orbiting object's mass (and energy) doesn't have an effect on the orbit itself.
