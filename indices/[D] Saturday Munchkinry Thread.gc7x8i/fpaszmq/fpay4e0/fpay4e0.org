Nope. At least, not if my understanding of physics is anywhere near correct.

Venus masses about 5x10^{24} kg.

Venus is travelling about 30,000 m/s.

One joule is equal to a Newton metre (exerting a force of one Newton over the distance of a metre).

Every second you're applying a force, you're exerting it over a distance of roughly 30 km.

So, the velocity change you can achieve is represented by the equation E= m*d*v*t, where:

- E= 10^{21} J
- m = 10^{24} kg
- d = 30,000 m/s x (t)s

So: 10^{21} = ~(5x10^{24)} * ((30,000) * (t)) * (v) / (t)

The time parameters cancel out, leaving: v =~ 10^{21} kg*m*m/s/s / (5x10^{24} kg * 3x10^{4} m/s)

v =~ 7 x 10^{-9} m/s

Congratulations, you've altered the velocity of Venus to speed its orbit up by about 7 micrometres each second, which is far, far less than the rounding errors I've made in its mass and orbital velocity.
