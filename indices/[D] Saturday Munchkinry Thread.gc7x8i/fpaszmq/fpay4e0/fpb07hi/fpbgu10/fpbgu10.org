No problem! Thanks to you, as well! Occasionally, it gets into my head that we should drop Jupiter into the sun as a way to extend our Sun's lifespan as a yellow dwarf, but I don't often have a way to grasp just how ludicrous (and, dare I say, /astronomical/) the forces involved would be. You've helped put the issue to bed in my mind again for a while, so thanks for that.
