Unless your Superman either gets /way/ stronger or relies on technology and external sources of energy (which has it's own issues if you want things accomplished in less than centuries) I don't actually think in the scenario presented it's possible.

The problem with trying to use a gravity tractor is that you are greatly limited in how large an object you can use before it can't be physically pushed at a reasonable rate (without going through it), and you're trying to move an entire planet with this. So this can only happen on astronomical timescales. For an explanation of how you'd move a planet using technology (and why it can't happen that quickly) [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oim7VvUURd8][I recommend this video.]]

There's also the issue that the staggering energy cost to move Venus /has to be paid somehow/. Given the total lifetime power output of your Superman can't even noticeably move Venus trying to use a gravity tractor isn't going to change that. Since you still need to be exerting the equal and opposite force needed to keep the massive object in the right constant position relative to Venus, which means you'd still be the one spending the energy to move it albeit indirectly.
