Ok, so, there are a few options that jump to my mind immediately.

Dumb Superman:

I can push a kilometer wide and thick asteroid. Ok. I'll assume it's also a kilometer deep for simplicity's sake. So I can move on cubic kilometer of Venus at Superman speeds.

Google says Venus is 938,000,000,000 cubic kilometers.

Google kind of says it takes between 127 seconds and 870 seconds for light from Venus to reach Earth. Let's round that to 600 seconds, call it ten minutes.

So in twenty minutes I can move a cubic kilometer of venus to the target and be back on Venus ready to go again. So 3 trips per hour, 24 hours in a day means 72 trips a day.

365 days in a year times 72 trips a day means 26280 trips a year.

So the dumb Superman plan (moving Venus one rock at a time) fails.

Factorio Superman:

One thing Superman can do is create Superman robots. A superman Robot can do basically whatever Superman can do, except fight major villains. In particular, they can carry out the Dumb Superman plan.

Superman can make Y Superman Robots (SRs) per day, and the Superman Robots each do the Dumb Superman Plan. It would take 938 billion divided by 26280 (total task divided by how much one Dumb Superman can do) Dumb Supermen to accomplish the task.

So Factorio Superman needs 35,692,545 and change Dumb Supermen Robots to accomplish the task. He has 365 days in a year, so he needs to crank out 97,787 Superman Robots a day. Round it to a hundred thousand bots a day.

Sort of. Only the ones he finishes on the first day will get a whole year's work in. The ones he finishes on the last day will get just one days work in. Averaging the whole crew, we can simplify that each robot only gets a half year's work in (some more, some less, but it works out to about a half year productivity per bot). So he has to make two hundred thousand Superman robots a day.

Beyond that, Superman Robots aren't as good as Superman. Exactly how not as good as Superman they are is more or less up to you, but I feel like we should factor in that they aren't as good as Dumb Superman at the Dumb Superman plan. if you think half, then he needs 400,000 Superman robots a day, a fifth, then it's a million a day. The roundness of that number is a compelling argument.

So Factorio Superman succeeds if he can crank out a million Superman robots in a day, more or less the assumptions baked in above. Lightspeed is super fast, and he is very strong, but is he that fast/strong?

Paperclipper Superman:

Superman Robots, of course, can do more than just carry out Dumb Superman's plan. They can, one expects, carry out Factorio Superman's plan.

The math on this involves so many assumptions that it's almost not worth doing, but basically if there was any way that Factorio Superman could ever have succeeded then Paperclipper Superman crushes it. He builds a million on day one, they each create a million on day two, and then the trillion Superman Robots move Venus on day 3 in the first hour or so.

The recursion is essentially almighty. Even if Superman can't build a million, he can only build a thousand in a day, it very much doesn't matter. If each of those thousand build a hundred, and then each of those a hundred more...you get the picture.

Paperclipper Superman succeeds under almost any values you want to put in for how long they take to do stuff.
