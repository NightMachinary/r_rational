Something for a story that's been bouncing in my head since the other day... what do you think could be a potential vulnerability of a massive AI-controlled structure (think Dyson sphere or something of that scale) that a human opponent could exploit, assuming they had a total advantage of surprise (e.g. the AI has reason to believe they are not coming at all)? I'm thinking stuff like infiltrating a main core and wreaking havoc on memory banks, CPUs, communication devices, and such. Also, normally such an AI wouldn't have a reason to have human-viable environments like pressurised cabins and corridors - but would you think it believable that they did if they were originally built by and for organic beings and thus still carried the need to make those sections as part of their core values?
