Yes... but /how/ can you do that?

Cut off communication lines between the cores? That might work for dumb terminals, but these are supposed to be smart machines - if the only thing that one can do near the other one is turn on a light, it will quickly occur to them to turn the light on and off in a binary pattern to re-establish communication.

That intelligence, of course, brings with it its own flaws - they may be smart enough to be vulnerable to /psychological/ attacks...
