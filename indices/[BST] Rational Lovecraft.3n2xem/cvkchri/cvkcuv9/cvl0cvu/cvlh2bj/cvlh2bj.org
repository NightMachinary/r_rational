Yea, I was thinking about MRI's too, haha.

The truth is that it's unlikely 4D anything would cause a psychotic break in anybody. But I need some sort of rational hook to explain the Lovecraftian insanity trope, and the idea that genuine 4D qualia are too much for a human brain to handle isn't /so/ far-fetched.

Cutouts and transparencies and slices and overlay highlights and all the other visualization techniques applied to 3D data from any source are useful, but still not really 4D. It's just projecting depth data into some other parameter, like alpha intensity. A 4D view of a brain would be able to see how translucent the various parts of the brain are, at the same time as their position in 3D space, their color, texture, etc.

That is assuming the inside of objects are lit by some 4D light source, which is something I'm surprised nobody has brought up.
