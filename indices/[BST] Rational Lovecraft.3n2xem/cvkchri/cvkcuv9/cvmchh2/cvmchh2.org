  How do we conceptualize this? Is the cube "sliced up" and arrayed so the guy can see all the slices? That's one way of looking at it, since a square area can be seen as a collection of line segments, but it's not really correct, because a 2D guy would then imagine hose line segments arrayed around him, somehow. No, he just sees right through solid objects, not as though they are transparent, but as though they aren't in the way.

This is really interesting to think about, and I think that while it wouldn't drive people insane, our minds are just not really wired to see something in 4d, so we might not really be able to understand what we're looking at when we see it.

The first important thing to realize is that we have what ends up being a relatively narrow field of vision. There is a blind spot behind our heads that we can't see in. Other animals, with eyes on the sides of their heads, lack this blind spot and can see a complete circle around them.

So lets simplify down to a hypothetical point entity that can see in any direction in 3-d space at once. Lets say its a cube, so that when flattened out, a person could see through each face on a screen with a panel for each of the six faces. Now, to see in 4-d, we add not two, not four, but eighteen, taking us up to a total of 24 total faces. These are all /directions/ perpendicular from one another. When looking into 4d, it would be akin to looking in a direction that is normally invisible, one perpendicular to all other directions.

So with 24 screens, you could see in every direction in 4d space. You would have 12 screens that would be seeing the views created by the two 3d cubes that form the hypercube, and 12 screens created by the faces of the hypercube between the two normal 3d cubes.

Would would this look like as visual data? that's getting a bit past my ability to visualize in my head, but I think you could path out light coming in from various directions around the object I defined above, and figure out what it would be like for the object to be looking at say, a tree in a field, but you might need to bust out a notebook and pen and do some visualizations to get a really clear idea. Its a starting point. Its certainly not maddening, but its definitely more sensory input then our minds are used to receiving. We can't even see in every direction around us at once. It would take some time and thinking to be able to make sense of what you'd be seeing.

As for seeing a 4-d object, we'd see a 3d slice of it. So it would start as a dot, and grow strangely in three dimensions as it passed through a point in 3-d space, then shrink again to nothing as it passed by. It would be like, suddenly, from nowhere, a point into the air bursts into a swarm of rising tentacles and articulating limbs, all seeming to grow and vanish rapidly like a flickering stop motion picture, swelling in space like a bloating tumor, a surface of all hands, claws, and tentacles and visual points, before rapidly shrinking away again to nothingness as it finally passes by.
