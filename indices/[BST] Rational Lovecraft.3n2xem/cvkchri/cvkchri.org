Well, the main problem is that 4D objects don't seem to actually drive people insane...

But! This may actually be good news, because I never got the impression that was what /caused/ the insanity in original Lovecraft. Rather, it was Cosmic Horror - the horror of finding out the Cosmos is nothing like what you imagined, and also crap.

Lovecraft protagonists go insane from the /revelation/, not AoE attacks that deal 1d6 SAN damage. Well ... except when they encounter beings with literal mind-control. Or psychedelic drugs. Or possibly the Colour. OK, so there are a few things that deal direct SAN damage.

Also ... I'm not quite sure if Azathoth and his ilk are /superintelligent/. Azathoth is the blind idiot god at the centre of all things. Superintelligence fits well into the Lovecraft mythos, but it's just another Vast Cosmic Power that humans can't hope to oppose.
