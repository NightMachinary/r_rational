As an aside, we do dimensional extrapolation on a regular basis.

Visualization is a big challenge with 3D medical imaging being displayed on a two-dimensional screen. We mainly view "slices" for CT and MRI scans for static images, but there are 3D modeling that work better for the lay public, but it usually conceals the important information. For echoing densities with ultrasound so we take one "spatula slice" for the classic view, but there are other dynamic imaging views that take movement into account like M-mode imaging (which takes a line segment of the spatula slice as the y-axis and then shows what it looks like over time along the x-axis.)

I can't wait until we have 3D holograms, because we will have a whole new axis to play with for imaging analysis.
