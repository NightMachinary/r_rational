If you want a 4d light source, simply assume that the sun emits light in 4-d not 3d. We don't see the 4d light because we don't see in 4-d. This is useful because it lets you figure out what direction the light is coming from and how it applies to create an image. Its important to note that while 4-d data is more then 3-d data, it overlaps heavily. 1/4 of it would be the same as that of a 3d entity with a perfect visual field (this is ofc assuming the 4d entity has a perfect visual field, which may not be the case. Humans don't have a perfect visual field).
