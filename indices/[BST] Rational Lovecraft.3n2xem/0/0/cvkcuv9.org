Well, we haven't encountered /actual/ 4D objects. Seeing an intersection of an actual 4D object, in real space, could be a real trip! But I think the insanity part really comes in when the poor human tries to explain to others what he's seen, and is then put in an asylum and given antipsychotics and electroshock therapy to "cure" him of his delusions.

The superintelligence bit is necessary from the perspective that you'd need a different level of cognitive tools to make sense of a 4D sensorium. Think about this: a 2D guy in 2D-land sees a square as a line segment (the front face), which is blocking his view of the back face. A 3D guy in 3D-land sees a cube as a square (the front face), which is blocking his view of the back face. He can see a whole square at once. A 4D guy in 4D-land sees a hypercube as a cube (the front face), which is blocking his view of the back face. He can see a whole /cube/ at once.

How do we conceptualize this? Is the cube "sliced up" and arrayed so the guy can see all the slices? That's one way of looking at it, since a square area can be seen as a collection of line segments, but it's not really correct, because a 2D guy would then imagine hose line segments arrayed around him, somehow. No, he just sees right through solid objects, not as though they are transparent, but /as though they aren't in the way/. The 4D rubik's cube applet that [[/u/QuantumTroll]] referred to in a comment somewhere renders the 3D faces on a 2D screen, but doesn't really help conceptualize 4D perception because you can see both the front and back faces of the hypercube at the same time, yet you can't see the fronts and backs of the /hypercube faces/ at the same time. So that's wrong, as well. Now imagine a lab assistant picks one of these squirming bodies they've been observing, and feeds it a bit of 4D qualia (somehow), without giving it the cognitive tools to process the information. /Snap!/ Another one for the looney bin.

Does this mean the 4D beings are more intelligent than us? Not necessarily. As you said, Azathoth is "the blind idiot god", so that doesn't jive well with /smarter/. As daemon sultan, I see Azathoth as possibly the lab director. He's the progenitor of all the Outer Gods because the Outer Gods are the laboratory faculty and staff. They have a typically low opinion of his scientific merits, because he's a bureaucrat and a manager, not a research scientist. Azathoth is the supreme ruler; he makes or breaks budget decisions, he hires and fires, he makes the decisions. Regardless, he does all these things in the more complex 4D universe that we know next to nothing about, so my guess is that he /is/ more intelligent in an objective sense, although to us (and perhaps also to his faculty and staff), he is a dimension of pure and absolute chaos.
