It's not, though! He didn't use math, he used the cultural associations and connotations of a particular set of mathematically definable terms in order to EVOKE emotion. If I say "he trembled as if some vast exponent forced itself digit by digit through sodium channels, and lit his neurons from within" I do not literally mean that an enormous exponent is shoving itself through his mind. I mean that he had just been exposed to an idea that's overturning some essential worldview he held. Why? Because exponentiation quickly creates numbers we cannot comprehend with our standard cognitive tools, and I'm associating the experience with something else.

Likewise with the non-Euclidean geometry. The specifics aren't important, for literature. What's important is that there are things which transcend our understanding of the world - they are alien, unpredictable, and horrifying.

Anything can be symbolic, in literature. Remember that. While rational fiction overlays another set of rules, it should not displace imagination, nor devalue the tools that our expectations of fiction are based on.
