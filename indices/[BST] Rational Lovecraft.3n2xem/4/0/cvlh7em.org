That idea sounds really fun, actually.

But yes, a rational fiction set in the mythos would be about a human trying to make sense of what's happening, which is what most of Lovecraft's stories were about. The difference is two-fold: the protagonist would go about his work in a more structured and reasonable way, with contemporary analytic techniques and modern technology, and the author needs a framework in which to cast the Old Ones and their bizarre powers (because the assumption is that they, too, are rational, but operate on different principles, for strange purposes, using otherwordly abilities).
