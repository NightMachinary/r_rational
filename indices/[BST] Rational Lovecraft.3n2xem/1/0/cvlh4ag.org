I think when writing rational fiction, it helps to have some idea what is motivating all agents in the story, and not just the protagonists. I'm not saying the reader should be /told/ about the cosmic lab, and I'm not sure a protagonist could figure it out based on the seemingly random or arbitrary actions the Old Ones take, but it helps to have a frame to guide those actions (at least to me).
