Sorry, but I hate the idea that they're doing a petri dish experiment. You could reasonably use that as your own personal understanding for why they're doing things, and keep it deep in the background, but from the perspective of the main characters their motives should be incomprehensible. Otherwise, you're not writing Lovecraft anymore. In my view, rational Lovecraft shouldn't be "let's figure out the secrets of the universe" but rather "let's figure out how to make decisions under extreme uncertainty".

Another personal interpretation might be that your characters are people inside a story book, and are being tortured for the amusement of the readers as well as the amusement of the Elder Gods.
