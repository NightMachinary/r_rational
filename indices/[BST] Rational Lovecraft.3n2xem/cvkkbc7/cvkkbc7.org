What might be interesting: What happens when a culture that can access 4d space mechanically but not biologically without going insane meets a culture that can access 4d space biologically but not mechanically due to not having the tech level.

Also, imagine the universe as a 3D surface on a 4d shape, like a map is a 2d surface overlaid on a 3D object. What happens when the bacteria discover a new axis to move on, that they can use to crawl "up"?
