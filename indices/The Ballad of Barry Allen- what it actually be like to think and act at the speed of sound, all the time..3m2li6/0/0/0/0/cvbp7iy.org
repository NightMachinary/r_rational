That's an excellent comparison, and I hadn't thought about that before.

My best 'theory' for the environmental effects (or lack thereof) is that as he increases in speed, he becomes more and more incorporeal, less and less dense. He begins passing through the matter instead of interacting with it- he's not starting nuclear explosions by running into air at 90% the speed of light because he's literally not interacting with the air at all, just going 'around' it. This doesn't explain why the ground doesn't explode with each footstep, but I like to incorporate the theory that Flash doesn't need to run, he could fly if he wanted to, it's just a mental block. He's more gliding than running. This would also explain how he's able to build up such speed in a straight line so consistently, despite the terrain changing wildly- it doesn't matter if he runs over rubble or ice, he doesn't really need the footing anyways. This also works in his "phasing in and out of stuff" power, as that's a more applied tactic of the aforementioned power.

This at least keeps the Speed Force localized for Flash instead of constantly altering everything around him.

The Speed Force keeps his structure consistent because...Speed Force. That at least feels slightly less hand-wavy than the Speed Force constantly altering the nature/velocity of everything in his vicinity.
