Really enjoyed the song. Often better to think of speedster as if the world slowed down by 300x rather than they speed up. Do any stories deal with the age implications of that though? Presumably you metabolise that quick too.

A band-aid for the song guy loneliness is asynchronous communication like the Internet or writing.
