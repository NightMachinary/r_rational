"There is a man who moves so fast that his life is an endless gallery of statues..."

--Alan Moore on the Flash

The song strongly evokes that quote, for me. The quote was also my inspiration for creating Flicker in [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents][The Fall of Doc Future]] and the sequels, mentioned elsewhere in this thread.
