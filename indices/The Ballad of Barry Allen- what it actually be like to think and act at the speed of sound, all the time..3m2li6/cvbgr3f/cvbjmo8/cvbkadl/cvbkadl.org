Very true. Before you even get to this being a problem you need things like the ability to not have his skin be ripped off his body by the air resistance and not break every bone in his leg every time there's a step. And then there's the whole sonic boom situation. He should be leaving a trail of rubble every time he goes anywhere close to full speed.

I've always thought this was a good way to distinguish the Flash and Superman. Both can move super-quickly, but you can say that Superman just does it in a more normal way, by just applying tons of force, and being invincible enough to survive, while the Flash has this special 'speed force' deal that allows him to do a more intuitive but less actually realistic version of super-speed.
