I didn't see the first version, but that works great thematically. Right at the end of the section when he faints seeing the mass of fur. Very much adds to the hilarity of the moment. Sets precedent for future illustrations too.

Liking the triangle theme of the title as well. Looks nice and minimalistic. Consider changing “Book One: Re- / Chapter One: Re-Awakening” to a slightly lighter shade of blue though. Maybe colour #0162e1 ? It looked alright in photoshop when I messed around with a screenshot of yours..

If you're looking into heading font choices, Tahoma, Cambria or Georgia could go well with the Calibri body text. It's fine as it is though. And for some reason authors I find always use a very dark shade of grey like #0f0f0f instead of plain black. Must be an aesthetic thing.

Oh, I found [[http://www.fount.artequalswork.com/][this bookmarklet]] the other day. Something if you wanted to identify font structures in places that particularly caught your eye. Hope you find it useful.
