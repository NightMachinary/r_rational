You're not the only one who's suggested lightening the title; so I have.

For fonts, I've used [[http://cssfontstack.com/][this list]] as listing fonts that are most likely to exist on a user's system, sorted by [[http://practicaltypography.com/system-fonts.html][this list]] for which are to be preferred; and at least for the moment, am trying out Cambria for the headers (with Georgia as a fallback).
