I like it so far. Butterick is a fantastic source, and it's good to see someone else using it. But about that picture at the top ... Does it really belong at the top? Or does another picture work? I know it's relevant (sorta), but not gonna lie, when I saw it my first reaction was to roll my eyes and move to close the tab. It was only when I saw the url that I stopped and scrolled.

Or maybe I'm just unfairly prejudiced against furries, or something. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/LessWrongLounge/comments/2itef3/time_for_spiders_freedom_of_identity/][I'll review my biases.]]
