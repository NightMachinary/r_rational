Dark blue text on a black background (your chapter titles) is generally inadvisable. When I'm reading a story, I tend to prefer dark text on a lighter background, but there are plenty of scripts that will allow people to have the option.

I'm glad that you don't have the nude furry picture at the top of the page. I might hide the picture by default and have a "click here to see NSFW picture" where the picture should go in the text, and have some javascript show the picture.

For typography, /please do/ use hyphens, em-, and en-dashes correctly. If you use a hyphen where an em-dash should be, on first read-through I will often read it as a hyphenated word, and it will take me a moment to realize that there should be a break in the sentence---confusing!

[[http://alistapart.com/article/emen/#section5][Here's a good reference on the different types of dashes]]

I prefer to write in pandoc-styled markdown, then use the cross-platform, free, and absolutely amazing [[http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/][pandoc]] utility to convert to [[http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html][practically any format under the sun]], including html and epub. Pandoc even supports custom templates for all of its output file formats!

When using pandoc, I use the =-S= (uppercase S) or =--smart= flags (they're the same) which:

#+begin_quote
  Produce typographically correct output, converting straight quotes to curly quotes, --- to em-dashes, -- to en-dashes, and ... to ellipses.
#+end_quote

Writing in markdown means writing in plaintext, which means that I am not tied to a proprietary or closed-source application. It's safer even than ODF in that I expect computers will still be able to read the same =.txt= file 10 years from now, with no loss of fidelity! I can also manage my story through source control such as git, out of which I get versions and (free) backups through github if I want them.

Anyway, that's my advice---thanks for writing!
