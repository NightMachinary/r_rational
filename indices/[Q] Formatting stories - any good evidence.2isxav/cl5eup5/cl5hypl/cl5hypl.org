#+begin_quote
  I might hide the picture by default
#+end_quote

I find myself somewhat reluctant to require the reader to do anything but page-down through the text, and click on 'next page' links. I've used PICS to add content warnings that the picture contains artistic/tasteful nudity, so anyone who's set their browser to filter out such material won't see the image.

#+begin_quote
  please do use hyphens, em-, and en-dashes correctly.
#+end_quote

There seems to be a certain amount of disagreement about what 'correctly' means, but I think I've worked out a reasonable compromise for most instances. Hyphens for word-joining - and a thinspace, em-dash, thinspace combo for parenthetical dashes. At least in the first chapter, I don't think I found any instances of en-dashes. (And I'm using the ellipsis character instead of three periods, left and right curly quotes for speech, ordinary apostrophes inside words but curly apostrophes for quoted text.)

#+begin_quote
  writing in plaintext
#+end_quote

That's what I do, already. :) (A few decades of doing so is why I instinctively write italics like /this/.) I'm probably just going to manually convert to HTML - once I've worked out which HTML tags to actually /use/, it's not hard to rock my fingers back and forth through a set of search-and-replaces (such as greater-than followed by quotes into left double-quotes; space followed by quotes into left double-quotes; and the remaining double-quotes into right double-quotes), and it's something I can do while a distracting TV keeps me from doing any creative writing.

(Not that I object to automation, either; but from what I've managed to read of pandoc's documentation so far, there doesn't seem to be an easy way to turn a text file containing ten chapters into ten HTML files based on the format I'm establishing in my 01-01.html test-file. With my current level of knowledge, it looks like it'll be easier to manually generate the HTML than learn whatever scripting language would be used to automate the conversion.)
