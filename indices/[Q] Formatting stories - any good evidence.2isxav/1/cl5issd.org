Butterick's advice about buying your own font seems weird to me. Especially, since he is selling fonts himself. I never saw the need to buy a font. There is nothing wrong with standard fonts.

In your concrete case, I'd say increase line-height or decrease the width of lines. Are lines like "First Awakening" considered section titles? Then you should style them somewhat differently than the main text. Maybe center or right align or italic.
