The only other image I have that's suitable for the beginning is [[http://www.datapacrat.com/SI/SI-cover-page.png]] , which I'm planning on putting on the index/table-of-contents page instead of the first chapter.

I could certainly move the image down a few sections, such as to shortly after the brain transplant, if having it at the /very/ start is that off-putting.
