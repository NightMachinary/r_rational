Are you sure? My personal experience is the opposite. Thinking about it, much of my computing time is spent in shaded or darkened rooms, which might not reflect most users' experience; but I'm reluctant to make the page less readable to myself, the authour.

I might eventually go looking for some sort of CSS style switcher to flip between light and dark, though such a thing is currently beyond my abilities.

(On a somewhat related note, I've tidied up the story's main page, at [[http://www.datapacrat.com/SI/index.html]] , a bit, at least compared to the initial ugly placeholder page.)
