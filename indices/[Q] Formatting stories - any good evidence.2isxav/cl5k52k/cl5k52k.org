Take a look at [[http://readable.tastefulwords.com/]] - I just use it with the default options. If you make it similar to that, you won't go wrong.

If the font size is large enough, I think serif fonts win over sans-serif - the main reason to use sans-serif fonts is that they do better at small sizes, which is what you often have on a screen, but I can see that you have made the font quite large (which is good).

Dark gray text on a light gray background is good for reading on screens - it's less bright and constrast-y than black on white. White on black isn't the worst you could do, but it does start to strain the eyes after a while.
