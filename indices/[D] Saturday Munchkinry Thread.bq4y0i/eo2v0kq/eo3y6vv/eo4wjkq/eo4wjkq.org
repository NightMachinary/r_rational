  If the gravitons are emitted at once, you have an implosion on your hands.

Yep. For a fleeting moment, the surrounds are attracted to the thing as if it masses more than it does.

  #+begin_quote
    The gravitons diffuse through the object, and after a short pause are emitted uniformly from the object. In essence, you can increase an object's apparent mass. The gravitons are emitted from the surface of the object; the object is not affected by its apparent increase in mass.

  By shaping the object like a fractal on one side, can you increase the surface there to emit most of the gravitons in that direction? Then you'd have mostly a gun instead of a bomb.

This is poorly worded on my part; what I'm aiming for here is that the object's apparent mass increases but the object is not affected by the increase in its own mass.

Perhaps "the gravitons are emitted at the surface, with the same dispersal pattern as if the object was emitting those gravitons from its own mass." as an improved wording? It's not supposed to be a graser or gravy gun.
