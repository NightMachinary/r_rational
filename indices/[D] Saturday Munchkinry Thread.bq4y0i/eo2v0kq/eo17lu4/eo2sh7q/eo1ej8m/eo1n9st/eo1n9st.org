Does this mean miracle healing for real life? As in, you can go and find 20 terminally ill patients with incurable diseases, and wish for all of them to be completely healthy again?

If so, this is probably the fastest way to make money (since the other wish is limited to 25000 gp, whatever that translates to in terms of actual money). Advertise your miracle healing abilities, and the rich will pay you incalculable amounts of money to heal them.

  You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.

On the other hand, this might be extremely exploitable, depending on how the value of an object is determined. What is the value of a friendly AGI? Its code almost certainly can fit within 300 feet of pure computer memory. It seems likely to be ridiculously expensive, but what if you sabotage it somehow in a way that only you can fix? Make it so that the code is encrypted and only you have the key, so to anyone else, this code is completely useless and has no value. Would you be able to wish it into existence then?
