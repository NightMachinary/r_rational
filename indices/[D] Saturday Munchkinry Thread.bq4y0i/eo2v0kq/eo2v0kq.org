Posit that gravity is transmitted by particles called gravitons. Rather than being affected by the pull of gravity, you can absorb gravitons and hold them in an internal reservoir of a limited size. Gravitons that you hold in this reservoir have no external effects. You can easily float and fly by absorbing the majority of gravitons hitting your body. You can reduce your weight by a fraction or completely. It's up to you.

The other side of this power is what happens as the reservoir fills. When it's full, you can't absorb any more. At any time, you can release the gravitons from your reservoir, but it's an all-or-nothing thing. You can only dump all the gravitons in your reservoir.

When you dump gravitons, you choose a solid object that you are touching and pump gravitons into it. The gravitons diffuse through the object, and after a short pause are emitted uniformly from the object. In essence, you can increase an object's apparent mass. The gravitons are emitted from the surface of the object; the object is not affected by its apparent increase in mass. Everything else in the vicinity is.

I'm trying to avoid HPMOR-style conceptual hacking that would allow Partial Infusion, but I don't know how to work around that definition.

I'm also not sure how fast graviton absorption scales, or what the practical effects of this infusion would be. I haven't done the math.
