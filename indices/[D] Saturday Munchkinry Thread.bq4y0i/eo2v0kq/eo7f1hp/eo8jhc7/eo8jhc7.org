I'd say the increase in the object's apparent mass would be proportional to the amount of gravitons dumped into the object. If you absorb all gravitons hitting you for 1 second, and you mass 100 kg, you'd impart 100 kilogram-seconds of gravitons into the object, and its apparent mass would increase by that much. Absorb for 10 seconds, and you'd impart 1000 kilogram-seconds of gravitons.

Speaking Doylistically, there's several options for how the imparted gravitons are diffused:

- at the rate at which they were acquired, so that absorbing 100 kg worth of gravitons for 10 seconds results in a 100kg apparent-mass increase for 10 seconds
- in one second, so that those 1000 kg-seconds of gravitons result in 1000kg apparent-mass increase for 1 second
- instantaneously, so that for the briefest of moments everything in sight is drawn towards this object, which outmasses the Sun
- over a duration of the power-user's control, letting 1000kg-seconds be diffused for a thousand seconds or for a microsecond.

For a power, I think the better option would be for the user to choose.

The reservoir does come with a sense of fullness, like a normal human bladder does.

  Given an initially completely empty reservoir, how long can you fly before your reservoir is full?

This, I'm not sure of. Again speaking Doylistically, the limit on flight time would be the bounds of what amount of kilogram-seconds would not be Earth-shatteringly overpowered to dump into an object. I'm aiming for something on the order of "terrifying, but not an existential threat", at least for this arc of the character.
