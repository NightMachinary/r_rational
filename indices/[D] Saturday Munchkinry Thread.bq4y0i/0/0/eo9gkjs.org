You could easily extend your reserves by carrying a bag of marbles or something. Just flush your gravitons into a marble and throw it away.

Also, can you "shield" an item from gravity? If you hold a ball in your hand, and start absorbing gravitons, does the ball float because you're blocking gravitons from reaching it?

Another fun thing to try would be repeatedly dumping gravitons into the same item, faster than it can emit them. This would get you an arbitrarily large gravitational field, which you can then aim by selectively absorbing gravitons on one side.

You can probably resolve the "what's an object?" question by making it based on the density of what you're pushing stuff into. Gravitons diffuse more easily through dense stuff, so you can treat two bricks stuck together with mortar as "an object", but if you simply tie two bricks together with string you'd have trouble charging them both, and trying to charge up individual air molecules is right out.
