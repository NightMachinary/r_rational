  You could easily extend your reserves by carrying a bag of marbles or something. Just flush your gravitons into a marble and throw it away.

This is brilliant, and there'll also be a few one-ton marbles.

``` 1000kg / (1 cm diameter sphere) = 1000kg / 0.523599 cubic centimeters = 1909.86 kilograms per cubic centimeter =

≈ (9×10^{-10} to 2×10^{-8)} × neutron star density ( 8×10^{13} to 2×10^{15} g/cm^{3} ) ≈ (0.2 to 190.9) × density of a white dwarf ( 10000 to 1×10^{7} g/cm^{3} ) ≈ 1×10^{8} × mean density inside the Schwarzschild radius of a supermassive black hole (≈ 20 kg/m^{3} ) ```

which is going to punch straight through most surfaces if dropped from any appreciable height, and probably deafen most people in the vicinity.

  And then there was a distant sound, like a tiny 'tink' noise coming from far away. Like a very loud sound coming from the second-to-lowest floor, say.

  Amelia looked at Dumbledore before she realized, before she managed to stop herself.

  The old wizard shrugged, gave her a small smile, said, "Since you asked it, Amelia," and went off yet again.

  Also, can you "shield" an item from gravity? If you hold a ball in your hand, and start absorbing gravitons, does the ball float because you're blocking gravitons from reaching it?
#+end_quote

Hadn't considered this; I'm going to say that the absorption field can be extended to things you're carrying, but no more than your full weight. Clothes and bags worn on your person count against that weight.

  Another fun thing to try would be repeatedly dumping gravitons into the same item, faster than it can emit them. This would get you an arbitrarily large gravitational field, which you can then aim by selectively absorbing gravitons on one side.
#+end_quote

The power is not directional; it's just a percentage how many gravitons you absorb.
