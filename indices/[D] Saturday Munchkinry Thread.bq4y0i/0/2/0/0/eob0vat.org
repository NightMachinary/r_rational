Hmmm. Okay, here's some thoughts, then.

Assume that the graviton-bladder allows for at least a thousand kilogram-seconds of gravitons (and the person is 100kg) for simplicity of calculation. Then he can fly for ten seconds before he has to release all of those gravitons again.

This is plenty.

First of all, he's not doing Superman flight. No matter how fancy he gets with taking gravitons from only one direction, the only body in his vicinity capable of attracting him with significant force is the planet Earth - which means he can only use his power to accelerate one way, and that way is /down/. In order to move laterally, he needs to either push off against something or have some sort of propulsion mechanism (like a battery-operated desk fan). He can make truly /astounding/ jumps (in terms of distance, not speed), but he's not going to be racing against cars anytime soon. (Well, he can try to race, but he won't win unless traffic conditions are truly terrible).

So. What else can he do? Firstly, he can easily make a long jump that lasts more then ten seconds - he just needs a handful of rice or confetti or something similar, dropping a piece every time his graviton bladder gets full.

Running out of confetti will be trouble, though. He might need to start kicking off his shoes.

And he can smash through basically anything. Imagine that he takes a coin and flings at at his target; but the moment before he releases the coin, he dumps a full 100kg of mass for ten seconds into it. That coin will strike with a full 100kg of mass (plus its own, comparatively negligible weight) but with a contact area that is /tiny/; meaning that in terms of pressure per square millimetre, well, that coin would probably embed itself into a steel door. And not just coins - anything with a small striking area (darts, credit cards, pencils) can be turned into a Deadly Missile of Doom... and ten seconds later, he can be ready to go again.
