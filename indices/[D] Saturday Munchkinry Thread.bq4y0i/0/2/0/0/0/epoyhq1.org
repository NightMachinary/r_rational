I like where you're going with the thrown projectiles, but they'd have the same problem that the M16 was meant to solve. A 1000-kg marble traveling at 100km/h impacting over a square centimeter in 1/10 of a second exerts 278000 kg/cm, which punches straight through the target. It has no stopping power, only hole-making power.
