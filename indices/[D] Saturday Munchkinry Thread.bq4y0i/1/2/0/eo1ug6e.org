I am not certain, but I believe that in order to wish for an item you have to specify the items characteristics, not its results. So you could wish for "a copy of this key in my hand", because you have a key in your hand that is uniquely specified by your wish, but a wish for "a key that will open the next door that I try to use it on" would likely fail unless the wish spell somehow invokes divination magic to see into the future. It can make a key with any particular shape you want, but you have to actually choose a shape.

Which means you can copy things and probably mix and match properties together, but won't be able to invent things with it. If you had a friendly AGI then you could wish for a copy of it. If you had instructions for a friendly AGI then you could wish for a machine that follows those instructions. But if you don't know how to make a friendly AGI then you don't know how to wish for one, as the words "friendly AGI" are not a primitive object that the wish spell knows how to make.
