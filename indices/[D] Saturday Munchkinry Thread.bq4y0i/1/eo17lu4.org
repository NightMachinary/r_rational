You may cast one [[https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Wish][Wish]] spell each year on January 1. If you don't cast it by 12:00am on the 2nd, you lose your wish for the year.

How do you use this to attain your CEV? Do you ever risk using a non-standard Wish and permanently losing this ability? What 8th-level spells would you most often replicate, assuming you're not just hoarding money every year (which is a reasonable approach as long as you can launder it)?
