Starting with perma-spells is an excellent idea. I think Clone is a great choice for Year 1, and I might go with Simulacrum for Year 2. I'll rule that your double does inherit the Wish, but as it cannot regain spell slots it only has one to use. Still, basically a free extra body, since you get another Wish this year only (use it for Awaken, the most powerful of the Familiar-type spells).

Year 3 is Planar Ally, with the task of "help me attain my CEV." I don't think I'd be quite as worried as you about potential disaster there, since as written the entity can at worst refuse the order and vanish. You might want to save this one until you can offer the angel something really tasty as payment, perhaps the promise of letting it dictate a Wish once the task is complete and post-scarcity negentropic utopia is achieved?

I'll also rule that any of the "standard" non-spell uses can be produced without the enormous downsides, since most or all of those things can be reproduced by spells anyway. Call them beefed-up Fabricate/Heal/Greater Restoration/etc. Under this ruling, granting yourself and nine friends resistance to at least b/p/s damage seems like a solid use of 3 years, preferably before you do anything that draws /too/ much attention.
