- Clone - grow a dormant clone of yourself that will receive your soul and resurrect you if you die. Clone can be of any desired age. Takes 120 days to mature the clone, but seems worth it to me, if only on utilitarian grounds so humanity doesn't lose the wish power.

- Awaken, Find Familiar, Find Steed - a permanent and demonstrably magical, if not particularly powerful, pet.

- Finger of Death - kill someone (no save possible for a baseline human) and turn them into a zombie permanently under your control. If used on someone powerful (and evil, ideally) could probably be used for shenanigans. Plus you gain a (creepy) magical pet for demonstrating your powers are real, as above.

- Modify Memory - a more flexible (and ethical) way to permanently subvert some powerful individual. Has a chance of failure, however (WIS saving throw and you need to pick a persuasive memory.)

- Plane shift, teleport - visit other dimensions or planets/galaxies. Not the lowest-hanging fruit, but at a later stage worth doing for the information on what's out there. No way back (Gate is lvl 9), so you'll need to pack enough for a year or spend a clone.

- Simulacrum - create a near-perfect, magically loyal copy of yourself (they might even inherit the wish power!) or someone that you've kidnapped. (Or an ally, I guess.) Takes twelve hours and the target needs to be in your company the whole time.

- Magic Jar - become a vase with the power to possess people. Lasts indefinitely, until the vase is broken or you willingly possess your old (comatose) body.

- Planar Ally - summon a very powerful angel. It's not magically loyal to you, but /theoretically/ this shouldn't matter since it'll be inherently Good. In practice, should probably test this one somewhere safe, like the Andromeda galaxy.

- Major Image - cast at 6th level, you gain the permanent ability to create a single illusion. (Max size 20' cube, range 120', you can reshape the illusion at will.)

- Summoning spells generally last for an hour as long as you can maintain concentration. (easy in DnD, especially outside combat.) Within that hour, you can get some loyal, blatantly magical, fairly powerful spellcaster monsters. More bang for your buck in terms of number of spells.

  - Conjure Woodland Beings: Summon a number of creatures, of your choice, for an hour. They're magically friendly and most of the options are spellcasters. Cast at level 8 you get 3x as many summons as default (especially useful for Sea Hags, who need to be a trio to be able to cast.)
  - Summon Greater Demon: This /would/ be the best option, but unfortunately it's from Xanathar's Guide To Everything, which might not be canon. Not only would it risk losing the power, you really don't want a DM-guided "evil genie" take on this spell in particular.
  - Conjure Celestial - summon a friendly Coatl for an hour. (Although beware, RAW the DM might choose to give you a useless Pegasus instead.) The Coatl is INT 18, so it can give good advice. It can also change shape at will, and can cast the following as a lvl 14 Cleric:

#+begin_quote
  At will: Detect Evil and Good, Detect Magic, Detect Thoughts

  3/day each: bless, Create Food and Water, Cure Wounds, Lesser Restoration, Protection from Poison, Sanctuary, Shield

  1/day each: dream, Greater Restoration, Scrying

Edit: Am I reading this right?

#+begin_quote
  The stress of casting this spell to produce *any effect other than duplicating another spell* weakens you [...] your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend Resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.

This seems to make the "standard" uses, like producing money and healing people, terrible choices. I guess the DM isn't encouraged to rules-lawyer you on them, but honestly this seems worse than being monkey's paw-ed.
