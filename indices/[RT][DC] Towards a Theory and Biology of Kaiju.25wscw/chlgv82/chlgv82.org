Old one, but a good one. The proposed mechanisms for how Kaiju actually work are of course ridiculous. But the ending, where it begins talking about how to /exploit/ the kaiju for a hyper-industrial revolution, /that/ is munchkinism at its finest.

I think this kinda invites a framework for a Rational!Godzilla fic, maybe from the perspective of a scientist trying to boost humanity to a hyperculture, and all the interstellar/intertemporal politicking and backstabbing and giant-monster-fighting that'd entail.
