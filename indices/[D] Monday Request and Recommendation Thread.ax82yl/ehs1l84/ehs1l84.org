[[https://captaingames.itch.io/freeways][/Freeways/]] is an extremely fun game, in which the player designs highway interchanges and is scored based on (1) the average speed of traversing vehicles, (2) the amount of concrete used in construction (affected by how much roadway is present and whether the roadway is at low, medium, or high elevation), and (3) the complexity of the interchange (as measured by an algorithm that is opaque to the player). The player has a limited (but usually fairly generous) amount of concrete to complete each puzzle. Traffic inputs and outputs are not limited to the edge of the map, but may take the form of rectangles inside the map.

The game definitely isn't perfect: the lack of an undo button or an erase tool forces the player to delete the entire interchange and start the puzzle over if he makes a mistake; a long play session will leave the player's wrist aching from constantly holding down the left mouse button for the "draw roadway" function, which can't be rebound to the keyboard (compare /Minecraft/, where the "mine" function /can/ be rebound to the keyboard); and vehicles occasionally will block each other when transitioning between elevation levels when it seems they shouldn't do so. However, at $4 for a DRM-free purchase, it's a steal!
