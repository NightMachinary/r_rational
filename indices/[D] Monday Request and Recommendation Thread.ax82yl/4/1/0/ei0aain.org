Yeah. The first chapters are a little fast-paced and assume that you're already familiar with the setting, but at no point does the plot become impossible to follow if you haven't read the originals.

(well, the oatmeal reveal is a little weird if you haven't read the original, but whatever)

Plus, the basic concept is pretty straightforward to begin with: evil mind-control aliens are invading, friendly alien gives superpowers to a bunch of kids to fight them.
