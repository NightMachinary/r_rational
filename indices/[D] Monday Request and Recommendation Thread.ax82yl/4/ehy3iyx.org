Reminder: just because [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5627803/chapters/12963046][Animorphs: The Reckoning]] hasn't updated in a while doesn't mean it's not mandatory reading for every [[/r/rational][r/rational]] member anymore.

There /will/ be random /The Reckoning/ quizzes. Anyone who fails them /will/ be brutally terminated. You have been warned.

Anyway, there have been a few new fics popping up here lately. Are any of them good?
