I was recently in the mood for some rational romance and finally got around to checking out [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/aqwvxm/d_the_oops_better_late_than_never_romance_in/][the Valentine's r!romance thread]]. [[/u/JanusTheDoorman]] had an interesting take on why r!romance is scarce, though I don't agree that utility maximizing motivations are "inhuman" or necessarily antithetical to pursuing (emotional) satisfaction. Plus, characters like that are pretty much by definition unsatisfied with some aspect of society's status quo, but they might have a soft spot or blindspot for some social institutions.

All this is to say that I think I've got the perfect recommendation for JanusTheDoorman's request at the end:

  It'd be interesting to see a rational fiction written about a protagonist who is rational and exacting in pursuit of their goals, but those goals are selfish and amoral - a satisfying love life, high status, power and resources,

You might know the author from his community artwork or from his previous Worm fanfiction, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/tabloid-worm-artfic-%E2%80%94-complete.455278/][Tabloid]], one of the best rational explorations of day-to-day cape life. I don't want to spoil anything, so let's just say Tom Riddle is a shoo-in for the selfish, amoral, rational protagonist award in this coming-of-age AU.

P.S. Great scene setting for 1930-1940s England too.
