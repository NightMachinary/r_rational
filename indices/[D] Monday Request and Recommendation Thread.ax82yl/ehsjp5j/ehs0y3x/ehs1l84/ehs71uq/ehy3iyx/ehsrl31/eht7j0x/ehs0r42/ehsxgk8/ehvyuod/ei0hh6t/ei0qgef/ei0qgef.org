If you were into the comedy aspect, the aptly named [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]] is one of my favorites.

I also really like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]], though the protagonist and writing can be hit and miss for some people.
