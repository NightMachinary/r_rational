The Pureblood Pretense series by murkybluematter is very good. It's AU. James and Lily give birth to a girl named Harriet who at 11 chooses to masquerade as her male "cousin", Archie Black, to attend a Hogwarts that non-Purebloods are banned from attending due to the machinations of highly successful politician Tom Riddle.

One of the main draws is that Harriet is a potions nerd and the author devotes a lot of attention to plausible academic theories and practical challenges of the subject. It doesn't take a Brandon Sanderson approach of describing all the rules in advance, but it makes you feel like there's real scientific intellectual work going on just out of sight. This is the best described magic in HP fanfic I can recall seeing.

Lots of stories have prodigies who seem more like idiots. This one has a prodigy who is genuinely smart, so it's very fun.
