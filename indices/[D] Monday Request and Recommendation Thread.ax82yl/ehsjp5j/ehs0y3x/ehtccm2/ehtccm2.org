This is fantastic so far. Great prose and the author's done a great job of finding the characters voices.

That the story begins in the orphanage, with barely a hint of the fantastical, and i'm not the least bit waiting for magic and Hogwarts to enter the scene because i'm already enjoying it so much, speaks a lot of the story for me.
