Never came across one, nor have I looked for that premise. It seems pretty darn hard to find a good one, since there's much less canonical material to work with during Dumbledore's 19th century school years. Also it'll probably be slash, which shares the same kind of fanfic stigma as pairing fics.

However, I assume you're at least partially interested to see the life and times of a genius in Hogwarts, so all I've got is another very canonically plausible Dumbledore during Riddle's school years. Probably my favorite depiction of Dumbledore in fanfiction, though the protagonist is still Tom.
