*recommendation*

I would like to recommend [[/r/JumpChain][r/JumpChain]] specifically their [[https://www.reddit.com/r/JumpChain/comments/58wjvc/relevant_jumpchain_links_jumps_builds_etc/][jump link page]] that has a huge list of CYOA's for various different fictions.

The premise of jump chain is that every ten years you go to new a fictional world and get to select perks and disadvantages, baced on a pre made CYOA document, for that world. As you can imagine, after a few 'jumps' if you are picking perks intelligently, your character becomes an unstoppable God and it ceases to be a challenge.

If you only take jumps on there own, or impose challenges on yourself, it can be a stimulating mental exorcise to maximize your odds of survivel. I enjoy balancing the perks and drawbacks to get the most power with the least risk and I find it fun to look at a jump after I have finished a series.

*request*

I have come to despise nigh omniscient characters in fiction as all the examples of them being used I have seen tend to cause plot holes when the don't take the actions they should to achieve there goal. Or worse were added to cover up plot holes in the worse possible way. Infinity War, Worm and The last god kubra are all examples of this to some extent.

Dose anyone have a recommendation for something containing a nigh omniscient (or something like that) used well?

EDIT: spelling.
