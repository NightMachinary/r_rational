The aesthetic is somewhat close to it. Characters are fairly smart, have reasonable beliefs, and mostly act based on their incentives, biases and personality. It's all very cartoonish and exaggerated (eg, it's the kind of story where the protagonists would start looking for a spy in a dinner party, except it turns out /everyone/ at the party is a spy for a different government organization), but within the bounds of the medium everyone's decision and personality makes sense.

Also, the aesthetic is pretty rational-like. This is the kind of story where the villains often say "Screw this, let's play it safe" and immediately shoots James Bond; where the protagonists will say "You know what, let's make a backup of the Giant Evil Portal Disruptor, just in case the first one fails", and otherwise makes fun of similar adventure story tropes.
