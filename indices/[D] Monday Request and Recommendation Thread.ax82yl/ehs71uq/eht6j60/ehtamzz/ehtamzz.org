It's not.

I really like girlgenius, and I second the recommendation, it's a fun action-adventure with a complex plot and fun characters, but it isn't rational.

Off the top of my head, I can't recall anybody holding the idiot ball, but the workings of the spark are pretty opaque so you never know what's actually possible. Rationality-wise, the best that can be said is that one of the main antagonists is really well-written, coming into conflict with the protagonist out of his justified belief that it's necessary for maintaining peace in his territory.
