[[http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0001.html][Order of The Stick]] has a pretty big 'what the hell hero' moment. It's a webcomic set in a DnD setting were the fourth wall has been battered to the point the characters talk about the game mechanics of the universe all the time.

[[https://fanfiction.net/s/5536346/1/Inviolate][Inviolate]] is a fan fix staring lex Luther and has him end up fighting against a world wide conspiracy. It start off really good but gradually gets worse over time untill I just strudled to read any more around chapter 14. I would recommend reading the first chapter as a one shot.
