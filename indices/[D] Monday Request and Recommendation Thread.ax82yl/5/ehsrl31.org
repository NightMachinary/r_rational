I'm looking for something with an anti-hero or retired villain protagonist. The kind of person who gets the job done in the most efficient possible way, even if it's incredibly brutal, often to the shock of the more 'heroic' characters. Bonus points for [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero][What the Hell Hero?]] moments, when the 'heroic' character(s) are actually causing more problems than they solve.

I would also be interested in villain protagonists who put villainy on hold to deal with a problem that the heroes are too stupid to see/don't see as a problem, like [[https://fictionhub.io/story/the-metropolitan-man/][The Metropolitan Man]]
