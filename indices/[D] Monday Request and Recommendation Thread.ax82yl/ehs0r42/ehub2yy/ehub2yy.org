I have a list of stories that I keep which involve characters dealing with romance and sex in intelligent and reasonable ways (even if they don't necessarily do the same outside of relationships). Most of the linked stories have sex scenes, but not all of them are pornographic. Also, I posted nearly the exact same list to the previous Valentine's Day Thread.

I'm too lazy to write up summaries for each rec, so I'm just copy-pasting the summary descriptions even if they aren't the best.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/conduit-rwby.6471/][Condiut]] [RWBY][NSFW] - Come for the kinky spirit sex and cool powers, stay for the responsible approach to polygamous relationships and deep philosophical dilemmas!

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/amelia-worm-au.916/][Amelia]] [Worm AU] - Amy Dallon is pushed by the S9, hard enough to actually *fight back*. From there, things diverge from canon.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-sins-of-cinnamon.7774/][The Sins of Cinnamon]] [Original Fiction][NSFW] - Everyone is born with a birth class and a gift, and everyone with a particularly dangerous class gets monitored and registered. Everyone gets a career class once they start working, but Artificer became more popular than Adventurer years ago. There are dungeons, but they've been sealed. There are dragons, but they were nearly hunted to extinction and now the nature preserves are well guarded. Prostitution isn't illegal, which is good, because Cinnamon Wallace likes being open about who and what she is. The gods left the world years ago, it is said that they will never return, not until all the world is dust, and the stars rain like fire from the sky. And so, when an Oracle prophesied that Cinnamon Wallace would one day meet a god, and be judged for her sins, the Oracle's words were dismissed. Surely, if the world was going to end, someone else would have also foreseen it?

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/monstergirlcity-ace-detective.3154/][Monster Girl City: Ace Detective]] [Monster Girl Quest][NSFW] - You are Monstergirlcity's only human woman and detective, the legendary Ace. What bizarre mystery will you face? Here's a [[https://fiction.live/stories/monstergirlcity-ace-detective/ozWAGdPAACtkX4dJ5][link]] to the original site for the story.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/a-rousing-rebirth-veilfall-original.5813/][A Rousing Rebirth]] [Original Fiction][NSFW] - /A Rousing Rebirth/ is the story of two magical girls and their origins, their adventures, and their intimate lives, in a near-future alternate history which presents them with challenges both familiar and exotic.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11508537/chapters/25824003][My Completely Normal Parahuman: Tantric is Magic]] [Worm][NSFW] - Being a Tantric Witch is harder than you think. First, dealing with the fact that you got it from your mother. Second, the trauma from finding the ten pounds of anal beads in the back of her wardrobe confirming that you got it from your mother. Third, it's pretty hard to be a hero when your power comes from sex, lust, and rock'n'rollin the boat. The fourth and most difficult part about the whole thing though? My name is Taylor Hebert... and I look like a fucking stripper.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/battle-action-harem-highschool-side-character-quest-no-sv-you-are-the-waifu.15335/][Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest (No SV, you are the Waifu)]] [Original Fiction] - So, after seeing too many harem series, I made a quest. A lot of IS and it's innumerable derivatives, a lot of Muv-Luv (very Ironic I know), a lot of Knight Run, some Sentou Yousei Yukikaze, mixed together with my personal antipathy for harem series, we get this. Battle-Action-Harem-Highschool... Side Character Quest. No Sufficient Velocity. You */are/* the waifu.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/][Erogamer]] [Gamer][NSFW] - The story of a human being who one day saw a status screen displaying her BOD, LST, SED, FUK, PRV, and ERO. "This is more depth than I was expecting with my porn quest." --- all of the readers. This is way more depth than I was expecting with my porn quest, even taking the previous statement into account." --- Sirrocco

[[https://www.asstr.org/%7EA_Strange_Geek/novels/PilferedPrincess/][The Pilfered Princess]] [Original Fiction][NSFW] - An evil sorcerer kidnaps a princess in his bid for conquest, but gets more than he bargained for. A humorous sendup of formula fantasy stories.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23173/the-simulacrum][The Simulacrum]] [Original Fiction] - An amnesiac guy from our world is sent into a harem romance comedy show, except instead of being the protagonist, which is the typical thing for how these stories tend to go, he is the idiot friend of the protagonist. The world closely follows narrative tropes from the genre and he uses his genre savviness to avoid awkward situations that normally arise out of these stories, and figure out what's going on and why he is here.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17061161/chapters/40116860][The Care and Feeding of Magical Creatures]] [Original Fiction][NSFW] - When I was nineteen, a sweet and very determined succubus came to abduct me out of my bed and off to her home in Pandemonium. Getting off Earth was a wild ride, but it was nothing compared to what happened after we escaped...

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1246519/chapters/2562553][Ship of the Line (Forever After Earth #1)]] [Buffy the Vampire Slayer/Multi-Crossover][NSFW] - To get Willow to wear a more daring costume, Buffy and Xander agree to go in the same costume Willow does. Buffy picks a set of matching costumes that are something called FAE... When the spell wears off, Buffy, Xander, and Willow are left with new bodies, life-changing memories, and a city-sized starship. Hijinks Ensue.
