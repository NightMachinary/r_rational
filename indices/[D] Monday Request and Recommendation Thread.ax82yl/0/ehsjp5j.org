I read over the weekend the ongoing webfiction [[https://tcthrone.wordpress.com/][Vacant Throne]] and was pleasantly impressed. It moves a little faster than I would prefer, not allowing the MC to really explore her new world. But the characters & their motivations, the magic system, and the overall plot were all a step up from most of the self-published fictions you generally find online.

Kudos to the author for improving their game over *Void Domain*, their previous work, which I dropped partway through.
