It seems you've answered your own question: if the effect is a true allergy, mediated by the receptors on immune cells that are well suited for detecting individual molecules, it would probably be triggered by the body's own water and so wouldn't work out so well for the patient.

However, there's other mechanisms for an individual's unusually sensitivity to something, and in colloquial use these are often referred to as "allergies" as well... dermal water sensitivity is actually fairly common (try a search phrase like /water contact dermatitis/), with required amounts of exposure that suggest something like:

1) Wash-out of some required component of the skin

2) Ingress of some common mineral contaminant of water into the skin

3) Osmotic pressure in the skin

So, if you want a hard-fantasy "otherwise-human witch who melts in the rain", take one of those causes of sensitivity and dial the effect up to 11.
