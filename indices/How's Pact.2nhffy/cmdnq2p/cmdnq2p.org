Let's see...

#+begin_quote
  Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.
#+end_quote

We haven't seen inside the heads or histories of all the important players to be sure of this, but I'd say it lives up to it - can't recall anyone seeming to be motivated by The Plot rather than their own reasons.

#+begin_quote
  Factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".
#+end_quote

This a story that contains /literal demons/, but those are mostly treated as something like a force of nature rather than actual characters (in the same way as fire isn't a "faction" - it's just dangerous and destructive). The major character groups all seem to have their own internal logic.

That said, they mostly come off as /assholes/, arranged against our protagonist... who is also rapidly descending into suicidal recklessness and may not necessarily be making things better despite his best efforts. So it's all a bit grey-on-grey rather than being able to sympathise with and sensibly contemplate support for every side.

#+begin_quote
  The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.
#+end_quote

I'd say it scores points for this too... although there's a whole lot of still-hidden information and unknown resources, which supplies the antagonists with a nigh-infinite supply of curveballs to through at the protagonist. He mostly gets along by creativity and sheer bloody-mindedness.

#+begin_quote
  The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.
#+end_quote

... is "Whatever happens, the universe is trying to fuck you up" considered consistent? It's pretty consistent on that point. Not so sure about sane - couldn't say that I can enumerate the possible "things that could happen" with all the magic that's loose, but you get a sense for how things work and there's not too much magic macguffinry involved - powerful effects being expensive and so on.

So as an example of Rational Fiction, it's not really ticking all the boxes, but as an example of Fiction it's pretty good... I've been enjoying it.
