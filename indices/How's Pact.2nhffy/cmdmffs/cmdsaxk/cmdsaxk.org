You ended an arc or two before the main comic relief/heart warming character is introduced, but yeah, you're not wrong. I had finally reached the point in reading Wildbow where I sort of stepped back and forced myself to ignore the current grimness, and that ended up being right before back to back grim-whammy arcs. Still enjoying it though, and the last arc has (very ironically) been much more optimistic and successful, with protagonists being proactive and accomplishing goals and not feeling perpetually on the brink of disaster. The karma system is a fascinating plot device in that regard.
