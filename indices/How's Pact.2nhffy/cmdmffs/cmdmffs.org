I read the first four arcs before putting it down. It's got some neat stuff in it, but ... the big problem I had with /Worm/ was that it was sort of unrelenting in how grim it was. In my opinion, and based only on those first four arcs, /Pact/ is worse.

So I was 36 chapters in, which is over 200K words, and I just closed the tab and started thinking about all the things I could have been doing that weren't reading /Pact/.

There's a chance that I'll read through it when it's fully complete, mostly because then it's not a twice-weekly dose of depression and there's hopefully some conclusion that makes everything worth it.
