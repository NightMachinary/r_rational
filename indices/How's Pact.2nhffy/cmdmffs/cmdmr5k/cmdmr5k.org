Huh. Now that you said this, I'm trying to think back to how grim Worm was and thinking of why I didn't notice it at the time. There were definitely long stretches of high tension and stark danger, and the world itself was very unfiltered, but somehow I never really thought of it as "grim." Maybe because Herbert spent such (relatively) little time dwelling or angsting, and so much time thinking of problems and acting, that I got a constant sense of hope.

Even when the dominos started falling down and things got cranked up to 11, the kind of person Herbert is was so core to her character and the story, that a voice in the back of my head was sure that no matter how dark things got, she would keep trying, keep *thinking*, and *never give up.*

Characters like Tattletale and Regent were great comedic relief even at the darkest of times ("Hey! [[#s][]]?"), but you're right, the story really is extremely grim. Had Worm been focused on a protagonist that was any less awesome, I probably would have noticed it more while reading.

Haven't gotten around to reading Pact yet, but interested to see how it contrasts now.
