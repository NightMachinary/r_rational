I'm reading Worm right now (At Sting 26.6) and I definitely noticed the grimness. It starts pretty bad ([[#s][Worm]], but nothing out of the ordinary. It does keep going down. The [[#s][Worm]] are absolutely horrible (but well-written) and going down from that makes everything worse. Skitter can't ever catch a break. When there's a victory, the first thing I think is "How will it get worse now?"
