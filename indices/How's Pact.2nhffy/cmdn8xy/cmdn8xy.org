I quite like it, and it's definitely enjoyable to read. But I definitely preferred Worm to it. Partially I just prefer the genre of Worm, and seeing the unique powers and fun uses put to them.

I don't really feel that I understand the rules of the universe either, so I'm unsure how "sane and consistent" I'd call them. There are some things, like with Maggie and Padraic, where I had no clue that that was even possible.

Still, it does have it good points. I am just worse at talking about the good points of fiction. There are some interesting characters, and some awesome/hilarious moments. I'd recommend reading it, although it's in its final few arcs so it may be best to wait a bit and read the whole thing
