I am absolutely a huge fan of Pact. It's kinda like my favorite TV show where I get to tune in every couple days for another "Episode". It's tough for me to objectively compare it to Worm, since I'm definitely reading it at a slower pace and it is a very different work. The setting and characters are so far off from Worm that it's hard to make a good comparison. Shakespere vs. Ursula K. Le Guin - which is "better"?

Having said all that, while this work is somewhat deconstructionist and definitely has strong rationalist influences, it is definitely not in the same league as Worm in that regard. I'm not sure that the genre really lends itself to such a strict rationalist reworking. It's definitely more little "r" rational than 99% of current urban fantasy.

For me, the real selling point is Wildbow's writing and plotting. He sets things up so far in advance and so subtly that it's sometimes breathtaking. He almost plays "tricks" that an observant reader might catch or which, after revealed, give previous chapters (or the entire STORY) a completely different flavor.

It definitely ramps up a bit slower than Worm (from what I remember), but is worth it in the long run.
