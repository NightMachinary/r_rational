Aha. If it's not too big a burden, do Future You a favor and [[http://www.amazon.com/Wizard-Hire-Storm-Front-Dresden/dp/0739451936][get the first three as an omnibus]]: the first two books are enjoyable, but in the context of the series as a whole they're more of a setup and introduction to the world and some characters, and it's not till book 3 that things really take off :)
