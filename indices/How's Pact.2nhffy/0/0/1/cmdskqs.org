Yeah, if Taylor had been less focused on "I can solve this and fuck anyone who thinks otherwise" then the story could have been really depressing. Tragedy after tragedy happens, the problems just keep ramping up, very few people get a substantial power boost to deal with the rising threats, and there just ultimately seems to be little hope for a better life other than simply surviving. But Taylor keeps going, doesnt treat any problem as unsolvable, and [[/s][end of the story spoilers]] So many great themes to draw from Worm as a whole.
