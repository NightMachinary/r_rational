Meh. Worm's strength was that its fights were very clearly defined in advance: you knew who was there and what their powers were, but the way in which they used their powers would be intelligent and surprising despite that. Pact's fights function in essentially the opposite manner, because power in that world functions through vague symbolism and emotional strength of will (edit: also, nobody ever knows what anyone else's standard capabilities are unless they've already fought before, information is much more scarce). Worm had supernatural powers, but they operated in a lawfully consistent manner (up until the surgery at the end - kind of a cop out), which made it a much more rational story.

There are one or two instances where intelligent mundane solutions are used for fighting difficult supernatural beings, but they are far scarcer than in Worm. When reading Worm, I liked when I got the feeling "damn, I should have thought of that", and I've had that happen only once to me so far while reading Pact. Instead, most of the time Blake does something totally random that no one had any reason to think would work, but the magic system is flexible and bends to help him out. (For a supposedly hostile universe, it sends him far too much luck.)

I read up until 11 or so before I got bored, might pick it back up sometime later or might not. Rumor has it it's ending soon, thankfully, so there's not much more I'd need to push through if I wanted the satisfaction of completing it.
