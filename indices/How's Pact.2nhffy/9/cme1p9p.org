I enjoy Pact quite a bit, and I heartily recommend it to other readers.

From a rational side of things:

It explains magic in a fairly rational way, i.e. magical effects are created by a multitude of spirits who collectively have some idea of fairness, but also have a desire to be entertained. The effect is that magic is a little bit science, and a lot of art and acting.

All the deals that are offered are true tradeoffs. Nothing is ever given for free, or even for cheap, so all deals must be dissected to figure out if they're worth it. Add to this the fact that no practitioner can lie, and you have a truly delightful lawyer-esque dynamic.

Characters tend to be level one intelligent, with exceptions being called out in a few specific circumstances. There is one memorable scene where Blake bets on a character having a lower intellect, for good reason, and ending up terribly wrong.

From a storytelling perspective:

Others have commented about how it's always bad for Blake, with no let up. Well, that's mostly true, but it's explicitly explained why that is, which mitigates the effect a bit. It also seems like that's changing in the current arc, as Blake is getting the hang of living with the magical community. I'm finding it actually very satisfying to see the progression.

Again, Blake's actions are always at least level one intelligent, but sometimes don't seem smart in a broader sense. I noticed this initially, but threw it under my usual suspension of disbelief because I was enjoying the story, but recently, Blake's back-story has been filled in a bit more, and suddenly every choice he made is explicable from a psychological perspective.

Finally, the setting and layout of the story allow for getting to know the antagonists well. This is something I feel it does better than in "Worm", where the bad guys are mostly undeniably evil, with a few morally grey factions thrown in. In "Pact", everyone except the demons and a few "Others" are morally grey, and conflict is created from ideology and circumstance.

Oh yeah, and it's updated 2-3 times a week. Holy crap is that impressive.
