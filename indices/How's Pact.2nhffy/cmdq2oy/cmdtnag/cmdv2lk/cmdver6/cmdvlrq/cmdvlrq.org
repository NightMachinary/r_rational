Ahh yes, that was a good moment. I read the entire story in probably a couple months right after it finished, now I'm realizing that I've forgotten a lot. I want to wait for a reread ideally when it's been edited and even perhaps published, but I'm afraid I won't be able to go that long. The only saving grace is that I have a lot of other stuff to read right now. I would probably participate in an organized reread/discussion group if that was organized...
