I really like the world building of Pact very much. The whole magical/metaphysical system is very interesting. It actually feels mystical/magical unlike lots of other magic systems these days.

However the problems I'm having with Worm I'm having with Pact. There us a huge buildup of tension but there is no release, no catharthis. Its like a rollercoaster that just keeps going up. Wildbow doesn't really give us time to breath, its just one contrived dilemma after the other. After a while there's really no tension and all the drama just feels ridiculous.
