I've finished Worm a year ago or so. I remember staying up late into the night, waiting for Wildbow to finally update with the last interlude haha. It was very satisfying.

Don't get me wrong, I very much enjoy his writing. I just don't like how he constantly ramps up the tension without letting the reader breathe for a little bit. I feel.like thr warlord arc should have been a lot longer. Just having more time between each climax would have been helpful.

Otherwise it jist feels rushed, at least to me. Although I think that's more the fault of the web serial medium rather then Wildbows writing skills.
