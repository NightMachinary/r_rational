  And the plot twists. Imagine if Frodo cuts off his finger, only to find out that all of his toes /also/ have rings that need to be removed. And there are /individual/ dark lords of death and destruction guarding /each/. That's how Pact feels much of the time, even after a climactic moment is resolved.
