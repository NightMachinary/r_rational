Ehhh...

*The solid:* it is well written. It has some interesting ideas in the modern fantasy genre which are well executed. There is a lot of it. It is free but essentially crowd funded. It has intelligent characters in mostly logically consistent situations.

*The issues:* the main character starts out in an interesting situation, then leaves it for way, way too long. This makes it feel /very/ bait-and-switchy. And then it happens again. And then again. Things are rarely clear ahead of time, and the MC literally gets dragged from plot point to plot point. Often. This ruins agency and thus much of a chance for rationalist approaches to problems. I think the only really rationalist characters mostly romp around off screen or in the background, both historically and narratively. Lots of things are alien in intelligence and motivation, but at least they're consistent in that.

Overall, it is basically a character-torture-porn soap opera that occasionally changes locations.

I won't say if anyone /specifically/ has amnesia, but people do. Like, two or three times just as far as I got. And there is a twin. Who might or might not be evil. And there is a will, and an inheritance, and a person who might be corrupt or just protective of his family and the community (or both). A land developer is causing trouble just outside of town, hiring some rough characters. There is a powerful authority figure who has a city under their thumb. Someone shady lives in the woods. There are near-death experiences and curses and troubled spirits. And there is a (brief) will-they-won't-they love story, but they can't be together because of overly dramatic reasons that happen really suddenly to yank a character away, almost like they were fired from the cast.

That happens a lot, by the way. Maybe they don't have good agents.

When you step back and list the things that happen, it might be from an especially ambitious Telemundo soap series crossed with a modern fantasy epic novel series. Which, again, isn't a /bad/ thing, but isn't what a lot of people might expect.

I feel the story tries too hard to be emotional, realistic, and impactful, and ends up bludgeoning the reader with things that should be subtle and subversive.

*Nit-picky authorial craft stuff:* the threat escalation is poorly done, in my opinion. By the end of the first few arcs, the MC can't seem to make a sandwich or /literally/ walk down the road without someone trying to kill him. In fact, few people can. No one really seems able to accomplish anything, including the sorta-villains, and the results of conflicts seem at the whim of agents out of everyone's control.

This is in fact a strong theme, but it doesn't necessarily make for a good /story/. If all of Lord of the Rings was Frodo dragging himself around Mordor /without Sam/, it wouldn't have been a very good story. But that is what Pact feels like a lot of the time (as far as I got). Just grimness and nothing ever really getting done.

And the plot twists. Imagine if Frodo cuts off his finger, only to find out that all of his toes /also/ have rings that need to be removed. And there are /individual/ dark lords of death and destruction guarding /each/. That's how Pact feels much of the time, even after a climactic moment is resolved.

At some point, it would be nice to see a finished sandwich, and someone the reader cares about sitting down and enjoying eating it while talking about their plans for what to do next -- all without ninjas crashing through the window halfway through. There is literally a scene where the MC fails to make a party platter, though not for that reason, and another where he fails to get and enjoy a cup of coffee. No comment on the ninjas there.

Overall, a good enough read, but not worth my time right now for the same reason I haven't read Worm or Homestuck all the way through: the themes seem to be explored a la carte, not presented strongly to the reader and then quickly and efficiently exercised in the narrative. This is typical of serial fiction, but is not something I currently enjoy.

*Pro-tip:* the "extra" stuff that has grimoire excerpts or historical narratives do a Sanderson's-Stormlight-thing where they make for /much/ stronger reading than the main plotline. Perhaps because they have a compact, serial short-story format and contain interesting characters /accomplishing/ interesting things during interesting times. /Read those/. I wish the story was entirely about the obviously strongest female character in the series (featured there). She seems like a much, much more interesting character, and she occasionally /got shit done/.

Don't spoil if that turns out to happen to be the main plot 1,700,000 words in, turning the novel from modern fantasy to roaring '20s occultist thriller. It'll only make me sad and cause me to fail NaNoWriMo this year for the first time ever.

But damn, that would be a good story.
