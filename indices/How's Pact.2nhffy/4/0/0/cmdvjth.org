I don't mean to imply that you /need/ a PoV moment to confirm that events are caused by character motivation rather than plot device.

But it is one way to demonstrate, when they do something that seems at first glance like it doesn't make sense, that actually there /were/ reasons that we just weren't shown at the time.
