  We haven't seen inside the heads or histories of all the important players to be sure of this, but I'd say it lives up to it - can't recall anyone seeming to be motivated by The Plot rather than their own reasons.

I don't think that is necessarily a meaningful conceptualization. The point is to give the illusion of independent thought within characters. The writer controls the story. In other words, just good writing.
