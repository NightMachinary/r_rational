There's some good and some bad.

I really enjoy some parts of /Pact/, like the use and implications of the chronomancy and karma, and Blake's "Damn the status quo" attitude, but other problems (heh) are super irritating.

The ban on lying is /brilliant/, since it /automatically/ makes all the little nuances of dialogue significant, and information control even more so. /Unfortunately/, the protagonists aren't equipped to obtain critical information themselves, and spend a /lot/ of the story lacking game-changing details.

*HOWEVER*, I think this is actually a case of the serial nature of the story working against it, because of the relatively long spans of time between chapters, as compared to reading one immediately after the other. As someone who caught up on /Worm/ in a week (it was two-thirds complete at the time) I think reading /Pact/ when it is finished would improve the experience.

Edit: For those who have already current, please remember to avoid spoilers as much as possible, especially things like the end of the Void arc.

Also, Thorburn Boogeyman X Green Eyes FTW.

Edit 2: In fact, I think the best way to think about it is that /Pact/ is doing for the Paranormal genre what /Worm/ did for superheroes: *a blend of straight storytelling and deconstruction /in a world which makes sense despite those elements/.*
