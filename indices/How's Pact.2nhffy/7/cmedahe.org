I, for one, like it /better/ than Worm

On the rational scale, it's good but not outstanding. The character mostly plans creatively but sometimes you couldn't have imagined what he was going to do. Still, the plans are usually well thougt out.

On the other hand, there is a rule about not lying ('wizards' character can't lie or they lose a lot of power) that the author sometimes seems to forget about, and its a big minus for me. In general, the story suffers a bit because the rules are a bit more variable and convoluted than Worm's and the author is less comfortable with them.
