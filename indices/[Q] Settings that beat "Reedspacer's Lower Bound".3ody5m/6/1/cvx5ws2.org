I could just as well say the same thing ignoring sentience: I could describe the utopia as a place containing lots of biological creatures and then say that if I was one of the biological creatures I would probably be one of the catpeople. Specifically assuming that you would be one of the sentients, rather than one of the (insert larger or smaller category that includes you) is reference class manipulation.

Of course, if you're sentient and catgirls aren't, being in a catgirl's position means that you would no longer be you. But actual loss of sentience is not needed for you to no longer be you--there are differences between you and even sentient catgirls, after all.
