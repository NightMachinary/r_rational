This sounds like a strengthening of Rawls and his Veil of Ignorance that captures what's basically good about his form of constructivism while ignoring the liberal baggage about "plans of life" and "procedural justice" that he draped it in.

For instance, it lets us conveniently and easily say, "[[/u/ToaKraka]] is literally a self-admitted sociopath, but it's still /irrational/ for him to support turning society into a dictatorship ruled by an evil overlord, because it's outrageously improbable that he would actually wind up in the advantaged position. Maximizing his own (sociopathic) interests actually involves building the kind of society that's robust against forms of power, manipulation, and domination to which he can't cheaply avoid falling victim, and which also robustly supplies him with other people's social cooperation when he needs it."
