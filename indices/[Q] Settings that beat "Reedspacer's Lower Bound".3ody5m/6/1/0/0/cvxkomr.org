If we're going to turn society into a dictatorship, there's direct continuity from an existing human to a human living under a dictatorship. On the other hand, saying "that society has a 100 to 1 ratio of trees to humans, so if you live in that society you'll probably be a tree" is nonsense, because we're not going to be making trees from existing people.

In order to be able to say "if the catgirls are sentient, you would probably be one of the catgirls" it would have to be true that

1. nonsentient catgirls /would not be/ made from existing people, but
2. sentient catgirls /would be/ made from existing people.

I find this unlikely.
