I think we've already determined that I don't buy into the LW definition of catgirl (along with anyone else who's read any stories about /The Instrumentality of Mankind/, or /The Wanderer/, or pretty much any SF literature involving humanoid cats...)

I mean, a non-sentient humanoid cat? I wouldn't go near one in less than a full attack dog trainer outfit. Cats are fucking scary, we only think they're cute because we're ten times their size.

Plus this subthread is discussing LiteralHeadCannon's post:
