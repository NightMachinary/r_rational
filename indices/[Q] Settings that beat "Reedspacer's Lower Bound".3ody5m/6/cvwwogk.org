Present-day Earth passes Reedspacer's Lower Bound if the catpeople are sentient, because odds are that in such a "utopia", you would be one of the catpeople. This is basically the same problem with many Christian conceptions of Heaven, wherein humans assume the roles of the catpeople and God assumes the role of the non-catperson.
