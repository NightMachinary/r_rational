This is another case of EY and LW in general using unusual terms for things. "Catgirl" was used in the original EY post to mean "sexual not-person" which is not what most people would think of catgirls as being and which has several better words to use to describe the same thing. (Someone replying to the original post suggested "fembot", which has much more appropriate connotations even though literally speaking it's possible for fembots to be sentient too.)
