AND, after reading the whole article:

Why does EY assume the catgirls are nonsentient?

I'd spawn a bunch of instances of myself so I'd get to be the catgirls as well. Why not? And why does he assume the catgirl option means you spend all your time screwing? Even if you do, how many people would stay stuck in the same gender? Hell, they'd invent new ones.

Also, Larry Niven has already written the novel where men and women no longer have sex to hold them together. It doesn't end well.
