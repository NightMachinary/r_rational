If there were a community of immortals in which a selection effect could operate, I could see that. Immortal doesn't mean indestructible. Rash immortals get killed off, survivors are conservative.

But Ken is a black swan, there's only one of him and he is what he is, he's not the result of a selection process among immortals. And he doesn't act conservatively in other areas. He acts like an impulsive risk taker inclined to radical experiments on adolescent whims (I mean really, lumbering a whole species with impractical tentacle-arms because he thought a cheesy Heavy Metal cover looked cool?).
