  But you die after a while, and there's other depressing stuff around... probably doesn't pass it.

1. You don't need to die after a while. You can uplift into higher dimensions, upload into a heaven, or simply live forever. It's mildly frowned upon (it's an "unusual life choice") but nobody forces you to die at 300 or 400 or whenever they normally decide to drop.

2. Reedspacer's Lower Bound doesn't imply there isn't depressing stuff outside the volcano lair.
