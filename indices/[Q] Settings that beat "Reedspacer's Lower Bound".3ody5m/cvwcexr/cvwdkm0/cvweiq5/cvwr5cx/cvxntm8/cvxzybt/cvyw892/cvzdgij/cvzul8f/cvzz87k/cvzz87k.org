That's quoting some unnamed third party.

There's a lot of other bullshit in EY's article too, such as the assumption that "catpeople" implies "nonsentient"... I mean consider that this subthread stared with DataPacRat's comment about the Journal Entries, where the catgirls are definitely NOT "nonsentient".

So I figure we're talking about "How many existing fictional settings do you know that are more fun to live in than /that/?" Where /that/ is just what I quoted two messages up. It's certainly easy to come up with ones that aren't. Like, Star Trek's Federation.

So, let's try another: I'll go with the high-tech Amish of Iain Banks /Feersum Endjinn/, who are resource constrained by some poor reactions to transcendant machinery (they're apparently the people left behind by their Singularity) but still manage to do a better job than "A volcano lair full of catgirls".
