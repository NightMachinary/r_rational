  It's still more fun than a volcano lair full of catgirls.

No thank you on the Ortians as a paradise, it's better than here and I'd work to get there, but it's a subsistence society constrained by being bios in the Oort. They have a deathist culture and a second class afterlife. It'd be a scary cult if they have a low out-migration rate.
