Catpersons of all genders and species. And an antigrav castle in a no-kidding Ringworld you built yourself.

I'll pass on the violent dominance games. Not my cup of tea. Also, it's kind of disappointing that he didn't spin off multiple instances of himself. He misses out on so much of the potential fun of the Hall by only letting people go through it once, too.

I'll vote for Banks "Culture", or Greg Egan's "Permutation City", though I still haven't figured out what's so great about pretending to be a "Chinese Room" AI. Peer's final embrace of Solipsist Nation principles is pretty awesome.

Charlie Stross's "Accelerando" universe has people being pretty much whatever they want in as many instances as they want.

Linda Nagata's universe has potential. Try "Vast".

Varley's Ophiuchi Hotline universe is pretty much a blast, though his reboot decades later nerfed the shit out of it.

Edit: adding Karl Schroeder's "Lady of Mazes".

Walter Jon Williams, "Implied Spaces"

Wil McCarthy, "Queendom of Sol" series.
