#+begin_quote
  "Catgirl" was used in the original EY post to mean "sexual not-person"
#+end_quote

I realize that's what EY thinks it means, but is that what <reedspacer> meant?

#+begin_example
   This Utopia consists of a one-line remark on an IRC channel:

      <reedspacer> living in your volcano lair with catgirls is probably a vast increase in standard of living for most of humanity
#+end_example

I'm pretty sure that most people would want their futuristic catgirls/fembots/succubi/post-realdollian-sextoys to pass the Turing Test.
