Let's be fair: how many Utopias are basically volcano lairs populated by cat people, just with a different color scheme?

I ... am having a hard time thinking of examples of Utopias, for some reason. I think that is a really bad sign.

So, uh, James Cameron's Avatar. Basically a volcano lair full of cat people. Except instead of a volcano lair, it's the Temple of Gaea, because I am having a hard time determining the value in living in a volcano for more than a weekend. Also I don't remember the name of the planet in Avatar, because I already told you Pacman is apparently in my brain, eating my memories. [edit: Pandora! Right after I posted!]

Star Trek! Like spaceships? Like exploring new worlds? Because it's got the cat people covered. In the future, space is a volcano full of cats.

I tried to explain how Heaven and Disneyland are basically volcano lairs full of cat people, maybe even more literally than the other two, but I'm feeling less sane by the word and decided to cut it.
