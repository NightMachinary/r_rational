Well, Star Trek has catgirl-lairs with the Holodecks, plus you get to explore space. Which happens to also resemble a volcano lair, and be populated by people who look suspiciously like catgirls. Hmm.

Life in the Culture looks a lot like Reedspacer's Lower, I guess. I mean, the catgirls are mostly other bored people, and you have to ask a Mind for a volcano lair, but it's basically the same. But you die after a while, and there's other depressing stuff around... probably doesn't pass it.

Um ... dang, most of the transhumanist ones seem to actually fail ... ah! /The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect/ beats the Bound.
