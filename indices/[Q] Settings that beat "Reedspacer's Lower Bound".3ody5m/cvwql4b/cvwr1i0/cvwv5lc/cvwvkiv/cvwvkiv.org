You seem to assume that you have no obligations beyond the volcano lair full of catgirls. That's not specified, so the awesomeness criteria for a utopia don't cover whether EVERYONE has a volcano lair full of catgirls, or whether you have an obligation to provide one for everyone else. I mean, it's a really low bar when you think about it.
