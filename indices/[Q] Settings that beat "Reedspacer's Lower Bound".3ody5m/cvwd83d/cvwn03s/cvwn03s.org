  I ... am having a hard time thinking of examples of Utopias, for some reason. I think that is a really bad sign.

Not really. Most half-decent even-halfway eutopias I can think of simply aren't grouped as utopias. Nobody who made them was trying to write a utopia story, and to call them such would insult them. They're extremely nice places to live /precisely because/ they were meant to provide /backgrounds/ for the positive and interesting lives of their characters.

To give an example, it was HPMoR that noted Rowling's wizarding world to be a "zeroth world country" in which most major material discomforts were so thoroughly abolished as to be beneath notice.

To give a further example, the world of /Slayers/ features various wars between gods and demons and all kinds of "not-so-utopian" worldbuilding details, but actually, on a daily basis, appears to have a high standard of living /plus/ magic /plus/ various forms of sophisticated fun available via Zany Schemes and Simple Plans for all kinds of advancement. It has enough room that the main character of the series eventually grows to be able to control spells which summon the power of their Chaotic Neutral creatress goddess, the Lord of Nightmares.

Nobody has to call it "eutopia", but you'd still actually want to live there.
