I /think/ it was a commentary on Orwell that made a distinction for me: utopia (or distopia) is generally a political message, whereas eutopia is more focussed on measurable hedons than ideology.

I don't say "utilons" because I see it referring more to what /should/ be good rather than that-thing-that-hedons-measure, and it tangles politics back in. After all, it's very easy to say that the political and legal structure of a eutopia is ideal, and then it's just another utopia...
