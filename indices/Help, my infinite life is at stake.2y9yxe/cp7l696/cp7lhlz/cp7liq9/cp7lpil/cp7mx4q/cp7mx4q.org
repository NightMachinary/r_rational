Classic rule of fiction: write what you know. You've already admitted that you don't have time to properly familiarize yourself with modern culture, so don't even try; tell us about your own instead. The results of doing so may or may not be well-received, but at least it'll be genuine. A fake effort based on what you think the judges are looking for has no chance at all.
