I mentioned it in Friday's thread, but has anyone else read [[https://www.amazon.com/Enlightenment-Now-Science-Humanism-Progress/dp/0525427570][Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress]]. I just finished listening to the audio book and will be reading the physical book once I get a chance. I would say it's the best description of how I feel about a lot of issues and actually directly mentions the rationalist movement, though not in the context of fiction.

In essence, the book attempts to make the case for enlightenment ideals. It argues, that they have been important it human progress along with laying out the evidence that humans are indeed progressing. He also makes an argument that there is a large group of intellectuals who are anti enlightenment. I agree with almost everything he said, which is honestly the biggest problem I had with the book. It didn't leave me re-evaluating many of my positions.

As I mentioned before he does argue that the potential for catastrophic disaster is over stated. I think he's only partially right. He states that since it takes a large group to create a powerful weapon one mad man can't then use one to destroy the world. I think the problem here is that in many cases the information may be hard to create, but using it may be easy. Let's say biologists in the next 10 years perfect gene editing to the extent that it's cheap and easy to build a totally synthetic virus. At that point all that is necessary is for someone to leak the information for a super virus and information is very hard to contain.
