Time works, not too much else. Getting rid of the mental trigger stuff and keeping busy work acceptably well. E.g. Seal away those fotos, favourite movies, books, mp3 files etc away and get a hobby where you get out lots and meet new peope.

As for the thought spirals, they can be a symptom of depression - any chance thats it? If so, treat it.

Thought spirals are hard to keep up when the body is busy and tired -start with regular cardio, or just run for a while until your brain is too busy breathing.
