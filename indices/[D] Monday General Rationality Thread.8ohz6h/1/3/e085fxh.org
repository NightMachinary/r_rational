Not really right wing-per se, and also technically not a podcast, but I would recommend watching/listening to Sargon of Akkad on Youtube. He identifies as a classical English Liberal, which means people should be free rather than compelled to do or say things. Recently he's been criticizing the left a lot due to social justice trying to take over the world and stuff, but he criticizes the right when they do stupid things as well. So while he's really more of a moderate, he usually explains why people think what they think even when he disagrees with them, so it should be useful as another perspective.
