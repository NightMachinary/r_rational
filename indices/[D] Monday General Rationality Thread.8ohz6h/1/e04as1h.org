Most of my political commentary podcasts are left-wing, so I'm looking for a podcast or two on the political right to round things out and reduce the opacity of the bubble that I'm living in.

I would prefer to not listen to someone who supports Trump /in general/ (support of specific actions or policies is fine) and I don't want to listen to someone who's going to be spending time making fun of the opposition. I'm not here for bad jokes or sick burns, and even when I /agree/ with the host, I tend to find myself wishing that we'd get back to the subject. It would also be nice if the host isn't religious, because there's no chance in Hell that I'm going to be convinced by an argument whose foundation is "Because Jesus."

Non-U.S. podcasts are fine, since I'm less interested in right-wing thoughts on particular issues than in right-wing /thought/, period.
