I don't listen to podcasts, and I've only kept half an ear on politics for the past year, but I think [[https://www.nationalreview.com/podcasts/the-editors/][The (National Review) Editors]] is what you're looking for. While essentially defining what right-wing conservatism is, these guys famously gave Trump an /anti/-endorsement in 2016. They know the issues, can speak intelligently about them, and stay on point.
