Another option is to just have these pokemon not evolve in the wild at all. For example, say that Kadabra only evolves after it has had prolonged contact with at least two different human minds. There just aren't any Alakazams in the wild unless some trainer released theirs.

This is less plausible for Machoke and Graveler, but given that friendship based evolutions and mega evolutions are a thing, I'd say there is precedent for pokemon unlocking some hidden potential only after prolonged contact with humans.
