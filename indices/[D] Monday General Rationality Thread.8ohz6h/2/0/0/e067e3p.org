It has been over a year since the break up. I just had a bit of a breakdown this Monday and last. Was hoping I'd be past those experiences. Especially for a short relationship.

I do have depression. I'm going to therapy but I feel tired all the time. I do work out and exercise but rarely have enough energy to put my all into it.
