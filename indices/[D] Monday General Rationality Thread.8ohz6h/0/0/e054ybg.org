Although the comments the others have made are rather short, they have a strong point. Vampires weren't their own category of creature: they are first and foremost a creature of horrors, Evil with a capital E, the kind you fear will drink your blood at night. All the other traits are specific to how they are represented in stories, until they become common enough to be consistent; they aren't central to what it originally meant to be a vampire. The immortality of vampires is a trait that is used to coax people into becoming evil, and Kay is shown to have fallen for it. For the people of this context, and indeed for most people today, the rational benefits are inconsequential to the main plot point.

Perhaps this is comparable to /the power of love./ In many pop movies, the main character has to choose between something and /love/ and generally love is picked even though it appears to be the worse option. Of course, since in popular media the main character's decision is always correct, it turns out there was a hidden benefit to it. Most people take it for face value - love is good - rational decisions don't have a chance to come in. Perhaps my view is incorrect, I do not watch many movies. I know in particular though, that the latest Spiderman movie did break this mould, much to my surprise.
