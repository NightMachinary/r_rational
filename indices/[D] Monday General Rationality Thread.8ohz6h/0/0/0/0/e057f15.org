It's also worth pointing out that rationalists are much less appalled by [[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/psychology-of-taboo-tradeoff/][taboo tradeoffs]] than general populace.

  When people are asked to trade their sacred values for values considered to be secular---what psychologist Philip Tetlock refers to as a “taboo tradeoff”---they exhibit moral outrage, express anger and disgust, become increasingly inflexible in negotiations, and display an insensitivity to a strict cost-benefit analysis of the exchange. What's more, when people receive monetary offers for relinquishing a sacred value, they display a particularly striking irrationality. Not only are people unwilling to compromise sacred values for money---contrary to classic economic theory's assumption that financial incentives motivate behavior---but the inclusion of money in an offer produces a backfire effect such that people become even less likely to give up their sacred values compared to when an offer does not include money. People consider trading sacred values for money so morally reprehensible that they recoil at such proposals.
