I really appreciate this comment, I'm beginning to get it. Especially the analogy about /the power of love/. I can see people from 1918 and 2118 being equally confused about our modern movies with /the power of love/. I might have to see if I can find a copy of /The Daughter of Dracula/ to see if vampires are treated similarly there, except for the fact that /Son of Dracula/ was so boring that I'm not sure I want to sit through a similar movie that my romance novel protagonist wouldn't been likely to have seen.
