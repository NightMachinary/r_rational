I think you're maybe trying a little too hard to map the logic of that one movie to values shared by everyone in the expected audience.

It's like if someone in 2118 watched /Avengers: Infinity Wars/, watched Thanos's character and went "Uh, I guess these people used to think death was an acceptable answer to overpopulation back then". Okay, so it's a little different because Thanos is portrayed as the villain (is he though? the movie spends a lot of time focusing on his perspective and his emotional struggle), but my point is, movie characters don't have to make sense, especially in big budget movies.
