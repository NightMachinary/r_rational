Thanos is definitely the villain but only in so much as he's opposing the characters we know as our protagonists. His ultimate goal is good, at least the driving desire is. The actuality of it is....less so. His solution is a brutish and simplistic solution to an overly complicated problem (a problem which may not even be universal; there's no real way for Thanos to know)
