Vampire!Kay seems to be just like her normal self, though. She seems to have the same thoughts, feelings, desires, etc - she's continuing her plan to get immortal with Frank, after all. She doesn't kill anyone and makes no plans to.

Count Alucard kills a fortune-teller (yes, /of course/ there's a Romani fortune-teller) in the first minutes of the film, kills Kay's father (actually - Kay may have been complicit in that, but that was while she was human) and Alucard leaves a young boy for dead after feeding from him, and he tries to kill Frank and the Professor, before the Professor whipped out a handy cross, so Alucard's pretty evil. But Kay wasn't presented as evil or even misguided or anything.

I'm just shocked the movie didn't even have Frank say to her, "what? Why would I want to be transformed into an /evil demon/?", he just was disgusted and said no and then set her on fire first chance he got.

I'm trying to think of what modern concept the 1940s concept of a vampire maps onto so I can understand what the viewers at the time were thinking when they saw Frank turn Kay down. Like, I know that Romani people were seen as mystical and magical in the time, I know that African-Americans were seen in a very different way, but I don't know what people then thought of vampires.

I can't liken it to modern zombies because modern zombies have no higher brain functions. So I'm trying to figure out what that concept can /map onto/. The nearest I can think of is maybe, like, "a thinking and feeling being who is considered by society to be evil with no possible redemption" - so, like, a pedophile or something? Like if it turned out that pedophiles got immortality, would I want to become a pedophile? (blah blah blah non-offending pedophiles blah blah blah).

So yeah, that's where I'm confused/struggling. Were vampires really considered so EVIL that not wanting to be one went without saying? When at least in /Son of Dracula/ they have their own agency and aren't like starving zombies?
