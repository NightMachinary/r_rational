So... vampires are kinda /evil/. It's only in the last few decades where that changed. [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43763.Interview_with_the_Vampire][Interview with a Vampire]] was published in... 1976. Maybe there's something older that portrays vampires in a sympathetic light, but I don't care to research it. Point is, vampires are evil, and it shouldn't need to be explained that no sane person would actively choose to become a monster.
