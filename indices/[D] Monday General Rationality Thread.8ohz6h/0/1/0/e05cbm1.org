I don't know if he "cried" (they didn't exactly film in 4K in 1943) but he had a mournful moment.

I wish the movie had been more explicit about exactly what he was concerned about, regarding the soul or whatever. It was the most fascinating part of the film, because it was just completely glossed over as though it'd be obvious.
