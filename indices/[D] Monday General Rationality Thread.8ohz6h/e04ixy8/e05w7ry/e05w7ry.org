I love that it cuts to a reminder to buy war bonds. I know that was just the way things were done back then, but it comes off as if the movie was a 90 minute commercial to "Buy WAR BONDS, or a vampire fiance could happen to you, too!"

(Though, I suspect that this would not be a strong incentive to buy war bonds, in your case >:P )
