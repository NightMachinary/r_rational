I was watching [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_of_Dracula_(1943_film)][Son of Dracula]] for research purposes, and it's not a rational film, but it was interesting to watch a film that was so very, very old.

There were some things I was put off by but completely unsurprised by (the main character calling her black servants 'boys', a situation that to modern sensibilities might ring alarm bells for an abusive marriage being treated as normal), but there was one thing I really didn't understand and I'm wondering if it was a plot hole or if it was just the was society /was/, or if I'm too much in a rationalist transhumanist bubble.

Anyway, the arc I'm curious about goes like this:

- Kay is engaged to Frank, but is dating Count Alucard (really) on the side

- She marries Alucard and Frank sees them together and is understandably hurt

- After she marries him, Alucard turns Kay into a vampire

- Kay visits Frank and explains her plan to him: she wanted to be turned into a vampire so she'd live forever, and now she's a vampire, she can turn Frank into a vampire too and they can be together forever. She just needs Frank to kill Alucard so there's no loose end

- Frank is so horrified by this proposition that he /doesn't even consider it/, and after killing Alucard in a dramatic show-down, he finds Kay sleeping in her coffin

- He takes a ring off his finger, puts it onto hers, cries, and then up and sets her coffin alight in cold blood

- There's no beat where he's sad or anything, it just goes straight to "THE END" and a reminder to buy war bonds

I'm like - they didn't address that he'd been offered immortality, like, /at all/!? No line from him about it being an affront to God? No line about it not being worth all the people he'd have to kill (it's not explicit whether vampires must kill humans to feed - it seems they don't)? No fuckin' line about how he'd really like to be with her but they wouldn't be able to have children and continue the family name? It's just taken as a complete given that Frank wouldn't even consider turning into a vampire to be with Kay.

So, is it bad writing? 1940s sensibilities? My rationalist/transhumanist bubble? Discuss.
