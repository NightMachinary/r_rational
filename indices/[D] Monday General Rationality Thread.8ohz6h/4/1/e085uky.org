Imo, evolution by trading one of the more questionable mechanics in the games, and I would certainly remove it if I made a pokemon game. I'm not entirely sure if it's appropriate to remove in a fanfic, in which every change is likely to meet some resistance. However, I believe this mechanic is removed in the anime, where we occasionally see trade-pokemon evolve without being traded, so I would recommend just removing it.
