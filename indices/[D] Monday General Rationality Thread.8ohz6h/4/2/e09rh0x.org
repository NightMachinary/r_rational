hmm, how about --

Pokemon evolution (/near-instantaneous maturation/metamorphosis, bypassing normal developmental pathways) is an exceptionally costly event, and carries some substantial risk of sterility or substantial germline mutation (due to the incredible energies released, some of it in the form of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat-based_contraception][heat]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiobiology#Health_effects][radiation]]) or death (in the case cancer development and overdepletion of the body's energy reserves -- maybe to the point of temporary lethargy, maybe even to death itself).

As such, in the wild it is to be avoided except as a measure of last resort, when the alternative is certain death. Usually, it is triggered by extreme trauma, such as one might find through exposure to violent combat. Hence, its induction through the accumulation of stressful fighting experience -- eventually, some threshold is reached, and whatever body systems monitor these things "decide" that metamorphosis is preferable to its usually much safer and more stable alternative.

Alternative triggers to pokevolution can also include environmental stressors, such as direct exposure to [[https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Evolutionary_stone][dangerous substances]]. Some especially eusocial species of Pokemon build elaborate communities and find their strength through interdependent social structure. To them, loss of community (through exile or cataclysm) carries not only substantial risk of death, but also extreme emotional trauma. This emotional trauma serves as such an excellent proxy of impending need for "fighting strength", and this association over anagenic (previously "evolutionary", at term which is now deprecated) time has allowed the emotional trauma itself to serve as "evolutionary" trigger.

When captured by a pokeball, pokemon undergo substantial neurological restructuring as part of a brainwashing regime that ensures obedience to their "trainer". This is often glossed over in popular understanding, but is required for hitherto aggressive pokemon to abandon their prior lives and enslave themselves to their new masters for the purposes of vicious bloodsport. The act of trading, then, induces feelings of traumatic separation and abandonment -- a severance of the bond between slave and master. In aforementioned eusocial Pokemon species, this can be enough to trigger metamorphosis.
