Unfortunately, anything particularly obscure is too obscure to have been read by me. However, there are some good books that I have mentioned a few times to other people, but they never seem to have read them.

China Mountain Zhang, by Maureen McHugh. A coming of age novel in a future where China is the world superpower.\\
The Glass Bead Game, by Herman Hesse (mainly just the first half). A coming of age novel for a brilliant artist in a future where high society is tired of art.\\
Very Far Away from Anywhere Else, Ursula LeGuin (Yes, I know she's famous, and so was Hesse, but you probably haven't heard of this book, therefore it's obscure). A coming of age novel for two awkward teenagers who like music and conworlding.\\
Mother of Storms, by John Barnes (won an award, but a while ago - you may have heard of his other good [though very different] novel, One for the Morning Glory?). Not a coming of age novel. Instead, Charles Stross writes 'The Day After Tomorrow.'
