Oh wow! I completely forgot about reading Deltora and Sea of Trolls when I was younger. That brings back great memories and I'm buying my own copies right now so I can reread them. By the way, Deltora was $#!@&/ing/ creepy to me as a child and I had some minor nightmares about it. /Especially/ about the monster from the fifth book which stalks you in a pitch black, flooded, underground maze. Yet I absolutely loved the series. I think I had creepy tendencies as a kid....

Too bad that I can only get the first Deltora series on Kindle. The other two series, Shadowlands and Dragons, can only be gotten in print. :(

I'd have to recommend [[http://www.amazon.com/The-Neverending-Story-Michael-Ende/dp/0140386335][The Neverending Story]], because while it's not similar to the YA stories on the list, it's a fantastic coming of age journey (sorta) like how the characters mature in your recommendations.

I also remembered reading the [[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016P2FA6/ref=series_dp_rw_ca_2][Septimus Heap]] series which I was so happy to have some decent length on the books I was reading. I hated how all of the teens and YA books were only 100 to 200 pages long instead of a more comfortable 600 page monsters the Heap series was.

I would also love to go through any book lists you have, since I tend to spend a fair amount of time every so often just going through my book list and seeing what I've read recently I'd like to add to it. Seriously, the excel spreadsheet is at half a thousand lines with a dozen columns for several different categories.
