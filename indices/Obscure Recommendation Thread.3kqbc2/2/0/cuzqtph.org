I second Strugatsky brothers. As a hardcore fan of Soviet/Russian scifi I may be a little biased, but I think their work is pretty good. Most of their books are about things rationalists may find interesting.

- /Monday Begins on Saturday/ is about a programmer in a world of magic.

- /Hard to Be a God/ about the application of the concept of greater good and being a benevolent god.

- /Noon: 22nd Century/ is a series about a technocratic socialist utopia.
