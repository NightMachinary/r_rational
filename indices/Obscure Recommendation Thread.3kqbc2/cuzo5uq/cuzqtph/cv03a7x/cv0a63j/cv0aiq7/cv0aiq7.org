Back in April-June reddit did the whole [[/r/thebutton]] thing. mncke did some work on a bot that used a large number of donated accounts to press the button every time the countdown came close to zero, thus delaying the end of the button. I was active in one of the pro death factions, so I tagged a bunch of people from all the factions, and it's always fun to see them in different places all over reddit.
