Let me make a trip down to the downstairs library and see what I can dig up that I haven't recommended before ...

- /Roadside Picnic/ by Arkady and Brois Strugatsky. Not actually that obscure, but it's fairly old (1972) and translated from the original Russian. It says on the front cover that it was the basis for the /S.T.A.L.K.E.R./ video games, but I have no idea how true that is; they both clearly take a lot of inspiration from Chernobyl.
- /Newton's Cannon/ by Gregory Keyes. The protagonist is a young Benjamin Franklin, who is meddling with magic. It's got a lot of cool ideas in it. Unfortunately, later books in the series don't live up to the first one.
- /Invisible Cities/ by Italo Calvino is a weird book that takes the frame of Marco Polo speaking to Kubla Khan about a variety of cities that he's seen during his travels. It's sort of surreal and directionless, the sort of book that it's better to read a chapter at a time instead of bingeing.

I think everything else doesn't fit the criteria of obscurity well enough. My recommendations not calibrated for obscurity can be found [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2pdug7/qhey_rrational_what_are_you_all_reading_right_now/cmvvp1o][here]].
