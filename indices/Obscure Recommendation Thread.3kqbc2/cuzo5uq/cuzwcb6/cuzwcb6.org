  It says on the front cover that it was the basis for the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. video games, but I have no idea how true that is; they both clearly take a lot of inspiration from Chernobyl.

Roadside Picnic inspired the movie Stalker by Tarkovski, which the video game is (very roughly) based on. I suspect that they had initially wanted it to be more reminiscent of the film, but ended up simplifying it due to development taking too long already.

By the way, neither Roadside Picnic nor the film Stalker take any inspiration from Chernobyl.
