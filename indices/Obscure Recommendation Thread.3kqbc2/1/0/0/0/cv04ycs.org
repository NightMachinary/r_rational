I tried the Bartimaeus trilogy a while ago, got about 1/3rd of the way into the first book before putting it down and never going back to it. It was a fair bit back and I don't recall why I didn't like it, but I can add myself as a data point into the overarching phenomenon of older readers not getting into it.
