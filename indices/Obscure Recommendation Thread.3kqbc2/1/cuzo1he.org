- The Screwtape Letters by C.S. Lewis (famous author but I think this is one of his is pretty obscure) is about a devil in Hell sending letters to his nephew about how to be better at tempting people. I'm not Christian but I still enjoyed it a lot. Excellent humor.

- Penpal is an excellent horror story written by someone on [[/r/nosleep]] that is quite good. It's not rational but I loved the way the author used foreshadowing. It's also really interesting how scary it is even without anything supernatural going on. Probably obscure outside of reddit.

I also read a lot of YA novels years ago that are probably still very enjoyable for older readers:

- Anything by Neal Shusterman, whose stories tend to explore the psychological and social effects of interesting scifi concepts. I especially recommend Unwind, which takes place in a dystopian America where parents can choose to give up their teen children so that every organ in their body can be harvested (they're legally considered to still be alive since every part of them is still alive, just in a divided state). Lots of interesting political commentary, but I wouldn't read the sequels since the first book is the best and stands very well on its own. Also by him and excellent: Everlost (does some really cool worldbuilding with ghosts and even some munchkinry by some of the more intelligent characters), Bruiser, Full Tilt, and The Dark Side of Nowhere.

- [[http://www.amazon.com/Sea-Trolls-Trilogy/dp/0689867468/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1442111847&sr=1-1&keywords=the+sea+of+trolls][The Sea of Trolls]] series by Nancy Farmer. This story is a real treat if you know anything about Norse mythology. And even if you don't, the use of both Norse and British Isles cultures, religion, and history makes the worldbuilding very interesting. It's about an apprentice bard in the British Isles named Jack who gets kidnapped by Vikings during a raid and ends up on a series of adventures to free himself and his sister, including an expedition to Jotunheim. There's also a lot of interesting historical stuff going on in the background like the diminishing presence of the pagan religions and the rise of Christianity.

- I'm not sure whether this is actually obscure, but the Bartimaeus Trilogy is excellent. It's about a young magician named Nathaniel in a magical version of our world where magicians get most of their magic by summoning and forcing demons to do their will. Nathaniel summons a demon named Bartimaeus to get revenge on someone who humiliated him once and unknowingly gets involved in a conspiracy. The humor is some of the best I've seen, especially in Bartimaeus's pov, and uses footnotes. Also lots of interesting stuff about how about how a society built on slavery affects the magicians of their world, who control the government. Now that I look back on it, it might have actually been a commentary on British Imperialism, though I was too young to see that back then.

- Deltora Quest is a children's book series by an Australian author set in a medieval fantasy nation similar to Australia but somehow filled with even more deadly and unusual wildlife. The main character and his friends try to free their kingdom from the rule of the Shadow Lord by finding all the gems of the magical belt of Deltora. The setup is a pretty standard adventure story but there's a ridiculous amount of puzzle solving that I think should be pretty entertaining to a rationalist. I actually considered writing a rational version of this story once because the setting seems to practically run on puzzle solving with each of the main characters bringing different strengths to the solving of each puzzle. The setting is also very unique for a medieval fantasy with many unusual and dangerous magical creatures introduced in each book. The plot is very entertaining and has a ridiculous number of twists. The twists are often also based on puzzles with things like word play being vital clues to future plot developments. Both the main characters and villains are very intelligent. A common saying in their world about the villain is "The Shadow Lord has many plans" being immortal and using that to his advantage such as by waiting for a weak king to take the throne to put his plans in motion and having backup plans for his backup plans.

- The Dark Lord of Derkholm by Diana Wynne Jones (and anything else by her really). A man from our Earth ends up controlling a medieval fantasy world via an extremely powerful demon he managed to contract. He forces them to act like people straight from a D&D game (complete with a fake dark lord and fake battles) to make money off of tourists from Earth as a side venture along with exploiting the mineral resources of their world. Very funny and plays on a lot of the tropes of medieval fantasy novels. You might have tangentially heard of one of the author's other books, Howl's Moving Castle, by way of the Ghibli anime adaptation. Both versions are different, excellent, and should be watched/read. Also by her and good: The Merlin Conspiracy and its prequel, the Chrestomanci series, etc.

For books that weren't originally in English, consider reading the following.

- The Mahabharata. It's a classic and I still enjoy it a lot even though I'm an atheist now. I'm still impressed by how complex its presentation of characters and morality were for its time. An abridged version might be more consumable though.
- [[http://www.amazon.com/Dream-Merchant-Works-Translation/dp/0763628808/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1442111651&sr=1-4&keywords=the+dream+merchant][The Dream Merchant]] by Isabel Hoving. A YA book about kids employed by a company that uses them to travel through the dreams of mankind, like Inception but on a much wider scale. I don't remember much about this one but it was very good.
- Mimus by Lilli Thal. Another YA book about a crown prince of a medieval kingdom who gets captured by the enemy country and forced into working as an apprentice jester. He struggles to cope with defeat and along the way the previously pampered prince becomes a more mature person. Complex characters and a surprisingly realistic and detailed look into how life in a medieval castle might have been. It was also nice to see a jester, a character often in the background of a medieval story, be the main character.

If you want more recommendations let me know, I left a bunch of obscure YA books I loved off of this list because there's just so many (I read literally hundreds or maybe thousands of books as a teenager and kept track of them).
