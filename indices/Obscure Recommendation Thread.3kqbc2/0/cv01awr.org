Steven Brust is surprisingly poorly known. He writes really excellent fantasy novels. Read them in order of publication. The Taltos books are unreservedly awesome - they're different episodic adventures within the life of Vlad Taltos, a human within an empire of Elfs. The Phoenix Guards books have a very unusual style that some people cannot abide while others, such as myself, enjoy greatly - try the first before buying the rest. The Phoenix Guards and it's 4 sequels are very consciously modelled on Dumas' Three Musketeers.

Kage Baker wrote some really weird stuff. One of them, The Anvil of The World, stands alone and is unreservedly extremely good. The House of The Stag is not quite as good and set in the same world, and the Bird of the River is not nearly as good. The Anvil of The World is about a man who travels through a fantasy world who has the power to be superhumanly competent at killing things, trying to get by in a world of vendetta. Baker's "The Company" books are mostly exceptionally strange time-travelling romance novels which are unlike anything else but are pretty good overall - the setting concept is a Company has been established to loot the past of things that they won't notice being missed (items lost in shipwrecks or fires, etc), and to serve as historians.

K J Parker has written a lot of novels that don't get talked about much. They're almost all really good, especially the Fencer trilogy and the Engineer trilogy. The Engineer Trilogy is about a foreman who is forced to leave a rigid city and his efforts to get back to his wife and child at /any/ cost to the world.

John Varley writes amazing transhumanist sci-fi. Start with Steel Beach, the story of a news reporter living on Luna in the far future. Read all his other books in that overarching storyline, especially The Golden Globe. Don't neglect the short stories, those are really good too.

Dan Simmons is mentioned very little on here. Hyperion and The Fall of Hyperion are amazing stories about a disparate group of pilgrims come to a frontier colony world in times of war, in hopes of fulfilling various desires even at the cost of their own lives, who have their backstories explained along the way. Endymion and The Fall of Endymion, two sequels, are more standard adventure stories that in the series following Hyperion, but they aren't really necessary and I'd only bother if you absolutely loved Hyperion. His other works are largely forgettable.

We discuss the works of Roger Zelazny shockingly little. His Lord of Light and Creatures of Light and Darkness are both amazing. Lord of Light is about futuristic humans masquerading as Gods and reincarnating people by copying their memories into new bodies, with a strong focus on Hindu and Buddhist myth. His Amber books have a strong start but get too complicated, and the sequel series (books 6-10) are actually not good.

Gene Wolfe writes amazingly deep and complicated fantasy / sci-fi novels. Go read the four parts of the Book of the New Sun (about a torturer expelled from his guild wandering a far-future Earth). Sometimes it is collected in a pair of duologies (Shadow and Claw, Sword and Citadel).
