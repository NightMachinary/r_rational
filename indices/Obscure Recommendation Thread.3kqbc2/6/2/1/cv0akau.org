Chatoyance has several webcomics, and they're all fairly awful. Fortunately she seems to be quarantined in the Conversion Bureau setting, though she escapes occasionally to grace the Optimalverse with her blatant CelestAI proponence. It's about an alien intelligence converting humanity into small technicolor horses, so it makes sense.
