I recommended the educational /Sherlock Holmes/ books /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76261][The Einstein Paradox]]/ and /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1130873][Conned Again, Watson!]]/ quite a few months ago [[http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ki3ey/eduffthe_einstein_paradox_conned_again_watson/][here]].

/[[http://stefangagne.com/sailornothing/][Sailor Nothing]]/, which I recommended [[http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/37k3vf/dcrt_sailor_nothing_same_author_as_floating_point/crnd391][here]] three months ago, might also count as somewhat obscure, as it was written fifteen years ago, even if the author is still known nowadays for other works (/City of Angles/, /Floating Point/).

I found /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46128][Perseverance Island: The Robinson Crusoe of the Eighteenth Century]]/ to be pretty cool. It has been pointed out [[https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1127697713][here]], however, that the book isn't particularly rational.

/[[http://unicornjelly.com/][Unicorn Jelly]]/ is a rather ancient webcomic by [[http://www.fimfiction.net/user/Chatoyance][a person]] who is nowadays somewhat (in)famous in the /MLP: FIM/ community. It's been several years since I tried reading it (I got bored of it after a while, though I loved the art style), but I do vaguely remember that it was somewhat interesting and included some cosmology stuff.

For books translated into English, there are always the little-loved sequels ([[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1259][1]] [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2609][2]] [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2681][3]] [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2710][4]] [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2759][5]]) to /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1257][The Three Musketeers]]/. Project Gutenberg's translations of them aren't the best, but I found them fairly entertaining.
