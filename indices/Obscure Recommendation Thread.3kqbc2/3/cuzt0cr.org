Stanislaw Lem is generally a good bet. /Solaris/ is probably best known because of the movie adaptations. Also notable are /His Master's Voice/, which has pretty much grounded in the real world top scientists as the protagonists and /The Cyberiad/, which is basically a book of fairytales written by a post-human civilization. (The internet says you should make sure to get Michael Kandel's translation of /The Cyberiad/ if you're reading it in English, there are bad Lem translations around and the book has some tricky wordplay bits.)

Thomas Ligotti is a sort of spiritual heir to H.P. Lovecraft, who goes for the raw cosmic horror angle instead of getting fixated on a cthulhu critter menagerie, and mixes in some Kafka-esque nihilism about humanity and society. Mostly writes short stories, basically pick any book you find and start reading.

Don't know how well known Bruce Sterling is these days, his /Schismatrix/ was pretty much my favorite SF book in the 90s. /Holy Fire/ is also good. Then I found /Zeitgeist/ really weird and haven't read his later books.

Ian Watson writes somewhat surreal high-concept SF. I liked the cognitive-sciency /The Embedding/ and the short stories in /Salvage Rites/.

Flann O'Brien's /The Third Policeman/. Just go read it.
