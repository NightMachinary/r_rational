"Kid Radd", a completed webcomic, which starts as a simple 1980's video game parody, and ends up as a rather impressive full-fledged story with various philosophical musings. One version can be read at [[https://www.bgreco.net/kidradd.htm]] , and you may want to check the summary at [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/KidRadd]] to double-check if you're interested.

Fox's "Peter Pan and the Pirates", a non-Disney-based interpretation of the classic tale, much to be preferred to most other cartoon versions, from the opening sequence on to exploring what happens if Peter decides to grow up.

"The Odyssey", a 1992 TV series which starts by having the protagonist fall into a coma, and stay there for two seasons, as he travels through what may be his subconscious and may be a parallel world. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOdyssey]] , [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Odyssey_%28TV_series%29]] , and depending on your local jurisdiction, you may be able to find the episodes [[https://kat.cr/usearch/odyssey%20-american%20-cosmos%20-plant%20-space%20-human%20-black%20-bbc%20-itv%20-garden%20-greek%20-cousteau%20-tattoo%20-smallville%20-volcano%20-nature%20-nolans%20-arrow%20-survivor%20-national%20-rick%20-cave%20-odyssey5%20-%22odyssey%205%22category%3Atv/?field=files_count&sorder=desc][here]].

"Spellbinder", another 1990's kids-oriented show involving parallel worlds. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spellbinder_%28TV_series%29]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spellbinder:_Land_of_the_Dragon_Lord]] . Or, from just 5 years ago, "Stormworld", [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormworld]] . (I'm just now realizing how many Commonwealth-produced parallel-reality kids shows I've enjoyed...)
