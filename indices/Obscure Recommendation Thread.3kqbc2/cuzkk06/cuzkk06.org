From my own recommendations, it would have to be:

- Anything by [[http://www.amazon.com/Octavia-E.-Butler/e/B000AQ1SQE][Octavia Butler]], especially Kindred, Fledgling, and Wild Seed.

- [[http://www.amazon.com/Medicus-Novel-Empire-Petreius-Mystery-ebook/dp/B0013TX7NY/ref=sr_1_7?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1442106287&sr=1-7&keywords=ruth+downie][Medicus]] by Ruth Downie.

- Anything by [[http://www.amazon.com/Robin-McKinley/e/B000AQ1OUY/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_1][Robin McKinley]], especially The Hero and the Crown, Beauty, and Sunshine. She's an unusual author, because I can't really tell any commonality between the people who I've met who has read her books and it's a bit hit-and-miss for whether or not a fellow bibliophile has heard of her. Her works seem to belong to the genre of fantastical adventure, but with twists to the story narrative to make it more of a slice-of-life style.
