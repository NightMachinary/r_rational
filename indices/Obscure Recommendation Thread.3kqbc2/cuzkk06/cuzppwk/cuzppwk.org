Can we talk about Octavia Butler? I tried reading her Xenogenesis trilogy and I just thought it was so bad. It's not good sci-fi, it feels like she's recycled common sci-fi tropes to get her point across. Like how 'hierarchical tendencies' is why humans are not as advanced as they could be. Wtf are heirarchical tendencies?

She also seems to eschew characters with white skin for whatever reason. A black-chinese baby is the protagonist of the trilogy. I'm sorry but I can't imagine that character without laughing aloud.
