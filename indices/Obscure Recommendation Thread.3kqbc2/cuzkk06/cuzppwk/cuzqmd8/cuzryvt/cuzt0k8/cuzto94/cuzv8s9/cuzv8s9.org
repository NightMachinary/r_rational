Yes, it's author specific. I would have no issues reading Snow Crash. (It's been on my to read list for too long)

The difference is Stephenson isn't trying to push a race agenda or for equality. IMO, you can't write a book while promoting your ideology. Ex: Atlas Shrugged.

There was a point in the book where the aforesaid baby says that plastic is the most evil thing created by man. What good sci-fi author would do this? She also seems to want to go back to an age without technology.

I'm not sure if I'm making a whole lot of sense here, it's probably better to read the books and judge for oneself.
