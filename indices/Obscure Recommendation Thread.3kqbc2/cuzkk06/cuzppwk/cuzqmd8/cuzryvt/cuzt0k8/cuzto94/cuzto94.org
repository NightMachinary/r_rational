Ah, sorry; Neal Stephenson wrote /Snow Crash/. I was wondering whether it was the authorship that mattered (whether it was okay when Stephenson did it but not when Butler did it).

Octavia Butler writes a lot of science fiction with themes of race and gender. This makes sense, because she's a black woman who grew up in 1950s America, and there's a long history of scifi authors taking what they see in the world and translating it into science fictional analogs to better grapple with the subject.
