  I'm particularly interested in books by non-American authors or foreign books with an English translation.

Dammit. Most foreign books I wanted to recommend aren't translated into English.

Still: [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1742699.Omega_Minor?from_search=true&search_version=service][Omega Minor]]. It's a very complex novel dealing with the Holocaust, but touching on a whole lot more. It's heavy on description and sometimes approaches poetry more than prose. It's complicated and beautiful. And as a bonus, the author did the English translation humself.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6913778-the-conqueror-s-shadow?from_search=true&search_version=service][The Conqueror's Shadow]], by Ari Marmell is also pretty good. It's about a retired villain/warlord who's retirement gets threatened by a new Big Bad Evil Guy. It's a fun little book with a lot of dark humor.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62031.The_City_of_Dreaming_Books?ac=1][The City of Dreaming Books]] is a book about books. The city it takes place in has more bookshops than you could imagine. It's build upon the catacombs of old libraries where bookhunters seek for rare first editions to sell topside. The entire thing is fantasy about books. It's pretty nice and it has pictures. (I like books with pictures that are still interesting for adults.)
