I'd like you to clarify what you mean by eschewing characters with white skin, as you've only supplied one example. And that's not nearly large enough to validate your claim. Also, on a more personal note, can you seriously not imagine a black chinese person? How ethnocentric can you be? That's like a Chinese person saying they can't imagine a white african without laughing.
