  IMO, you can't write a book while promoting your ideology. Ex: Atlas Shrugged.

Sure you can. I mean, this sub wouldn't have existed if it was for HPMOR, a work where the author has admitted to writing it in order to convince people of his ideas. Or take Cory Doctorow. Pirate Cinema is all about ideas he likes and finds interesting and it still manages to be an entertaining novel.

Why the hell wouldn't you be able/allowed to write a book from a perspective you are sympathetic to?
