I know a half black half Chinese guy, and a couple of half Chinese half Arab/Persian guys. I'm half Korean, half Persian. I do not find this surprising. There are lots of Chinese people and lots of black people on earth, or so I have been told.

Most people I know aren't white. Most people aren't white. I suspect exposure to people of different ethnicities has a lot more to do with physical location than anything else. Maybe you find non-white people surprising because you don't see a lot of them? In many places it's unusual to see people outside of your ethnicity so that would be a normal reaction. It's not the strangest thing for an author to use mostly non-white characters, especially since many authors use mostly white characters: authors often write what they know and what they've lived. Character ethnicities usually don't mean much to me.

I've read one story by Octavia Butler, Wild Seed, which was excellent. The two main characters were black, but for spoiler reasons their blackness wasn't relevant, and also it was literally set in Africa so I didn't find it surprising or off-putting in the slightest. I didn't even actively think about it or consider it might be unusual until you mentioned it now.
