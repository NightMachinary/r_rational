Honestly, the first ~3 books are probably the best the series gets, after that I feel like it went downhill pretty fast. If you didn't like the first one, I think the odds are very bad about you liking the other two, and totally dismal about liking the remainder of the series. Some of the third book has a bunch of thematic [[/r/rational]] probably really likes, [[#s][spoilers]] but honestly if you didn't like the first one I wouldn't force yourself through the second to get to the third, there are /many/ books.
