  Unicorn Jelly is a rather ancient webcomic by a person who is nowadays somewhat (in)famous in the MLP: FIM community. It's been several years since I tried reading it (I got bored of it after a while, though I loved the art style), but I do vaguely remember that it was somewhat interesting and included some cosmology stuff.>

The webcomic that started my 23+ tab morning relax, I have the hardcover and re-read it periodically.
