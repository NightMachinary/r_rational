  Unicorn Jelly[8] is a rather ancient webcomic by a person[9] who is nowadays somewhat (in)famous in the MLP: FIM community. It's been several years since I tried reading it (I got bored of it after a while, though I loved the art style), but I do vaguely remember that it was somewhat interesting and included some cosmology stuff.

Personally I enjoyed /Friendship is Dragons/ for employing one of my favorite deconstruction premises: look at any series you like, and deconstruct it by assuming it's actually all a table-top role-playing session underneath.
