Lately I've been really enjoying the Faction Paradox series of books and audios. It's a spinoff of a Doctor Who book (so probably as close to utter obscurity as one can get), but it has nothing to do with Doctor Who so it can be enjoyed by anybody. The book /Dead Romance/ is probably one of the best scifi stories I've read in the last several years. It's many shades of rational and engaging af. I have the Faction Paradox audios and a few ebooks (including /Dead Romance/), so if anyone wants, PM me.
