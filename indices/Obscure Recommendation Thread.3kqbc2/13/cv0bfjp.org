I forgot to include this story, [[http://www.amazon.com/The-Sad-Tale-Brothers-Grossbart/dp/0316049344/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_z][The Sad Tale of the Brothers Grossbart]]. It does a /great/ job of making the story enjoyable, despite (or is that because of?) the reader wishing the villainous protagonist brothers dead. It makes good use of strong black comedy.
