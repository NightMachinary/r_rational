If you're looking for some hard fantasy, I'd strongly recommend Rokka no Yuusha. It starts out looking like a typical medieval fantasy and quickly turns into a (relatively rational) locked room mystery. I've been having tons of fun with it, and it meets your criteria for a foreign book in translation.
