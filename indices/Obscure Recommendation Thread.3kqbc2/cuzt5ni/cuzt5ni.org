Not sure how obscure this is, but my favorite Big Epic Fantasy Novels lately have been by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Abraham_(author)][Daniel Abraham]]. My favorite series of his is probably the (completed) Long Price Quartet, which has some genuinely original ideas contained therein. His in-progress Dagger and the Coin series (4/5 books complete right now) is more conventional but still pretty good--and it has the bonus that the good guys are bankers, unsurprising for the author of [[http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/the-cambist-and-lord-iron-a-fairy-tale-of-economics/][The Cambist and Lord Iron]], an excellent rationalist story that has been linked on this sub before.

For more sci-fi/fantasy book recommendations, I tend to agree with the reviews of Andrew Plotkin (semi-famous as an author of IF games), which you can find [[http://eblong.com/zarf/bookscan/booklist.html][here]].
