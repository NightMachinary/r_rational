  Dan Simmons is mentioned very little on here. Hyperion and The Fall of Hyperion are amazing stories about a disparate group of pilgrims come to a frontier colony world in times of war, in hopes of fulfilling various desires even at the cost of their own lives, who have their backstories explained along the way. Endymion and The Fall of Endymion, two sequels, are more standard adventure stories that in the series following Hyperion, but they aren't really necessary and I'd only bother if you absolutely loved Hyperion. His other works are largely forgettable.

Hyperion, if you bother to trudge through all of it stuck me as a new atheist still angry at Christianity, or just horribly dystopian. I hesitate to call it Luddite fare but the impulse is definitely there.

That said your recommendation of Brust earned my upvote, I don't thinkl there is anything he's written I don't own other except cowboy feng. . .
