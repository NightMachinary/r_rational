What rule governs the absence of temporal paradox?

Do all people who would be willing to get themselves killed in order to try and cause a paradox happen to get causes that do not allow rigorous experiments?

I can hardly suppose some cause of death and then tell you a strategy to respond to it, because that strategy might make that cause of death not be spitted out in the first place, or warp probability in stranger ways.

Or would you be willing to play GM here? At any point, you may revise history, to simulate the machine's divinatory capabilities. My character is tired of the world and thinks that at least he might be able to end it all by causing a paradox, bringing about a cause of death different from the one given. What does the machine say?
