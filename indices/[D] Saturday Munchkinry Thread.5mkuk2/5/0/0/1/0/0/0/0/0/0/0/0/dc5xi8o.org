The problem with relying on DO NOT MESS WITH TIME style effect is that they're totally impotent against people who are extremely stubborn or dumb. I get why EY made time travel work that way, but it would be weird and nonsensical in a setting built rational from the ground up. I mean the whole DO NOT MESS WITH TIME message is a classic bootstrap paradox, and the time travel system (in HP and HPMoR) will just wipe people out of existence if they annoy it, while still leaving lots of evidence of their existence.

More importantly, people know that either the oracle is blatantly warping reality to conform to its predictions. Or we live in a world ruled by a capricious deity and the machine is simply reflecting that. Either result is basically the same, since the machine grants predictions in a way that is clearly intelligent, and then something is enforcing them with godlike power.
