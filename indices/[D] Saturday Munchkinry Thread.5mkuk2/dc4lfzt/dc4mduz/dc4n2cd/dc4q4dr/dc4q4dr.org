By an observatory on a mountain, I of course meant one to observe the ground. Do they need to target the surface, or can they spawn an avatar in mid-air/space? From a one-kilometre mountain, they could observe for 112 miles as if from point blank, and 112 more as if from a kilometre above. (Quadruple the height to double the range.)

They can use their avatars for global communication, by spawning avatars on the moon and lipreading/signspeaking (they might call it moonspeak :D ), or if they can't make their avatars move, blinking in and out in morse.
