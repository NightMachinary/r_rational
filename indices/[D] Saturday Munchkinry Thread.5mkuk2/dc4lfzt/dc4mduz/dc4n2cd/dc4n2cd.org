thanks for the reply :)

#2 works by magical items that they keep at their base, where they put the names (or magical imprint) of the foremost expert on a subject in a banner, which gives the rest of the species that ability. Magical items are specific to specific forms of combat (e.g. unarmed, short sword, long sword, crossbow etc.), and they don't have the ability to make more standards. It's unlikely they would progress to the point where they could make new ones or manipulate what they have in the time the story would take place.

I'm unsure how #3 could get a science victory? Like, I think it'd just be a slightly faster method of communication between each other since they could read surface thoughts, but surface thoughts don't move orders of magnitude faster than speech (I think). It would definitely not be a full mind-read ability, or faster thinking speed.

#4 could plop an avatar on the moon, but they don't have enhanced senses, so it wouldn't actually help them that much (though they'd know a fair amount about cosmology). They could definitely do astronomy way better than anyone else though.
