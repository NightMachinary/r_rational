Lurked for a long while, but figured getting feedback on this is probably worth delurking. I'm planning on writing either a quest (a la Marked for Death) or a story (exactly which depends mostly on if I'm creative enough to come up with a full story, or just the start of one that I currently have). Anyways, the premise is that there are a bunch of different sentient species each with their own super power, each trying to conquer/rule the world. I've tried to make the powers reasonably balanced, but would appreciate feedback on them, especially things I may have missed that make one power or the other incredibly overpowered. The setting has a tech level ~around the classical era, with occasional exceptions, and tons of monsters running around.

Race 1: Disguise/camouflage experts. They have hair/fur on the outside of their body which lets (sufficiently advanced users) disguise themselves approximately as good as advanced active camouflage systems, or take on the appearance of someone else (though they can't change their actual size, voice, or smell naturally).

Race 2: Combat experts. Each member of the race has the combat techniques of the most skilled currently surviving member of their race (determined by a national council, then put on the thing that grants everyone combat techniques) in any related method of combat. So basically everyone's a combat expert. They also have mideaval area personal weapons (so, steel and crossbows) where everybody else doesn't (at least at the start).

Race 3: Empathic Mind Readers. From birth, members of this race have enhanced empathy - they can determine what other people or animals are feeling. With training, this ability expands, and they're eventually able to understand stream of conscious thoughts from sentient beings.

Race 4: Explorers/spies. This race can project their senses of sight or hearing to the limit of what they can see. This ability doesn't compound, so you couldn't spy more than ~50 miles without using more than one person. Also, in the act of projecting their senses, it produces a bang, and a glowing avatar of themselves at the location they're observing from.

Race 5: Technomancers. This race has virtually no combat ability, and is not great at communicating with other races. It is, however able to manipulate electricity from the stump of their left arm. They also have a set of advanced mechas which they can pilot using impulses from their arm to control, but don't know how to make the mechas, and generally consider them to be demons they grant their life force to.
