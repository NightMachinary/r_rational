Maybe? But I'd posit it's better than the alternatives. Maybe reduce the weights slightly on it. Allow for less certainty. Some kind of well thought out clause to only include some sentient entities (the ones we know about) might be worth it to). Maybe instead of requiring the evaluation to be with the consequences make it require understanding of the motivation.
