Can I ask the AI to emulate me and speed up the emulation's thoughts so that the twelve hours becomes a few centuries? Alternatively, could it create a billion billion etc. emulations of me and organize them or help us organize ourselves, so we could divide into groups and just try to come up with an answer to any possible moral scenario? Could it do both?
