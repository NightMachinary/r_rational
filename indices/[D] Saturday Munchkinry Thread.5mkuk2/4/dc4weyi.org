Quick question for those who've seen [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_Machina_%28film%29][/Ex Machina/]] (*spoilers*).

Imagine you're transported into that universe and into Nathan Bateman's body, and it's [[https://i.imgur.com/dqEHX7s.png][the moment when Bateman originally confronted an escaped Ava in the corridor.]] What would you say\do to try to ensure both your survival and the most beneficial outcome for youself\humanity\AIs\etc?

Alternatively, imagine the same scenario only with you being transported into Ava's body instead.

In both options, you'll have a reasonable amount of time to think over your decisions before the moment “activates”.
