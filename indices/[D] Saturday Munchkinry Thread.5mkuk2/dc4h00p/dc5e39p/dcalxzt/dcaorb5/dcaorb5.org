See it's using your moral intuition /not just your preferences/. So by definition it will never make any decisions current you would find morally abhorrent because it's using /your/ moral system.\\
You could even make an argument that desiring it to have /any/ moral system other than your own would be a terrible idea. Since after all your moral intuitions are the only one's that you are guaranteed to agree with, so any other system will likely sometimes lead to outcomes you find horrifying, especially in the sort of edge cases that would be common in the post singularity world.
