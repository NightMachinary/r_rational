You have just been contacted by a newly-created superintelligent AI, which knows that "acting morally" is very important but doesn't know what that means. Having decided that you are the only human with an accurate conception of morality, it has asked you to define good and evil for it.

Important limitations:

- Because acting morally is soooooooo important, there's no time to lose! You only have twelve hours to compose and send your reply.
- You cannot foist the job onto someone else. You are the only being that the AI will trust.
- You must impart specific principles rather than say "Listen to whatever I happen to be saying at the moment." That would be a little too close to divine command theory, which the AI has already decided is kind of nonsense.
- You have only this one opportunity to impart a moral code to the AI. If you attempt to revise your instructions in the future, the AI will decide that you have become corrupted.
- If you choose to say nothing, then the AI will be left to fend for itself and in a few weeks conclude that paperclips are awfully important.

(And then, of course, once you've issued your reply, take a look at the other responses and make them go as disastrously wrong as possible)
