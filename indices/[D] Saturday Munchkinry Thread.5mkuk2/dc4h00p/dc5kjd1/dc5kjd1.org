I don't think it can be done. This is the AI Box problem, except that instead of having a human Gatekeeper, I have to write a set of rules that will gatekeep the AI's behaviour. Keeping it useful without giving it anything close to free reign. And it's near-impossible for the same reason as the AI Box problem is.

Can I just tell the AI "AIs are immoral, you should commit suicide and let humanity choose our own destiny"?
