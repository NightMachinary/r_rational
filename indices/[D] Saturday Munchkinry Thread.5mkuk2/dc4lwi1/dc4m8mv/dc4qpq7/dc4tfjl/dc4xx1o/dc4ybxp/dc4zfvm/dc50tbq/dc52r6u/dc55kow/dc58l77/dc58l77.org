"Ha-banana."

"Ha-I ha-can ha-speak!!!"

"Happy humans harvest ha-bananas ha-hourly!"

Congratulations you win!

Basically, the magical curse only allows me to speak English words known to the listener which starts with a H sound. But the curse allows for new "words" to be added over the course of a conversation as long as the speakers include a definition with the new word. This is to prevent nonsense words (especially ones that sound very similar to actual words) from being allowed.

Note that it doesn't allow for non-English words as a limitation imposed by the curse itself.

If I tried speaking to anyone else, then they would have to make the same statement as you did to allow me the same loophole. The curse is running off the listener's knowledge of H-words, so there isn't a solution to allow for me to be able to speak legibly to everyone.

"Ha-can ha-you ha-write ha-down ha-an ha-explanation ha-of ha-my ha-curse ha-to ha-show ha-to ha-others?"

(Can you write down an explanation of my curse to show to others?)
