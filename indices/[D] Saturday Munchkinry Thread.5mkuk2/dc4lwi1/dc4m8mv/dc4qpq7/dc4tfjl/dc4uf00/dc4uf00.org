"I like this. Obviously words, like Heaven and Hell can be divorced from their literal meanings and still be spoken. Must the 'H' be vocalized? Can you say 'honest' and 'hourly'? If so, can you say meaningless words like "hanana" and - if so in turn - can you say familiar words onto which you've mentally appended an introductory silent 'H'?"
