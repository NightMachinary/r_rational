You have met an individual with a particular speech defect. For some reason he appears to only speak words which start with a H, but you want to rigorously test the limits of the defect. It's a defect caused by magic, so he cannot communicate in any way other than verbally. He cannot write or sign. Body language is not allowed either.

What sort of words or questions would you test him on? I'll respond as if I am the character, but understand I might have difficulties responding if the appropriate words are not in the H section of a dictionary.

To stay in character and to simplify things, I'll say "Heaven" for yes and "Hell" for no.

Examples:

/"Hello human!"/

"Can you say hurt?"

/"Hurt."/

"Can you say time?"

/"Hell."/
