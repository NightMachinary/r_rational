Doing stuff in binary is probably the best solution, but you'd want much shorter bits. Something like "He" for yes and "Ho" for no.

Or perhaps morse code would be more practical because there are a lot more humans out there who already understand it and are practiced with interpreting it.

As a side question, can he say words in languages other than English that also start with H? or whatever equivalent that language has.

Can he say "words" that have no meaning in English or any language but nonetheless start with H when written phonetically?
