I'd start with checking if he could spell out words in "binary" ("Heaven" for 1, "Hell" for 0). If he can spell "Time" (A=1..Z=26) as "Heaven-Hell-Heaven-Hell-Hell, Hell-Heaven-Hell-Hell-Heaven, Hell-Heaven-Heaven-Hell-Heaven, Hell-Hell-Heaven-Hell-Hell" after I explain the encoding, I'll know that he can a) understand, if not reproduce, written language, and b) understand, if not reproduce, non-H concepts.
