A thing I've been thinking about on and off (but will probably never actually write the story it's attached to):

You're stuck in a groundhog day time loop that forces you to repeatedly relive 2016 over and over again (covering the full span of the year), with no end in sight or insight possible as to the origin of this loop.

You start the loop with no particularly notable resources (say "generically middle class westerner").

What do you do? What major geopolitical events can you effect? What do you start doing once you get /really/ bored of this loop?
