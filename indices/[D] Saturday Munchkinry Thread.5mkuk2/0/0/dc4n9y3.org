An important fact is whether or not death ends the loop. All signs point to no, which is probably good because as number of loops approaches infinity, the chance of death would also approach infinity.

First loop, I would try to do it all at once. I'd probably think it's some cheesy 'right what went wrong' thing regarding 2016 and I'd try my best to abuse what little I specifically remembered of main!2016 to improve this world. An obvious candidate would be trying to resolve the whole 'coup in Turkey' thing to my satisfaction. Chances are, though, I wouldn't get too much done, since I haven't paid attention to good opportunities.

Second loop, I'd probably change my running theory to 'indefinite looping unless evidence otherwise'. Since I'd be considering this as a possibility in the first loop, I'd have memorized an event early in the year that I couldn't have possibly predicted to convince my family. At the same time, I'd also memorize key financial events that I can hopefully use to gain the resources I'd need to do more.

By third loop, I'd be fairly confident that I'm in a time loop with no specified end. I'd repeat the event/stock market thing to get my family believing me and get us enough money to do more things. I'd also stop going to university, since not only have I gone through that year three times, but I receive literally no benefits to staying anymore. While I attempt to figure out key events surrounding events I care about changing and how to influence them, I'd try to get practice getting important people to pay attention when I tell them things. While abusing a loop to get personal secrets out of someone can work in a pinch, it'd be just better if I could present myself as genius millionaire (from my nigh-precognitive stock investments and uncanny prediction of events) and get people to listen when I tell them that there's going to be an attempted coup in Turkey, for instance.

From there on, optimize. Find the best ways to gather money and influence at my leisure, because in the loops (or just parts of loops) I'm not figuring out the first steps of "how to take over the world in less than a year" I'll be blowing exorbitant amounts of money on all sorts of stupid things. I don't have to care about long-term health, so I can eat as much of whatever I want, especially near the end of the year, and be back to healthy at the start. I'd develop a habit of buying whatever strikes my fancy, and being able to play video games for as long as I want.

Things really kick into high gear at my first death, though. It'll happen sooner or later, when my more careless attitude gets me run over or my increasingly optimized mercantile-political empire somehow gets a bullet in my head for one reason or another. I wake up on the new year again, safe and sound, and a grin would form on my face, since I'd have been fairly confident of this outcome but obviously not willing to check for myself.

Now I don't have to have /any/ restraint if I don't want to. I can go into warzones and try to identify important members and their locations throughout the year, without fear of getting caught. I can use any means necessary to break into high-security facilities to find any truth I need. I can kidnap and torture people for information if I need to, without fearing getting killed in retribution. Though granted, the last option would be unappealing, but if all other options are exhausted and I just /need/ to have that information, then I might consider it.

After I've optimized enough, the world is my playground. I could figure out how to hack the US elections and get myself made president, I could hack the US elections to get Harambe made president and, if I can manage it, prevent the decision from being overruled (perhaps through sufficient blackmail). You probably know the drill after this. I do wild and crazy things that I couldn't have done without years of practice on my first try, become famous, make my dog famous, engage in all sorts of reckless and/or insane activities just to see if I can, in between loops where I build an empire that swallows the world by mid-April at the latest, and such a scenario would only increase the options for tomfoolery I have. Imagine a world where the supreme emperor, who conqured the world in a span of two months, decrees that all pants must be bright red, on pain of having a bucket of red paint dumped on you, with squads specifically sent out to enforce this. There's an incredibly large number of things that can go wrong in such a scenario, but with infinite time I can notice them all and figure out ways to stop them.

I'd also try my best to remember the pieces of information that most quickly elevate our technology levels, so as to let even more impressive feats be accomplished under my +eternal+ one year reign.
