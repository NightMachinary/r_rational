  No, it merely needs that there aren't many remaining breakthroughs needed along the shortest possible route.

See the problem is that you assume because advancements are /somewhat/ random, that they don't have any limiting factors. Not to mention even the most optimistic singularity estimates place it decades away, so I don't really think many people in the area would say there aren't many breakthroughs left. You can take as many independent groups of WW2 era scientists as you want working for a year, but you aren't going to get an iphone.\\
Also you are forgetting that no serious people are actually trying to make AGI /right now/ there's just too much ground that needs to be broke first. Even if a bunch of people through sheer chance had all the needed insights in that year, it would take longer than a year to implement that sort of thing.

Sure you could imagine say quantum noise eventually creating a AGI ex nihilo on a supercomputer. However /by far/ the most likely way a AGI gets created is because of your interference. So either you try to work on creating one safely, or eventually by chance you have a mental breakdown or some other thing makes you create an AGI.
