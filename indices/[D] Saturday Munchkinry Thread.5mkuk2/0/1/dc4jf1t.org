We're far enough along the timeline that this ends in AGI that hacks my brain into respawning it one way or another. The goal is, as always, to solve FAI, and secondarily to reliably slow down this year's AGI research. I'm not sure how well mundane brainwashing via e.g. torture by intelligence agencies works, so start with research on that. If that's not a problem, go public, and reap the benefits of all the other ideas in this thread, along with bringing back the public's FAI research.

I might want to kill myself prematurely to keep AGI researchers doing mostly the same things - and that means that I should probably set up a way to only reveal the loop to the right people after a few iterations, because otherwise unauthorized researchers might try to deliberately randomize their approaches to get their AI through. Of course, that only works if the loop resets upon my death, instead of running through the rest of the year, which might spawn an AGI that finds all the glitches in the loop setup - but this is all the part of the plan that the public can contribute to.
