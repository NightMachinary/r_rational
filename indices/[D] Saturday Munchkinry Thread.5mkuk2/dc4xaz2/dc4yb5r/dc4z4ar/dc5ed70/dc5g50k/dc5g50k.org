Let's say it says HUBRIS, so you say, "OK, I will be very humble and live my life as a simple farmer because I am going to prove that damn machine wrong!", or whatever. You live your life as a simple farmer, and then, one day, and aeroplane falls out of the sky and lands on your house, killing you instantly. Turns out the pilot hadn't completed all their pilot training but flew anyway, so you are dead because of their hubris.

That's what ultimately would happen, I would guess; you'd get a prediction that would be vague enough to work for your paradox testing, but also be able to apply to a "normal" cause of death.
