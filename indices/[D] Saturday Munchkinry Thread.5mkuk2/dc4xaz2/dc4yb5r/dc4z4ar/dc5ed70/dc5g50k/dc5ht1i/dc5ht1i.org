The weird thing about this scenario is that as soon as the machine goes public the majority of deaths are likely to become somewhat or /extremely/ unusual. For instance if somebody was going to die of some disease then they will likely take every precaution against it (because at least starting out most people can't just accept their death so easily) so as a result there will no longer be much of a link between environmental factors and death. In addition most causes of death are not rapid and totally unexpected so many people would kill themselves if they got news of contracting the illness that will kill them, just so they can go out on their own terms. As a result initially it seems unavoidable that most deaths will seem to be at least somewhat contrived, and that there would be a massive number of /absurdly/ unlikely deaths.

Ok yeah I should specify that the only person who can circumvent death predictions that way would be someone who is willing to kill themselves just to try to screw up the prediction, but isn't suicidally depressed.

If it says hubris then just kill yourself, it doesn't really seem like hubris would make sense as a cause of death there. If it says paradox testing /then/ you might try to live your life normally. Obviously the thing to consider there is that you might get killed in some unrelated paradox testing incident so it can still kill you after all.\\
However there would probably be a significant number of suicidal or extremely stubborn people starting out. Who would be willing to go to great lengths to avoid feeling like their fates are being controlled.\\
So for those people it might say stubbornness and then have them killed by the stubborn actions of someone else, but how do you arrange that for millions of people?
