Ok the part that indicates the intelligence is the predictions of the machine. Thus why I think there's intelligence somewhere in the system. I the machine/underlying system was totally unintelligent you would expect predictions that won't lead to a massive number of extremely contrived scenarios to kill off people who try to defy the predictions. For instance it might say that they die because of cell death within the brain, however the types of predictions it does hand out obviously reek of agency.

  You can model a Novikov self-consistent timeline as a simple Monte-Carlo simulation that resets if there's a paradox. It's computationally expensive, because you're brute-forcing it, but it doesn't imply an intelligent agent flying around warping reality to conform to the predictions.

See just relying on self consistency doesn't make much sense either, since having the machine invented in the first place will necessarily lead to a reality that involves a much higher number of extraordinarily unlikely events.
