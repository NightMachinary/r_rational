It's really not, you're overcomplicating things.

You can model a Novikov self-consistent timeline as a simple Monte-Carlo simulation that resets if there's a paradox. It's computationally expensive, because you're brute-forcing it, but it doesn't imply an /intelligent agent/ flying around warping reality to conform to the predictions.
