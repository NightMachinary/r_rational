Oh, good idea! They wouldn't be able to make their avatars move (in fact, turning their avatar's head to see something else would require a separate casting), but morse on the moon would totally be doable, and could be more information heavy, since experienced casters could manipulate the shape of their avatar while casting (as in, make it look one way or another, not look physically different). And yeah, I had before imagined that they'd spread a communication network across mountaintops so they could use words, but it probably makes more sense to use the moon and a binary code.

My initial thought is that targeting things it's a skill they need to learn, and would always need to make sure their avatar was in an area with low enough density (so no forming in rock, or mostly inside a wall, but forming in mid-air would be possible if you were skilled enough, but not an easy thing).

Obviously, there are physics problems with relativity which arise with this (the avatar is stationary with respect to what (Earth or Moon makes a huge difference)), but fortunately the background I've written provides enough justification for that problem to not cause the universe to break. Would probably be something experienced casters could exploit with enough practice, but your average #4 couldn't do.
