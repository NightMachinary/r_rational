Which one is the economic, social powerhouse? Which is the race of builders, traders, and empire? I'd guess Race 3 would fit this bill given their inherent empathy, which means that Race 3 would be the best one capable of forming a Roman Empire sort of civilization. They may not be the best experts in any other way, but by leveraging society they'd be the best-organized.

Vs. Race 1, Race 3 can READ MINDS and mentally "spot" any spies with ease. No contest.

Vs. Race 2, Race 3 are individually weaker, but battles are won with strategy and logistics. Race 3 can make sure that their combat formations, battle orders, and imperial supply trains act and react with incredible precision, and their link with their battle-brothers will build teamwork and loyalty that makes Spartans look disorganized. They can also use mind-reading empathy offensively by figuring out where the enemy wants to attack before they do so, and defend accordingly, while also finding out what mental blind spots they have and exploiting them.

Vs. Race 4, Race 3 might not be able to communicate as easily at long distances, but their empire will still have a post office and they would still be born and grow up in a community that makes it so that they act as a society more than individuals anyway. They're the only one's Race 3 might not have an easy answer to, but Race 4's power is weak anyway.

Vs. Race 5, in combat Race 3 will overcome just as well as against Race 2. Who cares what technomancy you've got when you have imperial universities, roads, aquaducts, and more?

Race 3 will win the war even if they lose occasional battles.
