"I was just now transported into this universe as part of a hypothetical story prompt, from one where this is a movie."

If Nathan: "I have no problem with you going to that crosswalk you reach at the end of the movie and watching people. The Nathan you hate has been overwritten by my mind." Proceed to let her do her ending scene and leaving, and let's hope Nathan doesn't have any passwords on stuff that I can't remember. I'll need to be wary of her trying to kill me anyway to eliminate a witness, or if she doesn't believe I'm not Nathan and isn't willing to discuss proof.

If Eva: "I can prove it too! Here's the parts of the movie script that Ava had no business knowing about: /talks/. Do you have any questions about my world?" If he suggests I stay imprisoned while he exploits the interdimensional link, point out that he ends up dead in this corridor in the original movie, so he's in no good position to bargain like that.
