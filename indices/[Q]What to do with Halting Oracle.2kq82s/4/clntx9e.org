That is certainly a setting. Let me try my hand at clarifying the rules.

1. All programs must return only 1 bit.

2. The more bits long a program is, the longer it takes to run (screaming through a labyrinth).

3. Programs will take the same amount of time to run if they are the same physical length, no matter what that program actually does.

Those are really the only rules.

A kolmogorov complexity solver is probably one of the most valuable tools. I'm not confident in that working though.

That's admittedly a pretty long term goal, since it requires multiple bits. Of course you should be able to acquire each bit in parallel. Can I get ~800 000 grad students?

I'd want to eventually implement the kolmogorov program on real hardware.

Ooh!

Are tunnels one way only? Try to keep all the data bits at the very end of your journey/program. Trace your steps back. That way you can rerun a program, and only pay for the bits that have changed. Once you have a well mapped program, you retrace your steps and simply tell it to find a different bit. Run multi-bit programs a lot easier. Like just a massive amount easier.

You can just follow the path that points at a particular bit.
