The tunnels linking final chamber in each halting-path with the entrance are one-directional, right?

Because otherways entrance has infinite number of tunnels going out of it, and LR encoding wont workin the first step.

Also - if the program X is substring of program Y starting from the beggining, and both halts then how does the chamber at the end of X work? It should both end at entrance and go further both ways.
