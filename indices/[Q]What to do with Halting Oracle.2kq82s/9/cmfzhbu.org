I'd send robots instead of researchers so I don't have to worry so much about losing them.

How exactly does the pattern work? Could you send one person (or robot) through the majority of the program to find the shortest proof of P != NP and stick a marker in that room, and send everyone else entering in what bit they want backwards to see if they end up in the same place? Or if that has to be somewhere in the middle of the program, you could enter in the first half forwards, the last half backwards, and just have someone move back and forth between those two spots to find each bit of the program.

Quantum physics takes huge amounts of computing power to model, but writing a program for it shouldn't be too long. You could do things like protein folding without too much difficulty.
