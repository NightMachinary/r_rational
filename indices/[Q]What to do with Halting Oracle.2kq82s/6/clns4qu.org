I wonder if the explorers even kept going after that ... Cthulhu can slumber for a few more centuries, while we exploit his alien geometries.

No, I don't think it would impact my values or devalue creativity in my mind -- not before reading a few eloquent online editorials on the philosophical impact of this labyrinth, at least.

Right now all my proposals are boring -- Ã  la "claim the prizes to the Millennium Problems," etc, so I think I'll just wait for someone smarter to come along and munchkin the fuck out of this. In the meanwhile: Thanks, [[/u/lvwolb]], for coming up with this creative question! I love this idea and would definitely read a story about this.
