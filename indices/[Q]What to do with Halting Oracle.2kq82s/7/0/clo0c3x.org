Sooo....you can basically solve any algorithm that outputs "halt" or "not halt" within a pre-defined time limit (essentially, any algorithm with a binary output) right?

How does that translate to "you can prove any mathematical theorem or prove that it cannot be proven or disproven"? Is it okay to say that all mathematical theorems can be proved via solving some algorithm with a single binary output?
