I'm sorry if this answer is taking the story behind the problem too seriously, rather than considering what the implications of a halting oracle would be, but, I would do my best to bar any entry into the labyrinth.

R'lyeh is the home and abode of Cthulhu, and I am not willing to risk advancing his potential awakening by delving into the city. He is extraordinarily powerful, on a personal level and a political one, given his ability to corrupt minds, and unless I could independently verify that we could use the oracular nature of the tunnels to gain power comparable, or preferably much great than Cthulhu (which seems rather unlikely, given he apparently has the power to create a structure such as R'lyeh), I don't think keeping them open would be worth it. Better to delay his arrival and ascend some other way.
