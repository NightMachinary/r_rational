Wait, what's your confidence level in what you're saying here? Is this something you're casually conjecturing, confidently believe, or a proven and known property of halting oracles that I can read about somewhere? Because what you're saying is strongly violating my (very underdeveloped) math intuition.

I'm having trouble figuring out how you could ever use an algorithm to systematically go through an uncountable set. (For example, try making an algorithm to "systematically" go through the irrational numbers. What does it even /mean/ to systematically go through them?)

I think you have to /at least/ narrow down that if a correct proof exists, it exists within a countable set of proofs, before that would work.
