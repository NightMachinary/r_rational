You could just throw as much information as you can at it and directly do Solomonoff induction on it to find all patterns. Throw some physics at it, throw some stock data at it, etc.

You could prove any true mathematical theorem or prove that it cannot be proven or disproven.

You can break any encryption scheme.

You can solve any finite-time computable problem efficiently as long as the output is small.

edit: You ought to be able to do mathematically optimal science in some way. Do Solomonoff induction on a video feed and have some sort of model of requests for actions you can do then somehow figure out what action differentiates the most TMs that model the data accurately. It would take a long time to catch up to human science but it ought to work if you do it just right. You'd have to worry a bit about it turning into omniscient unfriendly AI. It'll probably be fine! :P
