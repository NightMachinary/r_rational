It's easy to convert a halting oracle to run any finite computation immediately. Let's say the output is 20 bits long. First, ask whether the program that computes the first bit of the output, and runs forever if that bit is 0, else halts, halts, etc.

I do not know of anything productive to humanity's situation to do with an infinitely powerful but slow computing device. If it were faster, one could maybe use it to make money on the stock market and use that to do something productive.

This seems mostly equivalent to the standing problem, "What the hell do you actually do with an Oracle that gets humanity out of its trouble?"
