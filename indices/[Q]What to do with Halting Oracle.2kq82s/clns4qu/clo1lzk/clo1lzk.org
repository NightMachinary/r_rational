Re philosophical impact.

You have an easily accessible physical embodiment of the entire platonic world. This is crazytown! (well, the computationally accessible part, which is everything which matters for us humans anyway)

Suppose you can do mind-uploads. What is the point? An uploaded mind is, necessarily, a "platonic and immortal" entity. What are the ethical reasons to run the program and not stop & delete it?

One possible answer is that you inscribe some value to "physical reality", as opposed to "platonic reality". Cthulhu's labyrinth already contains all computations, so this answer evaporates.

Re creativity:

Most disciplines of intellectual endeavor rely on a fundamental asymmetry: It is easier to appreciate a great work than to create it. If writing is as easy as reading, what is the point in reading?

In this viewpoint, a (much weaker!) SAT-oracle already kills creativity: Just write a program, which rates a musical piece for its beauty (worst case, using mind-uploads). Then run your SAT-oracle and spit out the most beautiful piece of 1-hour music, ever! No need for human composers anymore! No need for programmers, mathematicians, philosophers, thinkers, writers!

Btw, this is a fun setting for a scifi/fantasy story, where P=NP. To me, a world where NP-complete problems can be solved in reasonable time is most terrifying. Human intellectual endeavor would be reduced to playing chess or Go, or other games (which, funnily, are not in NP).

Re story: Maybe I'll write more of it at some point. But feel free to take the setting and run with it! Quite frankly, I suck at writing and would rather read somebody else's well-written story than writing it myself. I just like the setting.
