Fights between named are always a tossup, though there is more weight on the side of Heroes than Villains of course. It wouldn't be much of a story, though, if it was never possible for a Villain to defeat a Hero, and so that is always possible.

But Apostle wasn't facing down a Villain. She was facing down a horde of powerful, but still ultimately mundane, zombies. It's already been established that Named can scythe through arbitrary numbers of mundanes with near-impunity, and so her ability to do so is unsurprising.
