I think part of what I admittedly like about Cat as a character is the acknowledgement of both Scorched's humanity as a boy who honestly deserved better in so many ways, but also the colder military uses that he could have contributed. Also love the fact that she's upfront about Stalwart's lesser value to her both as a named asset and also as her being no more deserving of life than Scorched. Like its totally more than a little petty, but its also something that I cam super empathize with.
