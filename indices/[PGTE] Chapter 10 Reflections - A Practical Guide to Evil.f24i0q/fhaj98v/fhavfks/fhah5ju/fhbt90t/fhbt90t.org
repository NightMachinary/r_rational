I actually really like this update, mostly in the way it surprised me.

Previously, "Good" was established to be rather harsh and uncaring. Mind you, we mostly see it from the Villain PoV, but what they have complained about has made a lot of sense.

Until now.

Now we learn that Above is actually /limited/ in their power, and not just bound by arbitrary rules. They are far from omnipotent, and instead seem to have only a set amount of power that they can use at a time, and have to scrimp and save it for the right moment.

/This/ is why only one out of a thousand or ten thousand or whatever people who pray for salvation are Blessed/Chosen. It's not just a 'balance' being kept where they don't want Below to get a champion, it's because they don't have the mojo to appoint Heroes willy-nilly.

Cat sort of skipped over this in her angry rant, but it's rather important to go back and look at our own views toward the other side.

Above isn't deaf to the prayers of the oppressed. It isn't coldly obeying some sort of specific rules in order to deny their opponents in some weird zero-sum prisoner's dilemma. It just has to be very careful with whom it invests in power, and thus it is understandably rather cautious when it comes to spending it.

*TLDR*: Above aren't assholes with choosing Heroes; Above is *weak* and lacks the power to uplift everyone who asks or meets the criteria.
