Are they, though?

I mean, if nothing else, book 4's prologue showed us that believing in yourself and having faith in a higher cause really, really doesn't keep you from ending in a shallow grave with the last 20 idiots who tried the exact same thing.

The Hedge Wizard went against Warlock, with no plan besides "murder him until he dies", and at a disadvantage of 20 years of experience. And despite that she was absolutely pissed about her sister's death and desperately wanted to avenge her, she got a spear through the skull for her troubles.

If all it took for the heroes to win was to be really motivated about it, the Dead King wouldn't be a problem.
