I don't think Cat will talk to Stalwart Apostle, but I really want someone to. An interlude from her perspective where the White Knight or the Grey Pilgrim explains what happened with the Scorched Apostate would be fantastic.

It would be an interesting viewpoint. She could think about she had done, and either accept or question her decision. Also, I would like the perspective of a young and scared hero just being utterly terrified of the Black Queen. And I'm assuming that she is, because of how everyone else has been reacting.

One thing that hasn't come up yet, and I wonder if it will, is how long did Pascale (Stalwart Apostle) spend praying, compared to how much time she had? If she spent 10 minutes when she had a day, suddenly most of Cat's verbalized objections fall flat. I expect that wasn't the case, because that would make for a much less interesting story, but we don't actually know.

For my last thought, prayer is a form of meditation. Trying to meditate and clear your head before making a decision when confronted with a seemingly insurmountable problem isn't the worst idea.
