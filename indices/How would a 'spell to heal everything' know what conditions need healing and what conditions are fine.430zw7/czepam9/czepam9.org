One I thought of a while ago is that your soul is basically a backup for your body. When you are hurt, your body just copies whatever's on the soul. If you connect neurons wrong and get epilepsy, just remove any that haven't imprinted on the soul. In that case, a healing spell just needs to copy whatever the soul says. Unless you lost your arm so long ago that you lost your phantom limb and your soul now only has one arm. Or you've been using dark magic and your soul is corrupted.

A result of this is that your soul can actually function for a while without your body, up to and including conscious thought. Which is how you end up with ghosts.

Since it's just a backup, you can't use that method to heal anything that was always that way. You could heal removed wisdom teeth. You could /technically/ heal pedophilia if you have only just gone through puberty by reversing it. You might develop differently the next time around.

You also might manage to do a bit better by cheating a little. For example, if someone's right arm is gone including the soul, you might be able to copy the left arm but reversed. It will be pretty difficult to get it to connect right.
