It does cause problems if not used carefully! (Which just makes it more fun in a story, though obviously worse as a solution.)

We can mitigate the genetic effect by making 100 a larger number, or by imposing a cap on the number of times a person is healed in a lifetime. We could eliminate it entirely by adding a side effect of sterility, which means any children are born to unmodified humans. (Of course, this "solution" is not much better than the problem.)

There's also a question of how many properties the spell recognizes. If each individual allele is a potential target, that's millions of genetic problems eventually. On the flip side, we're in great shape if the spell targets phenotype instead, as a rule.

If the spell is somewhere in between, for whatever reason, I think it's still worth adopting as a life-saving measure until we finish the decades-long project of classifying all properties into "harmful" and "beneficial" and design a better spell.
