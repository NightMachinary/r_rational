In a magic system where everything needs to be described precisely, I'd expect fewer spells that use complicated rules to distinguish these conditions, and more spells that are easy to describe and sidestep the issue.

For instance, "reset body's state to what it was N days in the past" is a simple rule to describe. This spell is great for healing injuries, with a side effect of amnesia, not so great as a cure for the flu. (It could, in principle, heal everything, which is why I bring it up.)

If spells can actually access and modify properties such as polydactyly, dyslexia, autism, etc., but needs some rule to determine what values those properties should have (there are millions, so too many to hardcode), then how about: the spell operates on groups of 100 people, and whenever some value of a property is shared by 99 of them, it is extended to all 100. (We can have groups of racially-diverse healthy people walking around casting this, but if everyone has the plague, then that's not so great. Also bad: diseases which take a while to produce symptoms.)
