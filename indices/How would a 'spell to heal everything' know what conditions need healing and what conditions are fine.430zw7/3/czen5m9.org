Well, that obviously depends on who exactly is designing this spell and what are his intentions. But if designer is benevolent, the best way IMO is to check if recipient wants each particular issue to be resolved. Spell can model recipient's response to issues he doesn't know about. All this should be within a realm of possibility for magic that can automatically cure mental illnesses. This way has it's own problems with addictions, but this can be solved by modeling recipient in non-addicted state (increasing spell difficulty in any sensible magic system).

Alternatively, this spell can be made to just cure conditions that are accepted by medical professionals as diseases. There are obvious problems with this approach - used in the middle of last century, this spell would cure homosexuality, for example.

My own design can differ a lot based on magical system and available resources.
