Magic as people think of it tends to be non-reductionist, to the point where that distinguishes magic from technology. Human-important categories are treated as fundamental aspects of how magic works. You can turn someone into a frog without being able to make arbitrary alterations to biology. Harry Potter magic can't create food. Magic pools in Ranma 1/2 turn you into something like what drowned, but "what drowned" uses categories like "girl" or "pig"--you never see a pool that is used to regenerate limbs because it's a "pool of drowned two-legged biped".

A spell which does "healing" is magic, not science, so it works on a concept of "healing" that is more like "if I asked a guy in the street, and he was well-informed about the condition, would he call this healing?" and can't be reduced to being able to do specific kinds of cell adjustment or biological templates or anything which assumes that "healing" isn't a primitive category.
