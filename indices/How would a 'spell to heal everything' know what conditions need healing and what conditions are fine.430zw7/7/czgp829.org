If you live in a world with such a spell, then every time you remove wisdom teeth, have a tattoo or a piercing or make another wanted change to your body you would do some sort of protection or 'I meant to do that' spell on that change so it doesn't get healed. (I'd also hope there was a better solution to an overcrowded mouth than pulling teeth.) I would also make it so that no condition that affects the brain can be healed without explicit consent from the subject.
