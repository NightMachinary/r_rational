Potential sources of information:

- DNA of the target\\
- DNA of the caster\\
- DNA of any designated sources\\
- DNA of the target's parents and ancestors traced back through time, unless magically blocked\\
- The target's own idea of what constitutes 'healthy'\\
- The target's previous medical condition as a time vector\\
- The general consensus of the target's species as to what is considered healthy\\
- The consensus of the caster as to what is considered healthy\\
- The consensus of any other specifically designated sources as to what is considered healthy

There could (and probably should) also be defaults in the spell so that it could be cast by the ignorant onto the ignorant with no designated sources of consensus.

So.

By default, the spell could take the target's previous medical condition vector and run it against a general simulated species-wide consensus (if available) or the simulated consensus of the spell's creator species (if not) to determine at which point in the target's timeline its own brainstate would be considered most sane, calm, and "normal". It would then simulate that brainstate and run possible end-states of the available healing subroutines (based on available magic power, time to heal etc) past it, noting which ones gained the most positive long-term reactions without inducing lack of intelligence (i.e. accidentally growing drug glands). Then it would implement that choice.

Of course, it should also have control hooks so that the caster can modify the result or designate sources of modification if they are familiar with the spell's workings.
