  I wouldn't have batted an eye if you had instead told me that Squritle can spray out more water than its own mass. Then flashy evolution wouldn't be a problem. But that's not how you trained me.

Hmm. When did I establish or fail to establish this, exactly? I feel like you're making assumptions outside of what I've written as yet.

The problem I think is that our minds are capable of accepting certain illogical things much more than others. A squirtle spraying out more water than their mass seems capable of holding? That's a problem. It's gotta be magic: there's just no way we can wrap our brains around a 3 foot turtle creating enough water for it to swim in, and with no apparent loss of mass to boot. Fill a pitcher with water, and that's all it holds: end of story.

On the other hand, we're willing to accept a pikachu generating thunderbolts much more readily. Some chemicals, some biological charge, and boom, lightning. We don't really conceive of energy the same way we do the other states of matter, like solid and liquid, so it bothers us less that a 3 foot rodent could generate more energy than his entire body contains, by many orders of magnitude.

So what solution do you propose? Because if you're not expecting Conservation of Mass/Energy to be broken in this story, I'm curious to know how you're expecting any electric pokemon to function, let alone the psychics that can telekinetically move objects with their mind.
