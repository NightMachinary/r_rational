My assumptions (and you're right, they are assumptions) come from a number of factors.

First, it's the default position as a reader. Fiction is like reality unless noted. Until you tell me otherwise, I will assume Earth rules apply.

Second, I am learning from Red, the reasonably intelligent viewpoint character. Red thinks "types" are silly. This tells me that it's fine that I'm thinking more realistically than the games. Red is surprised to read that Charmander's life depends on the flame, and he expects that to be wrong. This tells me that Pokemon probably don't depend on really weird woo-physics. Red is surprised when Charmander just throws fire, and he goes looking for an explanation. This tells me that /I/ should be surprised when Pokemon do things that are apparently impossible, and I should expect explanations for them. Red immediately finds an Earth-reasonable explanation. You're heavily reinforcing my Earthly expectations, and you're not doing much to make me think otherwise.

Third, compounding all of that, you dedicated an entire chapter to this sequence, right at the beginning. I have to believe that the way you're shaping my beliefs about your world is probably important.

It's still early enough to back out of that without being /too/ clunky, though it'd be best if you trashed those expectations right at the start. The solution, simply enough, is to massively violate Earthly expectations, and have every character be unimpressed, because that's just how the world works. I need to see Squirtle filling a pitcher without losing half its weight. I need to see a Pikachu throwing megajoules around like nothing. I need to see a Kadabra casually tossing an Onix around with the power of its spoon. Or, hell, I need to see a Magikarp pulling 200 kg and 20,000 joules of light out of nowhere. If you don't want me to expect reality, you need to start noting the ways this world is not like reality, preferably sooner rather than later.
