This is exactly my dilemma: I can't explain *everything* that happens in pokemon rationally, because I could no more explain how a pokeball really works than I could make one myself. But that makes it hard to draw the line between what's too "integral" to the pokemon world and what's worthy of revision: if I get rid of pokeballs, it's not really "pokemon" anymore.

Is the distinction, to you, that one is magical technology, and thus, however improbable, hypothetically possible, while pokemon evolution is biological and thus isn't?
