It's probably important to note that in a work like HPMOR the magic /isn't/ explained. The main character wonders about it. He tests the rules. He even detects some patterns based on his normal-world knowledge that gives him advantages over other wizards. But there's no explanation (yet). And do we really expect EY to come up with an explanation that actually makes sense given our world's rules? Either he's going to posit a change to our world's rules that make something like magic work, or the story will end with the magic never fully explained. That seems to work fine for that story, so why not for yours?
