  The situations where a Pokémon would evolve are nearly all situations when you'd be recalling them to a Pokéball:

Yes, this is exactly what I thought of too :) It works really well.

  After receiving them in a trade (optionally with a trigger like holding a Steel Coat)
#+end_quote

Trading is going to be done differently in this: it's basically going to be a de-programming/re-programming to forget the pokemon's training and attachment to their previous trainer and replace it with one to the new trainer. So basically the mental trauma of going through that is what triggers certain pokemon to evolve when released from their pokeball for the first time after being "traded."

  Shelmet/Karrablast only evolve when traded for each other
#+end_quote

This will have to involve simply interacting to the point where the Karrablast can steal the Shelmet's shell, then attemping to withdraw them afterward.
