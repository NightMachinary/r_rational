Hmm. This is an interesting idea, actually... the more I think about it, the more I like it. Since trained pokemon spend such little time in the world, and are effectively frozen in time when in their pokeballs, it would be hard to really show them growing and changing much as they age.

But it could well be that the energy from the pokeball, at the right time and circumstance, triggers an abrupt and massive metamorphosis.

I like it a lot. I think you just changed my mind on what I'd be doing with evolution in this story :) Thanks!
