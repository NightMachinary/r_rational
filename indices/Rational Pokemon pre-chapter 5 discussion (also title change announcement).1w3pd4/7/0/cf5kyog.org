What I hope to do is introduce the fact that pokemon are in fact all one alien microscopic species that came to Earth and bonded with matter and energy in a way that alters it, and does so in a way that allows its "host species," what most people think of when they envision pokemon, to subvert the "regular" laws of physics.

Does that make sense as a basis to explain their "superpowers," or do you think the separate introduction of new atom-sized particles are also necessary?
