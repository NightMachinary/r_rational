I like the alien microscopic species angle. That covers things like why pokemon look like turtles and pigeons of all things.

I think you do need a way for the aliens to break the laws of physics otherwise. Worm had the aliens span multiple parallel universes as a way to handwave all the apparent violations of conservation of energy (energy is still conserved, it's just being brought in from a vast pool nearby). What you use for that is up to you: I think psychic and ice type pokemon are probably the biggest ones to watch out for. Worm's approach handles psychics but not ice.
