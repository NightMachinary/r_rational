my mind is stuck on that story of the butterflies that were mostly white (with some being black), until pollution started happening then it reversed, then reversed again when the city started cleaning itself up...could there be something in that?

the pokemon is ready to evolve/adapt in terms of energy storage, but needs the stone to act as an indicator of what the environment is like. if we tell eevee "the whole world is like water" then it adapts to it become vapoureon; "the whole world is darkness" then it becomes umbreon. the stones dont have any energy themselves, they just tell the energy in the pokemon what form to take.

maybe?
