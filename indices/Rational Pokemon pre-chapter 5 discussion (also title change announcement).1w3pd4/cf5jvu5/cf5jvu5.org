You're going to run into even worse problems with the laws of thermodynamics as soon as you find a Pokemon that learns Ice Beam. And more problems with any telekinetic Pokemon. I'd recommend looking for all the places that you're going to run into this sort of problem and coming up with some alternate physics that cover all of them.

Given your new title, it sounds like you should focus on evolution, ecology, and biology as the sciences that are considered sacred, and let physics slip.

If I were to take a stab at it, I'd introduce a number of new atom-sized particles that bond correctly with normal matter but have their own nonsense properties. Like constantly generating electrons, or forming additional bonds at a distance, or absorbing heat. Just because breaking the laws of physics is on the table as an evolutionary advantage, doesn't mean evolution will behave any different than normally.
