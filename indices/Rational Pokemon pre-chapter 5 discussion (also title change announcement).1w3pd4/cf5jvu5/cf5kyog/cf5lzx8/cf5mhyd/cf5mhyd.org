Yep, and since there are multiple dimensions in the pokemon world, I'd planned on borrowing that idea as well.

Psychic pokemon are one of the few that actually influence some of the humans around them, altering them in a way that creates a mental link between the trainer and their pokemon.

My idea for pokemon with ice powers are based on the concept of light or lasors that can slow atoms to the point of freezing. There's some recent technology that hints at such a possibility, though obviously it's nowhere near advanced enough for the kinds of magical feats seen in pokemon. Still, it strikes me as substantive enough to be a "bending" of reality rather than an outright break of it.
