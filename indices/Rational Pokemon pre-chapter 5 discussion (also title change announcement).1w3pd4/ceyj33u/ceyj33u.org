You don't have to stick faithfully to canon in every particular. But maybe you could say that as a Pokemon grows and ages, it naturally prepares to undergo metamorphosis like a tadpole into a frog. For some Pokemon this is a natural aging process, that, at a certain point, ends up happening really quickly, if not quite instantaneously. For others, they need specific, rare minerals that can only be found a few places. When these Pokemon are taken out of their natural habitats by humans, the humans have to supply these minerals themselves in the form of evolution stones.

As for trading...maybe certain Pokemon have spent enough time around humans that they evolved certain responses? Maybe those breeds were abused to evolve too quickly so they could be sold faster at a profit, which damaged their long-term reproductive viability and, so some Pokemon didn't evolve until they had undergone a trade...somehow...and so the only ones that could breed were the "failed" delayed evolution types...or something.
