Random idea: Could have wild pokemon grow slowly in a naturalistic fashion, while caught pokemon evolve in short bursts because of something related to being digitized in poke-ball form?

That would help condense the number of "weird" things you have to explain (like where all that mass comes from, assuming you actually want conservation of mass to generally be part of the physics) into the pokeball technology.

(Note: I've only played the games, so I'm not sure if wild pokemon ever evolved in canon...but wild pokemon /never/ evolved in game)
