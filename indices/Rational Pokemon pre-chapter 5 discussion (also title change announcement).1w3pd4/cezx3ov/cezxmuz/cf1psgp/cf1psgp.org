The situations where a Pokémon would evolve are nearly all situations when you'd be recalling them to a Pokéball:

- After a battle where they've reached some trigger threshold (often XP, sometimes happiness/etc)
- After giving the Pokémon a certain item and then recalling it (this is the one with the least evidence)
- After receiving them in a trade (optionally with a trigger like holding a Steel Coat)

And while writing this post, I also thought of some more stuff:

Pokémon with odd evolutions to look at:

- Shelmet/Karrablast only evolve when traded for each other
- Nincada splits when it evolves into Ninjask and Shedinja
- Mantyke only evolves on level up if there's a Remoraid in the party
- Pancham only evolves on level up if there's any Dark-type in the party
- Inkay only evolves on level up if the 3DS is upside down.
- Sliggoo only evolves on level up if it's raining
- Feebas only evolves if its Beauty is high enough
- What the heck is up with Eevees?

Also, the original Japanese term is /shinka/ - this can be translated to "evolution" but also true value, progress or apotheosis. Possibly it was translated as "evolution" from whoever originally researched the process?
