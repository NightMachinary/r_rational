I agree, it's much more entertaining to have the flash of light and near-instant form :) I'm still vacillating between the extremes of making the world more realistic or keeping it entertaining however, and wanted to know if any others found the idea of near-instant evolution worth dropping in pursuit of the former. I think we've found a good workaround though.
