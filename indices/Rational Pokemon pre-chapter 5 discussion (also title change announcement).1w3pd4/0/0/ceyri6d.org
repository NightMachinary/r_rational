  You could have them go into an hour-long (or longer or shorter) coma to metamorph, during which they form a bioluminescent outer skin that stretches with the transformation.

I like it! I was thinking an egg-like shell (similar to the "mysterious" egg-like-cradle-thing babies come out of), but the bio-luminescent sac captures both the glow and brief torpidity.

  For simplicity, I will refer to the pokémon equivalent of DNA as PGM, pokémon gentic material, and the other system of genetic material as EGM, extra-genetic material.

Totes stealing these terms and acronyms. BTW and THX.

  Actually, the stones are fossils containing archaic pokémon EGM. This EGM can be extracted from the stones and made viable, at which point it cam be fed to or injected intravenously into a pokémon, causing it to undergo a metamorphosis that it would not naturally be able to have. Such pokémon originally had normal metamorphosis, but evolved over time to lose it.

I'm leaning more toward the idea that the stones are mineral-rich triggers for those EGMs that are usually found in the pokemon's natural habitat, which speed up the cycle of the pokemon's metamorphosis due to exposure over long periods: alternatively, trainers might build little "nests" of the stones, crushed into powder perhaps, for their pokemon to sleep on to accelerate the process.

  There are some other conditions of metamorphosis for some pokémon. A few need certain objects in order to transform. In this case the objects become incorporated into the final form; it is unknown how this dependency developed in nature.
#+end_quote

This I see borrowing the previous idea instead: those objects have the same EGMs needed for various pokemon to evolve into their own unique forms. So a King's Rock might be a fossilized gizzard from any pokemon that the King's Rock normally helps a pokemon evolve into, and when one of those pre-evolved forms comes into conact with it, the dormant EGMs are awakened.

  TL;DR: What just happened? Where am I? Why is my nose bleeding?

Shhh... /strokes hair/ No tears now... only Pokemon...
