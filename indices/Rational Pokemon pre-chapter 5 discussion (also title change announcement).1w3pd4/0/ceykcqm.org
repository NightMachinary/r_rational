You could have them go into an hour-long (or longer or shorter) coma to metamorph, during which they form a bioluminescent outer skin that stretches with the transformation.

You see, pokémon actually all share a tremendous amount of genetic material. All pokémon, at least by our world's definition, belong to the same species. Because of this, they need a secondary system of genetic material to control their form, a bit like epigenetics, except that it is totally physically separate from the normal genome, sort of like mitochondrial DNA, inherited from the mother. For simplicity, I will refer to the pokémon equivalent of DNA as PGM, pokémon gentic material, and the other system of genetic material as EGM, extra-genetic material.

In most pokémon, EGM is stored in glands until they reach a certain stage of maturity, at which point it is replicated and released. This induces the metamorphosis process. It should be noted that this does not occur at the same age in all specimens, but the condition of a pokémon's health. In fact, many pokémon go through their entire lives without metamorphosis; most pokémon exibit neoteny. It is theorized that metamorphosis developed as a stress reaction, expending a great deal of energy to make a pokémon stronger only when it was well enough fed to survive after the transformation, and was fighting enough to need it. Domesticated pokémon used for battling tend to metamorph much more than wild pokémon because of this.

As I said earlier, in most pokémon, metamorphosis is a response to being in combat a lot, but there are some other reasons for it to happen. The most common method trainers use to evolve pokémon is the utilization of so-called "evolutionary stones". Contrary to popular belief, most likely caused by the film industry's romanticization of the metamorphic process as a simple minute-long transformation capable of "saving the day" at a critical moment, a pokémon does not transform after simply touching a stone.

Actually, the stones are fossils containing archaic pokémon EGM. This EGM can be extracted from the stones and made viable, at which point it cam be fed to or injected intravenously into a pokémon, causing it to undergo a metamorphosis that it would not naturally be able to have. Such pokémon originally had normal metamorphosis, but evolved over time to lose it.

Another cause for evolution is love. "Baby pokémon", that is pokémon who do not exhibit neoteny and have not transformed, are the most typical examples of this type of metamorphosis. In the wild, they would transform as soon as they had enough food to sustain themselves. Trainers can provide them with this sustenance indefinitely, but the stress of a very young pokémon being raised by humans is usually enough to prevent the metamorphosis. As such, baby pokémon (and some others) transform only if they form a deep emotional bond to their trainers.

There are some other conditions of metamorphosis for some pokémon. A few need certain objects in order to transform. In this case the objects become incorporated into the final form; it is unknown how this dependency developed in nature. One fascinating case is that of the pokémon burmy, which covers itself in detrious it finds in it's environment. When female burmies evolve, this "cloak" becomes incorporated into their bodies.

There are many other causes and alleged causes for metamorphosis, but most are not understood or confirmed as actual causes.
