For this near instant metamorphosis I could imagine that the Pokémon has to save up the energy over time. So that's because they have to get train first. The stones would then indeed carry the necessary energy to do that immediately for Pokémon that don't save up the energy by themselves. (They swallow the stones.) Now the question is why different stones produce different metamorphoses.
