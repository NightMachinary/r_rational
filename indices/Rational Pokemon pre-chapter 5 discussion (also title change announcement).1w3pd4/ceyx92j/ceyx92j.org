I think that gradual progression would work better for the story you are writing.

With the Charmander oil, you've established that this is a world that is realistic enough that I should already be able to solve some of the challenges in the story. Fire isn't something you can throw; there must be something else going on here. Evolution doesn't work that way; the common schlub in that world is using the word wrong.

Oh, but of course a Magikarp can pull 200 kg and 20,000 joules of light out of a pocket dimension. Why shouldn't it? If you're willing to handwave that, how can I trust that you wouldn't be willing to handwave the fact that clearly you /can/ throw fire, the next time you present me with a challenge?

Either the world should be obviously fundamentally different, or it should be as similar as possible. Even if it means dumping things from the setting.
