Fair enough, but your review of the factors seems to be missing one.

While the existence of humans indicates that many "Earth rules" probably apply, the existence of pokemon indicates that, if this *is* Earth, these beings are not earthly in the way we understand the term: Earth rules may exist, but they don't necessarily apply to pokemon.

For proof, look at what we've seen of charmander: yes, he produces fire in a way that makes sense to earthlings, and yes, that fire is flung in a way that makes sense on Earth, opposed to some other planet or universe where fire could be "thrown." But that fire is produced at the end of his tail, fire that can grow to quite a blaze.

And yet it doesn't burn him.

Flesh and blood charmander may be, but that flesh is not Earth flesh, and it does not interact with energy/fire the same way we'd expect Earth flesh to.

Subtle, I grant you. I'll try to provide a more massive violation of earthly expectations soon :)
