I agree: I'm not aiming to make pokemon "make sense." As far as I'm aware, that's impossible without utterly changing what pokemon /are/: for all intents and purposes, magical beings. I'm simply trying to make it 1) more realistic where I can and 2) more logically consistent with itself.

That's one of the reasons I plan to focus very little on natural laws in the story: quite simply, they don't all quite apply the same way in pokemon. They can't. And without someone from our world to notice them being broken, there's no way to really bring up the discrepancy.

Instead I plan on focusing on logical, psychological, and sociological issues, which are much more translatable from one world to the next.
