In the games, trading involves an electronic process to "transfer" the pokemon from one person's ownership to the next, and I think that's what triggers it. In my version I think I'm going to do something similar in regards to an unbrainwashing program that removes their obedience from their original trainer and replaces it with the new ones, which could trigger the trigger you're referring to. In the wild, this trigger might have occurred in the species when a mating partner or parent died.
