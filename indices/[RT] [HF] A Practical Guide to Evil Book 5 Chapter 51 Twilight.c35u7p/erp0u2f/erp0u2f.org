There are moments in this serial where the degree of opaqueness and ambiguity as to how Story's function and magic works leave me unsatisfied when either are used to resolve an important conflict. I thought this chapter was a great example of the /opposite/ of that.

The groundwork laid for this resolution was: Sve Noc's well established links with death and overcoming it, the foreshadowing of Cat cheating death in Liesse three times in previous chapters, Cats well established ability to temporarily â€˜steal' aspects and Pilgrims well established intimate ties with Mercy from the extra chapter POV's of his. I think this groundwork played a big role in the resurrection feeling so satisfying and justified.
