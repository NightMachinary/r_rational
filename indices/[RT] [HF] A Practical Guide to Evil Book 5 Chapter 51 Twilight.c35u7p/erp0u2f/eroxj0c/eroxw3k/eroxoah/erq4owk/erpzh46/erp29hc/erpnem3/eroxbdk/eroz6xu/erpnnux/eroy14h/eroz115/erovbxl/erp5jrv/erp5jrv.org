I wonder what might happen now to Pilgrim and his holy powers since his resurrection has been done by a Villain. Especially since she's labelled as the Arch Heretic of the East. The Pilgrim clearly didn't ask for this.

Will he be considered tainted? Will he no longer be a Hero? Will there be an angelic Civil War between the Choir of Mercy and others choirs that might contest the Pilgrim owing his new life to Catherine? How will this affect the Pilgrim's protectiveness of the Bard, and what will happen to this Twilight realm now that the Star is gone?
