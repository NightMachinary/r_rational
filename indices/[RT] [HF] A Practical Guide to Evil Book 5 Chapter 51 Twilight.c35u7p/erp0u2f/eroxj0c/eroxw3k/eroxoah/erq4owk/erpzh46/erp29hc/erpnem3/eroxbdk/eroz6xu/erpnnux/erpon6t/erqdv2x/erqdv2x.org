I don't think it makes sense for Resurrected Tariq to remain the Twilight King, because he took that crown with the intent of ending the crown. When the crown ends, so does the kingship.

I don't think it makes sense for Resurrected Tariq to remain the Pilgrim, either. He's lost an aspect; the Choir that powered his Pilgrim name has mourned his death. Tariq is back, but his role will be different. He's not going to be going around *Forgiving* people.
