For a series that produces 6000 or more words every week, I'm happy to ignore minor errors. The man manages to make me check the dictionary because he's got such eloquently put titles. And that's just the titles. The main content prose? He's up there with Stephen Erikson in my mind in apt use of words. A less pretentious type of style and tone than Rothfuss. As schematic and meticulous as Sanderson.

There are caveats, I'm sure, but I'm downright ignoring them.
