They certainly believe that Triumphant continues in some form, such that there is a risk of her and her legions returning, despite being quite dead. It's just a folk belief, but the Praesi are as well positioned as anyone to know what goes on in the hells, and we never hear anyone call that belief out as bring silly on the grounds that souls don't wind up in the hells.

On the other hand, the hells are visitable, and we never really hear about missions to go track down dead people, so who knows.
