They have what Pilgrim says is "his stay Above." and more specifically " No one could be ripped from the embrace of the Gods without finding Creation and faded and brutish place for the rest of their days, even if the memory of the Heavens was withheld." How much of that is religious imagery and how much is an accurate description of their potential afterlife is ambiguous. interlude-kaleidoscope-ii

At the same time we have either upfront lich-esque soul jar equivalents in both what we've seen from the Dead King and from Ubua's holding of her own soul outside of her own body. But pulling a person back from oblivion is very different from some sort of afterlife.

There's some amount of implication that devils at least return to their constituent hell and are remade anew from what we hear from Tikloshe, Masego's father, speaking to Warlock, Masego's father, they say

Don't waste it,” he implored. “After you're dispersed...”

“What comes back will not be me,” Tikoloshe softly agreed. “A blank slate. Tabula rasa.” interlude-inheritance

​

There's also both the soul constructs of the Watch and the numerous undead that we've seen that had their own personalities as far as we know that is, it's not like we've seen Cat raise say Ratface or someone that we knew as they were in their own body even if it was rotting.

​

So in total we know souls exist, they can be caught, which kind of has implications that something happens if they aren't caught, Heroes and it's not super clear that non-heroes/named can have their deaths Forgiven, but that any old person can apparently have their soul trapped into their own body as shown by the previous King's of Callow. But again we haven't seen non-named be resurrected it's a little ambiguous that Archer is explicitly a villain but at this point we kind of assume she is so that's worth something i guess?
