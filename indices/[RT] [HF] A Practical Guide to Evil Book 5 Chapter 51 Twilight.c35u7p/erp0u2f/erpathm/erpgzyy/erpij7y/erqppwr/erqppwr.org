Correct me if Im wrong, but in Guideverse, I don't think Ive ever seen any character talk or think anything to do with a "heaven" concept, and as far as I know, hells are strictly different /planes/ and most certainly not where "/souls/ go".

Now all of this could absolutely wrong (absence of evidence is not evidence of absence and all that), but I really do think that it is reasonable to assume that most characters of the guide think that oblivion awaits their final death.
