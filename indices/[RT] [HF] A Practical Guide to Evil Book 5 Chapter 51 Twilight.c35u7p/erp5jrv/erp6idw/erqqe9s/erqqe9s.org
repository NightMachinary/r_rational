  And for all that Sve Noc clearly stands closer to evil than good, the forging of those goddesses was done in rebellion against the Gods Below.

Can you elaborate on this a little more please? I always got the feeling that Sve Noc got "tricked" by below into to getting their explicit desire ... which makes their nature one that naturally defeats itself.

Which is where their dynamic with Cat comes into play. Cat is the one who is trying to get them to think and act better than their natures. Its why Sve Noc wanted to take twilight's crown and Cat had to talk them down then give the Drow version of the sermon on the mount.

I agree Cat isn't a villain and she is trying to get the other big Villains to reject their natures too.
