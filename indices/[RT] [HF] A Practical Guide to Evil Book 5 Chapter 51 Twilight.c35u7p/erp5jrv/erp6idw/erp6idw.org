While it was pulled off by Cat, the resurrection was powered completely by Above's Light, via Tariq's *Forgive*, so (outside of the unlikely possibility of him getting a different Name out of this) there really should be no change for him outside of no longer having that Aspect.

Also even though mortal geopolitics treat her as one, I think by this point it's pretty clear that /Cat isn't a Villain/. Her recent struggle vs Indrani highlighted once again that for all Night can bestow upon her she isn't Named. And for all that Sve Noc clearly stands closer to evil than good, the forging of those goddesses was done in rebellion /against the Gods Below/. Cat is a maybe a villain perhaps (even if her slate was clean, her work at the Princes' Graveyard would have had her treated as such) but not a Villain.

I doubt Tariq's opinion on the Intercessor will suddenly flip on a dime but Cat has gained something almost as valuable on that front. She now has actual time to convince him, rather than arguing while running from fight to fight.
