I'm not sure if the Drow have a unified enough culture to /make/ Names.

I do agree though that Sve Noc would probably try to squish down any nascent Names as it would severely fuck over the experiment if one of the Drow suddenly gained Narrative Weight^{tm} . Though it wouldn't surprise me if you're right and Night just “eats” the Name.
