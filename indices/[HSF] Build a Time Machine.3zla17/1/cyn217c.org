Congrats. You're done.

Indestructible solid-state hibernation /is/ a time machine. It lets people travel to the future. That's the dream of cryonics, right? Go to sleep today in your crumbling, fallible body and wake up as part of The Culture?

Relativistic spacecraft are significantly more expensive time machines, probably better used for more mundane purposes.
