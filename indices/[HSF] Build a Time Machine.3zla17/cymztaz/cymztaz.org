can we drag the wormholes? that is the important bit.

Because to build a time machine you need to have the wormholes in a particular arrangement.

The simplest of which is you tow it along with a relativistic starship so that you have a pair of worm holes that allow a round trip of going x lightyears in the past.

If the mouths of the wormholes cannot be towed and the arrangement of wormholes is not setup to allow timeloops then you can't build a time machine to my knowledge.
