In what reference frame are the wormholes stationary? Can the two mouths of a wormhole be fixed in different reference frames? How about the mouths of two separate wormholes?

If we assume that all the wormhole mouths must be stationary with respect to each other, we'll have to use gravitational time dilation to set up our time machine. I think this setup should work:

Wormhole A has mouth A1 in a convenient location with no nearby large masses and mouth A2 near a massive object (ideally, just outside the event horizon of a black hole). Wormhole B has mouth B1 near A2 but at some distance from the black hole, and mouth B2 near A1.

The difference in gravitational potential builds up a time difference across A that will eventually allow A1->A2->B1->B2 to arrive before you left
