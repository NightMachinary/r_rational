Oh well, [[/u/xamueljones]] 's idea works as long as you are aware you just restarted, but you can't exactly test it even with the savestate power because you can't remember it. In short, the power is quite useful if you can realise when you just restarted, but may be altogether useless if not, depending on how randomness works through each restart. At the very least, I came out of this idea knowing more about vector clocks, halting oracles, and electrons than I did before.
