So, two main enemy archetypes come to mind:

One, Time Limiter. Basically, it's happening in a week/month/year, it's near impossible to stop, and makes the story lean towards action/thriller. Something like a meteor, a supervillain ultimatum, or Generic Cosmic Destruction #37, animate or otherwise, are the obvious examples. The time loopers will have to deal with research, and how to do that in the loop, and minutiae, for instance, can I afford to sleep when each hour of sleep could be spent on doing week's worth of work time lost, or how short can I cut my "30 seconds" to. Action-packed, psyche, and deadline crunching.

Two, Apocalypse and Politics. Some threat is looming overhead, like nuclear war, environmental monster, or sleeping terror, and if nothing changes, It'll happen sooner or later. This leaves more interaction time between the characters so that the two loopers will be able to fight for who/what will be in charge when the event is settled, but if they spend too long sabotaging their rivals, the white walkers come and everyone dies. A more political intrigue story, for the better or the worse, with less focus on deadlines, more on power plays.

Other possibilities, though potentially less interesting, include limited usages, backlash, or anti-power factions.

Regardless of which route you want to take, I'd be happy to help you come up with problems.
