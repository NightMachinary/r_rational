  If someone can kill you before you can make a new save, that sequence just repeats itself.

I think that's only an issue if you automatically reset when you die. If I was writing a story, I wouldn't give my protagonist that much power and require him/her to perform an action to reset. This way, when the protagonist is dying of old age, there aren't infinite resets.

  The RPG classic- The save trap problem.

That's true and my protagonist would only notice it as the number of resets increase and increase. The problem is further compounded when you realize that due to not remembering your previous thoughts about a problem, you are very likely rethinking similar solutions or ideas. This problem is mitigated by asking other people for ideas (conversations are more likely to vary than thoughts) or free word association where you randomly generate three words from a dictionary or online and try to come up with new ideas starting from the words. Anyway, there is no fear of spending literally infinite time on this, because you are making consecutive saves which each has a time delay meaning sooner or later you will run out of time and have to face the consequences.

I have a question for you. What do you think would be an interesting problem for someone with this power? Because I have been deeply drawn into the idea of writing a story of someone with this power. It's so fascinating since most time travel powers are so powerful while this one is deceptively weak. So I was wondering if you can think of an interesting conflict to base the story around. I want to write about two or more people with this power, but I would find it boring to simply set them against each other.

Here's a time loop story I would like to recommend. It's [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/145711/hard-reset-2-reset-harder][Hard Reset 2]] a My Little Pony fanfiction story. I know ponies aren't everyone's cup of tea, but it's a really good story about multiple intersecting time loopers dealing with an invasion. Warning, it hasn't updated in 2 years, so that might aggravate you. Don't worry about missing the 'first' book in the series, because that was [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset][Hard Reset]] written by another author which Hard Reset 2 is based on and is not required reading.
