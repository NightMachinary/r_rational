You have the ability to make and reload savestates, as many as you want, however, you lose your memories of the time you spent when you reload. For example, you can save and reload if you are going to die, but you lose the memories since you saved when you reload.

So far I've got: Write a list of things you could do, leaving the last as think of new ideas. Save, get as random a random number generator as you can, either by random.org or something better and do whatever that path is. If it works, save there and repeat, if not, reload, and you would reroll and get something new.

Is there anything actually random enough? Is there any better options available?
