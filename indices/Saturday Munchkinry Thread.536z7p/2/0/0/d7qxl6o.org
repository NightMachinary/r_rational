..wow, that's really good, I hadn't thought of consecutive saves. That really just solves the problem, [[/u/xamueljones]]. Randomness isn't needed, just simple patterns. Resaving after 30 seconds, documentation, and standardisation make this an incredibly versatile power. Weeks of work in hours, leaving you at the end in a state you are successful.

Some traps/counters present themselves:

1)If someone can kill you before you can make a new save, that sequence just repeats itself, you trying to write 7, getting killed, reloading and repeating. Some of the risks could be mitigated by only saving in areas you know are safe, and perhaps varying your times so a skilled spy and assassin combo can't activate it. Basically, the Death Note problem, try and give away as little information on how your power works as possible.

2)The RPG classic- The save trap problem. There may be a problem you can't solve, so when you save you get trapped in the proverbial boss room, with weapons that can't damage it, and no way out. Lateral thinking and longer saves would weaken this, but it is a real problem that must be taken into account.

Also, all this time travel really is more mindbending than I thought it would be when I started. Feel free to use it, I'd love to see where it could be taken.
