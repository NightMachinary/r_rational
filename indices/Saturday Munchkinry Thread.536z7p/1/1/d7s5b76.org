What's the maximum current it can put out? AA batteries are constant-voltage power sources; you can choose how much current to draw, but most batteries get less and less efficient at high currents.

A magic AA battery could be realistic and just have its voltage go down as the current goes up, or it could be munchkinable and put out a constant 1.5V no matter what you plug it into.
