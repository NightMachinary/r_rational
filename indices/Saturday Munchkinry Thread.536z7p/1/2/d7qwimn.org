I think I read somewhere that if you could have a source of free energy which violates the second law of thermodynamics, then you could break any other law of physics depending on how much extra energy is being created. Anyway, I would sell it as the power source of something that we absolutely need to keep running without ever shutting down, possibly as the power source of a space craft?
