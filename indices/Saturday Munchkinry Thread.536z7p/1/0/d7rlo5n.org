Hook it up to a power storage unit or a dozen. Contact scientists and make it clear that it is impossible to reverse engineer, have them design something that can generate maximum output from the battery (something strong enough to drain a normal AAA in nanoseconds), and you have a lot of power to waste in creating more consuming devices. Sell giant batteries charged by the infinite battery cheaply to alleviate energy crisis and to make money.

Eventually you may want to connect the battery to the power grids of the entire world, construct super batteries to store excess power in different location so that in case of damage to the connections people won't be deprived of power.

And then think about entropy.

My answer has some problems though. Governments may not be willing to cooperate, they may pressurise you to weaponize it, maintenance of a unified global power network would be tough.
