You are an average middle class Joe. You don't have a PhD in physics, you don't have Lex Luthor's resources. But you have the mind of a rationalist and a superpower which you only use once.

Your power is not something you'd expected when you signed the Pact of Deux Ex Machina. After activation of your power, you will gain perfect knowledge of the functioning of all objects you see for 40 minutes without being overwhelmed. You must see the object directly, no pulling up pictures from the internet.

Now what would be the things you will choose?

You can add as many objects as you wish but remember that acquiring them must be economically and physically viable. You can build up on the answers given by others if you desire to do so.

My answer would be the human body. I can revolutionize medical, chemical and biological sciences + write the comprehensive papers on psychology.
