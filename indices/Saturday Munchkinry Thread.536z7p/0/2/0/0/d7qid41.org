Well, assuming I know what my power is and want to be properly prepared for using it, I could reach out to relevant scientists and try to buy either their EM drive or blueprints good enough that I can pay someone else to build one. Assuming I'm reasonably well-off, all of those expenses should be affordable, especially since I can go into as much debt as the banks allow me to with the expectation that this superpower will make me excessively wealthy once everything's said and done.

If the ideas of purchasing an EM drive or its blueprints both fail, I could anchor the location where I use my superpower to somewhere near a lab I can go to and talk to someone whose worked on an EM drive, hopefully seeing on in the process. But that's only if it's impossible to get one for myself that I can take with me to a place near other important machines.
