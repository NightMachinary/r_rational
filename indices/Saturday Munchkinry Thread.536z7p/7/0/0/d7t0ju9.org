  Anything small and dense enough to survive re-entry, I believe it would be possible to fire a missile to deflect it into the ocean without harm to the rest of the planet, but I don't really know.

If it's a nuke-level kinetic impact, then deflecting it into the ocean is not "without harm to the planet".

It just changes the nature of the harm. (More tsunamis, less earthquakes).
