If the knowledge is public to a significant portion of the population and I have the power to do something about it, then I would make sales of critical components (rocket fuel? for your issue and super-computers for AIs) either banned or extremely restricted.

If the knowledge is not wide spread, then I would investigate how easy it is to discover (is the field in question very obscure or widely studied). If obscure, spread information discrediting the field and get public opinion to believe any researchers are quacks and keep a close eye on researchers. If widely studied but very few have stumbled on the secret so far, then prepare for eventual revelation and work to preemptively deny the ability to actually apply the knowledge in real life.

For your particular problem, I would work on an asteroid deflection system, because anything small burns up in the atmosphere and anything massive enough to damage a significant population center should be noticeable going up (I think? I mean I don't think NASA and airplane traffic control can miss a rocket) to give enough time to prepare. Anything small and dense enough to survive re-entry, I believe it would be possible to fire a missile to deflect it into the ocean without harm to the rest of the planet, but I don't really know.
