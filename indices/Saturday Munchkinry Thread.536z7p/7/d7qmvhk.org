*Problem: Scientific Theory vs Existential Risk*

You have learned of a scientist who has, like Maxwell with light, become the first person to understand what a particular fundamental piece of physics is really made of. Hooray, science advances, everyone wins, right?

The standard Yudkowskyian issue: Said understanding opens up some more opportunities for random individuals to create WMDs with a lower amount of resources.

The particulars: Let's say that the basic piece of physics is 'inertia', in the form of a tweaked version of [[https://physicsfromtheedge.blogspot.ca/][MiHsC]], and the form of WMD is that if you can rocket anything up out of the bottom of Earth's gravity well, even something as small as a cubesat, you can accelerate it out and back fast enough to have nuke-level kinetic energy impacts within a moderately short timespan. (Introducing a possible solution to the Fermi paradox - every species in our past light-cone which made it to orbit blew themselves up.)

What changes to your choices should you make based on these conditions? What choices should high-level politicians make with this level of changes to the current form of nuclear stalemate?
