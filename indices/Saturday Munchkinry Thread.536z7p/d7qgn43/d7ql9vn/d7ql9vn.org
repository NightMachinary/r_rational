I do have time to prepare, yes?

What does it mean, 'see the object directly'? If I look at a part of the object, it counts as 'seeing' it? Can I /understand/ the Earth by looking at the ground? If I look at the starry sky at night, will I get the complete knowledge of the evolution of galaxies? Of stars? How can I get the complete understanding of something abstract, like human civilization? Or politics? Or an industry?

The goal is to figure out Theory of Everything, and preferably become a social expert while I am at it; the Theory of Everything is more important. Hence, it could go two ways.

I will start near something scientifically controversial (and at night), akin to the aforementioned EM Drive. I /understand/ it and the surrounding machinery, then people around me and myself, then the starry sky and the Earth. If it seems I have got everything I need for the Theory of Everything, I refocus on the civilization instead, running to the helicopter I hired and flying around, trying to /understand/ cities, businesses, and local governments.

If the laws of physics seem more complex than that, I should try to /understand/ as much various objects as possible. EM Drive, human body, animal's body, some microorganisms, a laptop, a galaxy, a star, the Earth, a vacuum, everything I set my sight on. Instead of going up to /understand/ the bigger picture, I drive around the city to get as much different objects as I can.

Worst-worst-case scenario, I am the best physicist, biologist, and probably psychologist in the world. Best-worst-case scenario, I have a Theory of Everything. Best-best-case scenario, I have a Theory of Everything and a better understanding of humans and human-based systems than anyone else in the world, making the world optimization trivially easy.

That is, if I don't insta-win by figuring out the mind.
