You have the ability to telekinetically your move hair, along with the secondary power of being able to grow your hair at a greatly accelerated rate (one foot per hour). You can move hairs individually, but you have no tactile feedback from them so don't know where they are at any given time. Each hair can exert roughly 1 Newton of force.

(Your ability to grow hair can be used selectively, so that you don't have to grow eyebrow hair at the same time as the hair on your scalp.)
