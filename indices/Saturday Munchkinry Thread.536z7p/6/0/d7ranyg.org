Sell your hair for money. I found a calculator where you could input information to find out how much your hair is worth. Twelve inches of brown hair, one inch thick, with hair products previously used on it (the worst options for hair quality I could guess at from the options) is worth 84 dollars. If you work for 8 hours a day 5 days a week with two weeks of vacation on just growing hair you would make $24000. However if your hair was blond, over six inches thick (it would probably be pretty thick since you can grow body hair), and untouched by hair products it would be worth $573. You could make about $160,000 per year. [[http://hairsellon.com/hair-price-calculator/][Here is the link of the hair price calculator]].
