Why compete with the other 999? Why not cooperate with a few of them?

With Orator and Gift of Tongues, you can probably get quite a few people (including some other demigods) to follow just about any cause, as long as it's not /obviously/ selfish. And a cause like improving the world for /everyone/ is almost certain to gain you a number of adherents, since it's improving things for them, as well.

A couple of uses of Expertise - picking fields which you imagine would be useful - will help you plan better (and Expertise: Current Events will keep you updated on the news inhumanly fast). Godly Mind gives you a general idea of every field of human knowledge, and Divine Memory lets you remember, well, everything.

That's fifty points towards the task of "figure out the best strategy and persuade other people to help you accomplish it". You might as well pick up Power Of Adoration at this point - your Orator will make it easy to obtain additional points in this manner - and then you have thirty additional points (now) and two hundred points (soon) to spend on whatever else you want... might be a good idea to pick up a few of those mental enhancements /before/ deciding what to do with those last thirty.
