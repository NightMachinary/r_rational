I really like this idea, where did you get it? Also, I'd go:

- Ancient Mysteries (seriously good)
- Rewind (Needs more errata; do you keep all previously attained powers if you rewind to before you obtained your initial powers?)
- Portals Maker
- Godly Mind
- Martial Prowess - Taekwondo

If Rewind does let you keep previously attained powers:

- Divine Engineer
- Divine Memory
- Ascended (This needs errata as well: does this negate how tired you are from abilities such as Creator, CRTeleport, TK, and Puppeter)
- Sanctuary
- Martial Prowess - (Whatever seems most useful atm, but don't wanna waste it on artistic or expertise)

What do you guys think? It's a decent start, although some changes would be made depending on the rulings on Rewind and Ascended, and I won't go into what I'd choose after that, as it'd mainly be situational and it's unreasonable to assume I'd be safe/ not fighting for my life with 999 other fuckers out there with as crazy powers as mine.
