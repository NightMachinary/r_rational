How would going back in time to spend your points again help though? Seems like three options.

1. It's just your mind going back, and thus you'll have lost all your powers due to not having the spark of divine power so you just get a single chance to repick your powers which expires in 24 hours. This seems by far the least likely.
2. It's your mind and divine fragment going back, in which case things get kinda weird but you've still already picked out your powers so nothing changes really other than you get an ~24 hour head start.
3. You physically go back, body, mind, fragment and all. In this case it's still just really getting an ~24 hour headstart, as you've already chosen your powers and you just displace yourself physically back through time and don't reset your spark to a state where you hadn't chosen powers.

God's Eye could help over triangulation, but that's unlikely to be too much of a help. As far as scouring the earth's surface? We can just input the relevant numbers in to Wolfram|Alpha to find out. Movement speed of Mach 1, covering an area 2km wide, assume you can somehow maintain that constantly and don't suffer delays or the like. It's [[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=land+area+of+earth+%2F+(Mach+1+*+2km][a mere 7 years to cover all the land area of earth]]), that's assuming surface counts as just land area and they won't be hidden underwater or anything. Needless to say if you also have to scour the oceans things get a lot slower.

For portals I'm presuming you're presuming that portals can be created and destroyed as fast as you can think of them? And you can target them with something like "1km ahead of me" with ease so you can basically just dip into the universe for a tiny distance every 1km along you leap frog? Depends on how people want to exploit them to counter that, for example the portals power neither lists that your portals aren't linked to anyone else's portals or that you can destroy portals, in fact it actually states the exact opposite for both of those, although it at least implies that they can be destroyed. Even with that you'll still likely attract a huge amount of attention and suffer mental fatigue, along with it still taking a decent amount of time.

It's still totally vulnerable to my own build for countering it however, which involves a power I've seen pretty much nobody take, and nobody mention taking for this purpose.

Portals Maker, Divine Weapon (Laser Sniper Rifle), Divine Speed, Regeneration, Marital Prowess (Sniper Rifles), God's Eyes, Expertise (Contemporary History), Expertise (Theology)

And that is how I counter everyone taking Ancient Mysteries or the like, just steal the cubes off them myself. Right up to those last two it's basically just a very dangerous ranged build with high mobility, the ability to get anywhere and take someone out from range, and thanks to it being a laser rifle with God's Eye and being the best marksman with snipers on the planet along with Divine Speed there won't be any dodging or anything.

No, the lynchpin is the exploit that are those two expertise. Granting you all of humanities knowledge, and the auto-updating knowledge, on gods and divinity. As demigods are still human, if enhanced humans, I'll also automatically get any knowledge they have or discoveries they make as to divinity and gods. You've found a cube? Well that's an interesting discovery as to divinity you've made there, and now I know it too, only you don't know I know it and I can form a portal a distance away and proceed to use the horribly broken ranged combo I took and unless you took Sixth Sense or Seer of the Infinite you won't even know anything is coming. Add in knowledge of all of humanities knowledge of present events? There's no way people should be able to go throwing around powers or discovering cubes or anything with out me knowing, and thanks to Theology I get automatic knowledge of all exploits anyone finds with the powers, as that's knowledge of the nature of divinity, nature of divine powers and all that.

So yeah, in this scenario? You get off to a good start, before I realise what you're doing and know the exploit you're using as you're human so your knowledge is up for grabs if it regards divinity or modern events and proceed to snipe you from 20km away with a laser rifle and steal all the cubes you've helpfully gathered for me. Maybe wait till you start using them so I can grab them while you're meditating and figuring out how to absorb them more quickly using your heightened mind?
