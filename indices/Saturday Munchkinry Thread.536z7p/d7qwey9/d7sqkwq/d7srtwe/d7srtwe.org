Time traveling to before you got your powers to get a second chance to spend points, not double dip on your points.

God's eye grants you the ability to see through matter, and you can tell when a cube is definitely within a kilometer of you. Being able to scan through walls and the ground will be easier and faster than trying to triangulate the position of the cube with your detection radius, or just randomly scouring the ground.

The previous [[https://www.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/comments/3kuvu2/demigods_cyoa_from_tg/][thread]] had about a third of the people gunning for the cubes. If your serious and start running from go, it'll take a couple of days or weeks to cover the entire surface of the earth using superspeed, and there's not much you can do to speed that up, so you'll be splitting your loot with everyone who had the same idea.

With portals you can cover the entire surface of the earth in hours, giving you a humongous advantage over everyone else. However, that only allows you to find the cubes quickly. Because of the nature of the power, you can't take them with you.

My ideas pretty unique because it bypasses the portal's restriction on inorganics by using the Divine Guardian as a mule that can be instantly summoned wherever I am, sort of as a secondary inventory. I didn't see anyone going in this sort of direction, or really discussing the possibility of this particular exploit in the old thread.
