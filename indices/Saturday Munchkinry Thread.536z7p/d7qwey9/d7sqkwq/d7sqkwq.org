Time travelling to before you obtained the powers to get more powers seems unviable, consider that per the lore at the top it's a god who possesses those powers giving you part of their power to grant you powers. Hence the source of powers should be fully aware of time travel, and presumably can detect that you already have a fragment of their power and won't just decide to give you another one for no reason.

Your plan also has an inherent flaw, there are 999 other people out there, and a lot of them should be competing with you. Sure if nobody else was after them you'll be fine, but everybody else knows they exist, and who knows how many took the ability to sense any cubes within 1km of them.

God's Eye doesn't grant you the ability to spot the cubes either does it? Sure it grants super vision but remember a trait of the cube is that they appear to be unremarkable stone cubes, or will you just scour the earth looking for any stone cubes and hope they're all the same size to simplify things?
