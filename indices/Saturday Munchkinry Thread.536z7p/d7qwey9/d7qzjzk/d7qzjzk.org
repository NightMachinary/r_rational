What is the point in /not/ taking Ancient Mysteries? On short term you have slightly less abilities, but you have access to 1000 extra points which makes splooging in Portal Maker so much worth it. You just need that and Godly Mind to be able to easily track down most of the cubes, and you'd only need something to help you survive underwater to get them all.

After you've spent some time unearthing and subsuming the cubes you have more points than you started with /and/ a free mobility kit.

After that, I think that Divine Engineer, Creator, Sanctuary, Divine Memory, Double Trouble and a pile of Expertise/anything intelligence-affecting would be pretty broken.

An polymath genius engineer god with absolute local omniscience and the ability create exotic materials out of nowhere? Good luck tackling that.
