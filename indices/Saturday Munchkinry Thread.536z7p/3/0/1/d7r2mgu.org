Cubes are a limited resource. Once they're meditated on, those points are gone. The thread on make your choice had about a third of people going for ancient mysteries, so you've got 330 people gunning for 100 cubes. You need 2 cubes to cover the cost of Ancient Mysteries. It's much safer to go for worship or demonic pact.
