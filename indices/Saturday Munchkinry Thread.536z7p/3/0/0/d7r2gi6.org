  What is the point in not taking Ancient Mysteries? On short term you have slightly less abilities, but you have access to 1000 points.

It depends how many other people also took that skill. There will be tons of competition fighting over the cubes and you are forced to take certain skills just to stay in the running. I still think it's worth it most of the time, but it's not a forced include.
