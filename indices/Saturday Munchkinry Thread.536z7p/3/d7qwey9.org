I guess this is just a general munchkinry problem, but I'd like to see what exploits everyone can see in this CYOA.

I feel two of the powers deserve errata:

Rewind: If you go back to before you obtained the time reversal power, and obtain it again, you are still under the effect of the cooldown until it would naturally end. You are under no obligation to take it a second time, however.

Portals Maker: For the purpose of "organic matter," any matter that is or was alive at some point, was biologically created by something living, or was biologically attached to something living is considered organic. Chemical refinement of organic materials tends to destroy the quality of "organicness" that is used by the portals.

I believe that my own solution to this is perhaps one of the best builds initially, but I'd like to see what others come up with individually to see if they can spot the same exploits I can.

Not knowing how much interest I'll get, I'll just put it in a [[#s][spoiler.]]
