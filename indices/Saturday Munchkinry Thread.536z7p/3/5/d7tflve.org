...after some thought, I think I've found a particularly nice combo.

Telepathy, Divine Memory, and Godly mind will allow you to read the mind of anyone nearby; perfectly remember everything you learn from this; and handle any calculations far better than any human. At this point, you can go to a single science convention, and come out with world-level expert knowledge on the subject of that convention - then probably write a few fairly revolutionary papers in that discipline before the next convention. It's basically all the Expertises, with a bit of a delay.

If you really want your scientific papers to do well, you can take Oratory (and that's just begging to be mixed into Power Of Adoration to become pretty much the patron deity of the sciences).

Telepathy and Divine Memory also synergise well with Shape Shifter - you can meet someone, get a copy of their memories with Telepathy, and then you can be them well enough to deceive just about every baseline human means of identification. (Plus, Telepathy lets you know if someone's starting to become suspicious, and lets you fix the error in your impersonation).
