You can certainly take over a /country/, if the country allows voting and you can occasionally get on TV (where you will be lucky enough to run only into interview questions you already know how to answer - especially if you minimise the outlandishness of this by studying up first).

You can also help this process along by going to important places to get votes in and being lucky enough to make a good public impression - and then passing within ten miles of major voting stations on the day of the vote in order to be lucky enough to get the votes. (You'd probably need to associate yourself with same major political party).

And then, I guess, you would be lucky enough in major international negotiations to end up with pretty favourable terms...
