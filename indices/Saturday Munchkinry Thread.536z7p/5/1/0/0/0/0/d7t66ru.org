Yes. So, the power has the ability to read your desires both conscious and subconscious, and the magnitude of each desire. For very high magnitudes it might kick in without conscious command; this is how it stops you getting shot. But you in general won't find ten pound notes in the street unconsciously because you don't have an explicit desire for them. Working out how to /control/ the power and explicitly wish for stuff means you can be lucky like that, though. And it's all subject to charge, so it doesn't matter how much you really really want the sun to explode, you don't have the luckyons, conscious desire or not.

OK, that seems like a reasonable set of rules -- once you've worked out how to control the power it's essentially a /wish/ spell, charge withstanding. So, how can it be munchkined and reverse-munchkined? The charge pretty much stops one just wishing for a tabletop cold fusion reactor or something.
