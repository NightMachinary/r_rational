It would make sense to me that the more you want something to happen, the more likely your luck power is to make that thing happen - depending on the amount of charge, of course. And the amount of luckyons required for a given output would depend on the likelihood of that output; winning the top prize in a national lottery (let's assume you're within ten miles of the draw) requires quite a lot of luckyons, while winning a minor prize would require a lot fewer luckyons.
