Yes. Exactly the reason that this is ill-defined right now is that I think that spontaneously finding a working laser pistol in 2016 is "too lucky" and isn't allowed, but I don't know how to write a rule saying that :)

The idea of "charge" is an interesting one! Say you get one "luckyon" an hour, and you can choose to spend your accumulated luckyons whenever you want, and sometimes the power will do it for you whether you command it or not (stopping bullets and the like). So finding a working laser pistol or having the bad guy spontaneously quantum tunnel to Mars or something would "cost" a zillion luckyons and therefore wouldn't happen...
