The luck has to have some sort of limit as to /how/ improbable a situation it can arrange for your benefit. Walking on a carpet of ten pound notes is highly improbable - finding a single ten pound note /just when you need it/ requires far less outlandishness.

It may be running in the background all the time, but need a bit of time to build up enough 'charge', so to speak, to make a ten pound note flying in the wind hit you in the face.
