That should probably depend on how much charge you have - the more charge you have, the more easily it grounds itself on fairly minor wishes, and if you use up all the charge, then there's no helping out even for fairly major wishes until it's replenished a bit.

(This effectively gives you a maximum charge, or at least makes it very hard to charge over a certain point).

  So, how can it be munchkined and reverse-munchkined?

First of all, you can get a desired result for less luckyons if you take the effort to make the desired result more likely first. Yes, you can win a lottery you didn't enter - such as by finding the winning ticket lying in the street - but you expend a good deal less luckyons if you go out and buy a ticket.

Secondly, you might not be able to find a working laser pistol, but you can probably design one with the help of a good random number generator and some algorithm for converting random numbers to design specs. For best results, you probably shouldn't specify the end result - giving your luck power the freedom to come up with anything beneficial gives you a much wider search space to work in.
