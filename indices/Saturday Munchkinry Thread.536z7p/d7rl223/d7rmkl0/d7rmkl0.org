I'm also not sure whether the power needs to be explicitly invoked or whether it's running "in the background" all the time. I think it needs to be explicitly invoked, otherwise every time you walked down the street you'd be walking on a carpet made of ten pound notes (because you'll /continually/ "luckily" find them), but there has to be some way it can be unconsciously triggered (otherwise nobody ever discovers they've got it).
