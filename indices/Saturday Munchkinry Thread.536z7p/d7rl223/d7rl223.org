You're lucky.

This is not all that well-defined, exactly because I'm exploring the idea of /how/ to define it in such a way that it's not enormously overpowered, but let's try these rules for starters:

- Things happen to you in an oddly convenient way for you. For example, if someone shot at you, their gun would jam, or the bullet would hit the cigarette case in your top pocket; if you bet on a roulette wheel your number will come up; if you jumped out of a plane without a parachute, you'd be that lucky person who landed in a soft snowdrift; you get the job and others don't. That sort of thing.
- The power tries to minimise the "outlandishness" of what it does: it attempts to give you the least lucky thing that gives you the luck you want. So the gun jams rather than your enemy spontaneously exploding. It finds local maxima, not global ones.
- It's got some sort of geographic and/or time range; it only looks for "lucky" things that can happen within 10 miles or an hour or something like that. So a lucky-but-plausible chain of events which would have had to have been started over an hour ago can't happen.

Is this still so overpowered that you can take over the universe with it? (That's not necessarily a deal-breaker, /if/ doing so is difficult and requires lots of working out.) How do you defeat someone with such a power? If you thought you /had/ such a power, how would you test whether you did?
