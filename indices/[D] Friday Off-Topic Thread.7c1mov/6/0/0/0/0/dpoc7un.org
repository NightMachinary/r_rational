No, you're right, it's a very complex issue. It wouldn't be fair to discriminate against someone because of a false accusation, yet this happens all the time. This is why there are libel laws.

And in everyday interactions with people, we're more often trying to judge a person's /character/ rather than guilt or innocence. If we wanted to be fully logical about making judgement calls, we'd have to apply a whole suite of techniques. Accounting for the halo effect is just the beginning.

The fact that most of us can't be fully rational all the time means we often get hoodwinked. Sometimes we behave as though a particular politician is the second coming of Christ, and he ends up being a scumbag. Or you date that girl even though there were plenty of signs she's a cheating whore. We can be really bad judges of character sometimes.
