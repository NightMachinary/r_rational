I think the problem here is that we have a hard time getting the base-rate of people being accused of particular crimes, irrespective of guilt, and also actually finding out the relative likelihood of accusation, given guilt.

So, like, yeah, we're actually missing most of the terms we'd need to consider accusation /direct/ evidence of guilt. We're marginalizing over a whole bunch of uncertainties about false accusations, non-unity rates of accusations by real victims against their abusers, non-unity rates of accusations by real victims against the wrong person, etc.
