[[https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amlaw/lwcglink.html][The /Congressional Globe/]] can be fairly interesting. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Wigfall][Louis Wigfall, a Senator from Texas]], made some very eloquent speeches shortly before the Civil War. Some excerpts:

#+begin_quote
  Senators, some of them, have spoken of the excitement of the South. I tell you the excitement has passed off, the fever has subsided, and the patient has collapsed. So far as this Union is concerned, the cold sweat of death is upon it. Your Union is now dead; your Government is now dead. It is to-day but lying in state, surrounded, it is true, by pomp and ceremony. They are, Senators, but the mournful ceremonies, pomps, and pageants which are seen around the mighty dead. The spirit has departed, and it has gone back to those who gave it---the sovereign States of this Union.

  It is known to every Senator upon this floor that one of the States of this Union will, before this day next week, cease to be one of the United States. She will pass a solemn ordinance before this day week. I see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preston_King_(politician)][the Senator from New York [Mr. King]]] smiles. Probably on the other side of your face you will laugh before this thing is terminated. ([[https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName=055/llcg055.db&recNum=86][1860-12-13]])

Of course, see also its modern equivalent, [[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collection.action?collectionCode=CREC&browsePath=2017%2F11&isCollapsed=false&leafLevelBrowse=false&ycord=0][the /Congressional Record/]].

Don't forget: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence][Any person accused of a crime should be considered innocent until his guilt has been proved.]] A failure to punish ten guilty people ([[http://www2.law.ucla.edu/volokh/guilty.htm][more or less]]) is preferable to the punishment of even a single innocent.

As a person who for some time now has felt strongly associated with a [[http://www.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction][community]] that constantly has been receiving [[http://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/5gtu94][frivolous]] accusations of crime, and as a person who once was dragged into court by his ""zero-tolerance"" high school on a frivolous charge of [[https://criminallawyerinnj.com/terroristic-threats-nj-charges/]["""terroristic threats"""]], I am inclined to regard unsubstantiated accusations with a /very/ high degree of skepticism.
