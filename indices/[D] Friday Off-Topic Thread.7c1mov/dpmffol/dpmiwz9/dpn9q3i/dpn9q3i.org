Full agreement here. The principle of presumption of innocence is for criminal courts, where the full might of government can come against the defendant. It is not a shield against the opinions of others.

I reserve the right to change my opinion of whoever and whatever I choose at any time, for any reason; and I recognize that everyone else has that same right. Proof of innocence or guilt is not needed.
