  Don't forget: Any person accused of a crime should be considered innocent until his guilt has been proved.

While I think that this is an important principle in terms of criminal offenses, I think that's too high a bar for everyday life, and for the average person is tantamount to saying that you shouldn't update your model of a person based on new evidence.

For example, if my base probability that an upper class white male is a rapist was /x/, then on knowing that he's had a rape accusation made against him, my probability should be higher than /x/, right? And if he's had multiple rape accusations made against him, from multiple women with no connection to one another, and there are key details that line up between their accounts, and they had little to gain from these accusations (and much to lose), all this contributes to me updating the probability that this man is, in fact, a rapist.

And I'm not going to just say "well, he's no more likely to be a rapist than anyone else" because none of this can be proven, because first of all that's not how the human mind works, and second, I don't think that's actually a useful way to interact with the world, mostly because the primary reason to do it would be as a universal civilizational norm, and I already know that others are going to wildly defect from it.

And even as a norm, it's of questionable utility. Always believing the accuser has the pitfall that people can make false accusations and ruin an innocent person's life, but always believing the defendant has the pitfall that people can just get away with any crime for which there's not going to be direct, non-eyewitness evidence (e.g. most sexual abuse or harassment). So to my mind, there has to be some /balance/, some standard of proof that we, as a society, have when talking about things that aren't provable crimes (because they aren't provable, or aren't crimes, or both). And in my opinion, "innocent until proven guilty in a court of law" is too far in favor of criminals (or people who have done reprehensible things which aren't actually crimes), in light of the difficulty inherent in getting that proof, especially for private individuals.
