Plenty of non-government jobs around for civil engineers. 99% of the time, the actual design work in my job is done by a private civil engineering firm. Government jobs are extremely flexible and have extremely strong job security, and given I'm the only full time worker in our household of 3, that's a priority. Plus an /actual/ 37.5 hour working week!

Also for me personally, I'm 6 months away from unlocking my long service leave, which is an Australian thing where after you work somewhere for 10 years (7 in government), you get 3 months of paid leave. It used to be so people could go back to England (one month on the boat each way, one month in England, was their logic), but we've kept it around. I plan to use it in 2019 to spend 6 months in a francophone country and finally get to a good level of fluency. I'm considering spending a month of that in Senegal as they have some great affordable immersion courses there, and it's safe enough, but my partners are both not comfortable with the idea at all (one because of the mosquitos/malaria: another because he's worried it's dangerous, and it's /not like I'd be going to the border with Mauritania/, but being in Western Australia /everything/ looks a hop skip and a jump away to our sense of scale).

I like your point about mistakes. One of my most formative experiences as a young engineer was when I was surveilling a bridge maintenance project and I had to deal with an Aboriginal monitor - they watch the site during riverbed disturbance because the local mythology is that the Wagul (giant snake) slithered along the ground to form the rivers, so the riverbed are where its belly touched the ground, so they're sacred. Long story short, there was an issue with the monitor not being invited on a day that he was meant to be there. I knew in advance that this would happen and raised my concerns with the site foreman and he said that they'd take advantage of a loophole and it'd be OK. I escalated my concerns to my manager and he agreed with the foreman. I /wish/ I'd escalated my concerns higher and higher until /SOMEBODY/ listened to me, but I was fresh out of uni and didn't have the courage to talk to people. Long story short, the loophole IS NOT THAT WEIRD TRICK THAT ABORIGINAL MONITORS DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT, the monitor was /PISSED/, and my boss's boss had to drive 45 minutes each way to talk to the guy and calm him down. My conscience is clear because given my knowledge and experience I did everything I reasonably could be expected to have done, but I wish I could have done it differently.
