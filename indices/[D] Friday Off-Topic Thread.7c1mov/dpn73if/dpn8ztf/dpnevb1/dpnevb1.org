  Personally, I like hearing about people's mistakes: what went wrong, how did you deal with it, what did you learn? If someone says they never make mistakes, or that they learned the wrong lessons from them... you get the idea.

I don't really like that line of thinking. It makes some sense on an object level, but on the long term [[http://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2013-02-05][you're training people to be better meta-liars]].

People can and will use the "If I admit to a lesser fault, people will assume that I'm honest and I'm not hiding any larger fault" strategy. (the first time I remember coming across someone else mentioning it was in lit class, when reading Racine's Ph√®dre)
