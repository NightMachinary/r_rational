This is called a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_hangout][Limited Hangout]].

Regardless, getting people to talk about their mistakes works anyways. It still filters those people who can't bring themselves to admit they aren't perfect; and in other cases it helps you get an idea of the person's experience. Even if they lie about everything, the "test" still works, because you can't fake knowledge.
