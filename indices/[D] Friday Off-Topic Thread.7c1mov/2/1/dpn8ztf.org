Uncivil engineers are better. They don't depend on government to get a job.

But yeah, that process is real screwed up. I understand that government processes are driven by a CYA mentality, and every screw-up is answered by more WTFery. Hence the laws penalizing references for lying.

So, job hunting. An employer puts out an advertisement with all the skills they want an employee to have, and maybe advertise a salary for someone who has a quarter of those skills. Then people with none (or very few) of the skills apply, and try to fool the interviewers into hiring them. Maybe some of them even believe they have the skills.

In order to stand out, you need to show not only that you can do the work, but that you can do it better than other people. Usually that means showing your knowledge of process and risk mitigation. Personally, I like hearing about people's mistakes: what went wrong, how did you deal with it, what did you learn? If someone says they never make mistakes, or that they learned the wrong lessons from them... you get the idea.

Anyways, good luck!
