So, I'm applying for a job - give myself a 10% chance of getting it, 50% chance of being interviewed. Deadline's Monday at midday, at which point the job I'm currently doing will be advertised (I've been told) and I'll have to apply for /that/ (I'm currently doing that job but being paid for a lower level job, it's more complicated than that but it's close enough).

Anyway, to apply for government jobs in Australia, you have to write basically a 1 page essay on 3 different "selection criteria" - so basically, 3 long answer questions about why you are good at things, with examples (my three are road and bridge design, construction and maintenance; project and contract management; and managing financial and other resources). I /also/ need to submit a resume but it's not nearly as important. They'll use my selection criteria to work out if they want to interview me, the resume will be a tiebreaker/sanity check (e.g. if I said I managed a road project but my resume only shows me working at McDonald's), and they'll interview me, if they like me they'll contact my referees, my referees will have to /fill out a form/ that it is /illegal to lie on/ saying I can do all the things that are on their list of job requirements, and then if I'm in the top after all that, I'll get offered the job! Yay! (and the $15/week payrise!! DOLLA DOLLA BILLS Y'ALL).

People in the [[https://complice.co/room/lesswrong][lesswrong productivity chatroom]] (recommended, shameless plug) are quite surprised at this process; they're more used to the more typical process (that is used for most jobs here; it's the government that's weird) where you submit your resume, they contact your referees, you go through a few rounds of interviews, and you're offered the job or not. (Or: your uncle's friend needs a software engineer and you get the job through sheer nepotism).

But surely, there must be other "standard procedures" for applying for certain jobs in your neck of the woods, dear reader? Or is it just the Australian government that is weird?

(btw the stated reason for this process is it's meant to be less discriminatory because you're judging them on their ability to do work rather than judging which school they went to, who they worked for, etc)

(aside: I asked my current manager if he'd be one of my referees. I gave him the list of job requirements and said please make sure he can endorse me for all of those because if a referee can't endorse you that's kind of bad. I've been working for this guy a good 10 months. He says he can't endorse me for having skills in e.g. road and bridge design because the road and bridge design I do isn't /identical/ to the type of road and bridge design I'd be doing in the new job. He did this for a bunch of items on the list. This was rather shocking as the job is open to the general public, so they are quite willing to hire someone who doesn't even have experience doing work in the same organisation, but apparently my manager thinks that because I design $9 million road projects I'm completely unqualified to ever design $100 million road projects! /rant)
