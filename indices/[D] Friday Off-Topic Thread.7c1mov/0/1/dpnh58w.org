I've worked a lot in Vue the last few months, and I'm pretty fond of it. I've only glanced at the other frameworks, but I feel like Vue is the most "declarative" of them; in that most of your code describes what you want to get, not how you want to get it.

The Vue.js approach to say "I want to have one version of this tag for each element of this array" (a scenario that comes up pretty often) is to add a v-for attribute to your tag; the React.js approach involves string concatenation.

That said, I would probably recommend React.js over any other framework, because I think it's the one most likely to be maintained on the long term.
