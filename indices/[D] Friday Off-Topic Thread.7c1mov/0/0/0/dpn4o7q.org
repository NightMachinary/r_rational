The reasons you list as downsides for backbone are largely the reasons I chose not to even bother persuing React, with the exception of age. It's apparently got almost no structure to it, in exchange for having the best handling for UI all things considered, to the point where some people use React /on top of/ one of the other frameworks to get the best of both worlds. This isn't really a positive for me (as you point out), since I'm a beginner and prefer to have some structure to lean on. Plus, I'm a C# developer; I'm /used/ to having a certain amount of prescription to go off of, and I'm not sure I'll ever really want a truly wide-open sandbox.

Thanks for the second opinion, tho! It's good to see I haven't veered /too/ far off the beaten path.
