Looks like you named all of the most popular frameworks which handle frontend development aside from React. That omission seems kinda surprising to me since I've gotten the impression that it's /the/ most popular. That said, I consume a fair amount of media related to web development and it's my impression that you can't really go horribly wrong by choosing any of them.

I personally use Backbone for day-to-day development at work, but I wouldn't recommend it over any of the alternatives you mentioned for a few different reasons:

- It seems to generally be considered outdated.
- It's less prescriptive about /how/ you do things. That's not inherently a downside, but it can be pretty bad when you're working in an unfamiliar area. It's like being tossed a box of tools and told to have at it. The end result can be pretty hard to maintain if you don't have the knowledge and discipline needed to use a consistent design throughout.
- It's not really "batteries included", which means it's up to you to choose how to fill in the gaps and make sure everything works well together.

I guess that's :+1: from this internet stranger. Good luck!
