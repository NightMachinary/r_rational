After many delays due to scheduling and waiting until I was in the mood for madcap insanity, I finally finished the first season/Battle Tendency arc of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. It was plenty of fun, though my [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6vz27p/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dm432zghttps://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6vz27p/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dm432zg][enthusiastic addiction I posted about when I started]] has unfortunately waned. I'm definitely looking forward to Stardust Crusaders, I actually like villain of the week stories, but I've gone from shamelessly loving the insanity that is JoJo to /just/ liking it and I can't help but feel disappointed.

I think it's due to the pace at which I consumed it. I was only able to binge Phantom Blood and ended up taking a three week break before watching the climax of Battle Tendency over the course of another two weeks, so the plot lost its momentum. Since I found both arcs to lack character development or emotionally satisfying conclusions, it's harder for the series to maintain the surreal madness high I want from it over a longer period of time.

I still want JoJo to be a part of my life, as everyone should, so I'm faced with the quandary of how to consume it and other serial shows with my new schedule. I'm working 12-hours a day, four days a week, listening to podcasts as semi-background noise. All I can watch during the week are relaxing episodic shows while the weekend features my Mom and I binging series together when the dogs she watches for her job finally settle down.

I'm going to have to start scheduling when to consume entertainment on my days off. I have a massive backlog of tv, movies, comics, books, and even some video games that I would like to get to. I'm used to picking what to do based on my current mindset, and failing to make a timely decision due to the sheer number of choices combined with insecurity over starting something new without finishing something else first. So I'd like some advice.
