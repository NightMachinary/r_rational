I'm around fifteen thousand words into my Undertale fanfic and only on the second day. I'm discovering that my writing style is very verbose. I'll probably have to pester someone to help me cut the size of it, but for now I'm happy to be as lengthy in volume as I please, just for the sake of practice.

It's going well that aside, though. Not published yet, for those curious, as I haven't done any major revisions for the first chapters and want to make sure everything's consistent first.
