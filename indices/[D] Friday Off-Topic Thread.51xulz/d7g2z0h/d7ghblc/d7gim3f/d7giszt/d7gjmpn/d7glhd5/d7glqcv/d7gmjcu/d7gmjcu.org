Oh yeah. I just can't play other FPS games anymore :(. For most people, 32v32 is large fight. For me, I can't stop thinking "I could be farming a skirmish this size with my rocketpods, /right now/."

EVE and PS2 are the sort of games that really skew your expectations of what a video game should be like :P
