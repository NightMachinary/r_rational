Oh! Another planetmans.

You're right, it's more speed chess and less twitch shooting. Different skills at play for different games, I suppose. The older I get, the more I appreciate the strategic elements at play, rather than the rote execution needed to enact those strategies, but I suppose it's amiss for me to forget that there are skills besides tactics.

(Speaking of scale, I love Planetside for that and that alone. I wish MMOFPS was more of a thing.)
