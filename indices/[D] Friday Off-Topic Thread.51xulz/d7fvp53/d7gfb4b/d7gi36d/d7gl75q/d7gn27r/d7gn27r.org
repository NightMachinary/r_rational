Well for the record I'm not as good a programmer! (I'd like to think I'm as good a designer, but we all have our vices, don't we.)

I'm totally down to collaborate. I only have the faintest of ideas for what the art design needs to be: hex grid, probably top-down, probably 2-D. But hey--if you want to start spitballing ideas or trying things out, let me know. I'll PM you contact details for whenever you're free.
