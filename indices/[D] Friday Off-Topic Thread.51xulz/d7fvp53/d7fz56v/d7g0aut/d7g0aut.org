Experience in building complex mechanical game systems is what I hope to gain. Do it first using the base of someone else's system as a proof of concept while working out the technical bits without needing to worry about the design so much, then make my own. Commander Keen was prototyped by John Carmack building Super Mario for the PC, and this is the same basic idea. The actual game implementation will likely not encompass more than pallet to pewter + an arena (if I even get that far), and if released it would be to no fanfare in an obviously incomplete, if playable, state.

[[https://bitbucket.org/ketura/billspc][Code is here]], didn't think it'd be useful in code form before the game libraries themselves were integrated (not to mention the code is an ugly SOB). Until then it's a glorified limited JSON editor.

It's built using WPF and hasn't been tested in any OS besides Windows 10, so it doesn't surprise me that wine craps out on it. Sorry to hear it, though.
