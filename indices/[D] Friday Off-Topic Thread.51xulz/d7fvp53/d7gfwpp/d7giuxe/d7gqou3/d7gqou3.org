Agree with [[/u/Anakiri]] mostly, though alternatively my preference would be to simplify them based off Base Stat Totals, assuming you're using those as a guide of any kind for the strength of pokemon in your game:

Fast: 200-450 Final Evolution BST

Medium: 451-525

Slow: 526-599

Legendary: 600+

The last's name might be a misnomer since it includes the pseudo-legendaries like Dragonite, and excludes some legendaries like the storm birds, but I think tweaking the stats of legendaries makes sense anyway, and even certain non-legendary like onix. Alternatively just make the last one 580+, since there's no pokemon that are between 580-600 that aren't legendaries (besides mega evolutions).

This way the pokemon aren't arbitrarily jumping around on the power level, or becoming more rapidly powerful for no discernable reason. Evolutions already serve as a good shifting point by which to measure jumps in power, and having some pokemon gain more stats faster between certain level ranges, but not others, is just adding more complication without any real value.

Random additional points:

- Evolutions should probably take longer, especially if you're extending the level cap or doing away with it altogether.

- Stones should be a held item on a pokemon for awhile before they evolve. I'd also add a level requirement to pokemon that normally only evolve by stones or trading, if level is meant to be at least somewhat correlated with age. (Alternatively, just include age as a factor too, and have pokemon age faster through battle.)

- Related, experience should be slowly gained passively while pokemon are outside their pokeballs, if there's the ability to travel in the overworld and have a pokemon out with you.

- Pokemon should gain EV stats through training at a fairly significant rate, maybe only through training, in order to differentiate getting physically stronger through combat (which comes from EXP) and becoming a better fighter through discipline.

- Are pokemon in your world sapient? Not sure how much you're basing it off my story, but in either case, I headcanon Intelligence as an extra stat that affects things like training speed, amount of moves a pokemon can learn, and unruliness. If it's not too much effort, might be an interesting stat to add.

- Environment should matter for which pokemon are able to be used. No fish pokemon on land. Only aquatic pokemon while underwater, if diving is in the game. Maybe some exceptions.

- Size of pokemon. You can't summon a wailord for an indoor battle. You can summon a wailord in a big enough space and just have it be stationary during the battle, but all moves against it should automatically have 100% accuracy.
