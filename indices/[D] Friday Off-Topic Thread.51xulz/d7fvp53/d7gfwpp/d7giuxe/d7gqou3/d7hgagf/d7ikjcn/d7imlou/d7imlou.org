  Rationally I feel like delaying evolution should only be possible with exposure to an Everstone, which is probably going to be a pretty rare item, or at least not a widely available one.

That's a good point, actually, for the level evolutions. My original idea was that you had to attack or order one of your pokemon to attack your evolving pokemon as they were going through metamorphosis, which would interrupt it but severely put a damper on your relationship. Pros and cons, and maybe you /don't/ want to risk pissing off your high-level Dragonair too much...but the Everstone idea is simpler, and supported by canon to boot.

  Even without a pokemon limit of 6 in your game, having so many repeats wouldn't be all that advantageous. Though if pokemon die realistically often, that might be a good justification not to put all your stones into one pokemon.

The more I put into the design, the more it makes me think of the days when I played Nethack nonstop, and it's definitely taken on more roguelike elements. I was ambivalent before, but I'm now leaning towards allowing permadeath in rare-ish circumstances. This is probably triggered from me watching a dude do a 1 hour 54-minute speedrun of Yellow using essentially only a Nidoking and HM slaves. It was interesting, for sure, but I couldn't stop thinking about how screwed this trainer would be if he lost his one powerhouse, in a more realistic setting.

  Easiest way I can think to do this is to make there be real life money constraints. If time passes in day-night and weekly cycles, just have your trainer incur living expenses. Even staying at a Trainer House and eating basic food costs a few bucks a day. Keeping your game running would drain your finances, or worse if you implement a "Fed" and "Rested" meter that your trainer needs to keep up to stay alive (which I think would add a lot to the immersion, but I get if that's too much for the game's first conception).
#+end_quote

My ideal game would in fact have the fed/rested meters for both you and pokemon team alike, but you're right, it's definitely pie-in-the-sky. The financial drain is a good start, and combined with permadeath would prevent one from just camping on route 1 with your strongest pokemon out, too. Man, I need to think more about how the cities themselves will be built; that's a whole nother can of worms.

  Makes sense. Also, you should probably start with just the original 151 anyway, or if you're doing it by region then do what I did and go by just the pokemon available in the latest version of whatever region the game is originally set in.

Yeah, [[/u/UlraRedSpectrum]] expressed interest in doing the art, so we'll probably start with the canon types that are between Pallet and Pewter, then their evolutions, then add "extra" pokemon that make sense to have in that area, and branch out from there. Personally I will probably only ever look at the first two generations and then add any pokemon I think are well-designed beyond that. I refuse to force myself to implement floating chandeliers and ice cream cones for the sake of completeness.
