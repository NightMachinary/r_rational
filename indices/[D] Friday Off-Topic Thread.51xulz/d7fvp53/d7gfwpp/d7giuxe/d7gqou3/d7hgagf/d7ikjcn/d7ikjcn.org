  This would result in a de facto delay of most evolutions rather than an enforced one, but I kind of like using incentives rather than invisible walls. It may not be feasible, but either way evolutions will need to be more important of a milestone.

Rationally I feel like delaying evolution should only be possible with exposure to an Everstone, which is probably going to be a pretty rare item, or at least not a widely available one. In my world I see it as a luxury item for people who own pokemon as pets, to ensure that the cute and cuddly mon they have doesn't turn into a destructive giant ten years down the line. I think most trainers would be fine with just letting their pokemon evolve when they naturally can, so there's no real reason to incentive lack of evolution imo.

  My idea was actually dosages, so it requires X stones to get a Raichu but only Y for Jolteon, or something. If they're difficult to get, it could even be made more common of a method than canon, requiring the player to decide between evolving the one powerhouse that requires 20, or evolving several less powerful pokemon instead.

Kind of like Candy in Pokemon GO? It's an interesting alternative, though it mostly works in GO because you can have hundreds of pokemon "with you" at any given time and putting pokemon in Gyms limits your fighting ability, so having six strong Vaporeon is better than having one super strong vaporeon in many cases.

Even without a pokemon limit of 6 in your game, having so many repeats wouldn't be all that advantageous. Though if pokemon die realistically often, that might be a good justification not to put all your stones into one pokemon.

  [[/u/UltraRedSpectrum]] mentioned having Metapod/Kakuna evolve through time and not leveling, and age is honestly probably the way to abstract that... Do I leave my game running so everyone ages? Is it based on steps instead?

Easiest way I can think to do this is to make there be real life money constraints. If time passes in day-night and weekly cycles, just have your trainer incur living expenses. Even staying at a Trainer House and eating basic food costs a few bucks a day. Keeping your game running would drain your finances, or worse if you implement a "Fed" and "Rested" meter that your trainer needs to keep up to stay alive (which I think would add a lot to the immersion, but I get if that's too much for the game's first conception).

  Hell, I'm not even sure I'll ever implement Wailord just for the sheer amount of problems something that large brings to the table. But size will be something that is tracked and enforced; your pokemon will take up X number of hexes depending on its size, and if there's not enough hexes in an area to support your pokemon, your pokeball errors out and refuses to open.

Makes sense. Also, you should probably start with just the original 151 anyway, or if you're doing it by region then do what I did and go by just the pokemon available in the latest version of whatever region the game is originally set in.

  Thanks for the feedback and idea dump!

No problem! I continue to think about these things for a pokemon tabletop RPG anyway :)
