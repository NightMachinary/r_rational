there's no way this is a real phobia in and of itself. notice the wording of the person who was quoted in the article

#+begin_quote
  the idea of living forever was even more unsettling than the idea of no longer existing after death.

In other words, he still finds the idea of no longer existing after death to be unsettling. I'm going to taboo the words life and death and immortality so that I can speak perfectly clearly. As we should all know by now, if he doesn't want to cease to exist, it means he wants to continue existing forever.

This "fear of eternity" could just be a fear of the unknown. Maybe fear of things that are very large-scale and impossible to comprehend. Because something that is that large, like the distance between galaxies, is bigger than you are. And there is no way to feasibly plan out and organize schedules around an infinite number days. With an infinite number of days to exist, a person might have no real deadlines or time-constraints on anything they do, except that which they themselves decide to enforce on themselves. Not saying that it's a bad thing, but people would have to put in a bit of work and soul-searching to figure out what they want to do with their time, and a lot of people don't like having to think much.

I mean, I suppose if you're faced with a choice between putting in the effort to figure out what you want to do so that you can live a more active lifestyle, versus lazing about doing nothing and being bored out of your mind, you'd choose to put in the effort so that you're not bored. It would mean that, i.e., if someone invites you to a party on the other side of the milky way once the whole thing has been explored, you need to actually make it to that party /on time/ before the party ends. Otherwise you miss the party.

But most people are not that rational, and so they would not think of breaking eternity down into manageable chunks of time for scheduling/organization purposes. They would just look at the astronomical amount of time they have and get overwhelmed.

Or at least that's one possible explanation.
