Does anyone have any good discussions on the likelihood of simulated consciousnesses being likely in the near (~60 years of so) future?

I've seen many articles discuss it as if it's very likely, because in theory it sounds easy. But all of the progress in real life I've seen makes it sound extremely difficult in practice.
