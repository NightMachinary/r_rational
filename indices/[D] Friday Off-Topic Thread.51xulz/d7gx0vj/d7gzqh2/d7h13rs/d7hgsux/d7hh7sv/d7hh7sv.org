  still the possibility of needing a Masters for a career.

Eh... maybe. I'd be surprised. At least for a career in CS.

What do you expect to actually get out of a masters? Aside from credential-ism. Is there anything you can do to show you have the same skills?

Why not start doing a "masters thesis" today? Getting some open-source work under your belt is an excellent way to show potential employers that you can actually code. Something a lot of masters students seem to be unable to do.

There's a very real concern that university grads aren't actually going to be a better fit then someone fresh off-of a programming bootcamp.

The sad fact is that until you have a tens of thousands of lines of real code under your belt, you're probably still a junior programmer. No matter what your education.
