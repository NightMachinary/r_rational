Well first, it's good to keep in mind how good I actually am. You can see my resume [[https://traverseda.github.io][here]]. It's pretty good for Halifax, NS. Which doesn't have a lot of work. It also doesn't yet reflect some of my newer contracts. But I'm not exactly working for google, either. It depends on what you're trying to do.

That's with me having dropped out of highschool, and being entirely self-taught. So I like to think I have a pretty decent grasp of turning nothing into a career.

Normally my first bit of advice would be to read the sequences and become stronger, but baring that....

Step one is to think of it from your potential employers point of view. How do you make /them/ money?

For example, on my resume I say

#+begin_quote
  Directed the implementation of haystack/solr search engine integration, significantly speeding up long-running natural language processing tasks.
#+end_quote

Which shows not only familiarity with a technology, but also the tangible improvement of "speeding up tasks". Which did decrease the cost of running and developing NLP tasks. Connect things back to the bottom line.

Often equally important, how do you make their life easier? How do you reduce their management burden (be predictable, and predictably competent).

I'm happy to talk about specifics, but without knowing more about your field/goals I can't give more specific advice.

And also, I was kind of forced into a career by being dirt-poor. I honestly can't say whether or not academia is a bad idea if you're not feeling some serious financial pressure. It might be a good position to leverage to start your own startup, or to do pure research. I don't know.
