  That's not to say that what you fly is unimportant--but if you know what you're doing (and you pick the right fight), it comes down to skill and skill alone.

Obviously, I've never played EVE, and am therefore not the best judge of how it works. But the skills EVE requires seem more strategic in nature-- less like, say, juggling, and more like playing a chess game. As someone who almost exclusively plays planetside 2, with a little bit of warthunder, although EVE definitely has the /scale/ I crave (why I'm interested in it in the first place), it lacks dogfighting mechanics as I'm used to them. Even in Planeside 2, nominally a shooter, I spend more than a fifth of my time in a fighter, and non-negligible amounts of time in the bomber, repairing my aircraft, or running from enemy fire after I've bailed from the flaming wreck of my aircraft.

EVE is still a really cool game, but by the time PS2 dies I'm hoping SC will fulfill my dogfighting and scale cravings at the same time.
