Eh? If you're in 1000-man fleets, or doing PvE, then yeah, it's going to come down to the richer fits and pressing f1, but I can assure you that in solo flight or small groups, how you fly is very important. Combine speed tanking with range control and you have a complex dance of getting shots in while you're within your optimal range but outside the optimal range of your opponent.

I remember one time that some dude in a Stabber came out to harass us while we lived out in Se7erance space, and he just completely picked us apart like we were made of paper. Six of us died repeatedly to him as he lazily ripped us to shreds. A Stabber is not an expensive ship, and if the six of us hadn't've been completely hopeless we would have wrecked him...if we could just touch him. But he held us all at arm's length, popped those of us that posed a threat and toyed with the rest of us. In a fit that probably cost 20 mil.

That's not to say that what you fly is unimportant--but if you know what you're doing (and you pick the right fight), it comes down to skill and skill alone.
