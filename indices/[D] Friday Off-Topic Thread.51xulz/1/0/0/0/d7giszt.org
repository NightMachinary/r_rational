Huh, I might try it out, then.

Though to be honest, my biggest issue would still be there-- that the combat is gear based, rather than skill-based, and tab-targeting rather than an actual flight model.

I'm almost certainly going to end up trying EVE valkyrie eventually, though (that is, if I end up caving and buying an oculus rift or vive).
