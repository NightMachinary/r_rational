I'd like to share the fictional roleplay civilisation/government that I participate in inside the EVE Online space MMO.

I run a corporation called the Alexylva Paradox that have colonised a solar system they named Origin. We live in Origin ingame and over the years have created a large amount of lore surrounding the government, people, technology, and values that Origin has. I thought you guys might be interested in what we've created, since our characters are all rationalist transhumanists, and we're trying to make the most stable/functional/optimal government possible. We use science to determine the objectively best policies, or at least, attempt to. Our highest rank is called a 'Coordinator' and Meditations on Moloch is required reading for those applying for the position.

Here are three wikipedia style articles that provide the core of the information about Origin to inform our roleplay:

[[http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?title=Origin][Origin]]

[[http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?title=Government_of_Origin][Government of Origin]]

[[http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?title=People_of_Origin][People of Origin]]

Its all totally hypothetical of course, and there's probably several ways that this government could just rapidly collapse due to corruption in the real world, but I'm curious what the thoughts are on what we've built.
