Reminds me of some of scott alexander's worldbuilding stuff. Here's a few random thoughts on how I'd break it:

I think hte biggest point of failure is the cellular democracy, as that seems very open to gerrymandering, etc. For example I put 55 blue neighbourhoods in one second order council, and the same within councils, or designate neighbourhood councils in such a way that people I agree with control the areas with the best stuff. Basically whoever sets the boundaries has enormous political power.

I don't know the setting, but with sufficiently advanced tech you can handwave some of those problems by making it easy to move between constituencies,. You also have the problem of how disputes between rthem are resolved, or what to do when an individual of one jurisdiction commits a crime against one from another. For story purposes that could be a useful source of conflict, have two normally mutually indifferent groups in conflict, and have a third party drawn in as a mediator.

IF you want to gain supreme power in the scientific conclave, just make sure you are friends with the people who determine the "meritocratic" promotion criteria
