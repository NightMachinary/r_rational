*Matrix multiplication*

Could somebody explain to me, in a way I'd actually understand, how to (remember how to) go about multiplying a pair of matrixes? I've looked at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication#Rectangular_matrices][Wikipedia]], I've read linear algebra books up to where they supposedly explain matrixes, and I keep bouncing up against a mental wall where I can't seem to remember how to figure out how to get the answer.
