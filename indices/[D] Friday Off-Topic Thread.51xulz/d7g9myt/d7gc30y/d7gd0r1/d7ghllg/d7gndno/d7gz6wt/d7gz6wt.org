It's easy to predict how it will work when you subscribe to a certain theory of consciousness, which are usually associated with different philosophical views, but none of them are currently falsifiable so they're all equally likely. If you can create a digital copy of a person's mind just by simulating the position of every atom in their brain, then it's only a matter of waiting until we have a computer that can process that information. However, we can't know if that's how consciousness works until the technology exists to test that theory.
