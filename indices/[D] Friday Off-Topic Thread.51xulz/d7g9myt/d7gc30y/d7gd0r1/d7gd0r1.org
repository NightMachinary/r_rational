So by "live forever" you mean on Earth, right? That would make some sense to me because it's keeping you from heaven. But in the article it references a Reddit thread where the OP talks about being disturbed by living forever in either heaven or hell without really explaining that point of view (I would think by definition, existing in heaven would take care of the problem).

Also, if it makes you feel better, even the "rationalist" version of immortality probably won't truly let people exist for eternity imo.
