I doubt I have an actual phobia, but despite everything I've learned from rationalists and agreeing with nearly all of it I still instinctively shudder at the thought of living forever. I understand that it's a good thing for everyone to become immortal, yet I still don't feel that way. Of course, I'm a theist, so my perspective might be different.
