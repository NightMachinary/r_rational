I don't know of fanfics, but there is a line of published fiction by Karen Traviss (see [[https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Contact-Star-Wars-Republic/dp/0345478274/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8][here]] for the first one), which are absolutely amazing. She personalizes the clones so well, and adds a level of backstory to episode 3 that is wonderful.
