Depends greatly on the degree of credentialism in the relevant field and on availability of independent certification for said field.

I think IT/CS is one of the fields where people will care more about your actual portfolio and demonstrable skill, and not about the certs you bring, but we'd best get [[/u/traverseda]] to comment on this, since he likely has a much better grip on the actual state of affairs there.

If we're talking about mainstream academic institutions, then going for a PhD is pretty much mandatory, I suspect.

I'm finishing up a PhD and expect it to be completely useless, since I plan on switching careers anyway, so keep in mind this fact. By the time you get the degree you may no longer be interested in making use of it.
