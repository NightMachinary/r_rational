Yeah that makes sense. It's a good thing then, that I've been coding for years since high school. I'm actually working in two research labs this year. One of them as a coding monkey to get their experiments working (I'd be done by now if they didn't keep changing the task designs on me!) and the other is to get experience conducting the experiments with face-to-face interaction with subjects.

The main issue I actually have is direction. I have marketable skills, but I'm not certain of what I will be doing in the future. What I'm asking for is how do people figure out what jobs they know they can be happy with? I decided to ask several different sources: family, older friends, college resources, and here.
