Thanks for the reply.

I'm in my last year in college and trying to decide between taking the time and expense to go to graduate school versus going straight into a job. So I'm going to graduate with a BS in Cognitive Science and a minor in Computer Science.

I've been leaning towards going into work in non-academia related fields which eliminates the need for a PhD, but there's still the possibility of needing a Masters for a career.

What I'm currently trying to do now is make a list of potential jobs and decide what I have to do to get these jobs.

I appreciate the advice!
