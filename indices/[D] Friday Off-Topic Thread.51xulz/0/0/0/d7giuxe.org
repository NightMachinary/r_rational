Hmm! I knew about the level xp rates, but I struggled to find an analysis that explained the /ramifications/ of the system like you just did here. Bulbapedia is utterly fantastic for collating data and explaining mechanics, but it leaves something to be desired when putting it all together.

Your explanation definitely makes me rethink the importance of levels in a system like this. I had considered stretching the levels out to scale up to 500, or be limitless, or take them out entirely and scale based on EXP amount, but you're right, I wasn't giving the old system enough credit. I was still planning on also including EXP curves, I just thought I would also throw it in for stat growth as well, which I think will be more immediately intuitive, since as you mention the current system is more obtuse. FWIW levelling will be slower in this game, whether it be through less frequent successful battles or higher EXP requirements or whatnot, so early/mid/late game will be more of a thing, with timing peaks being more important. There's a lot of influence from how Dota works in that regard. Also if team death is a thing, well...then it will be even more pronounced.
