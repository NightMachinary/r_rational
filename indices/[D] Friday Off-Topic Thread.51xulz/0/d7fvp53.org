So a while back I mentioned [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4snm5i/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/d5ayvuo][I might try taking a stab at a rational pokemon game]], and I've been sort of hacking away at the problem ever since. Not on the game itself, but on the tools that would be required for such a thing. Such a data-heavy game would need to be able to /very easily/ create dozens or hundreds of pokemon. Anyone interested can take a look at [[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6516469/Bills%20PC/Bills_PC_Release_2016-09-09.zip][my progress so far here]] ([[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Co3cS6p_5h6HGs3tzjbJRRbUFd-vI2njVGjYyz8jwE4/edit?usp=drive_web][basic documentation here]]).

I'm currently working on a good way to show the difference between pokemon stats, so of course I put in a chart, which led me to think about stat growth curves and such. Canon uses a very simple 2x linear growth, so you can expect to have BaseAttack attack by level 50 and 2 * BaseAttack attack by 100, ignoring EVs and IVs.

This is boring, so I thought of some different ways that stats might grow, [[http://fooplot.com/#W3sidHlwZSI6MCwiZXEiOiJtaW4oKDUwKjAuOCkvNTUqeCwoNTAqMC44KSouOCkrKCgzMDArKDUwKjAuOCkpLygxK2VeKC0wLjA1NSooeC01MCkpKSkiLCJjb2xvciI6IiMwMDAwMDAifSx7InR5cGUiOjAsImVxIjoibWluKDUwLzkuMCp4LDUwKSsoMip4KSsyMCIsImNvbG9yIjoiIzg3OUUwNiJ9LHsidHlwZSI6MCwiZXEiOiJtaW4oNTAvNDAuMCp4LDUwKSsoeC81LjApXjIiLCJjb2xvciI6IiNGRjAwMDAifSx7InR5cGUiOjAsImVxIjoic2luKHgvMy44KzQpKm1pbih4KjEuNSw1MCkrKCgoMzIwKyg1MCowLjgpKS8oMStlXigtMC4wNTUqKHgtNDUpKSkpKSIsImNvbG9yIjoiIzAwNkRGQyJ9LHsidHlwZSI6MTAwMCwid2luZG93IjpbIi01IiwiMTAxIiwiLTIwIiwiNTUwIl0sInNpemUiOlsxMDAwLDYwMF19XQ--][which I plotted here]]. Black is the standard curve, a logistical function that eases in and out in what I feel to be a very natural way. Green is bug, peaking early and then leveling to linear growth that is shortly outclassed. Red is Dragon, or any other long-lived dominant apex creature. And blue is, well, erratic and might not make sense at all to use, but was fun to plot.

Currently I'm stuck trying to figure out how to handle different base stats using this model. All the curves are different, so throwing "base stat" in as a variable to the curve itself results in wonky results, such as bug dominating at strange times, or Dragon sucking and then completely destroying.

Simply adding the base stat could work, if "base stat" was redefined to mean "power level as a juvenile", but it would mean hardly any difference between the curves at high stat ranges...right now, an assumed base stat 0 under this model results in a difference of about 100 at level 60 between Bug and Erratic, which makes the differen e between curves negligible if the bottom of the curve /starts/ at 400.

Anyhow. Let me know if you have thoughts or critique.

EDIT: oh, /duh/. I'll just treat this like I've named it, as a /growth/ curve and not directly translating level to stat. The point on this curve will be /how much stat was gained/ that level, which will eliminate wonky stat loss and other wierdnesses.
