Do they actually sue them? All I've heard of is DMCA takedown notices and Cease and Desist letters, which are basically a prelude to legal action.

I don't think I've heard of a situation where Nintendo has ever actually sued or requested compensation from a fan game.

Also, the games are usually distributed enough by the time these notices are sent that a sufficiently determined person could still find them online.
