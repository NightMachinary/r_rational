Reading through that older discussion, I ran into this:

  (Not to mention my skill set: I'm a programmer and an alright animator, but standard art is right out, so my mind is already automatically filtering scopes that can't be covered by just those two skills.)

If you do ever wind up needing any art for your game, I'd be really interested in contributing. I'm either finished or nearly finished with the icons for hackerkiba's Factorio mod, and I don't think he needs the textures done, so I'll be in the market for a new pet project.

(For the record, I'm not as good as the artists for the original pokemon games.)
