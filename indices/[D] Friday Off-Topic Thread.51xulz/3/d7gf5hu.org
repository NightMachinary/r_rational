Not quite off-topic and certainly not big enough for its own thread, but I found this entertaining.

  Different approaches to rationality, as illustrated by the margarine brand "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter".

  - Eliezer Yudkowsky can believe it's not butter if, and only if, it is not in fact butter. He feels that this ought not to be difficult. He considers the existence of the brand to be a minor, yet symbolic, Civilisational Fail.
  - Scott Alexander, after a thorough literature review and ten thousand words on the results, is tentatively inclined to believe it's not butter. However, his epistemic status remains "Dairy is not my field, I may be missing something important". He is working on a blog post on the implications for neoreaction.
  - Brienne Yudkowsky is installing a trigger action pattern to decide whether any given substance is or is not butter; she is currently wiggling her ears whenever the question occurs to her. The next CFAR retreat may include a seminar on her results, if there is enough interest. It is very likely that there will be enough interest.
  - Gwern hasn't had time to form an actual belief on the point, but he has a five-thousand-word blog post outlining the self-blinding mechanism he will use to test whether he can distinguish it from butter.
  - Topher Hallquist notes that the important question is not whether it's butter, but whether the production method is an ethical disaster of biblical proportions. He advises people to eat the stuff if, and only if, they believe it was not produced by torturing cows.
  - Alicorn has written a story in which the protagonist discovers that, actually, it is butter. She is unable to make his civilisation agree that this is an ethical disaster of codexical proportions, but she does manage to arrange his life, and that of her polycule, in such a way that he doesn't have to eat the horrible stuff, and also she gets laid.
  - Alyssa Vance knows exactly what regulations prevent it from being marketed as "I Do Believe It's Butter", and the precise effects the dairy lobby's nut-grip on Congress has had on American obesity.
