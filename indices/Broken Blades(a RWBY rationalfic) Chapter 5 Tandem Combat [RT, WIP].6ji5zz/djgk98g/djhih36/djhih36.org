I'll give a bit of explanation later on(especially about drones/AI, and some more on how dust works) but WoG: Because dust and skilled aura usage took care of a lot of the stuff people in our world needed to discover how to control naturally, and certain semblances make construction and design a lot easier, the discovery/invention of standardized parts happened early on(e.g. Jaune's shield is one of 'the classics' and even it has miniaturized mechanical parts. Because of that and the naturally accelerating pace of innovation(albeit slowed by grimm) at this point mechanical manufacture, particularly of aura-channeling/dust-based tech, is basically at the point where computational tech is in our society--i.e. nearing the vertical line of development.
