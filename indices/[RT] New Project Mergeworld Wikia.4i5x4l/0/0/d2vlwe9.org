Yes it's one I made. Mainly posting it here because I appreciate the variety of fiction I read here and think that the kind of people who also appreciate it might appreciate this as well. It's rational in the sense that it follows (at least to the best of my ability) the rules on the sidebar:

- Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'.

- If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.

- Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil".

- The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.

- The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.

Basically it's a rational take on a super-hero universe.
