  If someone was really thinking clearly about the whole thing, they'd locate a means to use time travel to go back and prevent Demise from cursing the goddess Hylia/Zelda and the hero Link to perpetual triple reincarnation.

I don't think this story is known at the time of any other Zelda game. It seems like it got lost pretty quickly, or this was really, really long ago.

Then again, "use time travel to figure out what you can" is a solid strategy and might lead to learning this. Though I think hopping in a time machine and throwing the dial as far back as it'll go is a strategy we wouldn't flinch to call stupid if it didn't pan out, so I don't know if it's the obvious rational choice.
