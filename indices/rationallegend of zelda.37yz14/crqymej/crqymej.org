If someone was /really/ thinking clearly about the whole thing, they'd locate a means to use time travel to go back and prevent Demise from cursing the goddess Hylia/Zelda and the hero Link to perpetual triple reincarnation.

I think King Daphnes Hyrule was the clearest thinker in the series: he obtained the power to end the curse and its cycles, allowing the eventual creation of a civilization that wouldn't always get ruined by evil overlords on a regular basis.
