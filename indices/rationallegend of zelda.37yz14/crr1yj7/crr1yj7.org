I just thought of something. The triforce could represent virtues of instrumental rationality.

/Wisdom to determine what is right, despite your biases... Courage to attempt what is right, despite your fears... Power to accomplish what is right, despite your weaknesses.../

Of course, the triforce can be used for good or for evil, so it would be a bit more accurate to say “instrumentally rational,” or “right given your values” rather than just “right”
