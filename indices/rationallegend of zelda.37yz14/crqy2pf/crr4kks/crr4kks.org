Rational puzzle design: A door is sealed with a small tube that has a series of tumblers. In order to unseal the door you need a piece of metal with ridges on it at precise heights, in order to allow the tumblers to line up just right to allow the cylinder to turn. It would be a very easy puzzle, except there's no way to see the tumblers and tell how to line them up. The puzzle is impossible to all but the designer.
