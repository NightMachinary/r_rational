Rationalizing the keys is easy. The "key" is actually a container for a fairy, it opens the door by breaking and releasing the fairy.

Of course now you have to rationalize the fairies, but you have to do that anyway. Maybe they're responsible for the hearts and rupees that Link finds everywhere too.

The dungeon ecosystems are driven by magic, with thaumovores and thaumosynthetic plants at the base of the food chain. That's why they're holes in the ground... the first dungeons were natural caverns that reached down to the mana table, later ones were a combination of mines and magic farms, abandoned when the Hyrulian civilization crumbled.

Edit: I love the suggestion in the comments that Navi is the hero. You could start out with Link as the unreliable narrator gradually being replaced by Navi as she realizes that she has to take control of the mission before Link completely stuffs it up.
