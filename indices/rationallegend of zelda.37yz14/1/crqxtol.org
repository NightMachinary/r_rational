[[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1xilpd/bst_rationallegendofzelda/][I brought this up myself a year ago]]. The fic ran into major obstacles in dungeon design, communicating those designs to the reader, and the unending question where the line between videogame and text ought to be.

What I said then:

  For or those two people who don't know what LoZ is all about, I'll summarize: it's a game series where you play as Link, the prophesied hero and bearer of the Triforce of Courage who will defeat the evil Ganon, bearer of the Triforce of Power, thereby saving Princess Zelda, bearer of the Triforce of Wisdom and the rest of the kingdom of Hyrule. Along the way of this epic quest you will meet and help a variety of side characters and collect an arsenal of tools and devices, including the Master Sword, The Blade of Evil's Bane. How do we rationalize that? It's pulp fantasy, through and through. For everyone wondering about rationalizing these sorts of irrational stories, I have some advice. I've been doing a lot of thinking on this topic, and there seem to be two approaches: * Take everything about the story and deconstruct it, rebuilding a carefully designed narrative. LoZ doesn't really have enough meat to sustain a story like that for very long. * Take one thing about the story and exploit it to the fullest, usually what the story did best. For LoZ, these are its Dungeons.

  And so, *I propose the rationalization of the Legend of Zelda series by means of making Link an architect*. The fic will take a rationalist slant to architecture, engineering, level design, and puzzle design/solving.

  I like the concept and appreciate the insight in your planning/creative process, but... trying to attend a magic academy? I know ration!lovedStoryFromChildhood usually diverges pretty fast, but they usually start similarly. If your using Twilight Princes as your reference, then why not have Link start off living in a ranching town out in the boonies. He could be studying with an old architect who decided he wanted to retire away from the busy city. Then he can be thrown in to the adventure in typical LoZ fashion and rationalize his way from there. I feel he needs to start in the same place he would in any other LoZ game.

The idea was that Link would bring an knowledgeable commentary to each and every vista while trying to save the world and ultimately break the cycle for good. But this required a huge amount of research, because I wasn't just trying to talk about architecture -- which can be very cool -- but /fantasy/ architecture, and I had to do so in a way to make it cool for people who don't care about medieval masonry at all. A tall order indeed.
