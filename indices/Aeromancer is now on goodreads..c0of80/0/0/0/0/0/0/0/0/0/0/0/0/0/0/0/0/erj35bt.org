Where I'm defining rational as the most efficient path towards a wholesome existence.

Edit 1: This is a lot of supposition and not particularly well written, but I just wanted to get the gist of my thought out there. Personally I've met a lot of happy religious people, and all the old Quakers I've met have come across as very intelligent and pretty rational, so I personally believe that there is definitely room for well adjusted religious people. I think that a lot of criticism of religion comes from the hypocrisy inherent to most devout religious people, but hypocrisy is part of life and pretty unavoidable. Part of intelligence and I suspect rationality is the ability to interact with hypocrisy, and being able to do that without 'throwing the baby out with the bathwater.'

Edit 2: and I'm placing religion in the same space in which I think you've placed writing rational fiction, it doesn't have to contribute to an otherwise rational life to be worth indulging in, IMO religion doesn't have to piss into the well of truth, it can be an enjoyable past time with quality of life benefits, social benefits, etc etc.

Edit 3: Case in point, both the theory of evolution and the big bang theory were attempts by religious men to reconcile scientific endeavor with their religious beliefs. I am under the impression that prior to the big bang theory scientists generally held the universe to be eternal in both space and time, and that Darwin was attempting to illustrate the mechanism by which God shaped life. I am not personally religious, but I do wonder about simulation theory, there is some reason behind it, and if scientists are going to indulge in the idea that the universe is a simulation then I feel it's in bad form to excoriate people for religious beliefs.

Neal Stephenson is a very flawed writer in my opinion, but there's a great passage about hypocrisy in "The Diamond Age" that I took to heart.
