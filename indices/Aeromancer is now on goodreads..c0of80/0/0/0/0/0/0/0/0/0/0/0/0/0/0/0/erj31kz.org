I agree with your basic points about religion, but when I try to model this person I come up with very different conclusions. He said that when he was at a religious camp he rediscovered his faith in Jesus, and as one does in that environment he decided to stop writing rational fantasy. I don't think that someone who doesn't hold a fervent religious belief ends up at a religious retreat by accident, I think that a lot of pressure is enacted on that person to get them there.

Maybe, if you tally up all the positives and negatives, a religious fervor is generally bad for an individual, though I think there is a lot of room for debate there. However, for someone who is probably submersed in a highly religious community, it would be incentivized to find faith and probably be the optimal path forward. I suspect that there would be a lot of rewards for compliance and faith, and a lot of negative incentives if one rejected the faith, rejected the community, rejected one's family, probably leading to ostracization and a host of other negative consequences.

So, for this author, I strongly suspect that embracing the faith was the rational move. All of the other potential paths I envision (stuff like rejecting his community and probably rejecting his family, moving out without support to pursue a 'more rational' lifestyle) would be really unlikely to turn out well, and probably wouldn't lead to as stable and healthy a lifestyle as staying with the faith.
