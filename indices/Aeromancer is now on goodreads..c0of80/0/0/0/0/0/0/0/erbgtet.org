...Yes? That's why if someone has the utility of "doing things that have maximum ethical impact" (which doesn't have to be the case, BTW) then attempting to maximize/optimize it by spending all of one's time on ethical activity is irrational, because one would get burned out and therefore do less ethical activity overall than they would have done if they had inserted periods of self-care.

I think you've confused utility maximization/optimization, with, I dunno, having an obsessive, single-minded focus on something. These two are obviously different things and the latter obviously harms the former in many cases.
