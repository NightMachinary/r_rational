I don't see why we would expect that. There are lots of sets of values such that writing fiction for this subreddit would be an excellent way to fulfill them; a writer might enjoy the writing process and then want to spread the product around in case other people enjoy reading it, or they might enjoy accumulating a fanbase and find this subreddit to be a good place to do so, or they might have some Ideological Point they want to make and find writing fiction-of-interest-to-this-subreddit to be a good way to do so (/cough/ HPMOR /cough/), or many other things. Am I missing something regarding why we wouldn't expect those reasons to apply to people who write things which end up posted here?
