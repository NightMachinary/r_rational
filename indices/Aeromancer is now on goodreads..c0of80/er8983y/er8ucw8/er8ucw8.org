By GR you mean goodreads?I don't know whether this is post-worthy, but goodreads is for some people (me included) the place of their to-read list, and also a way to (roughly) check what others think about a story before starting to read it.

E.g., if it gets a crazy average of 4.7 from 500 people, then maybe more people would be more inclined to give it a try..

Also, I now see someone has already marked it as "to-read"! (I believe they are probably going to enjoy it, so I count it as a good thing)
