  Well, my statement was farcica

Yeah, that did not come across :P

  I was offended by the implication that finding Jesus and deciding to discontinue his fiction was irrational (in part due to perspective you two have just explored), and reflexively attacked the values of the guy before me.

I would stand behind that guy's statement that someone who might consider themselves a rationalist finding Jesus is ironic, because religion is, like, one of the basic first tests of rational epistemics (don't believe in things based on faith, don't believe in things just because they're what you were raised to believe, don't believe in things just because they make you feel good, don't ignore contrary evidence offered by competing truth-claims about reality, don't presume beliefs in the face of uncertainty... on and on and on).

But that said, someone who writes or reads rationalist fiction has no obligation or requirement to be rational or consider themselves a rationalist. Maybe they just like munchkinry or clever protagonists or consistent worldbuilding/magic systems. And in any case, writers should feel free to stop writing at any time if they feel their time would be better spent doing something else.
