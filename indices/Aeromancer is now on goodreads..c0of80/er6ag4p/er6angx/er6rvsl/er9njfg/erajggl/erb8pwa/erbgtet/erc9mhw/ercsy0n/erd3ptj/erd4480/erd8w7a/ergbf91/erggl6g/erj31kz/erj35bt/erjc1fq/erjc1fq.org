No I think it was well written, thanks for expanding on the perspective you took :) I do counseling for a lot of kids going through suicidal crisis, and often tell the non-religious ones to do whatever they need to survive, including pretending to be religious until they're able to safely be independent. So I get why the rational thing to do in certain circumstances is to embrace a religious lifestyle.

The main argument is that actually believing in that thing sufficiently to decide to stop doing something he (presumably) enjoyed is itself irrational. Not in the sense of valuing the happiness he got from writing less than the happiness he gets from Jesus + Family + Community etc, which I hope is the case (or else it's not even instrumentally rational) but rather that prioritization of Happiness > Truth as terminal values.

Insofar as anything like that is a "choice," it's definitely not one that fits epistemic rationality. Instrumental is up for argument, of course; if all someone wants in life is to be happy, that's their prerogative.
