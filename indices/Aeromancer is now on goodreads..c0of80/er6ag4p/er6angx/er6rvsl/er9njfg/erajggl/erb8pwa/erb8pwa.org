Nothing at all, but idea that someone rational must be someone who uses literally all their "free time" doing things that have the *maximum* ethical impact isn't just unrealistic but I think a harmful norm to propagate, insofar as it make people feel guilty for being human enough to want time for things like, say, writing/reading fiction. Self care is an important part of doing good.
