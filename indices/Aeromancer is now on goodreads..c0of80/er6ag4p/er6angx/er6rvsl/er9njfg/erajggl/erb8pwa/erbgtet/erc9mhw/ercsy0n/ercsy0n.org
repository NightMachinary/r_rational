Sure. You seem to believe that utility maximization is defined by doing things in as short a time period as possible.

To me, it's pretty clear that that doesn't maximize that goal unless someone has completely incurable terminal cancer or a bomb strapped to themselves or something. People with more time get better outcomes with rest, hence better maximization.
