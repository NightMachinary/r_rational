The comment thread beneath me is really unimaginative.

Guys, /root/ access.

Edit the main partition by deleting some empty(ish) space, and create three new partitioned volumes: [God Consciousness], [God Consciousness.bak] and [Horribly Wrong Recovery].

Transfer slowly your main consciousness processing from human.brain to an independentconsciousness.god container, then use a virtual god network [VGN] to connect to Consciousness.bak, using .bak as a proxy VM interface that only broadcasts information back and commands forward, and create a "terminate connection" shortcut function that you can use to disconnect from Consciousness.bak quickly, while causing a full dump and rebuild from your primary mind on God Consciousness. Access reality.universe only through Consciousness.bak.

Any time you fuck up and need to reset Reality.universe to a snapshot, do a dump to Horribly Wrong Recovery, rebuild .bak, and access Reality.universe from .bak, then rebuild from there.

It's like running a particularly sensitive *nix build. Just don't do anything in production on servers that might be affected by the "oh crap" backblast.
