Journal perhaps? Or a changelog; record what you're doing and have it sync up periodically with the copy. It itself would only be low capcity binary, so contaminants being released would be low. You could reasonably figure out what went wrong, or atleast what not to do reading it. Eventually, you'll hit an optimal path.
