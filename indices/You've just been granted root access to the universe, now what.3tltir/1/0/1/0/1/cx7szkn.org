Now that would be terrifying.

According to your memory, you've only just finished setting up a backup system to fix any screw-ups. According to the counter it provides you with, this is attempt 1,002,592.

Presumably in those million attempts you would have tried something simple like "don't do anything". For some reason you don't know, that didn't work (though you can't be certain you actually tried it).

Something is causing an event so severe that you deem it a failure state (or die) and it or negative events of similar magnitude have happened 1,002,591 times so far.

Can you reliably reverse engineer your own thought patterns for all those attempts to determine what you might have already tried? Can you come up with something that 1,002,591 versions of you---differing at t_0 only by the state of the counter---couldn't?

Maybe many of those versions of you /did/ find the solution, only they just couldn't bring themselves to do it. Maybe they reasoned that some other you will do it, once the counter gets too large for their excuses to fly. Maybe 1,002,592 is that threshold, and it all comes down to you. Are you ready to die for what is right, or are you going to put it off for just one more lifetime?
