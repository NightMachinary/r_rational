Your brain is not the only source of solutions.

Open wikipedia, use the counter as a seed for a random number generator to find a page. Read that and use it to devise a strategy. Even if it's something silly. If the number is larger than the number of entries in Wikipedia, Google the number. If the number is larger than the number of people in the world, pick a random person and ask them what to do. Combine these strategies.
