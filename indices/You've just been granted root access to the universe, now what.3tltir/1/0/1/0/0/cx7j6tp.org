I would write down a list of everything I wanted to try, in order. 1, 2, 3, etc.---/before/ looking at the counter for cycles.

Because what happens if my instinct for 2 is virtually the same as 10? Or 60 and 90? I could get stuck in a loop while trying to avoid a loop.

At least this way, I'd have some hope of seeing, oh, it's already on loop four. 1-3 must have some problems there.
