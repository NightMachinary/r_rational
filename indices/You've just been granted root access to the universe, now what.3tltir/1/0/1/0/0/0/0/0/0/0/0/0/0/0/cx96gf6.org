The "backup of last resort" is meant as a failsafe against exactly that sort of thing. If at some point you think to yourself "hey, let's just give the Wheel of Physics a spin and see what happens" you at least get another chance after everything goes blooie (assuming you didn't make another backup right before trying something stupid like that).

I suspect the problem is English itself. It was never designed with these sorts of circumstances in mind, so there are assumptions and omissions in the language that interfere with discussing them. I get the same sort of trouble when talking about things like time travel and brain copying.
