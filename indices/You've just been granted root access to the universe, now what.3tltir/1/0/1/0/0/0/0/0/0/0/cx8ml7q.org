Not so, IMO, for a number of reasons.

Firstly, you're assuming that #2 is the /only/ possible solution. I don't even know what it's a solution to, really, this "savegame" is meant to be some kind of ultimate failsafe in case something goes /really really/ wrong, so it's likely that whatever happens is something very unusual in its own right. I think it's more likely that doing almost /anything/ differently is likely to butterfly away whatever it is that eventually went so disastrously wrong. Maybe solutions #7-#108 will all work just fine too.

Secondly, once you get past the first couple of entries on the idea list you're going to start getting them jumbled anyway, so this is still something that could happen even if you wrote the ideas out. The first time you write them out you might write them in order 1, 2, 3, 4, and then the second time you write them you write them in order 1, 3, 2, 4, and thus #3 gets skipped anyway.

Thirdly, once I start seeing the counter getting up into the millions I'll have run out of concrete ideas anyway. At that point I'll just start randomly screwing around, which means old ideas that I may have inadvertantly skipped and assumed that I'd already tried will get tried again (along with all kinds of other dumb things that I haven't tried before because they're dumb).

And fourthly, what if sitting down and writing that list /is/ what's going wrong? Like, there's something you think of while wracking your brains for ideas that causes you to do something with terrible unforseen consequences. If you're absolutely committed to writing down that list first thing then that's a good way to actually get one of those loops (at least, until the size of the number startles you so badly that you finally decide not to do it this time around).

I think you're just not accounting for the fact that I've got /infinite tries/ at this. So eventually I'm going to try everything that it's possible to try, whether I've got a rigorous system for it or not. The fact that there's a different integer sitting in front of me on every try ensures that there will be /some/ difference between each run, which is all that's needed where infinity is concerned.
