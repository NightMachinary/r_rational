Ah, I see. Well, I'd be trying hard /not/ to make mistakes like that, so hopefully that won't happen often. And hopefully root access will let me correct most of them without a full reset, too.

And if all else fails, people wouldn't know they're /my/ mistakes. I have no interest in worship or anything silly like that, so I probably won't let many people know about my effective godhood. Maybe just a few friends and family members. It'll be good to have them as advisers, psychological benefits aside.
