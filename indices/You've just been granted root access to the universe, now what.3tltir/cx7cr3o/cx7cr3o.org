I calculate and execute my CEV. First approximation: Everyone gets the option to emigrate at will to their own realm of omnipotence, the material plane is unaffected except for the initial announcement and people disappearing. Whether two realms can communicate is managed on a friends/ignore list basis, depending on the outcome of the race between AI-Box offense and defense. Emigrants can agree to binding contracts.
