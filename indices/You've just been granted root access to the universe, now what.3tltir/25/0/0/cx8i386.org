You can't have the afterlife do it for everyone because then you will get the fundamentalists continually making and raising other fundamentalists. It would also likely lead to strange reactions from Buddhists and is much harder to reason about. If you create any infinitely dividing world system then it will result in the most stable patterns repeating themselves endlessly and those patterns are unlikely to be what I consider optimal.

Furthermore any approach they use is something I could devise through other means either by creating a fallout vault style bubble universe or just asking people their opinion. Eventually I would contract people in the afterlife to help me design magical bubble universes and videogame worlds for people in the afterlife to play / be reincarnated in.
