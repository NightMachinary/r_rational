/Feedback/

Create feedback programs that display automatically updating statistics, metrics and population maps for whatever I tell it to whether it is number of burgers eaten in the last week to the number of depressed people in each country.

/Afterlife/

I'm thinking of something like a VR version of Second Life with a Infinite expanse of procedural generated terrain similar to mine-craft and giving individuals a limited amount of reality warping power that recharges over time.

Dealing with the souls of the mentally ill and brain-damaged would be tricky and morally complicated. Would probably want to learn more about neurology and psychology first.

Will create souls for the afterlife by scanning and interpreting mental states of the present and past.

/Covert Optimization/ Use my abilities to hack into criminal accounts and redistribute it towards charity. I gradually lower the rate of mosquito reproduction. Use powers to identify and investigate terrorists, human traffickers, child abusers, organized crime gangs and other criminals. Use anonymous tips, fabricated evidence, unfortunate accidents or mind control to deal with them. In particular kill the leaders of dictatorships and terrorist groups.

Covertly improve the skills and mental faculties of researchers and scientists, particularly in the medical and renewable energy fields, providing them with epiphanies, additional concentration and additional motivation.

/Alien Optimization/

Pretend to be a sufficiently advanced alien, show up in system with my ship, terraform Mars, leave a giant warp gate on it connecting to a massive network of portals allowing interstellar travel as well as a paranormal effect keeping Mars habitable. Do the same for Earth, dropping a device that will regulate the planet's atmosphere, water levels, soil quality, core temperature, fault lines, weather, sea waves and protect it from asteroid impacts making natural disasters a thing of the past. Also have a separate effect that prevents animals and humans from being conceived with known genetic defects like Down syndrome. Kill all the mosquitoes and eliminate biological weapons and other dangerous diseases like malaria and polio.

Maybe start giving people superpowers.

/Overt Optimization/ (This makes intelligent design extremely apparent)

Create and implement a magic system focusing on runes and geometric diagrams in particular allow magically binding contracts, honesty checking spells, rings of sustenance, linked transport circles, portkeys, rapid fabrication and so on, everything you need for a nation to go post scarcity. Publish it on the internet. Also create a spoken night light spell, naza taza lin gretal. The book will encourage you to say it first to see if you can do magic (everyone can), doing so will then create a brief light and convince people it's the real deal even though none of the other spells are spoken. Perhaps introduce it gradually by making only a small amount of people able to cast magic but have the number of people increase over time.
