- Give myself the standard godly superpowers -- invincibility, indestructibility, incorruptibility (of my mental states and consciousness), ability to stay existent, thinking, and rational even if the laws of physics forbid such a thing, etc.

- Develop a time travel protocol that enables me to visit any point in the past or future I wish and make any changes I wish but which undoes any change I make as soon as I leave that era, with the exception of copying anyone I take with me.

- Give myself the ability to understand and speak any language from any era and to appear as whoever or whatever I wish.

- Create a complete digital archive of the Library of Alexandria and upload it to every University net on Earth and also to the Pirate Bay under the username "Anonymous".

- Enjoy the reaction this causes.

- I hear that there were some schmart guys that died before I was born (Plato, Socrates, Abe Lincoln, etc. ) and some nifty events that happened before I was born (Rome, Fall of Rome, all the rest of human history, Dinosaurs, etc). It's time to go see and experience them all, and collect those people I like as cloned companions. This make take a while, but since I can access any time I wish there's hardly a need for haste in fixing the world's problems.

- Realize that becoming God has made me kind of a dick and promise myself to eventually fix things once I view all the important events of the past and various future timelines and met and asked the opinion of everyone worth meeting and asking.

- Check out alien life and if interesting do the same with its history as with human history.

- Several million subjective years and many carefully applied incremental intelligence enhancements later: Fix everything perfectly.
