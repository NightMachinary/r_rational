Incorrubtibility and invicibility run a high risk of turning you into a statue. I'd prefer respawning or regeneration to a preprogrammed backup state if you encounter catastrophic damage.

Simplest way to handle the time travel protocol would probably be the creation of a TARDIS like device much lower risk of screwing up the targeting and selection.
