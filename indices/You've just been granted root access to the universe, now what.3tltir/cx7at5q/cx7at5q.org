This answer has been clarified for me. I would contact effective altruist organizations first, and work from there. But now I want to read or write a story about someone who doesn't.

+I'd announce to the world that I am its supreme dictator of everything for life, and then ask for help in setting up good governance. I would set up a platform in the ocean, perhaps near Iceland as the sea floor is shallow there (thanks, Bioshock) in order to separate ties from my home country. I would set up a massive satellite as well, what evil overlord can go without?+

+I would try to directly erase guns from the earth, as well as all nuclear weapons. Chemical and biological weapons would also concern me. Malaria is gone. HIV is gone. I would research removing arterial plaque without dangerous effects.+

+Then I would start producing unbreakable negentropy devices to replace turbines in power plant generators. Energy becomes free, but it also becomes worthless. Same with materials. Same with transportation. Presuming I can break physics locally, instant production and transportation of food and water. The only thing left is shelter.+

+This is a near-instant transition to post-scarcity. Markets would collapse as everything became overvalued overnight. Stability would be a major concern. Logistics would be a major concern.+
