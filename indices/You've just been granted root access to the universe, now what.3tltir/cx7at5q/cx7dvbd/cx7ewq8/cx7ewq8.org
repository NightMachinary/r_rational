Maybe the world, but not the universe.

Dump waste heat off the ecliptic in EM and you'll be fine. Even if you eventually decide to fix the expansion of the universe (assuming you don't just make FTL, but stars /are/ pretty), you have a nice differentiated volume of stress-energy to destroy indiscriminately.
