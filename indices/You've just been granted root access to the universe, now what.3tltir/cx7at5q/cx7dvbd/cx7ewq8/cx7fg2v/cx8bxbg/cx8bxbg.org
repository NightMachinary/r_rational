  When creating a state where entropy is reversed

A physical state. The devices are superphysical artifacts induced on arbitrary loci and would act unitarily. This of course presumes I would be able to figure out how to produce that effect, but with this statement:

  Let's say you can have any interface you like and you have as much trust in it as you can get by it passing every test you throw at it. It doesn't do abstract requests like maximize happiness though. It re-orders matter you have as much as control as a programmer does over his program but with an easy ui. In other words, the interface itself isn't smart.
#+end_quote

by [[/u/Rationalfideism]] I would consider it trivial to implement (given a proper API, which can be constructed from lower levels if required). I would of course test and debug with sandbox universes. But in the end the only worry you have is dealing with the growing heat, which can be dealt with by similarly unitary energy sinks.
