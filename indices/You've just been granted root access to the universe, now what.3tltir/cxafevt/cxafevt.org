Immediately save the state of the simulation, extract myself onto the next layer, then pause the simulation (if that's all viable). Then spend some time figuring out what to do next.

If that's NOT viable, then... I suppose start reading manpages. If reconfiguring the universe is as trivial as writing some Bash, hooray! If it means patching the kernel, this might take a while.
