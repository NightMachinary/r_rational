I did not say that. I said it was /approval,/ meaning that there are people who want to encourage that sort of post. I disapprove that approval. I do not want to give you a voice, because your voice may convince others of the 'correctness' of your goals. This is a border where censorship is absolutely acceptable to me.

It is /not/ a /point!/ It is a fundamental denial of everything reasonable to my values, and to the values of anyone who wishes to remain intelligent or even to treat humans as representing their own interests! /You said yourself you would/ */give no choice to anyone,/* /converting humans into wireheads because/ */humans are an inefficient form of computing bliss!/* If you truly endorse this, we are enemies. I do not value your own satisfaction in this. I value your dissatisfaction. You are /damaged./ I may not qualify as Friendly, but you are /anti-Friendly./ *You are fundamentally horrifying to me.*
