I believe that processes that can be compressed to a register counting up are no different than the simpler process. Wireheading is literal destruction of the mind, it is suicide. Pleasure is an evolutionary hack, and if we are able to rewrite our brains to entirely remove a valence-maximizing hotspot, which I believe we eventually will be, we should do that /as soon as humanly possible/ to prevent as many wireheads as possible. Otherwise there will be a collective of nothing but registers counting upwards. Remove Wirehead. REMOVE WIREHEAD.
