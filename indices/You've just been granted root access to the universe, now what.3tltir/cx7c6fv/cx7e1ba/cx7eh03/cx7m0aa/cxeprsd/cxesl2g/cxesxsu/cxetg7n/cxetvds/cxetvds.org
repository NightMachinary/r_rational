By small I merely meant that it exists.

My point only works if there is any value for empathy. The greater your empathy the more you should rewrite the universe.

The idea of having a simulation shows a fundamental misunderstanding of human happiness and human well being and even utility in general. Everything is determined by brain chemicals, you never need to simulate anything if you knew the exact pattern of chemicals a simulation will release.

As the human brain has not that many positive channels you can just max them all out and that is the same as a simulation of the best possible life (which would be a bliss coma).

All utility functions of physical beings are reduced to chemicals. Unless you're a dualist which I doubt you will agree.
