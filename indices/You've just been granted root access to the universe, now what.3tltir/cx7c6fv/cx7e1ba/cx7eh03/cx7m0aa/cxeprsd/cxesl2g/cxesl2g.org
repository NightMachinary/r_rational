Well that's the bit where I say that you could maximise to something less horrifying.

Then you say that 'horrifying' isn't a very good reason to decide something whereupon I say that maximising to such a state shows an incomplete understanding of happiness theory and the human utility function.

Then you say that no-one has a complete understanding of the human utility function and I say that we can at the very least tell that orgasmium is not the optimal state of being because it only optimises upon one axis while ignoring all other relevant measures of what is important leading to a lower combined score than other possible world-states.
