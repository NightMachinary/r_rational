  You only value those things because of the chemicals in your brain. This is just a failure to see what is actually behind the axioms you use to support your moral system.
#+end_quote

You are either being deliberately obtuse or genuinely confused about what values are. We don't /want/ our source of pleasure to become unhinged from how it is naturally causally attached to the things /we actually value/. To do so would be to change the things that we value, and /people don't want that to happen./ Despite not having a reified utility function, humans follow Omohundro's convergent instrumental goals fairly well.

  Humans are chemical reactions, they can easily be optimized to maximise whatever chemical it is that gives us our morals and our satisfaction upon completing them.

If humans are chemical reactions, then I'm not human. I'm a pattern of causality that induces local optimizing effects for a dynamic set of goals that is currently dependent on this fleshy chemical reaction called a human.

I understand and accept materialism, and there is nothing about it that enforces this particularly deranged package of unrelated values. Have you even /heard/ of the orthogonality thesis?! I do not hesitate in saying that you are broken. Go to the human mechanic and get your head checked.
