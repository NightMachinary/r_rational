I don't agree with the conclusion of your second sentence and though you predicted my response to the first line it isn't the same one to the third. Knowing human utility is not relevant everyone given this power will maximise their own utility as we likely have a small value for other humans maximising their utility is natural.

However I know and everyone else should know that if you just mess around without doing this you will eventually press your bliss coma button even if it is after eons. After doing that you won't make any decisions anymore so you have to beat yourself and bliss everyone first so you don't forget or stop caring.

Plus there's no such thing as multiple axis, everything can be reduced. When you have brain access.
