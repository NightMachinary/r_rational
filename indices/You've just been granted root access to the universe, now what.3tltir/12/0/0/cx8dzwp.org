  It re-orders matter you have as much as control as a programmer does over his program but with an easy ui. In other words, the interface itself isn't smart.

OK, this makes it more like "root on a production server" and less like "you're god, have fun". This is "if you're not really frigging careful, you're going to destroy the universe in five minutes or less".

I would start out by re-reading [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Infinity_Concerto][/The Infinity Concerto/ and /The Serpent Mage/]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Cook][/Wizard's Bane/]]. Just to burn into my mind how easy it is to fuck up when you have control over the code.

The first active thing would be to find or develop a place where I can build empty spaces to test out ideas. Throw-away universes /with nobody in them/, with a framework that makes tests safe. Tilt switches and the equivalent of a negative pressure chamber in a lab levitated over an acid bath on an asteroid orbiting a completely different star. I'm not inside the universe, I have at most a meat puppet there, and a graduated dead-man switch that can do everything from cutting me free of the puppet to rolling me back to a sane state as each step fails.

All in a timeline running orthogonally to this universe's.

THEN I start working on solving problems. It may take the rest of my life several times over until I'm ready to make myself immortal and invulnerable, but that's what the dead man switch is for. There's going to be lots of unhappy versions of me, but they all made the choice to get in the tank. Nobody's mind-state gets lost who didn't decide to risk it.

Edit: If this universe was created by someone who wasn't literally insane, this framework already exists.
