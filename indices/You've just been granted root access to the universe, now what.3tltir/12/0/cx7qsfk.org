Let's say you can have any interface you like and you have as much trust in it as you can get by it passing every test you throw at it. It doesn't do abstract requests like maximize happiness though. It re-orders matter you have as much as control as a programmer does over his program but with an easy ui. In other words, the interface itself isn't smart.
