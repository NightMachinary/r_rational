  Calling humans chemical reactions does not necessarily mean that this particular series of reactions you are arguing for would be best compared to the chemical reactions for (for example) a person living the most fulfilling life that it is possible for them to live or one of many other options.

But the definition of the word fulfilling is based of off that chemical make up, so the most fulfilling life is achieved by direct manipulation of the brain in every single case.
