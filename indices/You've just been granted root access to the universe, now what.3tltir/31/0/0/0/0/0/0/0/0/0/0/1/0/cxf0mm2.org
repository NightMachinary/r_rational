  It's just a brain in a jar feeling good about itself. Say you have a car with a speed dial. To me, wireheading is removing everything but the dashboard and then turning the speed dial as high as it can go. Sure, according to the dial things are great but it largely misses the point of what cars are for.

Right but if the car derives how it determines what it is for from the dial then it isn't missing its purpose.

  Similarly, chunks of orgasmium might feel good but they're not actually achieving anything. No art or science or creativity is happening, no-one is exploring the stars or partying or falling in love and so on.

You only value those things because of the chemicals in your brain. This is just a failure to see what is actually behind the axioms you use to support your moral system.

  while forgetting that the scale itself is just an approximation we made because we didn't fully understand the proper underlying concepts and therefore any attempt to optimise things using that scale can only go so far.

Except that's not true. Humans are chemical reactions, they can easily be optimized to maximise whatever chemical it is that gives us our morals and our satisfaction upon completing them. There is a solution to sapience.
