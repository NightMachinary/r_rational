Allright, wanted to make sure I had that clear.

To my way of thinking wireheading misses large parts of what is important. It's just a brain in a jar feeling good about itself. Say you have a car with a speed dial. To me, wireheading is removing everything but the dashboard and then turning the speed dial as high as it can go. Sure, according to the dial things are great but it largely misses the point of what cars are for.

Similarly, chunks of orgasmium might feel good but they're not actually achieving anything. No art or science or creativity is happening, no-one is exploring the stars or partying or falling in love and so on.

To me wireheading is just taking all of humanity and measuring it on a simplified scale, then setting out to optimise that scale while forgetting that the scale itself is just an approximation we made because we didn't fully understand the proper underlying concepts and therefore any attempt to optimise things using that scale can only go so far.

I am confident that given a few hundred years humanity will create new schools of thought then theorise and possibly implement states far superior to wireheading. To wirehead everyone immediately misses out on those future states, locking the universe into a dead end inferior to what is capable of.
