I think the universe on wireheading is the optimal value, that doesn't mean individuals should wirehead, it means if you can choose the universe the best one in terms of morality is the one where everyone literally cannot be happier any other universe.

And, I believe that all instances of power over the brain lead to wireheading over a long enough scale because if you have power over the brain after you have spent a billion years doing stuff at some point you might touch your pleasure centre and then boom, there is nothing that can make you do anything else.
