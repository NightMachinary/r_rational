It might be natural to have a small value for maximising the utility of other humans, but that doesn't make it optimal or universal, or else there would be less grand gestures to help others. For example, when the creator of the polio vaccine chose to make it cheap instead of charging money, leading to what is essentially the eradication of polio in the modern day. I like to think that this idea of trying to care more than one's emotions and such normally allows is fairly common among rationalists and people in this sub.

I dispute that a bliss coma is inevitable so long as safeguards, save points and such can be properly implemented. I also dispute that the bliss coma is the best possible state. Unless when you say bliss coma you actually mean a simulation of the most fulfilling possible life for that being, which is a different thing and rather obviously better than just feeling happy the whole time.
