Create a room with a copy of me, including these priviledges, and set it to instantly simulate a month of time passing in that room.

Finding myself in the room, look through the from my perspective frozen world, and copy various people who I trust or with have specific relevant cognitive skills or knowledge.

Spend a bunch of subjective days just brainstorming and debating how to go about things with people way smarter than me withote using the powers for anything other than materializing food, comforts, and more relevant people from reality.

Create another simulation with some complex organization of privileges and instantiating copies of minds and very hevily regulated self improvement (because value is fragile) and run this for some huge number of subjective years.

Resulting plan of action is automatically followed.
