Backup everything. Ensure that if I accidentally do something to myself in the next steps, the universe reverts to backup.

Then, fix my current influenza.

After that, start looking through stuff to figure out how things actually work. Make a memo of possible changes I might want to make, starting small to get used to my new abilities. Think on every change for some length of time that I will specify beforehand, to ensure I'm not making any obvious mistakes. Use reasonably accurate simulations to help predict the effects. Commit one change at a time using backups.
