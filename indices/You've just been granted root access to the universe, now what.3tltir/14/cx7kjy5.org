Are you granting me omnipotence, or are you just handing me a program that uses more advanced math than I understand, some arbitrary-seeming variables that will kill me if changed even slightly, and expecting me to do something useful with it?

#+begin_quote
  To everyone suggesting setting up a system of backups, resets or simulations to test out ideas, aren't you effectively creating, causing suffering for and killing people each time you do it?
#+end_quote

Most of the simulations can be done without people. And when I do cause suffering, it's a necessary evil. Do you have any idea how much suffering goes on each second I spend trying to figure out how this works?
