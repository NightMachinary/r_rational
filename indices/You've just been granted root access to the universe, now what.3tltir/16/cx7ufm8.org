  Edit2/ Really everyone? The minute you're handed near definitive proof that our reality is a simulation you want to create alternate throw away realities to experiment on without consideration for the people you're creating?

I don't see anything wrong with creating alternate throw away realities provided you don't leave them running too long. In one sense you are creating and killing temporary copies of people. In another sense you are simply wiping peoples memories and moving everything back the way it was before.

It is the same thing as the issue of whether transporters kill and copy a person or not and I would answer it the same way. It's the information and process that is important, not the exact arrangement of atoms. If you copy and kill a person in a single moment then it's morally neutral because no information was lost.
