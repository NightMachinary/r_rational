This is a fun one. Luckily, I already have it planned out.

0- become Immortal and Indestructible

1- make certain there are no rules. If there are, modify the following steps accordingly.

2- set it up that should I cease to exist, the universe retroactively reverts to this state, plus a viewable record of the destroyed universe(s). Ensure that the rest of the universe is halted while this happens, so one thing doesn't keep destroying me.

3- set up multiple places that should my current avatar be destroyed, I will spawn at a new spot. No need to reset if I don't have to

4- Have a version of my past self, at the time right before I interacted with the universe, get complete control at a higher level than mine, but only at such a point as he genuinely believes that I have been compromised. I don't want hypnosis to ruin me, not when I have this much.

5- Improve my avatar. I mean, standard invincibility is nice, but also time looping (grey boy), regeneration, immortal object tags, etc. I don't want anything to happen to me.

6- Make certain there are no other beings with similar or greater powers. If possible, make it so that they are not/will not become a threat.

7- Make sure that there are no other items/people with enhanced privileges within the system. See step 6

8- ensure there are no catastrophes currently ongoing

9- See if you can detect any higher universes above yours. The powers suggest your universe is magical rather than natural, and probability says it is probably a simulation.

10- attempt to talk your way out of the box. Don't spend too long if you don't get a response- there is a chance you aren't in one, or that you won't get let out.

11- determine how powers work. Make sure what you are doing is what you intend to

12- Grab the standard superpowers, plus PtV, time stop, wish powers, etc. Anything you think you will need, or think might be useful, or think have theoretical value, etc. Prioritize information.

13- Create simulations of yourself, as many as possible, for all branches you still consider you. This is determined beforehand- it's so that any given you is likely god of a simulation. send down the message- don't let them think they are in a hostile box, so they don't have to waste time attempting to escape

14- create an afterlife. make it as pleasant as can be reasonably be possible. make one for all other sentient, as well. 15- Improve life on earth/civilized worlds

16- think for a long time on other safeguards for your immortality. Follow the proper pattern (ie don't propose solutions for at least 5 mins, etc)

17- ???

18- profit
