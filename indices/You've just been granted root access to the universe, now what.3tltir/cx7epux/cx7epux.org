I would screw it up just trying to write a find/replace routine for horrible diseases, or inventing some kinda mass-producible miracles, and wind up [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVp3GyMGiEc][turning babies into gold, or screwing with the weather]].

So... I'd try to see if the universe comes with documentation. Then hire someone smarter and patienter than me to try and translate it into something I can comprehend, although I'd need to find some way to guarantee they aren't going to betray me (after all, I am now an existential threat, but also a source of great power and temptation).

Also, publish the universe's documentation on Github, after carefully searching for obviously dangerous exploits that mightn't be best made public.

(If the universe is undocumented, then I guess I have job security for the years before I'm knowledgeable enough to rewrite reality on a whim. First priority is figuring out how to defend myself so that I can do research with experts in the relevant fields, rather than get spirited away by some shady military organization.)
