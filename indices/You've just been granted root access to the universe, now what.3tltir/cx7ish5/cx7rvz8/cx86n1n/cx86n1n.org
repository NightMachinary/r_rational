I want all of them back. Hitler killed millions. This makes a loss of dozens of millions of life years. Even if we could only resurrect Hitler and nobody else, the payment for taking multimillion years of life should be multimillion years of community service, not eternal oblivion. Man, talk about the easy way out. But, since we can also resurrect each of his victims, killing someone has just lost nearly all of its moral weight. Now he faces only the economic cost of resurrecting his victims, which if we're omnipotent is zero, and the moral cost of teleporting people into the future against their consent. And because we're omnipotent, we can move every atom in the universe such that the universe is shaped like one where those people never died, effectively time traveling backwards to put everyone where they go. We'll also award him a medal of some kind. He did, after all, kill Hitler.
