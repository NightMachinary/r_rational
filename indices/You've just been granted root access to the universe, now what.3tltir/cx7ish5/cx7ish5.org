Depends, how easy is the interface to use? Does having root access to the universe mean that the information appears in my mind at will? Like, can I run queries with my mind or something? And if the size of the query is not limited by the size of my mind, how much time do I have to even read/think about all the data, or does it come at me all at once and my brain somehow miraculously doesn't explode?

If the interface is easy to use, then I would learn as much as I can and find a way to safely prove to a trustworthy team of researchers with relevant expertise what I am capable of. (My best guess for a good way to do this is to make a prediction about something that I cannot possibly have any way of knowing about, by running a query and then telling them what I find out. And I would do this as many times as it takes to convince them.)

Then with their expertise I would do whatever I needed to do to save all sapient lives that ever existed forever without destroying the universe or infringing on anyone's human rights. I guess maybe I would use my powers to help ensure that Super-AI is friendly, and create backup copies of everyone who ever died and bring them back to life. Although I'm not entirely sure that the AI thing is the best way to go about it, but I would prefer to be as non-interventionist as possible to avoid screwing everyone over. But I suppose that if having root access to the universe doesn't come with superintelligence, a super AI could outsmart me and manipulate me into using my powers as it wants me to. I suppose if it really came down to it I could just go f*** myself (read as FOOM myself) and hope my increased intelligence means that I won't screw everyone over, although that would be more of a last resort since I don't want to FOOM myself...

If the interface is too difficult, I might just ignore the power because whoever gave it to me is probably just trying to mess with me anyways and almost certainly doesn't care whether the universe continues existing if it chose me to have root access.
