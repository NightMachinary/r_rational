You may be underestimating how easy it would be to fuck up that hard. All you need to do is mess with basically anything to do with any of the forces and you've probably doomed most beings that exist, or at least really screwed their ecosystem.

Consider the alternative, where you fuck up and doom innumerable species leading to trillions of dead worlds for hundreds of millions of years until life makes sense of the new physics enough to evolve sentience again.
