If something goes Horribly Wrongâ„¢ and you're incapacitated beyond being able to reverse your changes, and then the cron job restores the universe to exactly the state recorded, what prevents the fresh instance of you from proceeding with exactly the same plan and making exactly the same mistake again?

You need some kind of persistent information; an ability to signal to yourself that the emergency backup plan has been activated (ideally with an accompanying description of what you were planning so you know what not to do again). Otherwise you're headed for an eternal universe-wide loop... and not even a "Groundhog Day" loop if you're restored identically from backup; just an exactly repeating loop.

In fact there's a sense where "restoring from backup" then having the universe go through the same steps "again" isn't actually a separate thing from the first time through; it's exactly the same set of states with no distinguishing variable out of place, calling them /different/ is aphysical nonsense. So, arguably, that cron job ends the universe instead of saving it.
