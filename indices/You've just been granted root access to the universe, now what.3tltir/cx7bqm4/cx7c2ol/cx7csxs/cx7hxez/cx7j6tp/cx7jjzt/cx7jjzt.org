I think it's an unlikely risk, since the checklist will effectively already be present in your mind anyway. It's not a problem if your instincts for responding to loops 60 and 90 are basically the same as long as by the time you hit loop 1000 that causes you to try something a little different. Loops are "free", after all. There's absolutely no cost to repeating the same loop a million times as long as you break out of it on loop 1000001.
