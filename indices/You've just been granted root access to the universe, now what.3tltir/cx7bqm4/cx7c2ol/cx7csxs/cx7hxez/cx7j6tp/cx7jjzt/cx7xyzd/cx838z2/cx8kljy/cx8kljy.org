I was thinking about this situation:

You have ideas number 1,2,3,4... 2 and 3 look very similar.

First one didn't work, backup loaded. You see [1 reload], decide not to try that obvious idea and do №2, but since you have no actual list, you accidentally do №3. It also failed. Then you do №3 again. Then 4,5... and they all failed. Infinite loop. And №2 was the correct one.

If you decide to go with instincts, there are a lot of space for mistakes. Cost for responding to loops from 60 to 90 the same way is that you lost 30 strategies. After 1000 you will not think that solution can be simple. Every number after billion is just "very big number" for your instincts, you will not generate single new strategy after that. So, if you are not at least 10 times smarter than me, you will have less than 50 tries before infinite loop.
