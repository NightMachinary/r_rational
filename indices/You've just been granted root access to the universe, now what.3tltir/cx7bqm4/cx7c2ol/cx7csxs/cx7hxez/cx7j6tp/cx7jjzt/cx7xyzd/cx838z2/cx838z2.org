That doesn't make the mind any less finite, though. Unless your first act after backing up is to somehow make your mind "infinite" no amount of additional comments are going to change that.

Some things just can't be planned around. If you have tried /literally every possible outcome/, there's no way to magic up additional possibilities. If you're not satisfied with the universe after trying every possible thing that can be done with it then you're just not satisfiable.

Heck, given an infinite amount of loops, that "integer" will eventually grow to become a representation of every possible blob of unicode text anyway. Also images, movies, 3D models, and every possible video game. It will become every possible integer at some point and any binary data file can be represented as an integer.
