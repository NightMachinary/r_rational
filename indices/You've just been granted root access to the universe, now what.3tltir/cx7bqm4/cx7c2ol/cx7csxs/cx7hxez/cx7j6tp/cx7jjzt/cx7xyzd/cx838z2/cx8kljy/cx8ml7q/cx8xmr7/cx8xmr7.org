1)It looks like you think that we write list after we see counter. So probably you missed what the point of list is.

#+begin_quote
  (at least, until the size of the number startles you so badly that you finally decide not to do it this time around)

  I would write down a list of everything I wanted to try, in order. 1, 2, 3, etc.---/before/ looking at the counter for cycles
#+end_quote

2) I wrote about №2 as the only correct solution just for example. Without list you can miss a lot of solutions, not only №2.

3) I assumed that we live in the deterministic universe, at least on macro level. Are you sure some non-deterministic quantum effects I don't know of can get us out of the loop?

4) If our universe is deterministic, then you can't write the list differently before you see the counter - the only different piece of information.

5) If our universe is deterministic, then you can't "just start randomly screwing around" - you will generate the same "random" solution over and over and over.

6) If writing that list is what's going wrong and we don't have additional failsafes, we are doomed. But you can tell this about any plan. Obviously, we must make additional failsafes.

7)I am accounting for infinite tries. Again, our brains are finite, so after some huge number all numbers will be the same for your instincts. If you see number 1087520371, you will go with That One Desperate Strategy Of Last Resort, and if you see Graham's number, you will do the same.

If you have same good idea pseudo-randomizer(not intuition), that use counter as seed, that would work.
