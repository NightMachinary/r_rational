It'd be interesting to see Mercy in face of the flowering of those to whom mercy was rendered. Namely, Pilgrim was able to lay aside vengeance because of the consequences and suffering enacting that vengeance would bring. And I don't necessarily think he'd relapse on sight, but I'm curious how seeing either the retired prince, doing well by himself and heaven's light in the house of light, or the daughter heir, either serving admirably or reprising her father's mistakes, would make him feel, and more importantly how he thinks it ought to make him feel.
