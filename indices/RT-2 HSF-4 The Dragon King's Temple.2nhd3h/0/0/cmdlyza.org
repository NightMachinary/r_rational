Level of such and such from 1 to 10. Using it for a comparison with other works. Like hpmor would be RT-8 and MK-7, or even in absolute terms of a given concept, in which case it would be RT-1 for story mode, and RT-10 would be a whole world built on consequences of a given premise. In this case it's the first version. But so far I have read 5 chapters out of 12, and the science parts weren't interesting for me to double check.
