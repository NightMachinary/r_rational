Just thinking about parallels - if Scribe is Ratface (which fits!), then Aisha might be the Empress equivalent?

It appears that the "groups" would work in odd numbers, i.e. 3 | 5 | 7 and the history mirrors the present.

For example, in Appellant, there was a core group of three calamities attacking the heroes: Black, Warlock, Captain. There was a hidden fourth (not part of the main action): Assassin.

In Chapter 7 (Elaboration), there was a core group of three: Cat, Apprentice, Adjutant. The hidden fourth was Archer.

For the calamities in general, it seems to have a core of 7 Named:

1. Empress (behind the scenes)
2. Black
3. Warlock
4. Captain
5. Assassin (?)
6. Ranger (retired)
7. Scribe (affiliated)

For the mirroring effect, I guess Cat would end up with 7 Named too.
