Hmm, I feel like Cat is forming her own Calamities.

Black | Cat

Warlock | Apprentice

Captain | Adjutant

Assassin | Iunno, Robber maybe? He seems to be enough of a legend amongst Goblins to get a name.

Ranger | Here I have no clue. Maybe Archer takes a liking to her?

Edit: Hell, she even has her own Grem One-Eye in the form of Juniper.
