  However, Harry is a pretty frikkin massive Marty Stu, and a bit of a bore to read about. He is smarter, stronger, nicer, cooler, and morally better than everyone, has no weaknesses (he isnt even actually blind!) and gets the girl by default. He also has this weird monk aesthetic going on, being "above" petty childish things like pranks or lust. And most of these abilities are informed; when he makes magical discoveries, its not like the story had some problem it presented to us, and the reader thought "man, how would i fix this", then harry pulls from existing knowledge and shows his genius. instead he simply "discovers" solutions to problems we didn't know existed.

Yup. What broke it for me was the Ministry being interested in Harry's Transfigurations. HPMoR has Harry do stuff that they'd be interested in too, like partial Transfiguration, but they're quite rare and rather important/unique. Plus, the story goes into how difficult it was to create them, like going evil after facing a Dementor and having to rewrite his mind manually to do partial Transfiguration. Blind!Harry here just sort of glosses over them, which makes it perplexing when we're told they're apparently so important when it didn't cost him anything we saw.

It makes him look, well, overpowered, along with other Sue warning signs - having more powerful equipment that no-one else does despite it being available in Diagon Alley (see many, MANY fics in which he gets a trunk, HPMor included, that is as powerful as Moody's despite him being the only one to have one in canon and having a powerful artefact for an eye, suggesting the trunk is rare too), having a "disability" that is quickly or immediately nullified by a magic sense that is even better (see Princess of the Blacks for an example done well), and Harry being neglected in favour of a different, wrong Chosen One.
