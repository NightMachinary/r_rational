Without having read it (and only in response to your second point), it's not neccessarily unreasonable that two muggle-born children could figure out so much more about magic than all of the wizardign community.

Humanity as a whole progressed extremely slowly up until the discovery of the scientific method, which allowed for huge advances at a much more rapid pace. The wizarding world has been cut off from the muggle world since way before that time. I think it isn't crazy to posit that the wizarding world has been making it's same plodding progress the way humanity did pre-science and that a couple of muggle born kids who aren't embeded in that culture starting at 11 and who therefore might get exposed to the scientific method could make some pretty basic discoveries pretty quickly.

It doesn't require them to be geniuses of the entire wizarding world to be idiots. They are just the first ones to be using a new, vastly more powerful analytical tool.
