I don't think it's too unlikely that Dumbledore wouldn't be too interested in Harry under the right circumstances. If you just swapped his treatments of Neville and Harry from canon with each other that would be entirely reasonable as a matter of prophecy interpretation. Dumbledore is support of Neville but to him Neville is just another student.

Probably this could have been portrayed better in this fic with Dumbledore offering Harry a place at Hogwarts anyways and giving him a magical eye (like what Mad-Eye has) so that he can see and learn, and Harry not being willing to gouge out his eye, potentially losing his mana sight, for a chance to see? There are a lot of ways you could go with it.

It's worth noting some of the plot elements (Dumbledore being a dick, Harry getting equipment not used in canon like the staff, or unique discoveries magical discoveries that aren't game changers but make Harry stronger) are pretty much standard HP Fanfic fare.
