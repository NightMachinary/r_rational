Man the beginning was good. Everything went too well and the characters were a bit boring, but still a fun read.

Now I want to see a fic with the opposite setup, where Harry is just regular blind and has a hard life, but gets to go to Hogwarts and is still targeted by Voldemort. Harry is way less good at fighting but is the moral / strategic voice and plot McGuffin, Hermoine gets to be awesome, and Ron +can jump in a lake+ gets +replaced by Neville+ interpreted as a more awkward, sympathetic character.
