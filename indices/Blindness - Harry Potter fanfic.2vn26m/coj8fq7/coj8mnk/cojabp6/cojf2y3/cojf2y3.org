Actually, Harry/Luna is often referred to as Huna or sometimes Lunarry, again using the same naming scheme that gave us such delightful portmanteaus as Brangelina and Tomkat. Threeway Harry/Hermione/Luna relationships are also quite popular, and are often referred to as "Lunar Harmony".

There's [[http://fanlore.org/wiki/List_of_Harry_Potter_Pairing_Names][a good organized list here]], and [[http://forums.fictionalley.org/park/showthread.php?s=&threadid=4591][a massive list of rather amusing although less-than-serious possibilities here]].

My personal favorite when it comes to shipping names (as opposed to favorite ship, which is an entirely different kettle of fish) is Honks = Harry/Tonks. :-P
