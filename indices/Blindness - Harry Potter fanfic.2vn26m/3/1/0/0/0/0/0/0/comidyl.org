  */Dracorex/* is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur][dinosaur]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus][genus]] of the family [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachycephalosaurid][Pachycephalosauridae]], from the Late [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous][Cretaceous]] of North America.

  The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species][type]] (and only known) [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species][species]] is /Dracorex hogwartsia/, meaning "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon][dragon]] king of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogwarts][Hogwarts]]". It is known from one nearly complete skull (the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holotype][holotype]] TCMI 2004.17.1), as well as four cervical vertebrae: the atlas, third, eighth and ninth. These were discovered in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell_Creek_Formation][Hell Creek Formation]] in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota][South Dakota]] by three amateur paleontologists from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux_City,_Iowa][Sioux City]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa][Iowa]]. The skull was subsequently donated to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Museum_of_Indianapolis][Children's Museum of Indianapolis]] for study in 2004, and was formally described by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Bakker][Bob Bakker]] and Robert Sullivan in 2006. However, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_R._Horner][Jack Horner]] /et al./ suspect that it is a juvenile /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachycephalosaurus][Pachycephalosaurus]]/ and an analysis of pachycephalosaur fossils by a joint team from the University of California, Berkeley and the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_the_Rockies][Museum of the Rockies]] has questioned the validity of two named genera of pachycephalosaur, /Dracorex/ and /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stygimoloch][Stygimoloch]]/. According to the team, specimens of /Dracorex/ and /Stygimoloch/ might actually represent earlier growth stages of /Pachycephalosaurus/. As this article on the UC Berkeley website says, "The confusion is traced to their bizarre head ornaments, ranging from shields and domes to horns and spikes, which changed dramatically with age and sexual maturity, making the heads of youngsters look very different from those of adults."
