The story has some great potential, with innovative ideas with the magic sight and the way it helps unravel magic. The "if neville had been harry" plot outcomes also make a great parallel timeline, with lots of fun responses (like voldemort's) to the new situations. The "supporting cast" as it were, is very strong.

However, Harry is a pretty frikkin massive Marty Stu, and a bit of a bore to read about. He is smarter, stronger, nicer, cooler, and morally better than everyone, has no weaknesses (he isnt even actually blind!) and gets the girl by default. He also has this weird monk aesthetic going on, being "above" petty childish things like pranks or lust. And most of these abilities are informed; when he makes magical discoveries, its not like the story had some problem it presented to us, and the reader thought "man, how would i fix this", then harry pulls from existing knowledge and shows his genius. instead he simply "discovers" solutions to problems we didnt know existed.

it is also being held back a bit by the "omniscient 3rd person narrator" style; dialogue is infrequent, scenes tend to be sketched out from afar instead of lived, emotional developments often happen off screen, and we dont get to see people's thought process too much for the main cast. This improves as the story goes on, but is still a problem, and i think contributes to the blandness of the protagonist.

Overall a decent read and good premise, but some flawed execution and a very unlikable main character. Good effort on the author's part though! Great to see writers tackle an interesting premise.
