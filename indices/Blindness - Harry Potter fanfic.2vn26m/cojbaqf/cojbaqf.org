Just reading the first few chapters raises up a bunch of red flags.

First is the standard manipulative!Dumbledore cliche. Apparently Dumbledore doesn't really care at all about Harry's well being and only wants him because of the prophecy. But since he's blind he can't learn magic or something so Dumbledore abandons him? Dumb.

Second is that apparently the wizarding world is incompetent and doesn't even know how magic works. It's up to two muggle raised children without any real experience at all to discover how magic works. Even though wizards have been living and studying magic for thousands of years yet they're being outdone by a pair of schoolchildren.

Harry gets a staff.

The contrived relationship between Hermione and Harry.

Etc. This is mediocre at best.
