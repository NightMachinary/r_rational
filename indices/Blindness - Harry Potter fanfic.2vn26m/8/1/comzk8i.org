Petunia probably told him. In fact, here's a relevant quote from chapter 7:

  "Yes, of course."

Petunia might not know any specific details on the magical world, but she would be able to teach him the basics she'd picked up from Lily (and Snape) - such as, for example, the ubiquitous use of wands and common terms like "Muggle".
