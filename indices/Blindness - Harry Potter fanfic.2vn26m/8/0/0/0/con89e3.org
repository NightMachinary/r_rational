Upon further reading,I think he's created a mapping of some sort between real colors and aura "colors" (He asks if the goblet's fire is blue because it showed up as something he mentally labels as to "blue" in his mage sight, etc).

That kind of explains why he describes things in terms of precious gems and metals so often. I think he just asks people what colors various things are, and maps it to whatever aura-sense he is perceiving, and it turns out an imperfect relationship exists.
