I'm amazed I keep missing fics like this one, somehow, in spite of searching quite hard.

Sounds quite interesting. Will definitely check it out.

 

[Edit] I'm on the last chapter right now, and it was definitely worth a read. Quite enjoyable.

I particularly like the following quote (may be slightly spoilerific?):

#+begin_quote
  Harry paused, shook his head. "I'm not /breaking/ any rules. Magic isn't, either. It's taken me all summer to figure that out. There is reason and rationality and rules to all magic can do, just like there is with everything the muggles have figured out so far in nature. What we call magic is simply another force to consider mathematically, one whose limiting factors have not all been discovered. More complicated than most, of course, because I am almost positive that if there is some sort of math to it it is capable of changing based on the user and how it is used, or, better put, its environmental factors."
#+end_quote

Finally. /FINALLY/.

Other analytic HP fics I'd read were often.. less than stellar on this point. They called magic unexplainable and that was that, and some were even /smug/ about that, somehow.

I could hug the author.

Oh, and the author also has a 700k word HP story on her profile. If it's of similar quality, I think I'll enjoy myself a great deal.
