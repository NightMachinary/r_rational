It's mentioned in several places that he doesn't know what colors other people see, and any time he talks about colors, he's approximating or guessing based on information he's been given from others. There's probably a fair bit of free and/or random association going on. Harry might be assigning the names of colors he's perceiving with mage-sight based on what he (or his subconscious) associates those colors with, e.g. blood red is lethal Dark magic, brown earthy tones correspond to animal or nature magic, etc.

Or perhaps there's even a magical imperative involved, which may or may not be discussed further in later chapters - the story isn't over yet, after all.
