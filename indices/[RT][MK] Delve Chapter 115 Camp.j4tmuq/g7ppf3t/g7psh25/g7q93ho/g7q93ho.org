That's more of an issue on the author's part than the Patreon model.

The Wandering Inn? 1 advanced chapter for $5. You don't have to 'drop' the story for a month when you drop Patreon.

Delve? 8 advanced chapters for $2.50. If you drop the Patreon, you're out of the story for 2 months.

Both stories are doing /very/ well. But they have very different implementations of the same Patreon model. And frankly, with Delve's pacing, I would rarely pay for 1 advanced chapter, so the author has probably made a good decision here.
