  That puts me now in the unfortunate spot where I have to wait a month or two (had paid for September's advanced stuff too) before I can access new content in a story

This is why I think the "pay for advance chapters" concept is flawed. After the first blast of chapters you are no longer paying for a benefit (as chapters still come out at the same frequency) but are now merely doling out money to avoid suffering a detriment (have to wait a month without chapters).
