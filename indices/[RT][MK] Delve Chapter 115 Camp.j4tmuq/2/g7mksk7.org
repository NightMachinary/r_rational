Rain is clearly going to infect the entire company with the strange plague of Numbers. At least if things turn out how he wants, anyway. They're also clearly not ready for it, except maybe for Staavo. But at this rate they're going to have to learn just to figure out their compensation and benefits. I wonder if he's going to have to invent the abacus or if there's a local version he can promote, just so people can do the math.

Are there any fiat currencies in this setting so far? I don't recall for sure whether there's money that isn't formed out of an equivalent value of a precious metal. And it sounds like he's going even beyond that and making the company "credits" abstract entries in a ledger, without any physical currency! I guess that'll be fine as long as all the transactions go through the company. They'd have to "cash out" in the form of some company assets to trade with anyone else.

EDIT: Ah, I missed this the first time through:

  Credits, on the other hand, can be exchanged just by moving some numbers around in the quartermaster's ledger. It's like how the Bank's coins aren't worth the same as the metal they're made from, just taken one step further by doing away with the metal altogether.‚Äù

So the Banking guild already had fiat currency.
