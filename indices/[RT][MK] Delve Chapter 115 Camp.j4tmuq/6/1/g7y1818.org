Re: Mana Manipulation

Easy. Normal items have like 50% efficency as we see when Rain recharges the hotplates. I have little doubt that actual training items have something like 100% efficiency (many of them probably even allow you to just siphon most of the mana off so you can use it in a charging loop) and thus the fact that they only have like 1% of the mana regen doesn't actually make them level up in the skill slower then Rain.

The fact that Rain hasn't spent a hour picking up a normal charging item at the store and then the next day just training his skill up to 10 is honestly pretty appaling.
