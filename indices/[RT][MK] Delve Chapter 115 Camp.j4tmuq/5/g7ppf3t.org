So, this is the chapter that made me drop my Patreon subscription, if I'm keeping my timelines straight. Reading about Rain trying - badly - to implement democracy while appealing to (but not actually explaining) some sort of half remembered Robert's Rules of Order was not interesting.

In fact, it made me feel rather bilked by the Patreon model. Not for the first time, and it's not the author's fault, per se, but I remember thinking: /Am I really paying a subscription for this guy to slowly worldbuild his way to something approaching a story?/

That puts me now in the unfortunate spot where I have to wait a month or two (had paid for September's advanced stuff too) before I can access new content in a story that already suffers for its serial format. Maybe I'll just pick it back up in half a year. Like other posters have said, I think Delve really does do better when you can consume it in bigger chunks.
