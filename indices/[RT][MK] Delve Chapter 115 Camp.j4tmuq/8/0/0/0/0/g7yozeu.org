They /have/ put in immense effort. Through trial and error, guess check and improve. People talk about builds all the time in this world. What they haven't come across is a systematic way to derive ideal synergies. Adventurers stumble across rare gems of knowledge and then guard them, they don't share with their potential enemies.

Every advance made has been slow, barely methodic and mostly random. Because math is not intuitive for most people without 10 years of education to beat it into them, and it takes a rare genius to pioneer a new field of math first. All those geniuses are scooped up into far more 'important' fields in this world than fiddeling around with meaningless number hobbies that won't have any effect on the world.

Except Math can, enter Rain. Who is not smart, but he is standing on top of several centuries of incredible men and women's minds and ideas.

edit: So the highest levels of math Rain is using in this story would be compounding percentages. Which I would expect most grade 9 students to solidly grasp. So... natives to a world without mandatory schooling because they haven't even had an industrial revolution yet (and probably never will, because magic solves the low hanging fruit problems that inspired ours much more easily), yeah, they've got no chance. If anything, the author is exaggerating how quickly people can learn this stuff without a formal education. If you've ever had to tutor someone that missed formal education... it is ridiculously tragic how stunted their mind is.
