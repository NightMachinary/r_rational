Finally caught up with this. At literally any point I would have liked Rain to try and abuse Overmana. In this chapter we get a few throwaway lines about Winter “helping” the classes that night. A few weeks gave a horse semi-intelligence. These people do not understand the concept of 0 yet he is trying to install some sort of representative (?) democracy. They should have just camped close to the city and gotten used to the “fake” cold of winter, taking his classes and shit, before they moved on.

I would have MUCH preferred if he said “hey guys, we're gonna travel into the ranked zone for a bit, if we find some lower level region we'll drop roots there. If not we build a camp somewhere and work on finding lairs for our unawakened to farm. After we get everyone awakened, we move south for more ascension.”

This semi-guild shit is so... odd for me. It's like, 10 chapters ago he was just trying to lower the barrier. Then he just... gives up control for nothing to the watch? Why not use Fel Sandis to fund ascension if that's his goal? Why not USE the city in an impenetrable barrier??????

I really got sucked into this a few days ago, pretty GREAT system exploration and the lair stuff, shit I would say this was 10/10 scratched some CRAZY itches I didn't even know I HAD with regards to LitRPG up until the bubble shows up. Basically forcing myself to read the last 30 or so chapters.

ALSO: at this point I've forgotten why it has taken him so long to upgrade mana manipulation. How the fuck is a normal person to get that to 10/10??????? And no matter HOW it happens, with a group of unawakened and Ameliah, his next blue is always gonna feel gifted/weak/Mary sue'd. There were opportunities (lavarro, bring me a lvl 27 blue and I will add your name to the list, or leveraging the Citizen.) to raise his cap in satisfying ways but at this point... just bleh.

One thing that WOULD be cool is if he got Ameliah to try out theorycrafted builds. It's gonna take ALOT of trust from her because he'll know everything about her at that point, but if he can make her “builds” more specialized that'd be great to see.

Or perhaps he creates “Ascension” builds. Like the secret builds of the Watch. The first is Passivist.

Ah at this point I'm just kinda ranting sorry lol. I still liked this, 7/10 for me. Just a disappointing end
