I haven't been getting that, things work different in this world.

People with the drive and mentality to shape the world go off and try to get awakened, they devote their lives to fighting and advancement. Those that don't have the drive to change the world, don't.The System has effectively created a permanent 'brain drain' culture where anyone that would have pursued the difficult paths of study, don't. (Or are so weak that no one cares because why would you try to invent a steam engine when Awakened can levitate objects, know you place you unawakened worm)

So Rain's background from a world where way more resources were devoted to that learning and that is hundreds of years past an intellectual awakening, is way ahead.

Only people like Staavo, who began as adventurers and gained enough levels that other people won't ignore their ideas, then got crippled, then rather than give up become a researcher. Only that kind of person has any hope of influencing their society, in much the same way Rain would be just another nobody if he hadn't been awakened.\\
Low and behold though, Staavo is rapidly picking up ideas because he has already laid the mental foundation. Everyone else in Ascension needs to go through an accelerated catch up that he did over a decade.
