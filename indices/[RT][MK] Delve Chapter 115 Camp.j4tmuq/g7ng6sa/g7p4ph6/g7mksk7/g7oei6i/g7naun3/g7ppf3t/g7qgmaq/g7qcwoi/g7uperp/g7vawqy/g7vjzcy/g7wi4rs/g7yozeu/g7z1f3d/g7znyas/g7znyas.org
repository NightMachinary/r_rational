Individuals can get a lot more influence by focusing on gaining levels and acquiring loot in this world. There is no incentive for an adventurer to sit down and work for a decade+ on refining mathematical theory.The lower class could work on things sure, but they will find it much harder to recieve funding and outwork any breakthroughs due to the extreme apathy of the ruling class who all possess magic capable of doing far more.

Blues are exactly why it *isn't* as much of a thing. Instead of sitting down and studying for years and years, people venture out to hunt blues.

Rain isn't special. He just comes from a world where the incentive structure was different. Hell, if he hadn't gotten a lucky blue and was unawakened, he wouldn't matter at all.

edit: You can see this in their culture too. Instead of synergising everyone takes builds that benefit the individual most. The System has created a global mindset that is rather uncooperative and not conducive to the advancement of more subtle fields. The people of this world are overall, even less educated then their earth equivalents, they don't even view education as important. (And why would they, everyone knows its your level that makes you important or not).
