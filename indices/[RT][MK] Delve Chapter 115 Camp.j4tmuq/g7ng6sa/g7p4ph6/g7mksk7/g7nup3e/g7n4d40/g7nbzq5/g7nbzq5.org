That's rather ingenious. Motivate people to learn math by making the math be about their money.

This sort of education could be revolutionary. It is a shame the story progresses time so slowly we are unlikely to see the ramifications. That's one downside of the current trend of character-driven stories: there aren't many that encompass large swathes of time. Even a Dickens-style entire lifetime narrative can do things that just aren't possible in stories about just a couple of weeks or years.
