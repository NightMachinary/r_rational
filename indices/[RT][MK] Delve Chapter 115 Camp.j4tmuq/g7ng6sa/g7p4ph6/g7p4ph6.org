Umm. Why is Rain pushing for a democracy, again? He wants to be in charge as a lord. The society expects lords to be in charge.

Even if he's committed to "democracy = good", at the very least he should wait a few weeks until the company is running smoothly. 8-person parties and helping each other kill blues is already a major change for the society. Let that settle down, then start stepping away from being a lord and towards sharing power in a democracy.
