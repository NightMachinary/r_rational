Damn, he is bad at this. Sorry, not trying to poke at it, but the first thing he should have "structured" was not the proceedings of the vote itself, but the proceedings of a meeting. The way it went, Rain explained three times what was needed, everyone else got one third of what they needed to vote, concerns were not addressed, almost no one got to clarify anything and the vote was held anyway. Thankfully, he had some good things passed there, even if a little forced. The rules as they are now will probably contribute to calling things back into question and smoothing things out later.

Now, the system he proposed is almost point per point the system used by pirates back then with a bit of extra complexity, so it should work well enough. I suspect giving people the chance to take non fighting classes and still being a viable "career" within the group will pay dividends later, the same way Tallheart does. Also math is a extremely good idea. Having people being able to do the math and check the books will dissuade anyone from pointing fingers blindly. Not sure if it's worth teaching a whole new set of numbers and measures just because he prefers it, but that's his free time to use.

I just wonder how he will set credit values for tasks. "Shares" worked well for pirates, since there was not that much of a power gap between crewmates, there was one task giving dividends (plundering) that everyone joined for and the reward was one massive treasure to be shared. Everyone did the same work, the only ones getting more were the ones doing extra work (captain, quartermaster, surgeon, carpenter, etc) and it was a simple ratio.

Here on the other hand, there are several tasks "worth of credits" that not everyone will participate. This means people with specific talents like fighting, healing or even different power levels will claim their contributions should be worth more credits. Not everyone is gonna be as selfless as Ameliah is, and since there is strategy and luck in bidding for a blue, the power gap will not smooth out easily. More than that, it will take one monster dropping a rare item worth a load of credits on one guy's lap to throw the whole credit system on it's head.
