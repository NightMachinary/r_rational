I loved it, but rational ... eh. More than baseline, definitely, which I think usually comes with a more reactionary take on a genre. There are bits and pieces here and there that read as "this is how it would actually be in the real world", but that's kind of secondary to what they're trying to do, which is a takedown/analysis of celebrity culture, soulless corporations, revenge, cycles of victimhood, and a bunch of other stuff like that. Like I said, I loved it, but if someone recommended it to me as rational fiction, I would be in the kind of mindset where I would immediately start poking holes in things, since there are holes to be poked.

Oh, and it's also really edgy, enough that it was a bit of a turnoff, but /far/ less than the comic books.
