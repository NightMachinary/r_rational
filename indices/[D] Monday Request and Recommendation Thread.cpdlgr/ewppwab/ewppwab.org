Anyone have recommendations for novels or web fiction about incremental progress? [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25225/delve][Delve]] and [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-paragamer-worm-the-gamer-w-ocs.496126/][The Paragamer]] are good examples of this, as is [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20299769-sword-of-the-bright-lady][Sword of the Bright Lady]].

People here might enjoy Delve. It's an isekai + lit rpg where the main character gets no special advantages, and even has to learn the local language. You get excited about things like his scraping together enough money to buy some clothes.

Sword of the Bright Lady is the first of the World of Prime series. The main character gets pulled into a fantasy world where power is gained by drawing a substance from the minds of deceased sentient beings. I'd venture to call it rational, probably the closest I've seen to a rational take on a literal interpretation of D&D. What would the world look like if sentients were actually worth XP? And if there was an alignment system and spells that let you see alignment?

Anyone who isn't reading, or hasn't read, Ted Chiang is missing out. You should run out and buy [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GD46PQZ/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1][Exhalation]].
