Delve seems promising but I am having a hard time understanding why our protagonists build is good. Aside from that one lucky essence monster and the mana to xp thing, it seems that his build should be easily replicatable, especially when Dynamo is commonly known. I also somewhat question the complete (almost) complete lack of asking for advice and common knowledge about good skill combinations/tactics as well as the idea of sinking three skill points into damage when he isn't investing anything in focus and when 9 points could make him virtually invincible to all damage types.
