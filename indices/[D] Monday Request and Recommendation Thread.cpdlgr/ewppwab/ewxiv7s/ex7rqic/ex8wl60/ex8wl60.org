I'll buy that given how vulnerable you become when you expose your build, that the social norm is that those are kept hidden and possible social stigma as you mentioned. It seems likely to me though that the nobles have extensive libraries on classes and skill trees and scholars hired to find and log new combinations. Admittedly though, for the vast majority of humanitys time it wasn't common to log things with the precision this would require, so I can buy a certain level of incompetence. It does seem narratively unsatisfying if the reason that the protagonists build is something is that the opposition is incompetent though I guess not less unsatisfying than the usual special treatment.

I think that the smartest thing to do regarding damage was to ask your friendly aura mage who were raised by the local OP mage about hidden offensive auras.

We don't actually know that there is only one other person who have a class around one attribute. We don't actually know the class of any of the other people and it seems at least plausible that most mages do a solo Focus build.
