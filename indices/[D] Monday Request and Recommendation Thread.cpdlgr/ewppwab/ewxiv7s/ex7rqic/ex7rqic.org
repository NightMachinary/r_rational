Seems fairly plausible that there might be a norm about not telling others about your build, i.e. a ruling class might know the best classes and find an advantage in discouraging open knowledge on builds, and the knowledge does seem fairly personal. In real life, we often don't share our salaries, even though that knowledge would help our colleagues and friends negotiate better. It's partly becaue the norm benefits social superiors (who are employers and not emploees) and partly because the numbers are too naked a reflection of status. Literal status (attributes, skills) eems like it might follow a similar dynamic.

Tend to agree that his points on freeze and fire are a waste. Perhaps you could justify one to access higher tiers or whatever, but unless I'm missing that they're both needed to unlock something in particular (which is possible) the fire at least seems like a waste.

I don't think his class is really anything special, at least not yet. Seems like people have a hard time specalizing to the extent that he does, there is only one other person shown to have a class based around one attribute.
