Honestly the "best rated" section on Royal Road is pretty good, which is surprising as it was pretty terrible like a year ago.

Notably pretty much everything on the first page is very solid, with a few that you might not like depending on your preferences (for instance both Blue Core and Large Chests feature adult content with Large Chests being pretty hardcore).

That said, I would recommend Blue Core anyways. Unlike Large Chests the adult scenes are always marked in the chapter title (and thus easy to skip if it isn't your cup of tea) in addition to being much less extreme. Its also a good and fun series.

Super Minion is also great, with a main character that is actually pretty rational. Now, he lacks starts off a non-human monster with no understanding of the world and human nature so despite acting rationally for him and his circumstances he still manages to act pretty insane, which is loads of fun.

I am also particularly impressed by the Scourged Earth (science fiction but restricted to Earth), which is one of the very few litrpg's with a good reason for leveling other then "Some gods felt like making a system I guess lol" and that really feels like it makes sense.

A rec that /isn't/ from the front page is The legend of Randidly Ghosthound which is a quite good litRPG. Not the /best/ ever, but A) It is still pretty good, and B) Quantity is a quality all its own, and at 980 chapters its something you can sink your teeth into for a significant chunk of time.
