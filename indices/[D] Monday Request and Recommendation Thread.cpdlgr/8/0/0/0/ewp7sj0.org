Yes. There's a site that compiles "qidian" chapters into pastebins. It used to have a subreddit. The second keyword is "underground". Search a bit and you should find it.

BTW, I second the rec for Lord of the Mysteries. It's quite good and draws on a lot of real-world inspiration and facts from Victorian Era London. I've actually learned a good amount of history from reading it and then looking up the references, facts, conditions, and statistics in relation to the real world. The difference is that in Victorian London, mysticism was a "fad" and a backlash against rationalism, but in this story, the mysticism is real (with strong Lovecraftian undertones). The author does a good job of sticking to his own rules and of letting the situation develop realistically based on the established conditions. You can absolutely reason about mysteries and future events based on what you've seen so far and the rules of the world, which is the most basic requirement for a Rational! work.

The same author wrote "Throne of Magical Arcana" (incomplete and very slow translation though). This one features "scientific sorcerers" called Arcanists in a world dominated by religion where the Arcanists perform experiments to discover the truth of the world and develop their powers. Features the wave-particle duality, the advent of non-Euclidean geometry, the discovery of the periodic table of elements, the discovery of the inner structure of an atom, and more. It's also quite fun to read and contains a lot of references and parallels to the real development of math, physics, and chemistry in the late 1800s to around 1900 while incorporating some of the Science vs. Religion and general religious oppression of earlier time periods.
