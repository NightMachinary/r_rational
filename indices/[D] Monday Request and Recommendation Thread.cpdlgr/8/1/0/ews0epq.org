Light spoilers for Super minion.

Didn't it bother you that he developed sympathy seemingly out of nowhere? What drew me to the story in the first place was the inhumanity of the MC, the tension between his cold robotic perspective and the need to fit in for survival.

The first couple of chapters were great for that, I was looking forward to witnessing how his inherent sociopathy would affect his relationship with other characters...and the first real connection he makes with- the guy from school (the one with the asshole stepdad)- and he decides to help him and be a "good friend", meh. disappointing. Ruined the whole concept of the story for me.
