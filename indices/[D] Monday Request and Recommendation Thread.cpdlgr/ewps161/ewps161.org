Isekai manga and anime is on full swing this summer season with countless new additions. However, what perturbs me off the most is that they try to add a "realistic" cookie cutter plot and expect the readers to take it "seriously".They hide the blatant fact that their medium is just a fanservice power jerk, filled with wish fulfillment. If you go on [[/r/manga]] or [[/r/anime]] they actually have fervent discussions on the latest chapter or episode. Not anything about the /revolutionary/ plot mind you but about who is the next best waifu. They glorify this medium as it is and I actually should not even be suprised why so many of the same cliche isekai keeps getting released looking at the comment section. They eat this garbage whole and shit out their money for it.

Is there any isekai besides worth the candle that has a rational or rational adjacent world and takes itself "seriously"?

[[https://mangarock.com/manga/mrs-serie-100391860][Eminence in the Shadow]]is an isekai manga that does not take itself seriously at all and thats why it is very enjoyable. The MC makes it his mission to be the unassuming yet powerful side character trope and takes it to the extreme.
