Someone already recommended Log Horizon so I'll recommend No Game No Life. Obviously the show doesn't take itself very seriously, quite the opposite, the world and main characters very openly celebrate a lot of goofy/fanservice-y tropes of otaku media (which I'd argue is one of the strengths of the show). However, I'd consider it pretty close to rationalist fiction: The premise lends itself well to interesting intellectual conflict (all conflict must be resolved through games), most characters have clear motivations/goals and pursue them in a rational manner, the main characters are highly motivated and have a very EA goal of wanting to unify the world and make everyone happy. Check out the first couple of episodes, they're a strong introduction to the premise and overall tone of the show, therefore a good guage of how much you'd like it.
