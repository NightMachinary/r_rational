I don't doubt that specialization is king. But he dumps 3 points into damage auras when 1 is enough and his lack of focus means that his damage is going to be lower than any mage that actually focuses on damage. We know that physical resistance is in tier 2 defensive wards and with his bonuses he can block 100% of damage eventually.
