Subtextually, I don't think it's the case that most (or any that we've seen) mages are specialized in focus to the extent that the MC is specialized in Clarity. The other mage guy expressed incredulity that the MC's health is so low. I believe one of the other classes was also "mage" or something similar, and they made kind of a big deal out of the vivicant (the health regen specalist) as if he was rare. They also explicitly say the "monolithic" classes are well-known but that people don't choose them too often. The story does seem a little inconsistent about how much other characters know about skills, they seem frequently surprised at his use of purity even though they seem to be able to find it in the menu as easily as he can.
