[[https://krytykal.org/daybreak/][Daybreak on Hyperion]]: isekai in a fantasy early-modern era, mainly focus on warfare and politics, among with personal issues. I remember really liking it, among the few things I actually read a couple of times, but I can only be vague since last I read it is years ago.

[[http://moonbunnycafe.com/overseer/][Overseer]]: maybe stretching it a bit, as mc's don't know his/her background, and isekai-ed as disembodied god of a race, but it's pretty unique and quite charming.

[[https://m.wuxiaworld.co/Release-that-Witch/][Release That Witch]]: guilty pleasure of mine. The isekai is a medieval setting, mc became a prince, and turns out there's magic, or more specifically there's witches that can use magic. Mc shelters them from being torched and use their power for good of the society, all the while introducing technological revolution to his territory to fight of monsters, nobles, princes, and in general just improving the welfare of his people.

[[https://myanimelist.net/manga/94658/Daraku_no_Ou][The Lazy King]]: mc isekai-ed as a demon in a hell with magic sistem based on fulfilling one of the seven sin, and mc's sin is Sloth. The story starts when mc had already became powerful, using the perspectives of demons around him, with the mc treated as a force of nature more than anything. When I read it I was unused to it's writing style so it felt a bit of a slog, but the ending of the book 1 is really memorable to me.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23173/the-simulacrum][The Simulacrum]]: Arguably rational or even rationalist fiction, though really what I'm in is for wacky hijinks of the main character, wielding Refuge in Audacity whenever the situation demands for the alternative.
