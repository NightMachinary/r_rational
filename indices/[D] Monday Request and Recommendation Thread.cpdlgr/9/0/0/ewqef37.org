the basic problem, is that bad writing is far more common than good writing. ergo, most people will encounter a poorly written version of the idea first.

the classic isekai is Narnia, with the lion witch and wardrobe (written in 1950). british children enter fantasy world with jesus alegory, during WWII. the full series includes genesis and the rapture. it is also gullivers travels to a lesser extent, where a man lost at sea finds fantastic and strange island (published in 1726). its not a new idea, really.

the 'bad' version... is the old D&D cartoon where the plot is basically monster of the week as the kids look for a way home. its a cheap concept that isnt even true to its source material. and if all you have seen of the idea is as bad or worse than that, then the hate makes too much sense.
