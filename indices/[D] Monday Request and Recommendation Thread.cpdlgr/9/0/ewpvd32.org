Eh, I don't understand all the hate on isekai. It's like all the junky sitcoms us Americans mass produce: they're cheap and easy to make, and some of them are very popular. The industry struggles to identify what makes particular one's popular so they just make a lot of them. As for all the discussion etc I assume it's mostly younger people or people new to the genre. I enjoyed some pretty poor anime when I was younger, harem and edgy tropes in particular that make me cringe now. The current popularity/penetration combines with it having built in plot essentials has also made it popular in current fiction production in general, so I try not to disregard them right away, but I feel your pain about the bland money grabs that are getting made.

The best straight take of isekai anime I've watched is Re:Zero which I'd give a 7/10 and Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash which I'd give a 6/10. Also if you've been exposed to the isekai trope but haven't watched Konosuba you're missing out!
