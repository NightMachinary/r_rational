I'm not really sure what you're expecting out of a large sub's comment section, lol. Once a sub gets 6+ digits of subscribers, the closer it becomes to a youtube comment section. Isekai is just a convenient method to create junk food fiction, simple as that.

You could say the same thing towards western YA fiction by calling an entire subgenre "teenage revolution", where your plucky highschool protagonists have to overturn an oppressive adult government. A dozen of those stories come out every year, and people, as you say, eat them up. Or with apocalypse litRPG, a subgenre that was popularized in western webfiction communities but is starting to get bigger in Japan now.

The closest thing to a serious rat-adjacent isekai I've seen is Mahoutsukai no Yome, though technically it's more of an urban fantasy with a magic masquerade. I suppose you could throw Spirit Circle in there as well for being more or less isekai.
