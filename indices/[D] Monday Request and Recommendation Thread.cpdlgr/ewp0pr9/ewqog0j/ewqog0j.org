I'd give a general rational recommendation for most alternate history stories since principally they try to appear consistent with what could happen irl. There's not meant to be any suspension of disbelief (maybe just the odds of the pod) since the whole idea is to demonstrate another path of history.

I never realised before the geographical spatial awareness you need for these stories until your paragraph.
