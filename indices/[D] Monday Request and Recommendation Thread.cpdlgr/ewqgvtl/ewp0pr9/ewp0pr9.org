This recommendation is for all my fellow Paradox gamers, particularly Europa Universalis 4. If you haven't heard of it yet, [[https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/the-revival-of-rhomaion-an-age-of-miracles.227279/][The Revival of Rhomaion: An Age of Miracles]] is amazing.

Over a million words long, incredibly dense in terms of content, and attempts to be historically accurate in the greed, pride, and the usual sins of people in power in an ahistorical revival of the Eastern Roman Empire. And it's still in progress.

Unlike the usual Byzantium or Roman wank, this fiction doesnt magically grant the nation instant industrialization, teleport in modern military tactics into the minds of generals, and hand waves away objectively terrible emperors that managed to find their way to the throne.

This fiction instead rationally describes a nation embodies the saying "Two steps forward, one step back". With every other step a complete waste of thousands to hundreds of thousands of lives. Completely historically accurate in that way.

For an author that reportedly never played a Paradox game, the level of detail found in this fiction wouldnt be out of place in the hall of fame for EU4 AARs.

The pictures no longer work but the text descriptions are detailed enough that, combined with a couple thousand hours staring at Europa Universalis 4 maps, you can paint the areas in question with memory alone.

I hesitate to recommend this fiction to the wider rational community however. There is a minimum level of historical, geographical, and medieval military knowledge needed to parse the jargon that makes the story so great.

An example of the usual sentence in the work:

#+begin_quote
  Even with their control of Crete uncontested, the Venetians are utterly enraged by the terms, but news of Ragusa's defection in late May and reports of ominous Milanese troop movements near Mantua give them little choice.
#+end_quote

It reads like something straight out of my last (failed) Basileus to Mare Nostrum run.
