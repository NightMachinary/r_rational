My interpretation was that the probes were sent out at slower than light speeds, and also returned at slower than light speeds. Note that the apocalypse happens in 2472, so it's fairly far in the future already, and some probes could have returned by then.

I'm not entirely sure how Voyager XIX was supposed to have survived entering the anomaly, as it is not equipped with the grav plating tech needed to traverse it, but the anomaly in question is apparently a different one 27 light years away, not the one orbiting near earth during the main story.
