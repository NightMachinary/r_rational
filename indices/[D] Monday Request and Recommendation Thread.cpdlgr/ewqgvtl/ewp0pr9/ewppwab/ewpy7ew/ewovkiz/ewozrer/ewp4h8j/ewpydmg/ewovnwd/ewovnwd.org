could somebody reccommend me something thats not on the wiki page under the "defining works" ?

it can be anything, although preferably a fantasy novel that i could read online. Doesnt have to be strictly rational although ofcourse i would prefer if it was but i am largely bored and would read anything.

I was lately reading the novel "delve" on RR and was in the mood for something similiar. I have also read metaworld chronicles, the good student, azarinth healer, skyclad and a couple of others on RR. Most of the stuff on RR tho is pretty meh altogether but sometimes there are things that i can read as popcorn fics.
