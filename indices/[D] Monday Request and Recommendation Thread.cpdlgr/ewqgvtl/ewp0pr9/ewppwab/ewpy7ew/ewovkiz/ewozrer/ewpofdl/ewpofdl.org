I started reading it, but haven't finished it yet, not sure if I will.

The tech level struck me as weird. It was sort of implied that humanity (pre-apocalypse) was stuck in the solar system, but later on it is basically stated that they did have FTL. And then it isn't clear (at least for the part that I read) if the MC does have access to FTL or not. Which I would think changes everything.

Also: A little bit later, the MC (and friends) take out a enemy ship. And afterwards (at least as far as I got), there were no consequences? Like, no one else noticed that the ship went missing, and was a t last known position X, Y, Z?
