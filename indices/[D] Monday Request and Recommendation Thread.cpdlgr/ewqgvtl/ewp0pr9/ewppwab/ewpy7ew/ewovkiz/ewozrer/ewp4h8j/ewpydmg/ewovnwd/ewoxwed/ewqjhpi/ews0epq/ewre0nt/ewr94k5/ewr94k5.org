well, i would say that the best rated section atleast has some pretty good things there that i would want to read. Not counting mother of learning we have stuff like "delve" which is a promising new litrpg, "re: trailer trash" which is a rarely seen normal highschool drama and we also get "epilogue" which is a rather nice and short exploration of a concept about isekai stuff if at time a little unrealistic.

There are things that interest me there but there are also novels that are totally boring and rather uninteresting. Personally i really was bored of ELLC and although i havent read blue core it doesnt look that enticing either. I read a bit of superminion and the early chapters are absolutely a slog to get trough because the head of the character in which we sit is such a total blank slate that its just tiring.

i read the legend of randidly the ghosthound to about chapter 300 i think ? when randidly gets back to earth from his adventure in spear xianxia realm. i also remember some things happening after that but the novel is just annoying to read at some points. Its just too long and in a typical chinese xianxia fashion it has thousand of chapters that are so spread out it doesnt make a lot of sense
