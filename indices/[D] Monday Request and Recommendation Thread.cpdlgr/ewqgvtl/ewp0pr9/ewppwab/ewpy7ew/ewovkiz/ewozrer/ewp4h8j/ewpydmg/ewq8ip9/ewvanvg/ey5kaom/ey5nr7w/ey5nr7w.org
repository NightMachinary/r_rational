I like LE and CP (haven't found Hbomberguy), but I think the point above stands.

Like, I would say that Lindsay Ellis is a better critic / analyst than Lily Orchard by most metrics, but /man/ Lily just gets to the point, and she has a knack for finding controversial issues and getting to the root of them, even if I don't always agree with her points or her presentation.

I'd put it this way: if ContraPoints is the Paragon of left-wing Youtube, then Lily Orchard is the Renegade. Not necessarily /better/, but way punchier.
