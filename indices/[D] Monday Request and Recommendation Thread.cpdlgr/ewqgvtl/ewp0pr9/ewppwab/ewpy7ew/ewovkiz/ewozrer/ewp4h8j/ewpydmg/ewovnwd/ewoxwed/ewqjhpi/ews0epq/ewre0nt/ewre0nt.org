Yeah I'd probably agree with this, I normally try to avoid quantity as I get sucked in way too easily so I haven't read Randidly. Also has a ridiculous name, put me off. Put I've given a go on a lot of the royal road top fictions and the good ones that have enough writing to actually sink your teeth into are:

-Though the heavens should fall(not actually in the top but by iron teeth author, and I think its going have a lot of potential)

-Delve

-super minion

-He who fights with monsters

-The scourged earth

-Metal and magic

-Tidal lock(stopped writing but still read it)

-Perks of immortality

-Deeper Darker(switches between characters but Ubik is interesting)

-Chimera(might update again not sure)

-Defiance of the fall

-The daily grind

-Wake of the ravager(probably shouldn't like this one but I just really enjoy the world building)

-Street cultivation(loved this one, but its being turned into a book. might still be able to find it dunno)

-also not on royal roads but Potenia traitor son cycle on space battles is honestly one of the fictions/quests I most look forward to see updating

-Theres a few others but they're other short and discontinued or just not as good. Btw this up to page 6 maybe theres more out there, but I'm not sure I'm willing to slog through any more while I have enough updates to satisfy my decently written trash novel need. I also read quests on sufficient velocity and space battles, which I can give recommendation on if anyone wants.
