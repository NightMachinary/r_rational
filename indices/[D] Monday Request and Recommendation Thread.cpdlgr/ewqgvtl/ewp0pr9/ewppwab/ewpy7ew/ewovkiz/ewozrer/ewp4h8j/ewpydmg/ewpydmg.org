Have you ever watched a video dissertation about something and felt the youtuber was making some interesting points, but they were really diluting them by being vague and non-commital and adding a lot of extraneous "But it's just my opinion" after every sentence?

Well, then I recommend [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAQ7357VoOQZTeRGhMa4r-A][Lily Orchard]]. She got her start in My Little Pony Analysis, and branched out into other kids' cartoons and video games. She's basically the polar opposite of a liberal centrist, and has an extremely strong opinion on everything she talks about.

She's a really frustrating content creator for me.

On the one hand, she's one of the smartest, most incisive youtubers I've seen. I agree with about 80% of the points she makes.

On the other hand, she is incredibly obnoxious about the remaining 20%, and she often represents the most toxic, self-destructive parts of the internet. So, you know, proceed with caution.
