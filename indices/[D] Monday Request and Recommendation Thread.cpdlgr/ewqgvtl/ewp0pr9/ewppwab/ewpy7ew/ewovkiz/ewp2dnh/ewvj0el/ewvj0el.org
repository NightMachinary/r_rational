If you haven't had the time for Mother of Learning, I'd suggest it. One of my two ;) favorite serial web-novels of all time. Not yet finished, but I'm extremely excited for the end, because the author has set up a scenario with a solution yet to be revealed. I think I've figured out most of what the MC is planning to do to get him and his friends out of the disaster, and there are a few other puzzles I'm still thinking about. You'd have to make it about 100 chapters in to get there, but it's well worth it on the way. It would be my pick for "Best Ongoing Web-Serial for the Clever Reader."

I also read through Doc Future the last two days because I wanted to see how the author did with smart characters... not amazing really, a lot of it is "wow, reader, isn't this dialogue confusing?" However, the story baited me in with a fantastic initial chapter, which I'd happily share with anyone who likes a little clever storytelling. It's called "Phone Tag" and it's about a speedster superhero who suddenly hears her friend scream on an international phone call, and has less than a second to save her. The physics of speed measuring solid fractions of c is the best part, imo. Honestly, the speedster, Flicker, comes across as smarter than her father, Doc Future, the "smartest man in the world." We actually see her being creative and doing things in the world rather than just arguing about time-loops and quantum physics.
