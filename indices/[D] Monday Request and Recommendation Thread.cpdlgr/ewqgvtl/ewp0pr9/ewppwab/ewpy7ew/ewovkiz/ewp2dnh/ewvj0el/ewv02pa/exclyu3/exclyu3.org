Not online, but I've been rereading the Commonweal series by G Saunders ([[https://www.goodreads.com/series/242525-commonweal]]). It requires and rewards attentive and intelligent reading, by pointing at concepts in fuzzy ways (with characters having more detailed knowledge that they don't explain) long before describing them in detail.

However YMMV - I find this kind of approach relies heavily on a partial match between what the reader imagines is the logic behind the events, and what actually is explained later, and that will vary.
