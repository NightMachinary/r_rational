The anime handles the first season's ending with slightly more drama and emotion. Also, big sis is even more over the top, probably because they cut down on giving sound to everyone's inner thoughts.

All in all, it's still good. And all in color. Worth the watch if you liked the manga and don't care that you know the whole plot.
