I recommend [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22356/dreams-come-true/chapter/324904/01][Dreams come true]] for fun, thoughtless entertainment. The premise is basically co-existence as isekai and in reality, which makes for a nice contrast in storytelling and a fun situation to exploit. The writing style is easily tolerable, the plot doesn't stagnate, and the most ridiculous aspect of the early plot can be safely ignored IMO (BIG spoiler, the "hate" of the "antagonist" neighbor). Overall, if you have nothing good to read right now, try it.
