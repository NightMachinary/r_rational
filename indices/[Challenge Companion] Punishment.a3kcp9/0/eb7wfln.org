I wish I could remember the name of the book, but there is a science fiction story in which many crimes are punishable with decapitation. Which you survive after having your personality and memories and essential regulatory functions downloaded into a digital device that is implanted into your pelvic ganglion. You are expected to spend your own money on sensory replacements.

It's like an extremely drastic version of punitive branding.
