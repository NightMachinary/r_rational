The contaminated and uncontaminated food should be worth different amounts. The bad taste lowers the price of the former, and some of that total value, if people can buy uncontaminated food instead, will go to the latter. The vote discusses whether to set the value of the contaminated food to 0. This does not make today's contaminated food more expensive.
