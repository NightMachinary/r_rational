  Why would the price of the food which might be dumped because of its reduced quality go up?
#+end_quote

Because the quantity of food available is more or less fixed.

Edit: Actually on reflection you might be right. The cost of food futures should be going up, but that doesn't necessarily translate to the cost of current food going up. Let me think about this more before I change anything though.

Edit 2: I decided the way I had the economics of food working in this setting didn't make sense and have edited those bits. Thanks.

RE the questions about voting off: It should be noted that that fear is very much to be viewed through the lens of Arthur's social anxiety. Arthur is not in fact in any danger of getting voted off the ship - people tend not to get voted off unless they're actively useless, but having friends certainly helps if you find yourself in that situation.
