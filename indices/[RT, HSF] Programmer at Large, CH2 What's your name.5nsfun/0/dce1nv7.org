  This was why the price of food was up -- speculation on the slightly reduced resources if the vote went ahead.

Why would the price of the food which might be dumped because of its reduced quality go up?

It looks like these Nomic mechanics are applying evolutionary pressure to the ship's population to become more popular - but I wonder how that translates into a bureaucratic requirement for everyone to not be antisocial? The who-gets-voted-off is a zero-sum game, after all, and I would expect the bureaucracy to instead try to push for people to not invest ressources into increasing their own chances at continued employment at the expense of everyone else, that might instead have been contributed to the ship's common good.

Perhaps the protagonist fights against akrasia, and imposed the social points system on himself so he'd be forced to interact with people in every short term, so he wouldn't be voted off the ship in the long term?
