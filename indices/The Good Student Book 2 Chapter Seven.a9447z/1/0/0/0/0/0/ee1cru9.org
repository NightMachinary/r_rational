Thanks for the references.

Taking these in whole I think helps illuminate one of my reoccurring problems with understanding this novel. Half the time I read nics confessions I'm baffled and the other half I'm shocked. I'm not entirely sure if I need my hand held more than some people but I don't have issues understanding things in worm or ward or mother of learning or pgte, and yet, what characters say seems to sometimes conflict with or go against what they do or act like. Other times it just comes out of left field or doesn't click for me at all. I think your penultimate quote is a somewhat ok example of this. When I read that the first time I was confused - is he joking, is he being facetious or childish? Is he somehow serious or is he just trying to make himself believe this, maybe in vain? Is this roke subtly affecting him? Is it just a new shift or an underlying issue bubbling up? What happened to past camaraderie proven loyalty through time spent together facing challenges, etc?

It just seemed like a really weird thing to say and somehow never really became clear what the intent was. The weird strain between all of them that somehow appeared in the beginning of the book seemed misplaced to me. No reasonable preamble for it to suddenly be there and now he's saying stuff like that - applicable to one of the other quotes regarding them as well, like he's suddenly unfamiliar with their personalities and teasing and is blowing it out of proportion. Is he supposed to become an unreliable protagonist sort?
