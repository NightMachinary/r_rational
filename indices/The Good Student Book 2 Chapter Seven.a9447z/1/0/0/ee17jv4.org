I just reread a few of the last chapters from the end of book 1 as a refresher and then read book 2. So, as someone that just binged it (And read the chapter discussions here), I see a lot of complaints about Nic not changing and there being little character development. However, I think it's more apparent when you read it straight.

Nic goes from a passive person with little opinion about himself or his station. He is interested or devoted to his academic lifestyle. However, he has changed since the events of book 1.

He has lost his passion for studying and class. He is actively searching for something new to bring value to his life. Nic admits that he no longer wants what he has been allotted to in life. He doesn't want the boring, cushy, and safe desk job anymore. He is actively looking for a place in the adventurous, dangerous going-ons of Ranvar.

Though he doesn't outright admit it as far as I can tell, Nic is also tired of how people treat him. Dizzy brushes him aside and tries to use him to be involved in the situation. Simole treats him better and helps him but it is from a position higher than him. She has power and skill which intrinsically has her looking down on his ability. The Archmage, demons, and Winnum Roke all are trying to manipulate him.

Nic is, as he stated, tired of being the damsel in distress. He wants to have agency over the modicum of influence he has in his role in the situation of things. He is no longer willing to just be passive and be so insignificant. He has begun to plot himself and has started to treat other more along the lines of how they have been treating him. It is a kind of growing up, though a sad one where one loses their naivety and kindness.

Sorry for the wall of text but I felt like getting some of my thoughts out there after catching up.
