I love this type of story telling personally. I hate it when stories have a ton of hand holding, repeatedly telling you the conclusions or what is happening. That isn't how conversations work in real life. Often, the best way to do it is to give the hints and imply the conclusion. It leaves a lot to the reader to pick up on it and not miss characterization or intent but it is great when successfully done.

I think part of your difficulty is that you need to be good at remembering off handed comments and connecting disjointed dialogue from different chapters to connect things when conclusions are left to be made by the reader instead of being expressly written down. Also, you need to remember that many characters straight up lie. You need to be discerning of when that is happening. I find it obvious enough but if you take what they are saying at face value, you'll get really mixed up. Also, in addition to lying, characters hide the truth from other characters. They won't tell the whole truth but as the reader you need to be able to interpret what actually happened.

In regards to your question. Nic is being serious, he's just saying it in a jokey manner cause he's having a mostly lighthearted conversation with his friends at lunch. I don't find it random at all. It was completely set up at the end of book one. it literally ends with Simole and Dizzy speaking together and reveals that they know what Nic did even though he didn't tell them. Nic lied and said he closed the door to the Other Place and trapped Roke there. However, Simole and Dizzy reveal that Nic did not. He took Roke back with him in his mind. He has her trapped in his mind. They don't trust him with being her warden and are collaborating to watch over Nic and Winnum Roke.

  “He was the door. He was always the door. He couldn't stop her, but he could stop her getting through the doorway. He trapped her,” said Simole. “Do you think she's really crazy? If she's inside him, it might end up making him go mad.”

  “He's too stubborn to let Winnum Roke change his mind. But he might lose control of the rest of his body. And then they'll know, and do something about it. They're too scared to trust him. That's why it's important you look after him.”

  Simole raised an eyebrow. “I thought you were the one who wanted the heroic jobs. He'd rather have you.”

  “He needs you. You can protect him.” Dizzy smiled bitterly. “Must be nice to be born with so much power.”

They might work together and be "friends" but they each have their own agenda and desires. They also know each other's abilities/skills. As such, Dizzy and Simole do not trust that Nic has the ability to keep someone as powerful as Roke in check for long. Pretty reasonable and so they are going to be working together to do it instead because they believe in their own abilities more. You're saying that because they are friends they should trust each other and Nic is acting out of character but it seems like you are misunderstanding their characters instead. Nic knows that they know what he did and that this is how they will react, hence his comment.

You also say that they are just teasing and he is blowing it out of proportion but you seem to be misunderstanding their relationship. They are fairly friendly with each other and trust each other to be largely working for the same goal (As in they aren't evil). However, they aren't completely on the same side per se. Nic wants to do things as a primary actor and wants to keep Dizzy out of it to keep her safe (or at least he did in Book One). Dizzy wants the primary actor to be herself and refuses to be kept out of the loop. If they can take advantage and power away from the other in order to achieve this, they will. Dizzy repeatedly has straight up told him this though you might have taken this as just a joke?

  “Like I was saying,” said Dizzy firmly, “Simole I understand. You, on the other hand, are completely out of your depth. You don't deserve to be part of this, let alone leading the way.”

  “And you do?”

  “More than you.”

She is totally serious. She has been jealous of Nic in the entire series because he gets to be directly involved in what is happening. She will take that role from him in a heartbeat even if she is friends with him and has feeling for him. Nic knows this but he is not willing to give it up.

  "I'm sorry if I ended up where you wanted to be. It was just dumb luck, I know, but it would be stupid not to make the best of it. That's all I'm trying to do now. Even if I'm doing it poorly, it's still my decision how to proceed, deserving or not.”

  “Yes,” said Dizzy. “I accept it, too. You're the winner here, there's no changing that.” She said it like he'd won a lottery prize of great value. That wasn't how it felt at all. “One qualified contestant, one wild card. But you're going to let me join. Whatever is going to happen from here on out, I want to be a part of it. I don't care if you think it's a good idea or not.”

  Her demand was met with silence. Nic wasn't sure how to explain his reluctance. At least not in a way that wouldn't cause her to turn violent.

Both characters are helping one another but keeping an eye out for the other. Dizzy will take the chance to steal everything from Nic for herself and Nic will stop her from being involved if he can.

Also Simole is trying to remove Nic's agency along with Dizzy not because she wants to stop Nic's goals but because she wants to protect him. She thinks he is out of his depth and at risk of being turned insane by Roke or taken advantage of by the mages. So she will help remove his agency for his protection. The same way Nic wants to remove Dizzy's involvement to protect her. Just as Dizzy doesn't want Nic to do that, Nic doesn't want Simole to do that either.

Plus there are other reasons for the characters to be at odds with each other. IDK if this will ever come up again, but Nic was kinda (?) involved in killing Dizzy's dad

  “You can't keep him alive,” said Nic. “It isn't your choice.”

  “You think his heart will stop beating while I hold it in my hands?” asked the demon.

  “You have spent enough time among us,” said Nic. “Have you ever know spilled blood to be drawn back into an open vein?”

  The blood flowed out and the Minister fell to the floor.

  “Did you just overcome a demon's will?” said Simole.

  “Yes. It's their weakness, the direct contradiction. Don't worry, I can only do it here. Back home, you'll always be able to squash me like a bug.”

  Simole snorted. “Glad to hear it. Was it really necessary to let him die?”

  “There was no way to save him. This was better than the alternatives,” said Nic.

  “I'd like to see you convince the girl of that.”
#+end_quote

Obviously Nic didn't actually kill him. There was no saving him and Nic just wanted to let him die. But it would understandably upset Dizzy if she found out.

Also not revealed until later but when Nic let the door to the Other Place be closed, it cut off the Arcanum that the All-Father needed and this could have potentially put him at odds with Simole

  Simole's eyes narrowed. She knew Nic carried a passenger, the one he had just named. At least, that was what she believed. Nic judged her to be couching her next question in language that wouldn't give him away. Which meant she was still on his side, for now. Her relationship to the dragon was close. She had grown up with the giant lizard as a guardian, as a beloved pet. Even though she knew what it was underneath the scales and claws, her bond with the monster was no less intense. If you could love a fanged, flying leviathan of death, what difference would a little demonic heritage make?

  “You shut the door behind you?” she said.

  “The door is closed,” said Nic, as careful with his wording as she. He hadn't closed the door himself, Winnum Roke had done that. And she had done it from that side, locking herself in. Allowing him to leave with a parting gift lodged in his brain.

  “And you knew this would happen?”

So yes they are friends but they are not above doing things they believe are right or self serving at the expense of one another to a degree.
