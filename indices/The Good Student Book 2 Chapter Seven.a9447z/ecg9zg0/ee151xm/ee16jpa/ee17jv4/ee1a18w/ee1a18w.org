#+begin_quote
  He has lost his passion for studying and class. He is actively searching for something new to bring value to his life.

I think that's a maybe. I think it's purely circumstantial - he has bigger things to worry about at the moment and the focus has shifted from class to accommodate this.

#+begin_quote
  Nic admits that he no longer wants what he has been allotted to in life. He doesn't want the boring, cushy, and safe desk job anymore. He is actively looking for a place in the adventurous, dangerous going-ons of Ranvar.
#+end_quote

Do you have any citation for this? I seem to recall him only recently mentioning, yet again, that he's not interested in being a mage for example. He's currently doing things mostly because he thinks he either has to do them to accomplish what he wants, due to his circumstances, or because it'll make things easier for what he wants. Throughout all this I've never gotten the sense he particularly enjoys or prefers this new life of adventure and mystery.

  Though he doesn't outright admit it as far as I can tell, Nic is also tired of how people treat him. Dizzy brushes him aside and tries to use him to be involved in the situation. Simole treats him better and helps him but it is from a position higher than him. She has power and skill which intrinsically has her looking down on his ability. The Archmage, demons, and Winnum Roke all are trying to manipulate him.
#+end_quote

That's a possibility - I'm just not sure how entirely likely it is. He's aware of Dizzy's motives, and doesn't seem terribly bothered by them - he still seems stuck on her. I think he's making the best of the situation by trying to use her in return. He might as well. As for Simole - well I don't know if there's any revolutionary there. That's been the case since the very beginning, and he's been aware of it for a very long time now. I highly doubt he has any particularly gnawing concerns about their dynamic.

I agree with the rest. I'm glad for it but still wonder why it took so long. For someone supposedly talented in learning, he's sure taken an extremely long time to adapt to his situation. Apart from that, this novel, for some reason, makes it difficult to discuss its characters and their motivations/relationships without immediate context. I don't know if it's because readers are left in the dark with intention but it always feels like I'm speculating.
