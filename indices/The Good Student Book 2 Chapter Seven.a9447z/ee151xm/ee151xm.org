Nic is getting increasingly devious and openly manipulative as the series goes on. Not necessarily in a cruel way or unreasonably but he is develolping a somewhat Machiavellian personality and projecting it onto everyone around him as well. He believes that others are using him and attempting to coerce him to act in a certain way because that is how he has been treating others.
