I'm quite clear on dizzy in regards to nic, most likely because it's been very transparent so far. I'm sure it's part of why I find her so annoying. I'm not seeing anything of revelation in regards to Simole purely from references although I would question how she actually plans to remove nic from the equation. At most I've been led to believe she'll have to protect him and watch out for him. Perhaps she could start using force if she had to but I don't know if she's ever hinted at that. Or if he believes that.

In any case, despite any attempt to draw similarities to real life, this behavior actually seems less believable to me. His words start fine but become really spiteful for no apparent reason. They're so hyperbolic they become strange, especially since it's apparently just an assumption on his part. But hey whatever, I should probably come to accept that this novel won't have any flow or internal monologue help. The whole isolationist tactics in the beginning was still strange. Their little tete-a-tetes could only have served to make him extremely suspicious if not resentful (I assume maybe what the author was going for, but then why) - whatever their point it would only put his guard up. Especially after last book's events. So either intentional or incredibly stupid of both characters to do, especially if they have motives that deviate or go directly against Nic.
