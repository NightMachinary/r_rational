Like I said, I just read the second book at once and what I'm saying comes from expressly stated thoughts in the series. Easy to forget when you're reading chapter by chapter but extremely obvious when you go through it at once.

  He had accepted that his original goal --- to get closer to Dizzy --- was no longer feasible. But the result of that was that he had lost a lot of his ardour for learning. His mind often wandered during classes, on flights of fancy of no consequence. Drifting and aimless.

  He lacked purpose. He needed purpose.

My first point isn't circumstantial, in my opinion. This is in Book Two Chapter Two. it also has to do with my point on Nic looking for something to do with his life.

#+begin_quote
  I've decided it won't work to just sit and wait. Plus, I like it. Being involved in something big, even when I don't really know what's at stake. Maybe if I did I would be more scared. Ordinary life, working in a nice office, buying things to make myself more comfortable, it just feels a bit...”

  “Drab?”

  “I guess. Drab and dreary.”

In regards to him no longer wanting to be a clerk. This is in Book Two Chapter Three.

  “You seem distracted,” said the voice in his head.

  “Yes. I'm trying to understand my place in the world,” said Nic.

  “That's not very difficult. It is whatever you want it to be.”

  “What if you don't know what you want it to be?”

  “Then it doesn't really matter, does it?”

Nic speaking to Winnum Roke at night while he is being introspective in bed. More with him thinking about his new thoughts on life. Book Two Chapter Four.

#+begin_quote
  “I have no doubt you will try to deceive me at some point. Everyone does, if they think it is for a higher cause."
#+end_quote

Like I said, it isn't expressly stated but imo, Nic has been bringing up how people treat him and how he is viewed a lot more in Book Two. He is thinking about it a lot and the tone that I am getting is that he is a bit bitter about it and he doesn't like it. Book Two Chapter Four

#+begin_quote
  It was like they didn't even know he was there. No, it was worse than that. They knew he was there, awake, listening, but they didn't care what they said in front of him. His feelings were irrelevant because to them he didn't really have any. He wasn't even human, just a vessel they were deciding on how best to utilise.

Nic's thoughts of how Simole and Dizzy are treating him in Book Two Chapter Six

#+begin_quote
  Even Nic could feel the pressure she exerted on her surrounding just by being present. More than before, he was almost certain. Had her father given her further training? Had Winnum Roke?

  The other students shifted and flowed out of her path without even realising it. They were students of the Ransom School, smart enough to recognise an insurmountable threat. Simole wasn't the only one of those the school contained.

  What was it like being so sure of yourself? Did it make you happy? Did it make you feel safe? Did it lead to arrogance and conceited disregard for the wishes of the mere mortals who crawled around at your feet?

  He needed her, even though it helped emphasise his own weaknesses.

Nic's thoughts on Simole in Book Two Chapter Six. I get your point that that has been their dynamic but I think that Nic has been more clear about his uselessness recently and his own opinions have been changing recently. What he wants from life is different so, while he doesn't necessarily begrudge Simole, her strength and his reliance on her is just a sign of his own incompetence, which he wants to change.

#+begin_quote
  “Yes, you're right. In all likeliness, they've decided to join forces to keep an eye on me and prepare a suitable tactic for preventing me getting in their way. They probably assume some new catastrophe will befall us and I'll be in the middle of it, and they'll want to control, manipulate or coerce me into giving them full power of attorney over whatever small influence I might end up with. I don't think they trust me to handle it myself or have the good sense to let them take over without being forced to.”
#+end_quote

Like I said, I think Nic wants more personal power because he desires his own independence and agency without needing to be used and influenced by others. From Book Two Chapter One

#+begin_quote
  What Nic really feared was that he would have to be saved, again. A heroic knight in a nightie and pigtails bursting through the door in the nick of time. He had had quite enough of being the damsel in distress.

  His life at the centre of these infernal events never seemed to raise him up to the level of competent challenger. He was merely a pawn being moved around a board at someone else's behest. And rescued from certain annihilation the same way.

From Book Two Chapter Eight. Nic has had the somewhat of a similar sort of dynamic with Simole and Dizzy and a lot of other characters since the beginning. He is smart but out of his depth and has a lack of skill/training. Especially when compared to chosen one Simole, trained her whole life Dizzy, powerful/experienced Archmage, and ancient power Winnum Roke. But after the events of Book One, he is getting tired of the dynamic.
