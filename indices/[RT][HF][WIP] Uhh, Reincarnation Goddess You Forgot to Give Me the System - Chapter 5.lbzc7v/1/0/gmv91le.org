Yes, it's always been my plan to eventually crosspost this to Royal Road. I'd like to build up a bigger backlog before I start doing that, though.

(I mean... I've already written the first novel's worth of content, but I mean a bigger backlog of chapters that I've already posted about here, to the group that I consider the story's primary demographic.)

(Also, I'm still working on commissioning some cover art for it. You can't go big on RR without a cover, sadly.)
