A problem I've realized I'm having with my own writing is that I keep writing scenes that I think "ought" to be in the story rather than just getting to the stuff that interests me. The result is that the writing is difficult and slow and bad, and the audience probably doesn't find those scenes any more interesting than I do. As a result, I'm going back over my stories and throwing out everything that I wrote because I thought it was supposed to happen. Instead, I'm going to do whatever interests me, and I'm going to listen to the part of my brain that gets bored, that complains the scene isn't working, that feels like it's being forced to work instead of the writing flowing naturally.

I think this story could use the same. Skimming farther down, it looks like it gets sort of interesting. There's magic and monsters and stuff. Sounds neat. But do I really want to slog through pages of...I don't know what, exactly, to get to that?. Girls at school getting to know each other and learning about drinking? Sort of like /The Bell Jar/ but bad? I wonder how much of what's been written really interested in the author, how much flowed naturally out of what interested her about the story she conceived and how much she had to force out because she thought it was supposed to be there.

Also, is it just me, or does it go from Chapter One to Chapter Three with no Chapter Two in between?
