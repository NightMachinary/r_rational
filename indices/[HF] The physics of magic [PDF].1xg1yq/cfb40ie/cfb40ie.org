First impression wise; you could do with an editor to help smooth out the word flow. Right now it feels just a bit stilted and not much has been done to frame the world we are in a little more.

I do not know where we are, and I was not engaged enough to invest the time to get to the explanation of the world we are reading about. After reading the first few paragraphs I sorta can guess that we are in a boarding school, maybe? This is set in the modern day, but the characters prefer to use much older styles. I don't know why this is or what this means for the setting, it just feels out of place and takes me out of the story even further.

It is not very clear on what exactly is going on to the detriment of the story. I honestly don't feel like sticking to the third chapter with how the first five paragraphs are written.

I really don't mean for this to be too harsh on you, it is great that you want to write and to get your work out there. Just find someone to pre-read for you and to work on making the writing flow a little better. Keep working at it!
