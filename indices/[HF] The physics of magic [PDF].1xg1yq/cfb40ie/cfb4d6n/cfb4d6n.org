It's not mine. I am running the website for the author though.

How many books have you picked up that were engrossing from the very first paragraph? Like actual novels, not web-fiction or fan-fiction?

[[/r/rational]] seems to trend towards fiction that you can just pick up and start reading. Fiction that doesn't require any kind of investment, and a lot of short stories. I think the industry in general is probably going that route, but I don't think it's a very good trend.

It's had a lot of pre-reading. Given other peoples reactions, I'm inclined to think it's more about your reading style then the content of the book. You try to target everyone and you end up pleasing no one.
