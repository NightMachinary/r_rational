There are a lot of small traps that amateurs fall into. The biggest difference between the professional and the amateur is (usually) years of experience and a much larger level of feedback in the form of beta readers and (especially) editors. There are also a lot of gatekeepers that tend to admit only those in the top 1% of all writers into the realm of "professional". So for those various reasons, I expect amateur works to be worse than professional works (though of course that's just a general rule, and there are a few exceptions to it).

As to the question of why writers tend to fall into the slow opening trap, I think it's because they feel the need to set up all of the cool things that they have ideas for - and if you're doing science fiction or fantasy, they feel the need to set up all of the rules and characters to get the reader invested. It's a pretty easy trap to fall into.
