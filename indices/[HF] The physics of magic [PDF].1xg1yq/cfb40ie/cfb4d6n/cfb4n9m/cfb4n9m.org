The very first sentence made me want to stop reading, and the second and third sentences reinforced that feeling. Not every story needs to start with something going bang--look at Star Wars: A New Hope, which has a painfully slow opening. But based on a skim, this story has absolutely nothing happening for several pages. That's not an opening; that's just stuff that needs to be cut.
