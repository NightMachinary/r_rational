For reference, the first Harry Potter book does its setup in the first chapter, and slowly introduces the mysterious - but I've seen to done in a variety of ways. What you /really don't/ want is to explain your magic system right at the beginning (which this book doesn't - and I think the slow introduction works here, though I'll wait until I'm at the end to give my full thoughts).

  Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they didn't hold with such nonsense.

And then we get a couple paragraphs of description of the Dursleys, a single sentence about an owl flying past the window, and then things start to get weird.

I personally think starting cold works pretty well here. You want a slow introduction of magic and its rules, because again, infodumps are terrible.
