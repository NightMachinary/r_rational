I would like to say that it feels like you are being aggressive in your comment about reading a lot of books. In response to your question about the quantity of books I have read, I have read a lot books of both the dead-tree and digital. Part of being a writer is reading a lot of all kinds of books and learning what works and what does not when you are doing your own writing. This story just does not have that same quality to it that encourages people, like myself, to read it.
