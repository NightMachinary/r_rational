Weird. It did go through a lot of testing, and the pacing wasn't something I saw anyone complain about. It seemed pretty average to me.

I thought it might be a difference in culture. Dead tree vs being able to pick of an existing set of characters and tropes.

No offense intended. Just trying to figure out whether it was part of the fanfiction culture or not. Probably not a culture thing though.
