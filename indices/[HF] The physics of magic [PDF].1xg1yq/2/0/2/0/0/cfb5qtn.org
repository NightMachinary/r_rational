This does not strike me as fanfiction, but an original work. Unless you are telling me that it is fanfiction of something. Fanfiction can cheat a little for establishing a setting, most of the work has already been done by the original author and the fan writer only needs to reference the framing of the work to say, "This is $Harry_Potter_Setting."

A new book with a new setting needs to take some time to write about and set up the world we are in. Starting with something familiar to the expected readers and expanding to the unknown. Something common to most people, like moving away from family to go to collage can be a good starting point but we need to know how much of this is like our own world and how much it is not. The story, I feel, fails at this by making to many assumptions on the part of the reader. It is starting to cold, and we don't have any reference point to latch onto.
