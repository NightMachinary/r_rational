For me in this case, "starts off slow" means I would cut the entire first chapter (second? it just skips to the third chapter). It doesn't do...anything. You could have a chapter that's just about a girl going to a new school, I guess, but in that case it would need a /voice/. The narrator is so bland. I don't really have a sense of her. And so the entire first (second?) chapter is just a totally mundane scene filtered through blandness. It's nothing I would try to save though....
