I suspect the standards for web fiction and dead-tree are very different. I think physics is aiming for dead-tree.

It looks like a reasonable trade-off to me. It's used using a set of tropes that don't mesh very well with a lot of this audience.

It's trying to be rational, but to aim for more mainstream appeal. Not specifically targeting white 30-something IT professionals, which is what most of lesswrong (and presumably this sub) is made up of.

If people can give saga of soul (and its weird-ass formatting) a try, I'd hope they could stick through the first few chapters of this. I was told that hpmor doesn't pick up until like chapter 15 (I don't remember the actual chapter).
