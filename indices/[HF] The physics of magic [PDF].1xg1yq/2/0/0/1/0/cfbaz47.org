Well, I would actually consider HPMOR's major flaw to be the first few chapters specifically because they're weak and tonally off compared to the rest of the book. I'd be really curious to see the traffic stats for HPMOR to see what kind of a drop-off it's getting. Of course, word-of-mouth is the God of marketing, so if you can get that going you don't have to worry about a slow opening.

You're right that dead trees and web fiction have different standards, but I'd actually argue that it's /more/ important in the dead-trees world. Either you're talking about someone picking up a book in a bookstore and reading the first few pages before deciding whether to buy it, or you're talking about someone reading the first few sample pages on Amazon before deciding whether to buy it. In both cases, there's an extra barrier that's not there in web fiction. If you want to listen to real, actual professional writers talk about how important beginnings are, [[http://www.writingexcuses.com/2008/03/02/writing-excuses-episode-4-beginnings/][listen to this 15 minute episode of Writing Excuses]].

And like I said, it's not /that/ big of a problem here (as I'm still reading). I'm just arguing /in general/ that beginnings have to carry a whole lot of weight. They're the pitch that you're giving the reader that says "this is what you will be reading". Word of mouth can make up for a poor beginning, but it's hard to get word of mouth in the first place if the recommenders aren't going to bite.
