Worm also has a weak opening. I haven't been able to get into it as a result. I wouldn't have even been able to get into HPMOR if I had thought it was going to be an actual story rather than a series of thinly veiled cute and funny lessons on rationality and science. What is it about amateur fiction and bad openings? I've struggled with this myself....
