Having had a very small hand in going through the slush pile at a small publishing company, and a degree in English - the first sentence/paragraph/chapter is the most important one in the entire novel. If you look at readership statistics of pretty much /anything/ people are far, far more likely to drop off at the very first part than at any other part. [[http://i.imgur.com/8nYEkJR.png][Here's a traffic breakdown by chapter]] for the last nine days of a novella-length fanfic that I wrote. That very first chapter is where people decide whether they want to read it or not. You can see similar stats if you look at any of the traffic stats that Wildbow has posted for Worm. The first sentence/paragraph/chapter of a book is /absolutely/ the most important, because that's where people will decide whether they're going to keep going.

Now with that said, I don't actually think that it's as big of a problem here. For me, the part where I actually got interested was halfway down the page - the idea of a medieval person going to university in modern clothing is intriguing and makes me want to know more. If I were editing, I might move that part up to the beginning, then describe the room in contrast with home, /then/ have a conversation with mother and father ... but that's based solely on what I find interesting and what grabs me and says "this is worth continued reading".
