A sparkler is a type of hand-held firework that burns slowly while emitting colored flames, sparks, and other effects. In the United Kingdom, a sparkler is often used by children at bonfire and fireworks displays on Guy Fawkes Night, the fifth of November, and in the United States on Independence Day. They are called Phool Jhadi in India and are popular during the Diwali festival.
