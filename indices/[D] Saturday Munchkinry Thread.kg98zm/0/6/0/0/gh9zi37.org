Thank you I never knew that! :) perhaps for the farming and agriculture i will use nuts and tree seeds instead such as apple and pecan, I don't know about apple seeds but I think pecan nuts are edible? Also using trees will probably result in consistent yields of food without having to spend all your time and effort looking after them considering trees can pretty much take care of themselves and even replant more of themselves without your intervention, you can just pick the fruit or nuts (think if it's a pecan tree you'd shake it instead) when they're ready! :D

Because of your username I imagined the sunflower seeds in the seedpack saying that to make themselves less appealing like “please don't eat me! I don't taste good, you might suffer from fecal impaction and...” or being extremely helpful, maybe as a sort of hunger driven delusion made by the mind to prevent the hungry human from eating something dangerous even if they're really hungry haha :)
