The liquids you suggested are a bit problematic, since all of them would require FDA approval to allow you to sell them. Additionally, the most profitable one there is scorpion venom at about $10,300/mL, but it might not count as being "sufficiently common". Aside from that though, insulin goes for about $32/mL, horseshoe crab blood at about $16/mL, and human blood at about $1/mL.

A better alternative, if it counts, might be molten gold. That wouldn't require FDA approval and could sell for about $400/mL.
