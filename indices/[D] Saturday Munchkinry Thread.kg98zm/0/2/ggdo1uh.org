*Real world*

I'm thinking finding an expensive liquid (scorpion venom, insulin, human blood, Horshoe crab blood, etc), put it in a common mass produced container of some kind that comes with a faucet or drip mechanism, like one of those water jugs for camping.

Make it as big as possible while I can still lift it once, briefly (spend a few weeks in the gym first for the low hanging fruit gains). Then sit next to it and hold it to constantly produce while I surf, read, play games etc with my other hand.

If I can't get a deal for a large volume; start small and save up the produced liquid for progressively bigger vessels.

*Post apocalypse*

Same as above but water, fuel, antibiotics, insulin, etc. Keep vessels of many sizes around so that I can produce more of whatever valuable liquids are found.
