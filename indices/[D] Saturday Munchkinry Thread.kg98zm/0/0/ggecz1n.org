Scuba diving, being able to stay down /forever/ is far more discontinuously useful than almost any similar area.

You might be able to use a leafblower to create air from nothing, and because the supply is the entire atmosphere the 1.5% thing is still a lot of air.

Either of these are especially useful on a spaceship.
