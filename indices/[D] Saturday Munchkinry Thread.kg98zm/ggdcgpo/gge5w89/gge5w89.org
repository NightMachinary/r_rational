You can materialize 99% pure iron, up to 100 kg of it, in any structure you can visualize the entirety of it in. It could be a monomolecular string 1000 km long, or a solid block. You can only go to the limit of materializing singular iron molecules, no smaller. You can only materialize 99% pure, inert iron. No isotopes, or allotropes, or alloys. Once you hit your quota of 100 kg, you must wait 24 hours before you can use your power again.

The materialization happens in a radius of 25m, with the structure happening much like a 3d printer (layer by layer), but at a much higher speed. For example, you can materialize a single block of 100kg of iron in 1 second. More intricate/smaller objects take longer depending on how much concentration and mental acuity you need to visualize it. A woven blanket of monomolecular iron strings would take days of concentration. You can't materialize things inside people, or inside of buildings or objects that you can't see into. You can only materialize stationary things, and once your materializations are in the real world they are acted upon by real world physics.
