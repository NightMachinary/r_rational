  My initial thought was to use the iron as a space-launch system using its potential energy but unfortunately even assuming total conversion of its potential energy and perfect storage of same, it's about one month per kilogram launched

I mean, even if the math had checked out, ground launch still has a ton of issues, most notably air resistance. If you want to do space related stuff, your best bet is to bootstrap your way to getting yourself into orbit via existing companies, then use the power for space construction. Being able to materialize a hundred kg into orbit for free would be absolutely massive when it comes to creating megastructures in space.

There's some catches: Weight still matters when it comes to moving anywhere, albeit far less than when you're launching. Plus, I'm not sure how useful pure iron even is for a pressurized container, and alloying it in orbit is still prohibitive.

But in theory, getting hundreds of free kgs worth of shaped iron should help boost the commercialization of space. Things like stations or oversized ships should be easier if the shell gets into orbit for nearly free.
