I would assume that a hollow cube of iron would take what, 10 seconds? I could produce a mountain of cubes the size of NYC during a single trip to ISS.

For defense:

- iron sheet walls

- iron cubes with crossbow slits

- fuckton of simple helmets, and breatplates

for economy:

- iron hulled boats (would have to be painted extensively to rpevent rust)

- countless buckets, cauldrons and barrels.

- a railway for horse drawn wagons

- sheet metal sheds for storage
