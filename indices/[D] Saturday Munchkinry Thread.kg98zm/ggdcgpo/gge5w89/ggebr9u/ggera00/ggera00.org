Dust isn't very complicated but it's very small. You wouldn't be able to make an explosion of iron dust but you'd maybe be able to materialize enough per second to make a slight fog. Still very flammable, and explosive.

Technically, you could use up your concentration to build straight up machines one part at a time. Like building a gun one part at a time, or a lathe. Of course, you'd need to pick mechanisms that work with the strengths of pure iron.
