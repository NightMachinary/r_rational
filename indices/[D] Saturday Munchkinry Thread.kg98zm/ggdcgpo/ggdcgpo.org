You can continuously renew the supply of any handheld common item that is meant to be used continuously and steadily: a roll of duct tape, a can of spray paint, a spool of wire, a ball of yarn, etc.

A few limitations:

- The supply isn't inexhaustible, it renews only as used and has a maximum rate of renewal of about 1.5% a second. You are unlikely to exhaust a big ball of yarn, but a small bundle of rope might be used up (counting as used as it comes unbundled) faster than your power renews it.

- The item must be sufficiently common, a custom ordered canister of Gold spray paint won't work with the power. A limited mass production run might if it is made in sufficient quantity.

- It must be sufficiently continuous and contiguous. A pitcher of water poured out wouldn't work with this power, but a jug with a good nozzle might and with a miniature pump setup that makes the water flow steady and continuous definitely would.

- The item must be held to use this power. The item must be small enough that you can lift it without mechanical assistance.

So munchkin ideas for

- the real world

- a post apocalyptic setting

- street tier superheroes
