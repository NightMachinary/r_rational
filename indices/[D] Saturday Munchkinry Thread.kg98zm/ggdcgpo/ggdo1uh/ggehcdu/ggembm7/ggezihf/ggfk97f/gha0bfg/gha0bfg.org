Okam's razor in all its glory! :)

Speaking of razors, could you used an item like a razor to constantly produce more hair for clothing and blankets and stuff for the apocalypse scenario? Or a hoover to suck up something rare like gold chunks or powder or something and then slowly empty the hoover to produce a renewable supply of things which are rare since they're using a common item?
