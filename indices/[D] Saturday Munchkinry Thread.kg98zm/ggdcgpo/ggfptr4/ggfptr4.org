Small usages of the power, never run out of lighter fluid. Has been smoking the same cigarette since 1987. Never runs out of alcohol in a hip flask. Never runs out of toothpaste in tube. Never runs out of shampoo, conditioner, hand soap, bleach, or any kind or common consumable. Never runs out of coolant, or antifreeze, and never has to re fill on oil. Never runs out of propane when grilling. Never runs out of spices, or condiments. Never runs out of chewing tobacco. Only bought licorice once.
