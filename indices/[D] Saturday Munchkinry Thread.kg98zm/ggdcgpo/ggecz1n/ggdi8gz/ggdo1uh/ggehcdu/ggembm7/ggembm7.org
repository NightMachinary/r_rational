I was thinking I would be working with an established medical company.

I considered gold, but I thought it would be problematic to pass off the device that maintains gold at a liquid state and drips it out at 1,5% per second as a "common handheld item".

The containers in my medical examples would be simple, off the shelf products. Just the contents would be special.
