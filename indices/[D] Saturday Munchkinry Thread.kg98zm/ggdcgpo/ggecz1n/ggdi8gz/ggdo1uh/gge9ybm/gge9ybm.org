Do electronics count? If I hold an iPhone in my hand, it is continuously and steadily consuming electricity, at a rate of less than 1.5% per second. It is extremely common, and the power is drained continuously and contiguously. And I can hold it in my hand.

So would this mean any common handheld electronic will never ever run out of power as long as I hold it? For that matter, a laptop isn't too difficult to hold with one hand. Can I recharge one from 0% to 100% power just by holding it for slightly over a minute? Do I even need to hold it, or can my power reach any handheld item even if I am not holding it?

What about "digital" money? For example, phones have balances (or minutes) that are continuously drained as you make calls. If you hold your phone, does this balance renew?
