For the real world I would use one of those money guns and continuously shoot money out of it to effectively print money (or would the process of taking out the fake money and filling the toy with real money count as the object being used up? Could you refill an empty can of spray paint with a different colour of paint and have the power work to restore it? If so would it restore the new or old colour).

You could use a tube of icing like the ones in a bakery to create a constant supply of high concentration sugar which can be used to flavour lackluster apocalypse food, salt shakers can be used to create much needed electrolytes and smoothies and juices can be drunk continuously to regain much needed vitamins which might be useful in an apocalypse where fruit is hard to come by, sunflower oil can be continuously poured out and stored in glass bottles to be used in Molotov cocktails and a pack of seeds could be used to cover huge swathes of land in seeds which is especially useful for people who haven't gardened before since now they have an infinite supply of seeds to test on or they can just eat the seeds continuously if it goes that poorly. I'm not sure if things go off when using this power so I don't know if you can just continuously pour out fruit juice or if after a few days nasty, chunky, expired juice comes out? If it replaces the old stuff with new stuff is that fresh and sustainable forever? E.g. pouring out milk all day into other containers, pouring the milk from those containers into containers, are these most recent containers of milk full of fresh milk or 2 day old milk? If it's the former you could have infinite luxury so long as you manage the goods correctly but if it's the latter I think you might be in trouble, of course the off stuff has uses too so the power is still useful e.g. as fertiliser for the gardening projects mentioned above with the pack of seeds.
