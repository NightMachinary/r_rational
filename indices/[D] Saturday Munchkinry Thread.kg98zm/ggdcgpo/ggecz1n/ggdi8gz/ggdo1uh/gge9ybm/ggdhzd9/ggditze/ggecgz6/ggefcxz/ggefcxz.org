There has to be something of it left. For example with a candle at least some wax would need to be left for the wax to be renewed. Although with ordinary usage of the candle, starting from a complete state, the power would renew both wax and wick and the candle wouldn't run out as longer as it burned slower than a rate of 1.5% per second.

Restoring an almost used up candle is tricky. The item needs to be in use for the power to activate and renew it, so you would need a way of slowing the burning rate of an almost used up candle to restore it... as long as the remaining candle would take longer than 94 seconds to be used up with your power and had both a little wax and wick left the power would eventually restore it as it burned.

For the sparkler, rig it up so a small portion of it won't burn properly, use it, the retrieve the unburned portion and burn it slowly? I haven't used a sparkler in a while so I'm not sure that would work.
