1.5% per second of the total unused supply. So for a 100 m long ball of twine you could unspool 1.5 m (150 cm) per second and not exhaust the supply. Whereas for a 1 m length, you could only unspool 1.5 cm per second. If you exceed these limits you will be using your supply faster than you are replenishing it.
