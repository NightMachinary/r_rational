Can you renew something after it is completely depleted?

For example, a wax candle would continuously use up it's wax, until all that remains is the wick. Can you then pick up the wick and renew it to get a candle back?

What about a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkler][Sparkler]]? Can you pick up burnt out sparklers and renew them?

Because for a post apocalyptic scenario, renewing sparklers would let you make lots of renewable sparkler bombs. (Note: This is illegal, do not attempt to make unless in a lawless post apocalyptic scenario.)
