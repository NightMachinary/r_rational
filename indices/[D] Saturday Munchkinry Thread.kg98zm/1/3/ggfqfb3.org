Try putting iron in a ship's spine. Or on a ship's sails. Or in counterweights for things like portcullises and drawbridges. You could also put iron in swords to throw their balances off and to make them weaker. You could also put a very fine coat on wooden or hide shields . You could also put them in sling bullets.
