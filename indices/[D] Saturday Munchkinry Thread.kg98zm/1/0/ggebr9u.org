How quickly can I visualize iron dust?\\
It's dust, so the shape doesn't matter and can be whatever is easiest to visualize.

If you can do so very quickly, you can materialize a cloud of iron dust around your opponent, then set it on fire.

If not so quickly, you can materialize tiny invisible amounts of iron dust in an enemy's mouth whenever you see them open it, slowly poisoning them to death.
