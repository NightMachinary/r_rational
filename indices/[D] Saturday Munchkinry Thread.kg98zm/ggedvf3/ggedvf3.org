An enemy combatant can prevent combustion in an 2000 ft radius around themself.

- This will prevent guns from firing, as the gunpowder will fail to ignite.
- Grenades will fail to explode, and fires cannot burn.
- Engines will fail to start, and will stall upon entering this area.

To make matters worse, the enemy is in an urban environment and has unpowered minions armed with melee weapons.

Assuming you have access to conventional military weapons, but nothing supernatural, how would you defeat the enemy?

(Aside from firing a sniper rifle from outside the 2000 ft range.)
