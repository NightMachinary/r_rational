Combustion reactions transform carbon compounds into CO2 and water. The most important part of cellular metabolism, the oxidation of acetyl-coA to transform NAD+ into NADH, is technically a partial combustion reaction. Stopping that starves all eukaryotic cells out on its own.

The problem with powers like this is that biology in general "uses every trick in the book," as it were. Dimwitted theists convinced that the fine-tuning argument is proof of God wouldn't be so convinced if that didn't look so true from a na√Øve perspective. But they're looking at it all wrong. Those tricks weren't designed with us in mind, we developed to take advantage of them because they exist. Reality looks tailor-made for us only because we sometimes fail to take the outside view and recognize that we are, instead, tailored to fit perfectly within it.

So you can't really fuck with chemistry or physics too hard without also destroying the assumptions which allow us to function. You could do some kind of Manton Limit to fix this, but that will always be an artificial hack. There is no part of the fundaments of physics you can mess with without messing with creatures built to function under that physics.
