Many police departments are equipped with paintball guns which are powered by air pressure along with mace cannisters. Riot police even have substantial armor, tear gas, and gasmasks.

To win, load pepperballs, full rubber balls, or even frozen paintballs in a pinch, and then your average suburbia PD could simply hose fire untill the enemy is in too much pain/can't breathe. The riot squad can also be equipped with paintball guns, along with mace and stun battons. To move around, they could use police horses, bikes, or requisition Tesla's (or other EV's) to close in. Unless the mooks are well prepared (gas masks) this wouldn't be too difficult.
