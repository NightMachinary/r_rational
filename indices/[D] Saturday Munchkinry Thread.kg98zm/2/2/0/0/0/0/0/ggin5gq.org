Unfortunately, I don't know enough about cellular biology to know the temperature of combustion reactions at a cellular level.

Or really, if a temperature-limit actually makes sense in the context of combustion in general. I'll have to read up more on the chemistry involved.

I also considered only affecting the composition of certain chemicals, or preventing the chain reaction that sets of the rest of the gunpowder.

Perhaps reducing the expansion that matter undergoes when it increases in temperature? So the expansion of heated air wouldn't take place and propel the bullet. But again, it'd have to only apply to temperatures above that of the human body, and I still don't know cellular biology well enough to say if that kills a person or not.
