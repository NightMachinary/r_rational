Low level virtues often round out the skill or make it more usable. So the low level virtues would allow you to bypass limitations like chafing, lack of arousal, etc.

I think one key thematic element of masturbation is self reliance and self dependence. Various mid-level virtue might allow masturbation to replace some combination of sleep, food, social interaction, and/or water.

The capstone virtue would be something outright broken. Another element of masturbation is the self care aspect. So maybe for a capstone masturbation is able restore all the various magical energy pools used by other powers such as blood for blood magic, your own bones if used for bone magic, emotions for passion magic, mental energy for gem magic, breath for vibration magic, whatever it is Locus use (oh a way to help the Locus expand), etc. Outside of the WtC magic system... maybe whatever magic resource analogs exist in this skill system: mana, magic energy, mental focus, creativity, willpower, stamina, etc.

For other virtues, maybe a grip strength for guys and a dexterous touch or penetrating touch for women? Or just lump all three together into one or two virtues.

For the combo virtue with sign language maybe a way of communicating and articulating your conscious and subconscious thoughts perfectly to yourself by touching yourself. With handjobs added as well, a way of perfectly communicating to other people through touch.
