If masturbation were a skill that one can level up in a system a la Worth the Candle, what virtues would it give? Most interestingly, what would be the reality breaking level 100 virtue? Would there be combo virtues, and what would the linked skills be? E.g.: masturbation, handjobs and sign language, what would be the combo virtue for that?
