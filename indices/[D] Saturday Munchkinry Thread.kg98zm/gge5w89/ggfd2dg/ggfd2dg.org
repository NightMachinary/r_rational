Caltrops would be a decent compromise in conflict, I imagine. The basic structure is relatively simple, and being able to create them on command could do well due to people not expecting it, being able to sneak past metal detectors, and so on.

The metal detector thing is actually pretty interesting. If you were determined, you could materialise knives on an aeroplane to perform heinous activities, maybe even a simple crossbow and bolt if you bring a piece of rope and know what you're doing. Though honestly I'm not sure how useful that would be since that's not, you know, my line of work.

Industrial sabotage, perhaps? All you have to do is get inside a factory and you can pretty untraceably put a literal wrench in machinery, or contaminate food and chemical products to lower reputations. It's not like anyone's gonna call you out on it if they see you staring at the materialising chunk of iron - you could even hit them with a 'is that suppose to be there?'

Human reaction time is about 200ms, or a fifth of a second. I think it's reasonable to presume you could create iron weights above a person's head that drop down an kill them faster than they can react, especially if the process is quiet. Surprise would help here, of course. I'm not sure what mass/height ratio would be optimal, but I think the optimum would be lethal at a glance.

You could probably make decent art, being that manual dexterity is less of a limitation. Literally, create anything you can imagine! Sculptures are the obvious usage, but you could probably create a series of iron lines on a pale coloured wooden surface, take a picture, and turn that into some decent digital line art. And that's ignoring the novelty of having supernaturally created art in the first place.

You could make people stumble by creating small objects in front of or below their steps, which could be funny. Potentially useful. Mostly funny.

In combat you could perhaps create iron blindfolds? In the time it takes to remove the initial blockage to sight you could create one bound tightly enough that it would a struggle to take off. That one's maybe more useful in the fantasy setting.

Last but not least, create razors in food you're about to eat and then sue the restaurant you're eating at. Though that one's contingent on you being an asshole, and it'll likely only work once. Come to think of it, a lot of these are contingent on being an asshole. Oh well!
