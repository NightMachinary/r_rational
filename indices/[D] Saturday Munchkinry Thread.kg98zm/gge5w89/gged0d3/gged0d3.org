1kg into low earth orbit is a minimum of 32 MJ or 32,000,000J.

100kg at the top of a 400m building is 392,000 J. 100kg at the top of an 850m building is 833,000.

My initial thought was to use the iron as a space-launch system using its potential energy but unfortunately even assuming total conversion of its potential energy and perfect storage of same, it's about one month per kilogram launched, and 1kg into LEO is only worth like a few grand.

Damn. There goes my brilliant plan.
