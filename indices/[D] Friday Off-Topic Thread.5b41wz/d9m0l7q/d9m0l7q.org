Just built my first computer. Was really worried when I tried to turn it on and I didn't get a video signal, but after an hour of troubleshooting I discovered the problem was I hadn't been nearly forceful enough when installing the ram. Really gotta jam that stuff in there. Anyway, first post on my new desktop!
