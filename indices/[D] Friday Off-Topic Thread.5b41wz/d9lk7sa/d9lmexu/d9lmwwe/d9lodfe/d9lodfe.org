Yeah, it's not great. And so far as I know, there's no way to export your entire comment history unless you want to run a BigQuery against the entire database of reddit comments. I get why they limit it, but it seems like one of those features that would be ripe for adding to reddit gold. (So far as I know, the user pages use dynamic parameters for generation, which means that Google wouldn't really help you anyway.)
