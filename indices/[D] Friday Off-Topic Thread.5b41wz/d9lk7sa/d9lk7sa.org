If anyone's interested, the (anonymized) participation logs for [[https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/425w1n/d_friday_offtopic_thread/cz7ssa8/]["Friendship"]] Six (containing over 1300 questions that were exchanged between February 2015 and June 2016 [though not their answers], as well as the numbers underlying the graphs shown in the comment linked above) are available [[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/vncl028gdoqc8ld/AAA4TZwrK7yDhifDVmzM6-Z9a?dl=0][here]]. (Having been converted from Google Sheets to .xlsx format, these files seem to be somewhat glitchy, as they caused my copy of Excel to crash several times while I was anonymizing them.)

It seems, by the way, that even Google isn't perfect in searching Reddit. In order to find the first link of the previous paragraph, I had to sift through [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/fridayofftopic][the list of Off-Topic threads]] /manually,/ because a search for =toakraka friendship spiel site:www.reddit.com/r/rational= turned up /literally nothing./ (Needless to say, Reddit's built-in search function didn't work, either.) Likewise, I had to check [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/mondaygeneralrationality][a zillion General Rationality threads]] in order to dig up [[https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/48akta/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/d0ii4d6/?context=1][this favorite comment of mine]], because a search for =toakraka animator slave site:www.reddit.com/r/rational= didn't find it. Sigh... Well, I'm glad that [[http://i.imgur.com/LOThjpU.png][I came up with the idea to create and maintain those lists in the first place]].
