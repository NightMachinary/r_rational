Right.

  ... and a consequence of that is that the reader can solve the story prior to the solution being displayed in the text.

I disagree. Say a character has been established as an excellent diplomat, and there's a conflict with another nation. The obvious answer to the conflict is to send the diplomat and spend time showing how the diplomat solves the conflict.

Told straight, the conflict arises, they send the diplomat to a diplomatic convention, and we watch them as they wield diplomacy to their faction's ends.

Told as a puzzle, the diplomat explains the issues, describes the players (other diplomats) and what the diplomat thinks they want, and lays out what resources the diplomat has with which to bargain and deal.

Both options embrace the fundamental truth-seeking and thoughtfulness that's expected of rationalist fiction; they just do it differently.

--------------

In the first scenario, if we have yet to see inside the mind of that diplomat, then there are things we reasonably won't know. The diplomat will probably give us an overview before they talk to someone as a review, but they might also go straight into dealing in diplomacy, gradually revealing to the reader their approach as they do it. The latter isn't a puzzle; the reader may be familiar with the resources of their faction and thus able to guess what incentives to deal the diplomat can offer, but has no way of knowing exactly how the diplomat will respond to novel information. Further, if the diplomat is given free reign to promise whatever they like, no matter how outrageous, then the reader won't be able to guess what the diplomat will say in a conversation unless it's something like:

- "There's Duke Gaspard. He loves ponies."

- Reader stops reading and thinks for a few minutes.

- "'Hello, Duke Gaspard! We need you to ally with us for just a season-long campaign. Just monster-slaying. If you do, we promise to turn you into the largest pony to ever live - greater than even the moon to a cave-child's eye!'"

Even then, I don't foresee a reader guessing that solution.

If the story must be puzzle-like, then the author is forced to go with the second option, where "the diplomat explains the issues, describes the players (other diplomats) and what the diplomat thinks they want, and lays out what resources the diplomat has with which to bargain and deal."

It's one solution, but it's not the only solution, and I don't understand why all works of rationalist fiction must abide by the stipulation that they must be puzzle-like, so long as resources or information aren't pulled out of thin air.

--------------

If someone is the ruler of an alternate universe's country, and a new conflict arises that inspires the ruler to ask, "Do we have people who specialize in this sort of thing?" and the answer is yes, then the reader wasn't aware of the information specifically but could still have deduced "delegate to specialists" as an honest means a ruler of a country would use to solve a novel conflict.

Another example: a character is well connected. A new conflict comes to their attention. The character goes to a heretofore unmentioned contact in order to solve or seek help in solving the the conflict. A reader couldn't puzzle that out except in the broadest sense, but the character is still acting rationally according to their characterization.

--------------

Perhaps I'm quibbling. The distinction is fine, but I think it's important that a subgenre-defining rule be as specific and hew as closely to its intent as possible.

I'm not sure if I'm being clear.

Say the conflict is opening a mechanical apple by a student at magitech academy.

*Puzzle:*

- 1) Learn (components). 2) Think (how they fit together). 3) Apply (solutions).

*Other approach I:*

- 1) Think (about mechanical apples). 2) Learn and apply at the same time (e.g. ask the academy's resident klepto if they know anything about mechanical apples, then follow them to a thief's guild meeting hoping someone will open it for you).

*Other approach II:*

- 1) Think (about immediate solutions). 2) Apply (e.g. place a reward for the apple's opening and wait; offer to grade a Professor's homework for lower classes if they open it for you; run odd words in the speech of the person who gave you the apple through some cryptographic algorithms).

*Other approach III:*

- 1) Apply (solve it during the same interaction you receive it by noticing hints on the device itself, and relating each hint back to classes previously covered in the story; e.g. where Leaf in the Wind means freedom from gravity: "A leaf? Maybe..." He lightly tossed it straight up, and at the zenith of its arc, the leaf lit and opened a third of the apple.)

Apologies for the lack of concision. Hopefully I've at least made my argument clear.
