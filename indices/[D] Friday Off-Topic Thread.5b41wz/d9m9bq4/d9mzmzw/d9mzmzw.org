I believe the intent of the rule is that protagonists don't solve conflicts using information or resources that aren't available to the reader, and a consequence of that is that the reader can solve the story prior to the solution being displayed in the text.

If the protagonist is displaying heretofore unknown skills and/or equipment, that's not just bad storytelling, it's breaking the fundamental truth-seeking and thoughtfulness that's expected of rationalist fiction.
