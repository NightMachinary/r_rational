Unfortunately not. I'm still not sure what the intent is. I understand more what it's likely to be, but not enough to give a concise rule. I'd like very much to think of one myself and put it to a vote; since I can't put my finger on the right wording, I'm trying to first convince people the rule needs clarifying, in the hopes that a solution arises.

The best I have so far is from my reply to Walesy in this thread chain, "Characters do not pull information and resources out of thin air," which itself is also too vague.
