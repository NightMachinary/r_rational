Why must rationalist fiction be like a puzzle? Doesn't that shunt all rationalist stories into the mystery genre?

Complications arise unexpectedly in life all the time. It seems arbitrarily restrictive to drop hints to the protagonist and readers where realistically there would be none.

Let's leave aside the issue of foreshadowing being good writing, as that's a prescriptivist rule of writing which shouldn't have any bearing on the defining elements of a work of the rationalist subgenre.
