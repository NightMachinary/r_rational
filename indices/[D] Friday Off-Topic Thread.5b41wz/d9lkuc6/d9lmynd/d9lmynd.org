I only watched the pilot for Timeless and found it just okay. The underwhelming tv show I want to see rational fic for is The Librarians. That was a series that had a ton of imagination and occasional moments of brilliance, but could've been so much better. As is, it's just a goofier Warehouse 13 with less entertaining characters.
