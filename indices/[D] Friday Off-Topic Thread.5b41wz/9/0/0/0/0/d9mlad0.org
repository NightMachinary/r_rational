  utilities
#+end_quote

Alright, well that's a pretty simple one. We're getting a lot better at distributed utilities. We're not quite at the level where small-scale alternative energy can do everything we need to, but it's more then doable if you're frugal with using energy and can burn some sort of fuel for heat. For personal use if not industrial.

I'm not going to bother even including that on the list, since there are already plenty of commercial, workable, less-convenient, options on the market.

Everybody else uses the FDA, so I don't think it's a big problem if we use it as well. Of course being able to bypass it has some big advantages as well, right now it's enforced.

That's a pretty big one. Any ideas?

  legal recourse to crimes
#+end_quote

I feel like there are policy options we could take that would provide some-recourse. Pretending that we're seasteaders, simply denying them access to resources like marinas and resupply points would be good recourse for financial crimes and the like. If we were a "bayesian-conspiracy" job site, likewise.

If we're providing a legitimate service, then cutting them off from that service provides some manner of recourse.

Duel citizinship, or even just us being a loose unrecognized coalition, does similar.

I'm not positing that the US is going to collapse or anything, just that I know a lot of people who'd rather live somewhere saner.

--------------

But I feel like those are some of the least interesting problems you could have come up with. Here are some ones that I personally find more interesting, that you might have some ideas on.

- Access to community (meeting new people, etc)

- Postal Service

- Face to Face meetings with the people who employ you

- Civic centers that make it much easier to find gainful employment

- Mortgages (for both properties and industrial equipment)

- land equity

Try suggesting some solutions, to some of the problems. We don't have to get it all, but there are some low-handing fruit there. Maybe start with postal service? What would we need to create to make a reasonable alternative to the postal service?
