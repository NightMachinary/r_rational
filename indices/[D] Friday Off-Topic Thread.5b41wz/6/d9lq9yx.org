I'm looking for some beta readers to give me critique and advice on a paper I'm writing. Looking specifically for things I can include or miss. In the paper I'm proposing a system for objectively quantifying aspects of games. The paper is not ready for public consumption, so I'm hoping for volunteers I can rely on.

Note, I'm not trying to answer is "Is this objectively good?" but I am trying answer questions such as "Is this game playable the way it was designed to be played?" among other things, such as, "objectively, what is the average FPS of game X given Y specifications?"
