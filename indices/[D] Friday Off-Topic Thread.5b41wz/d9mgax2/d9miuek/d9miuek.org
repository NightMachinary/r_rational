Have you checked out Sealand? [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Sealand]]

I think the main criteria they're missing is: "people and other countries recognize it as a country"

You can't have businesses go to your place to avoid taxes unless the countries in which they do business allow them to do so. You can't have embassies or diplomats unless other countries allow you to. You can't gather global support to help defend you against invasion unless the world perceives action against you as an actual invasion and decides to help.

And it matters whether the people in the land you control perceive you as a government and obey your laws. If the whole world decided and agreed that North Korea isn't a real country, it would still keep doing what it's doing internally and not much would change (unless we decided to take action as a result of their new definition).

Having things like farms, citizens, banks etc might shift public perception in your favor, but I think they're more of things that a country probably wants to have, rather than strict necessities.
