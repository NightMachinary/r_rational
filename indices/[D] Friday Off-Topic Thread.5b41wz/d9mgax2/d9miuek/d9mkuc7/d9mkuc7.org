At least give me the credit of assuming I've read the basic literature on the subject ;p

This is more or less why I'm asking this question, to figure out what we need.

As to the why, that should be pretty obviously. The US isn't doing so well, and most of the people in the rationalist diaspora live in the US, excluding myself. How do we provide an alternative franchise? It's a question I think we should each think about for at least 5 minutes.

What roles does the US fill, what are it's most useful facets, and how can we provide them ourselves without relying on the US?

Ideally, once we've identified those roles, we'd take gradual steps towards creating an organization that fullfills them.

I think embassies, passports, and recognition as a country /could/ be pretty low priority, depending on the strategy we use. A distributed republic, a seamount, A loose collection of social-media tools, a bank. None of those require recognition as a country.

I have given some thought to identity services as a fundamental export, verification of some sort of digital "citizen". It would solve a lot of problems in smart contracts if you could rely on unique user votes.

So let me phrase this question a bit differently. What essential services does the US (not the government, but the system) provide for you, and what are our options for bypassing them?
