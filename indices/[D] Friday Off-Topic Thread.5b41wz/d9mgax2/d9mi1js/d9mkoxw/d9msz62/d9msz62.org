  (also, those two sentences seem pretty unrelated. I'm not sure how your particular definition of nation implies that we shouldn't? Or is it a non-sequiter? If so, it should probably be in a different paragraph.)

It's more that in nationalist theory, nations are considered organic, pre-theoretical entities that either actually exist or actually don't. /Creating/ a nation where one does /not/ previously exist usually involves becoming a dictator and welding people together through economic, cultural, linguistic, and educational integration (by force if necessary).
