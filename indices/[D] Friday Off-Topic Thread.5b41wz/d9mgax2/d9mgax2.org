So, how can we found our own nation? What does a nation need, to consolidate enough power to matter?

Let's think about the problem space for a bit, because I know I'm not prepared to even think about planning.

- A place for people to live?

  - What about a distributed republic? A "country" that owns no land?
  - Boats?

- Our own banks, and control over what kind of companies get investments? Who gets loans?

  - I don't know if we can invest in companies that we like and be competitive. But my bank is offering free ipads with new accounts, so I suspect the efficient market hypothesis isn't in play and that they don't have the consumers best interest. If they have enough market power to be as inefficient as they are...

- What are our countries key exports? I presume we're not growing grain ourselves, so we're going to need to buy some.
- Etc, et al.
