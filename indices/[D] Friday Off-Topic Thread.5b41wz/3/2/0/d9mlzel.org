Again, I agree, but lack of ~ ex machinae is a different rule than the story must be a puzzle.

Also, that's arguing for foreshadowing being good writing, which isn't what I'm disputing. I'm disputing the requirement that all rationalist stories be a puzzle, for it's overly restrictive if the intent is really, "The story does not utilize ~ ex machina plot devices."

Take, for example, a story about elves. The protagonist is on a stroll through the forest contemplating how they might beat their political and social rival when they witness humans prospecting.

If the protagonist was hyper-focused on their clan struggles, and you want to shock the reader as well as the protagonist, then one shouldn't foreshadow the humans' appearance. But that's not puzzle-like.

For the above example, if the antagonist knows more magic than the protagonist, then of course they'll steal it. It's the author's job to find a way to make that satisfying. Adding a requirement that all works of the subgenre be puzzles is one author forcing their solution to the problem on all others. Better to have a subgenre-defining rule that reflects the intent than a rule that solves the main problem while introducing unnecessary restrictions and obstacles.

I'm not sure what the full intent is, so I can't write that alternate rule myself. [[/u/EliezerYudkowsky]]'s writing on the subject is intertwined with writing advice. A rule that's also writing advice is prescriptivist and unnecessarily restrictive.
