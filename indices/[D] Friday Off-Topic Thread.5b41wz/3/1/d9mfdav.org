I don't think rationalist fiction requires that /every/ fact or event in the story can be predicted, but the idea is that we don't hide everything from the reader- there is no 'magic moment' in the story that the character magically solves all of their issues in a way the reader couldn't have done, given the facts... There is a small difference, imo, but it's there.
