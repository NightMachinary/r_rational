I think it's a bit of both.

The laws of physics in our universe are uniform, but we can imagine a universe in which they varied from space to space. What we have more a difficult time imagining is a universe in which the laws of mathematics vary from place to place, and I think Lovecraft's universe would be such a place. There are still some aspects of rationality that might be able to translate over, but not many.

Lovecraft's universe wasn't malevolent exactly, but it was viciously indifferent in a way that he anthropomorphically characterized as essentially malevolent. There's normal indifference, what we think indifference is, and then there's Lovecraftian indifference, when our luck runs out and the universe stops being so gentle and shows us that what we thought was a callous, perhaps slightly evil universe was actually incredibly merciful - though no longer.
