My interpretation of Lovecraft was that humanity in particular was limited to functioning within a small subset of rationality/science, and that we simply weren't psychologically equipped to peer past the surface of our small pond. As opposed to something like the Tales of MU setting, where the universe intelligently, malevolently, and universally interferes with the experimental method.
