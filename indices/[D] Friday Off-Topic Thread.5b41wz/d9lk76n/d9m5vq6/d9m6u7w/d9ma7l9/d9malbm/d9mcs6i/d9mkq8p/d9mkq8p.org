It's funny. You talk about a group being unwilling to compromise as your justification to be unwilling to compromise with them. Not only that, but you imply disdain for their unwillingness to compromise, and yet consider your own unwillingness without fault.

Let me ask a question. What if you're wrong? Sure, narrow the scope of the group to be limited to people unable to compromise and you can say that they are unwilling to compromise, but when you merely talk about 'the other tribe', there's no /inherent/ quality that makes them unwilling to compromise. What if, now that you've dismissed them all as uncompromising, and thus refuse to entertain compromising with them, they say the same about you? If we go with what you say, they have every reason to say that our tribe wants their tribe scattered to the winds, and are unwilling to compromise. From that, what else can follow but meaningless hatred between the two tribes, if each tribe sees the other as not worth rational discourse with?

Even if they deserve to be made fun of, however you'd quantify that, making fun of them isn't productive in any way, and is in fact counter to the idea of spreading rationality. The only good it does is make you feel superior on the same primal level they feel superior by retaliating to our closed-minded intolerance. That is, our closed-minded ignorance if we choose to attack and belittle them because it /feels good/.
