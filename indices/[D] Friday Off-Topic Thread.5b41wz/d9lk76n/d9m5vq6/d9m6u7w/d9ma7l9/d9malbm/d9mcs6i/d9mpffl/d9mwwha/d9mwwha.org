  I don't know anything about American Churches, so this is a case of inside view vs outside view.
#+end_quote

Fair enough, I have kind of a personal bias in this case. I was raised Southern Baptist.

- I was shown [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Hovind][Kent Hovind]] videos as a kid and told they were fact. Kent Hovind is a young earth creationist. He believes Evolution is a deliberate lie and the Earth is only 6,000-10,000 years old. His "theories" fail back-of-the-envelope calculations.

- My High School (located in a suburban area of Florida), taught abstinence-only sex education. We were shown pictures of the effects of STDs, and we were told how having sex before major would ruin our ability to bond emotionally with our future spouse. One exercise they used was to give us pieces of tape and then stick the pieces of tape to each other and pull them apart, so that the pieces of tape eventually lost this stickiness. This was supposed to illustrate how pre-marital sex would affect us. There was no discussion of any forms of birth control. There was no discussion of how to get tested for STDs. There was no discussion of what consent means.

- One of my Christian friends from Church in High School shunned another one of my friends upon learning that he was bisexual. My Christian's friend's parents encouraged his decision to shun my bisexual friend. These Christians were in most cases your stereotypical Southern Hospitality sort in terms of their behavior. They were willing to open up their home (their father was a lawyer and made lots of money so they had a big home) to lots of Church youth group events, they volunteered at the church, etc. My Mom tried convincing his Mom that shunning wasn't mature and wasn't Christian behavior, but instead of convincing her, instead his Mom convinced my Mom that their was probably something else wrong or perverted about my bisexual friend just because he was bisexual, and that her son was being justifiably cautious and prudent by avoiding my bisexual friend.

I can give more examples of why this group is so bad. I can understand you wanting to take a neutral stance, particularly if you haven't been exposed to this cultural mindset before.

  American Churches
#+end_quote

This is a mistake. It isn't actually Americans churches in general. It is a specific subculture mostly found in the South, the so called "Bible-Belt". Hence why I used the terms "Evangelical", and "Fundamentalist" repeatedly. American Catholics, for example, will believe evolution is real, believe climate change is real, and may be Democrat or Republican, because they don't view things in terms of a single set of issues. Southern Baptists on the other hand will often make statements indicating that Catholics aren't real Christians, I've heard said at the pulpit of the Church I grew up in that Catholics are pagans (because of their worship of the Saints, which isn't true, but the idea was never corrected from the pulpit). Many non-evangelical denominations have found room for compromise and understanding on issues like gay marriage. So American Churches are not one thing. That said, I think many surveys indicate somewhere between 20% and 50% of Americans believe in young-earth creationism (evolution is a lie, the Earth is only 6,000-10,000 years old) so they do represent a plurality and a leading cultural force, which is thankfully dying off.

  You mentioned above how their leaders are awful but there are maybe university students who identify with their ideas and yet are open to reason, for instance.

Yeah, fair enough. Even if not used as an argument for hypocrisy, I think Trump is a very good argument about keeping religion and politics separate. Also, the younger generation could potentially leave for less toxic forms of Christianity,

Here is a [[http://www.patheos.com/blogs/rolltodisbelieve/][blog]] that I think gives regular really good summaries of different aspects of Fundamentalist Evangelical Christianity. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism_in_the_United_States#Recurrent_themes][Wikipedia article]] for a more neutral starting place. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Hovind][Kent Hovind]] a shining example of a Creationist "Scientist" (his PhD is from a diploma mill).

[[https://answersingenesis.org/][Here is answers in genesis, one of the clearer presentations of Creationism]]. They have like no peer-reviewed journal articles to back up any of their claims, but they have plenty of bible verses and their arguments may sound reasonable to someone with a 5th-graders or even a High Schooler's education in science, especially someone who doesn't understand their peer review and consensus building process behind the current scientific consensus.

Here is [[https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/][the gospel coalition]], a set of blogs by fundamentalists. Spend any time browsing and you will find stuff that will disgust you... Oh look on the main page an [[https://blogs.thegospelcoalition.org/trevinwax/2016/11/02/whats-really-going-on-with-evangelicals-and-same-sex-marriage/][article]] about why compromise on Gay marriage is completely unacceptable! I didn't cherry pick their worst, I simply glanced at their main page. They have an [[https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/being-on-gods-side-a-dozen-recommendations-for-the-religious-right][article]] on their main page about why the Religious involvement in politics is still a good thing, but on the other hand the qualifications they give to this are pretty strongly against Trump and Trump supporters.

  Which is why I always argue

If it is an absolute, I am not going to convince you. That said, for me, there is a threshold. People who argue against the dangers of strong AI, yeah the evidence isn't yet really clear and I can understand that they are arguing in good faith. Heck even MRAs still have good points mixed into the redpill that has claimed the movement. But for Fundamentalist Evangelicals, I claim from personal experience that the movement is too far gone.
