Even-numbered years are national elections. The lower house (House of Representatives, apportioned to the states based on population and coming from a specific electoral district) serve 2-year terms, and the upper house (Senate, each state gets 2, elected by the state at large) serve 6-year terms, no limits on either. So in Presidential election years (years evenly divisible by 4), Americans cast their vote for President, the Representative for their district, and between zero and one Senators depending on how the terms line up (I don't believe any states have synchronized Senate terms). Generally, however, only a few of the Congress seats are actually competitive in a given year.

If I had to guess, Republicans are trying to make the best of a situation where Hillary gets elected by refusing to allow her to enact any of her agenda, thereby protecting themselves from primary challengers (members of the same party competing to be the party nominee for the seat) who might otherwise challenge their commitment to conservative principles, and don't expect to get punished for their obstructionism the next time the general election comes up because, as I mentioned, so few seats are actually competitive. This is basically a more extreme version of what they already did with Obama following the 2010 midterm elections.

tl;dr: shit's fucked, yo
