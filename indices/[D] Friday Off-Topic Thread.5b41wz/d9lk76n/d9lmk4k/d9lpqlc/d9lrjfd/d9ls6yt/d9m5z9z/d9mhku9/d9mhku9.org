  Many Republican politicians are kinda trapped between a rock and a hard place when it comes to winning both primaries and general elections. Over the course of the past decade, basically, there has been a movement amongst some of the Republican electorate to be more aggressive about certain populist issues. This caused big changes, especially in the 2010 congressional election. Several of the blue dogs (conservative Democrats) were ousted in general elections, and many moderate Republicans were ousted in primary elections, and replaced with radical Tea Party Republicans.

You know, while I basically hate the Republican ideology root and branch, I can't help but congratulate the Tea Party guys on their organizing successes. However much it undermined the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Party_System][sixth party system]], they've understood how to make their "party" act like an actual, ideological /political party/ as the rest of the world understands the term.
