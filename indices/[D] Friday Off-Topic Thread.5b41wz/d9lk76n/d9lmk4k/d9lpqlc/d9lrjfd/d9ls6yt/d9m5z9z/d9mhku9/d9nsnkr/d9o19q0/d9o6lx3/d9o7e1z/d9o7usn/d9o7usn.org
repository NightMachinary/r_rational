Pretty uncharitable.

That's not what I said is it? Whoever said anything about /any/ reform ? I merely consider the chances of changing the base problems of this system (and the way groups like the TP interact with it)in a sweeping way to be low, especially in the short term.

The split government is not going away. You're not getting a parliamentary system , you're likely not getting a change of the electoral/voting system without constitutional reform. The ways that groups leverage the system (the SCOTUS impasse and so on) are also deeply baked into the system

Have you /seen/ the requirements for constitutional amendments? In an age where the US is getting more and more polarized (which is itself contributing to the problem)? The US can barely pass healthcare reform...
