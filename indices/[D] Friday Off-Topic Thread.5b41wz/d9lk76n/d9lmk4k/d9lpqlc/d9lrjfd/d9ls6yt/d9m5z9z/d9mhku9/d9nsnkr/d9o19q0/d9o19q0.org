Honestly, I blame that on "the US system". And not to be edgy, but because in the rest of the world, having an actual ideology (that is, beliefs about how society works and policies to make it better) isn't a dirty word. If we /actually/ stuck to the supposed American traditions of "just follow the Constitution, reach across those aisles, and for God's sakes don't have any ideologies" the country would never have actually industrialized.

It's vital for both democracy and modernity in general that the public be able to actually express their changing needs and understandings.
