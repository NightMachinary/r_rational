Well, part of the problem is not just one group having opinions and ideology it's what happens when you have groups like the TP acting in lockstep regardless of the consequences. As the country becomes more and more polarized (and gerrymandered) local reps have less reason to compromise and, because of the split between executive and legislative branches you get more and more situations like the shutdown or the SCOTUS impasse.

At a certain point though, given that the US system is here to stay, people have to work with what they have. There's a way to express your opinion and reach across the aisle to achieve things, Tea Party manicheanism just isn't the right way to work within the system.

The last thing that's needed imo is a plurality of progressive voters wagging the dog in the Democratic coalition in this way as well.

No one wants to hear that some measure of "politeness" and incremental change (cause they feel it's an argument for the status quo) has to be cultivated, but it's better than this alternative. As Obama said in his recent interview: you don't start from scratch. The US will not get another system, so having these groups act in the manner they're acting is dangerous.
