  What is the correct ("rational") way to deal with an information source that does not lie but only tells one side of the story?

Ow, that's a tough one.

Ideally, you want to weigh their opinion against partisans of the "other side" of the story - preferably from people who are roughly as eloquent as your first source, otherwise you're introducing a bias. Most of the time, you'll end up more confused and mostly neutral, which is good because you should /not/ change your opinion after listening to a one-sided source anyway (or only change it slightly).

As Yudkowsky pointed out, this method has a failure mode, especially when applied to politics: you might hear good-sounding arguments for the two sides, and never shift your opinion, even though one side's arguments are much more important/accurate/better than the other. Eg "this candidate will keep the corrupt systems that impoverishes you" vs "that candidate might start a nuclear war".

I don't know any solution to this problem besides "be better informed". Like Professor Quirell said, only harsh experience teaches you that "Kill your problems immediately with a lot of death" is more important than "Avoid making powerful enemies when you don't have to". Otherwise they both sound very convincing.
