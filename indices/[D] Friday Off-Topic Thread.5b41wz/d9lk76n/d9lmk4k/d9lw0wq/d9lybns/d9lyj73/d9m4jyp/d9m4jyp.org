They have every incentive no to comment on the leaks' authenticity. If the Clinton campaign confirmed the leaks as authentic, and Wikileaks managed to convincingly fake a very incriminating leak, then the Clinton campaign would be screwed. They would sound very weak: "We said the other leaks were authentic, but this one is fake, honest!"
