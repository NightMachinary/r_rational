  What is the correct ("rational") way to deal with an information source that does not lie but only tells one side of the story?
#+end_quote

You have to take the all of the information at once, and update based on what you would have expected based on certain situations.

Let's say you figure there's a half chance that there is a car behind door number 1, and a half chance that it is something nearly worthless.

Here are the rules:

1) Door number 1 has one person in front of it. This person, the salesman, tries to get you to pick door number 1 no matter what (by convincing you its a car).

2) They can not lie.

3) They only get one statement to convince you.

The salesman might tell you "Behind door number 1 is an object whose outer body is made mostly of metal."

If this person wasn't a salesman, and was instead just someone spewing out random facts about what was behind the door, that should move your posterior above a half. Why? /Because you would expect someone spewing out random facts to say something that doesn't apply to a car if it wasn't a car."/

But since it is a salesman, you should adjust /downward,/ not upward. Why? /Because you would expect a salesman to say something like "It's a car behind door number 1," if it really was a car./ The fact that they didn't is evidence /against/ it being a car.
