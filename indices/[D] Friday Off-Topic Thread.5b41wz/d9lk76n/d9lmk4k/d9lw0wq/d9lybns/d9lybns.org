  the still ongoing, daily leaks of emails between her highest staff which, arguably, indicate her participation in outright bribery, on top of additional national security concerns. Clinton counters that these leaks are from a cyberattack orchestrated by Russian hackers, not to be trusted

What is the correct ("rational") way to deal with an information source that does not lie but only tells one side of the story?

Like, even if they really were evil Russian hackers or whatever, you can't just refuse to do Bayesian updates because they are not lying (does Clinton deny that the mails are authentic?). But on the other hand we should expect the other side to have awful stuff in their emails as well (maybe more stuff like "You can grab them by the pussy!") and we don't hear about them because they were not hacked.
