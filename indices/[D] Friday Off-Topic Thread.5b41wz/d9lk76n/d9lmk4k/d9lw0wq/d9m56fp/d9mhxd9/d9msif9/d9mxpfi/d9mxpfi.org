  His point as I understand it is that he didn't see anything in the leaks implying unethical collusion with the media, not that unethical collusion with the media is totally okay.

If I had to say exactly what I meant... I think the leaks indicated slightly unethical but not illegal behavior, and compared to Trump and the Republicans that support him, and the fact that Florida is a swing state, I am willing to vote Clinton (have voted as a matter of fact, thanks to mail-in ballots). If not for being in a swing state, the idea of voting third party so that a third-party can get 5% of the vote so we can break up the current system sounds pretty nice.
