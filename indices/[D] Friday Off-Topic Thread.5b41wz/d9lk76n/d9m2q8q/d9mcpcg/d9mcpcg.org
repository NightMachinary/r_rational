  Although I disagreed with their policies, I never doubted they wanted to do the right thing and help America. They weren't the enemy, just the opposition. Trump, though... sheesh, man.

This is now the 4th Presidential election I have paid close attention to. This is said every time, about every Republican candidate, to the point where it is now a cliche. It's possible you're an introspective unicorn (much more likely than average, given what I've seen of you, base modifier for membership in this community, etc). But there's something eyeroll worthy about watching people (who cried "Bushitler!", who declared the selection of Palin as VP the functional equivalent of /treason/, and who savaged Romney as a poor-murdering plutocrat extremist) suddenly realize that they have no room left to escalate their rhetoric against Trump.

Disclosure: I am voting Johnson, but I think Trump's [evil * ability to enact evil] <<< Hillary's [evil * ability to enact evil].

Counterpoint to your final note: In all but the smallest, most local elections, any individual vote is staggeringly unlikely to matter. I believe that the best justification for spending the time to do so is to enable the right to complain afterwards. If this is not an important factor to you personally, then remember to vote IFF there is nothing you could be doing with your time that would be more useful to anyone.
