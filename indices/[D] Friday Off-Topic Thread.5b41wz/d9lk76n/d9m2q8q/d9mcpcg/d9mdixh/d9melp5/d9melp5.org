If you don't believe you're qualified to pick the person who runs the country, is it still your civic duty?

Personally I think anyone who is truly undecided should just stay home rather than cast a vote without being fully committed to the decision.

I'm not saying a person has to perfectly sure that they're making the right choice in a candidate (or on any other issue). But I don't think we should pressure people into voting if they don't have an understanding of the issues, or if they don't really have much preference even after understanding the issues.

If you don't care or you're not sure, you really shouldn't be voting.
