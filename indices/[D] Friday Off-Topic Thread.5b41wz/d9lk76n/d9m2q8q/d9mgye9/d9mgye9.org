  In retrospect, I was too hard on Bush, McCain, and Romney. Although I disagreed with their policies, I never doubted they wanted to do the right thing and help America. They weren't the enemy, just the opposition.

Did we live through the same Bush administration? I can believe that he believed in what he did. That doesn't really change the fact that what he did was /atrocious/.

I mean, he basically started out in office by passing a bunch of tax cuts I don't like, /scuttling the Kyoto Treaty after we'd already signed it/, encouraging consumerism as a response to the dot-com bubble collapse, and then /starting a bunch of aggressive wars and encouraging consumerism as a contribution to the war-effort while cutting more taxes during wartime/. While also doing a bunch of other stuff I don't like personally and passing /massive/ restrictions on civil liberties, including consolidating all internal security agencies (ie: what other countries rightly regard deeply corrupt agencies with totalitarian tendencies) into one big department (ie: one /big/ deeply corrupt agency with totalitarian tendencies /and no civil-liberties laws to stop them/).

Like, Bush was the guy who told the librarians to start handing over people's /public-library borrowing records/ so his government could check for /terrorists/, by which he meant leftists.

Bush was objectively really fucking bad. It was under Bush that I had to hold my breath so a random guy in a mosque in my area wouldn't be convicted in a weapons trafficking "sting" that was /clearly/ entrapment. Luckily, the local Civil Liberties Union actually had our acts together, and so the case /was/ eventually thrown out as entrapment. By which I mean, under Bush, the FBI entrapped rando Muslims into weapons trafficking so it would have "terrorists" to hunt.

And as far as anyone knows, none of this shit was ever rolled back under Obama. Mind, I thought Romney was pretty damned evil, but just, you know, /bourgeois/ evil, without as much of the god-bothering imperialist mayhem that made the Bush years so /exciting/.

Your vote controls less than one bit of entropy.
