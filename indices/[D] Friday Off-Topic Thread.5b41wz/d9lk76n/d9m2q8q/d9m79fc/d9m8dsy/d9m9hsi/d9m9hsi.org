It seems like you probably understand the argument from non-hegemony, but it basically boils down to not bullying everyone else. I have a problem using physical force at all, it needs to be justified every time it is used. Doing it because it's convenient for billionaires in their quest of eternally-increasing balances does not seem justified to me.
