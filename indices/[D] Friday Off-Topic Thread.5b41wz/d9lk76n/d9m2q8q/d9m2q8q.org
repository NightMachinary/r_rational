Here are the latest odds from the bookmakers:

*Clinton is the next president: 3/10 (short) odds, or ≤77% chance of Clinton being the next president.*

*Trump is the next president: 5/2 (long) odds, or ≤28% chance of Trump being the next president*

So, it's generally expected that Clinton is the next president, but it's totally plausible that Trump wins. Since this adds up to 105%+, you can tell they're shortening the odds to make a profit. These predictions are from a standing start, not contingent on anything in the future, and the odds change over time, etc. The bookies also give Sanders ≤2%, Biden ≤1%. I'll be interested to see how things turn out.

I hope that Trump does not win, because I think he will likely not be a good president for a variety of reasons. In retrospect, I was too hard on Bush, McCain, and Romney. Although I disagreed with their policies, I never doubted they wanted to do the right thing and help America. They weren't the enemy, just the opposition. Trump, though... sheesh, man. You know, I don't think he'll as bad as people say on some things (like I don't think he'll actually use nukes) but I think it will still be a bad presidency. A lot of the president's job is like super boring shit like appointing people to run various government agencies and making sure the right hand knows what the left hand is doing and attending complicated annoying staff meetings all the time. I can't imagine Trump will have the patience to deal with this effectively, or the humility to appoint and listen to smart secretaries and staffers. If he wins, though, I hope he proves me wrong.

I do notice that there is a strong sentiment on some parts of the internet against Hillary Clinton because she is a very Washington-insider, business-as-usual candidate. "Too moderate," complain the Democrats. "Too corrupt," complain the centrists. "Literally the Devil," complain the Republicans. They're not wrong. Well, she's not literally the Devil but this isn't the actual complaint the Republicans have. And I do see why some people complain about her. Nonetheless, I voted for her in the primary over Bernie Sanders, because I didn't like Sanders' policies and I don't think he'd do nearly as good a job. I also voted for her in the primaries in 2008. As far as I can tell, Clinton will be a fine president if she wins. She's smart, tenacious, wonkish, centrist, and ambitious. I'll be voting for her on Tuesday.

Make sure to turn out and vote, everyone! If you are an American, it is your civic duty. As a citizen, you are entrusted with the power to cast a vote, and you have an obligation to exercise it.
