  Why the hell did nobody seem to notice he was a nazi when he launched his campaign promising racial cleansing?

1. Because that's overblown, ignorant rhetoric that devalues the utility of "Nazi" as a negative signifier and draws /actual/ Nazism closer to the mainstream by associating it with a vastly wider but much less objectionable group.

2. Because the people whose job it was to notice were actively helping him, both for their own ratings, and because he seemed like the ideal opponent for their preferred candidate.
