  The problem for me is that Stein has too many dumb antiscience positions, like nuclear energy and GMOs, and Johnson is, well, a libertarian. I don't really want either of them to be president.

Oh, I agree. Stein is nuts. I don't like her. I especially don't like Baraka: he's an Assad apologist.

I voted for them mainly because, if a third-party gets over 5% on a Presidential ballot, they can run candidates for dog-catcher or State Assembly without going through a complicated bureaucratic maze -- they're just /on the ballot/ by declaring a candidate by a deadline. I deliberately wasted my Presidential vote in order to potentially buy opportunities to vote for better candidates down-ballot in future races, which we especially need in my state because we're the worst in the country for having contested (more than one candidate) state and local elections.

And actually, since Johnson's higher in the polls than Stein, I perhaps should have voted for him. It depends how much I care about getting a third-party their dog-catcher candidacies /in principle/ and how much I care about doing so for a /left-wing/ party in specific.

  But my state is contested, so the choice that optimizes for distance between Nazis and the white house is unfortunately Clinton.

Yep. Entirely true. Even my socialist organization said it really does come down to this. If you're in a contested state, go full Popular Front (or at least, Anti-Nincompoop Front), hold your nose, and support Clinton.

  Why the hell did nobody seem to notice he was a nazi when he launched his campaign promising racial cleansing?

I mean... I KNOW RIGHT? But there seems to be a major set of deontological and virtue-theoretic assumptions built into the American political establishment: that if you follow the procedures and work within the system, you have a level of Rawlsian legitimacy, Godwin's Law applies as normal, and the actual content of your political stances basically doesn't matter at all.

So I hope that if Donald Trump teaches the establishment one fucking thing, it is this: policies matter, outcomes matter, and the value of a procedure is just the information it integrates as input and the expected utility it generates as output.

Because HE LAUNCHED HIS CAMPAIGN PROMISING MASS DEPORTATIONS. Not closed borders as a component of a sane, humane immigration policy, MASS DEPORTATIONS. And he comes as a culmination of a DECADES-LONG TREND in which his party have come to consider themselves the ONLY LEGITIMATE GOVERNING PARTY, and as he continued his campaign he asked WHY WE CAN'T JUST NUKE PEOPLE, and in the closing days of his campaign he has promised to ELIMINATE CLEAN ENERGY RESEARCH OF ALL KINDS.

This has been batshit insane from the start, and I'm really tired of being the only guy in the room who believes his own eyes.
