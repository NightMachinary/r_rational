  Yes! Of course! That's why it's important to run on more than personality. Every candidate is going to have smears thrown at them and dirt dug-up on them, and that's why they need to be able to point to a clear policy platform (or party manifesto, as other countries would call it), a strong back-bench within their party infrastructure, and hopefully a popular movement behind them.

Wait, I was under the impression that Clinton had a strong policy platform except no one ever talked about it. What makes you think her policies are unclear?
