Ok, so I was gonna say that you've got a really good point and where I disagree it's because I honestly differ in view on the facts, but then you said:

  Also, artificial general intelligence will probably be invented in a few decades anyway, so there's really no point in rebelling at this point.

This is insane. Sorry, but that's enough time for maybe a third of the world's population to replace itself, if we estimate "a few decades" to be 30-40 years. Even if we assume it's only 15-20 (inside edge, so to speak), /those are lives you're talking about/. Every point in the causal trajectory matters, not just the ones that come after some point or another! If you give me a magic guarantee that everything will be either just fine or totally annihilated 20 years from now, /everyone's remaining 20 years of normal life still matter!/

I mean, if you sincerely think we should just be pouring all available efforts into FAI, fine, PM me and I'll send you a Google Doc to look over that is meant to help push that effort along from a direction that hasn't had too much work. That doc has taken too long to prepare and someone had actually said they were interested.

And then you can help with my PhD application, too.

But otherwise, the pre-AI-kills-us-all years matter and deserve real effort from all of us, since everything still adds up to dreadful normality at this point in history.

  I understand how upset you are, I would be too if I actually, you know, expected things to be better than this on some gut level.

I expected, well, /lawful/ evil, and what I'm getting is a [[http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Chaos][Chaos incursion.]] And Chaos is on the not-even-once list, right alongside hegemonizing swarms.

  But ultimately you need to consider the decision in terms of consequentialism: will rebelling actually save more lives than not rebelling? If yes, then go ahead, but if not then it's a really bad idea.
#+end_quote

The thing is, at this point, I genuinely believe the answer is yes.
