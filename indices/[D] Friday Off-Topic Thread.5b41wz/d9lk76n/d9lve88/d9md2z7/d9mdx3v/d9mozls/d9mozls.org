I didn't realize that that's enough time for a third of the population to replace itself. But still, the key question to ask is still whether more lives will be saved if you rebel compared to not rebelling. When answering that question it could be important to take other things into account like, "could this impede other efforts to save lives that very smart people are already undertaking," or "are there any other ways besides rebelling that could save more lives". Yes those last few decades before we get GAI still matter, but I would say there's a significantly higher probability that outright rebelling against a much bigger, stronger enemy like the /US government/ is only going to get a lot more people pointlessly killed compared to other methods of trying to save lives.

Furthermore, even if you were to somehow miraculously succeed, a huge sudden shock to society like that could be very risky and have unforeseen repercussions and make things a lot less predictable for a lot of people. Yes, the US government for the most part doesn't seem to care very much about most of its citizens. But we could have far worse governments than that. I'm not sure how long it would take to build a better government in the unlikely event that you do succeed, but I would expect it to take a few decades rather than a few years, simply because just putting new people in power historically hasn't magically made things better. Even if smart, competent, and well-intentioned people could theoretically be put into power, the chances of that happening seem very slim.

I suspect that if there was someone sufficiently competent at politics and with enough money and who was intelligent enough, they /might/ be able to get some of the most problematic parts of the US government replaced, or give them incentive to act more in the interest of the citizens, so that the world is less likely to get destroyed by crazy/irresponsible/ evil people in the US government (I.e. Trump) and so that more net lives are saved. Or maybe they could just entirely reform the government outright without rebelling. I don't know what is possible because I'm just a layperson with no legal or political expertise.

Ultimately, the sort of endeavor you propose is not only extremely risky in terms of human lives compared to alternatives, but to make such an endeavor less risky would probably require years of study in the fields of law and political science, and military training too. Any less than that i expect would have a higher probability of failing and causing more net lives to be lost.

But maybe I'm missing something here. Maybe if I consider your belief that rebelling will save more net lives than not rebelling for five minutes I will realize that you're right? But I have no idea where to begin to steelman your position that rebelling will save more net lives than not rebelling, because I lack the expertise. How would the world look different if rebelling was more likely to save more net lives compared to not rebelling? I don't know. Maybe there's some reason that rebelling would be a more feasible way to save a positive number of net lives than I expect? Ultimately, thinking about it for five minutes is a start, but it's not enough. Sometimes you actually need to have more knowledge.

Show me the evidence that more net lives are likely to be saved if you do this than if you don't do this. And please don't use any more ad hominem arguments. I don't like it when people die any more than you do.

This situation is upsetting to me too, but I'm not upset in the moment because there's no point in getting upset about it. When I said "I understand that you're upset about this" it was in the sense of being viscerally upset in the moment. And I'm not viscerally upset about this in the moment because getting myself worked up about it won't accomplish anything. I've gotten rather numb to politics at this point and I'm focusing my emotional energy on things that I am more likely to be able to do something about. If I thought too much about politics I would just get really angry and upset. So I've just been choosing not to think too much about politics in order to avoid getting that angry and upset because it's not productive. I'm still angry and upset in the general sense, I'm just choosing not to let myself feel it right now because it would interfere with my other goals to get that upset about this. I'm sorry if that wasn't clear.
