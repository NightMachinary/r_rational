Actually sending aid to the Middle East and drastically increasing efforts towards halting global warming would in the long term result in more lives saved.

Why is a complicated answer, which [[https://www.amazon.com/World-Very-Small-Place-Africa/dp/0765624842][this book]] will help you to understand. In brief, foreign aid is necessary because western enterprise has created economies of dependencies in the third world, so aid efforts are sabotaged and ignored in order to preserve revenue streams. An example would be bribes to foreign leaders to not develop their country, making it more profitable for the leader to continue their country's dependency than to invest in development. Oil is the most obvious and profitable dependency cycle. Others, more subtle and insidious you'll learn about in that book.
