  I would say there's a significantly higher probability that outright rebelling against a much bigger, stronger enemy like the US government is only going to get a lot more people pointlessly killed compared to other methods of trying to save lives.

This assumes that the US government is doing a good job keeping people alive in the first place and isn't otherwise collapsing, which I don't really believe.

  Furthermore, even if you were to somehow miraculously succeed, a huge sudden shock to society like that could be very risky and have unforeseen repercussions and make things a lot less predictable for a lot of people.

Again: you are assuming that everyone is privileged enough to live a stable, predictable life under the present regime. I don't think this is true.

  Ultimately, the sort of endeavor you propose is not only extremely risky in terms of human lives compared to alternatives, but to make such an endeavor less risky would probably require years of study in the fields of law and political science, and military training too. Any less than that i expect would have a higher probability of failing and causing more net lives to be lost.

And I expect that the continued stagnancy of the US government, plus the effects of US imperialism outside its borders, plus the /staggering/ incompetence of the US government on domestic issues compared to /most of the rest of the civilized world/, make it "profitable" to actually mount a rebellion and either force the usgov to reform or replace it outright.

My rough belief is: if we force the usgov to focus on putting down a domestic rebellion rather than gratuitous foreign slaughter, that's a gain, and if we force it to reform by picking some /incredibly low-hanging/ fruit of domestic policy for improved /not dying or living in horrible suffering for no good reason/ statistics, we win. We don't need to switch from neoliberal capitalism to fully automated gay space luxury communism tomorrow. We need the United States to stop lagging behind the norm and gratuitously killing people tomorrow, /but it refuses to do so unless we mount an actual rebellion/.
