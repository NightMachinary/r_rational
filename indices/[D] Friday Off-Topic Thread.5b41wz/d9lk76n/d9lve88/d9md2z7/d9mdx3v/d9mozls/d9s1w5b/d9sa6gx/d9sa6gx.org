  This assumes that the US government is doing a good job keeping people alive in the first place and isn't otherwise collapsing, which I don't really believe.
#+end_quote

No, it's assuming that even more people will die than are dying already if there's a rebellion. Also, what exactly do you mean by "collapse" and what evidence do you have for it happening any time soon?

#+begin_quote
  Again: you are assuming that everyone is privileged enough to live a stable, predictable life under the present regime. I don't think this is true.
#+end_quote

No, I'm assuming that /even though/ the majority of people living in this country are not privileged enough to live a stable, predictable life under the present regime, that a rebellion could cause that number to increase. I'm also assuming that /organizations that save lives/ will be negatively impacted by the instability and unpredictability, not just organizations that cause people to die for no reason.

  And I expect that the continued stagnancy of the US government, plus the effects of US imperialism outside its borders, plus the staggering incompetence of the US government on domestic issues compared to most of the rest of the civilized world, make it "profitable" to actually mount a rebellion and either force the usgov to reform or replace it outright. My rough belief is: if we force the usgov to focus on putting down a domestic rebellion rather than gratuitous foreign slaughter, that's a gain, and if we force it to reform by picking some incredibly low-hanging fruit of domestic policy for improved not dying or living in horrible suffering for no good reason statistics, we win. We don't need to switch from neoliberal capitalism to fully automated gay space luxury communism tomorrow. We need the United States to stop lagging behind the norm and gratuitously killing people tomorrow, but it refuses to do so unless we mount an actual rebellion.

And you conveniently skipped over the part where if you fail to overthrow the US government they just go right back to killing gratuitously abroad, only this time you'll have even more people dead in total because there would be people who died domestically too.

Also, since the NSA can spy on you to find out any plans you try to share with people electronically, you likely can only communicate such plans to people in person. Even if there were some way to completely protect yourself from the NSA's spying, it would probably cost a lot of money, and purchases made with credit/debit cards are probably tracked by the government too. And I'm pretty sure cash withdrawals can also be tracked since banks also use electronic record keeping these days. And if you make a pure cash withdrawal large enough to buy state of the art equipment for avoiding cyber tracking by the government, I'm pretty sure that will make them suspicious of you. Good luck trying to grow your rebellion faster than it can be found and shut down when it only spreads by word of mouth, while the government has instant communication on /their side/ and you /don't/.

Furthermore, what if the US govt decides to blame your rebellion on a foreign gov't rather than on domestic rebels? Could it be another Iraq?

Or maybe someone in China or Russia or someone else that doesn't like the US decides to aid your rebellion, and some kind of twisted entanglement of alliances causes another country to aid the US gov't against the rebellion, and suddenly you have WWIII on your hands!

Do you have any idea what might happen? Are you actually thinking about the probabilities of negative externalities and taking them into account, or are you just declaring that because the US government is causing more harm than good, that therefore it is /deontologically/ a good idea to overthrow them, regardless of the what the actual consequences are? There is such a thing as the cure being worse than the disease, you know.

Don't forget that whatever you decide to do should be trying to maximize the number of lives saved. Do you need me to explain basic decision theory to you? Here's an example: if you're faced with a choice between act A (1% chance of saving 99 lives) and act not-A (99% chance of saving 70 lives) over a population of 100 lives, then you're more likely to save the most lives if you choose not-A.

That is to say, even if the number of lives that could be saved by rebelling is theoretically higher then not rebelling; if the probability of that many of them being saved is sufficiently low for rebelling compared to not rebelling, then in practice it would be better to pick not rebelling, because then you are on average saving more lives.

It still seems most likely to me that more people could be expected to die if you rebel than if you don't rebel. And you still have yet to show me any evidence to contradict this.

Something else to keep in mind, is that the US probably has a lot of treaties that will be null and void if the US government no longer exists. So if you want to avoid dragging foreign powers into your mess, you will need to reform the US government without literally overthrowing it. If you take a boat and replace one part of that boat every year, eventually all the parts will be replaced, but it will still be known by the same name and will still be considered the same boat. And since the US government is unlikely to decide to reform itself, you will need to get people elected/appointed into positions of power who will be more sympathetic, or who might have something to gain for themselves from the reforms you want to implement. A sympathetic politician or group of sympathetic politicians could pretend to agree with current policies until they have amassed enough political power to unexpectedly legislate a bunch of reforms. Or maybe some sympathetic business people will be able to buy out a group of politicians and have them pass those reforms even if they wouldn't want to otherwise. And if there are literally no sufficiently skilled politicians or sufficiently wealthy business people who are sympathetic to your cause, have at least someone with diplomatic skills negotiate with them until they are.

Don't break the law or kill people unless it's actually necessary to save more lives. If there's a relatively non-violent alternative to open armed rebellion which is more likely to succeed than open armed rebellion, it's better to go for that alternative instead.

That being said, I've got no political or business expertise, so take my words with a grain of salt. Still, this seems to be the most obvious strategy for reforming the US government, which I thought of in about five minutes once I actually applied myself to the problem, which it only occurred to me to do after finding out that Trump got elected. :/

If I can think of it, someone else who does have the expertise to carry it out definitely can. However, that might just be my total lack of expertise talking, and maybe there's some reason that such a plan is entirely unfeasible. But if that's the case they might even think of something better.

I find it hard to believe that if you put a bunch of creative, politically-savvy people in a room together to work on this problem, that armed rebellion would be the only viable solution that they generate.

And if it gets to the point where armed rebellion is the only option left, then we are all probably doomed in any case.
