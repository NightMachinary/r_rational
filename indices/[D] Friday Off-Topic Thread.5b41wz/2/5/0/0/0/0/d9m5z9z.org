Many Republican politicians are kinda trapped between a rock and a hard place when it comes to winning both primaries and general elections. Over the course of the past decade, basically, there has been a movement amongst some of the Republican electorate to be more aggressive about certain populist issues. This caused big changes, especially in the 2010 congressional election. Several of the blue dogs (conservative Democrats) were ousted in general elections, and many moderate Republicans were ousted in primary elections, and replaced with radical Tea Party Republicans.

Many canny and capable moderate Republicans held on to their seats, by swinging just far enough to the right to undercut their Tea Party challengers, then coming back to the center for the general election enough to beat the moderate Democrat who runs against them (but not so much as to piss off their base). This is /not easy/. It also really constrains their ability to act like normal people while in office.

Take, for example, my boy McCain. McCain /hates/ Trump. He really truly loathes Trump. And for good reason! McCain is a sane person and a career politician and has every reason to hate Trump. Trump also personally insulted McCain for being a PoW... etc etc. Well, in any case, you may remember that McCain endorsed Trump. Seems strange, right? McCain really does hate that guy! So why did he do it? He did this because he was facing a primary challenge from a populist rightist who was a total nutjob. After winning the primary, he waited for an opportune time to unendorse Trump. He has since went back to the middle and now has to win the general election. He probably will.

In any case, not saying we shouldn't blame Republicans for intransigence if they actually follow through with it, but bear in mind that they all are trying to get re-elected, and not all of them have the political skills and war chest of McCain.
