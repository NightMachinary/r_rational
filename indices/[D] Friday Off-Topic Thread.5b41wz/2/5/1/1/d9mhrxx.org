  Clinton naturally considers this a disgraceful attempt by the FBI to influence the election, and maintains that there is nothing to find. Those opposed to Clinton (disclaimer: including myself) point to the still ongoing, daily leaks of emails between her highest staff which, arguably, indicate her participation in outright bribery, on top of additional national security concerns.

Can't both these things be true? Or at least, from my understanding:

- These actions within the FBI are actually being deliberately orchestrated by a bloc of Trump supporters.

- They /are/ a disgraceful attempt to influence the election, insofar as state agencies are supposed to, you know, /not influence who bosses them around/, since that's what makes it democracy instead of a Soviet-style bureaucratic oligarchy.

- Clinton also takes a metric fuck-ton of bribes, has turned corruption into a lifestyle, and has had the press in her fucking pocket since the primaries.
