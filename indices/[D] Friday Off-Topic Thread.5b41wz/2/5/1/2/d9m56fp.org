  Clinton counters that these leaks are from a cyberattack orchestrated by Russian hackers, not to be trusted, and claims that Russia is also disgracefully attempting to influence the election.

Clinton started pushing this claim after various federal intelligence agencies all said that the Russians were behind the DNC hacks.

  daily leaks of emails between her highest staff which, arguably, indicate her participation in outright bribery, on top of additional national security concerns.

The "daily" part is because Wikileaks is intentionally screwing around to generate the maximum media attention. I stopped paying attention to the email leaks after the first set of them only succeeded in revealing that Hillary is in fact running a competitive campaign and working with the DNC and media. Isn't that what a good campaign would be trying to do? (As opposed to Trumps failure to work with the RNC and his continuous fights with the media). Anyway is there anything actually substantial you can point in all these leaks [[/r/the_donald]] seems to upvote every little thing they can take out of context as damning evidence,

  older lines like him asking, "What's the point of having [nuclear weapons] if you can't use them?" or him refusing to commit to defending NATO ally nations unless they've paid their bills.

I think Trump has buckled down on some of these points when pressed about them again. In light of the whole "Russia influencing the election" narrative, several of the stupid things he has said about foreign policy seem kind of damning.

Anyway, Politics is the mind killer, so maybe Trump being so stupid and awful has made me look at Clinton overly positive, but I haven't seen anything really substantial in terms of the Hillary is totally corrupt narrative. I voted by mail already anyway so whatever.
