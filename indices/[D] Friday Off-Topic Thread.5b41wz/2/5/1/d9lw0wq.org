The most meaningful recent event, for my money, is the FBI publicly announcing less than two weeks before the election that it has re-opened the investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as Secretary of State. They say that evidence found in a previously unrelated case may be relevant, and they need to investigate further to determine whether anything has changed or not.

Clinton naturally considers this a disgraceful attempt by the FBI to influence the election, and maintains that there is nothing to find. Those opposed to Clinton (disclaimer: including myself) point to the still ongoing, daily leaks of emails between her highest staff which, arguably, indicate her participation in outright bribery, on top of additional national security concerns. Clinton counters that these leaks are from a cyberattack orchestrated by Russian hackers, not to be trusted, and claims that Russia is /also/ disgracefully attempting to influence the election.

Trump, meanwhile, is continuing his ongoing vendetta against his own foot. Candid audio was released in which he advocated that when you're rich, you can get away with sexual assault (Money line: "You can grab them by the pussy!"), which he dismisses as "locker room talk". Shortly thereafter, a number of women have emerged accusing him of raping them. I think that the worst "Trump says stupid, dangerous thing" is still older lines like him asking, "What's the point of having [nuclear weapons] if you can't use them?" or him refusing to commit to defending NATO ally nations unless they've paid their bills.
