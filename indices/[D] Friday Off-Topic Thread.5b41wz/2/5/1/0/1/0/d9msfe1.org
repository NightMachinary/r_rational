Since the private communications were not leaked and I'm making stuff up, obviously what I expect to find are the things I expect to find. I can't /expect/ it to be worse than what I expected, otherwise I'd update in that direction /already/. That's what makes this whole wikileaks business so weird.

That means /you/ should expect that his private communications, if leaked, would contain things that are worse than rape apologetics, right?
