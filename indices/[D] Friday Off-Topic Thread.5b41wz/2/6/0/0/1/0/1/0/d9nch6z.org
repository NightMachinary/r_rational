Your overall point is worth considering. On the other hand when you open up yourself to compromise repeatedly, but the other party shows complete unwillingness to do it, at some point you should come to expect them to be intransigent, surely? Or do you keep stepping on the same rake over and over forever?

Tit-for-tat is sensible enough and that's what's going on here, I suspect. It's just that tit-for-tat against a defect-bot looks much like a defect-bot itself.
