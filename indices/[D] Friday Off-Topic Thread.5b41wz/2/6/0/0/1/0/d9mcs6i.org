  invite tribal signaling, while making you feel good because you're casting down the outgroup.

In terms of winning the culture wars, that sounds like a positive to me.

I'm aware of that, but I think it is worth it. I can understand trying to keep the discourse going in a direction that promotes pragmatic compromise and cooperation. The thing is there is no compromise or cooperation with the Evangelical Fundamentalist Biblical-literalist Christian mindset and thus there is no utility in trying to keep that door of compromise open. Their politics and religion have become tied together into one fractionally wrong mindset. Political compromise is sin, they are eager to elect politicians that will hold the world economy hostage over their agenda. They literally can't acknowledge scientific evidence that contradicts their faith or politics, whether it be evolution, Global warming, or simply social science's evaluation of their policies. They claim to be pro-life while cutting social safety nets for single mother and promoting abstinence only education. They get riled up over irrational fears about transgender people using public restrooms yet are willing to elect a man that brags about sexual assault.

So yeah, the hedons I gets from beating them down in a reddit post is worth more than the expected value from the off chance they actually get something right or finally decide to compromise on an issue. If you want to down vote me for violating some rationalist ideal of evaluating every idea fairly and avoiding tribal signal, well so be it, but I think this is a group that deserves to be made fun of and we should be allowed to [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/3h/why_our_kind_cant_cooperate/][enjoy a tribal signal every now and then]].
