Otherwise, I see your point. I don't know anything about American Churches, so this is a case of inside view vs outside view. As an outsider, I think that we are so heavily biased towards believing that the outgroup is closed off to reason and that trying to communicate with them is pointless, that we should just ignore that opinion at all time. You mentioned above how their leaders are awful but there are maybe university students who identify with their ideas and yet are open to reason, for instance.

But really, the reason I'm arguing against tribe signaling is that I see it everywhere, and as someone who feels mostly tribe-neutral, it pisses me off. As in, I'm tired off seeing people take a dumb on Clinton/Trump/Sarkozy/Hollande/Yudkowsky/whoever and say that their opponents are moron who can't handle the truth.
