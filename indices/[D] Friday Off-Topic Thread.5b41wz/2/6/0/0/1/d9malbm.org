"Calling leaders hypocrites" is one thing (and I don't really like it either), but strong negative statements against a political movement as a whole (like "absolute hypocrites") are really bad. They ignore different perspectives (maybe all the leaders are bad in one respect but great in others or whatever), and invite tribal signaling, while making you feel good because you're casting down the outgroup. They're a mind-killer.
