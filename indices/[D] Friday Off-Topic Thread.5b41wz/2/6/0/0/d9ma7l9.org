I should probably amend my statement to the majority of the leaders of the Moral Majority/Religious Right/Fundamentalist/Evangelicals. I mean Jerry Falwell Jr. endorsed Trump but a group of liberty university students signed a statement against him. So not all the people, but the movement (as in the leaders and public faces) itself?

Ever? I can understand how it is useless if you are trying to have a dialogue with those bad people, but if they absolutely refuse to compromise ever (as in they think filibustering Supreme Court Judges for 4 years is a good choice because they are so absolute in their moral convictions) and it weakens their position and pushes fence-sitters and undecideds away from them, then calling them out as hypocrites is useful.
