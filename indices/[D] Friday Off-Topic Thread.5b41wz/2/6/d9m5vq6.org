I like the fact the the entire Moral Majority/Religious Right/Fundamentalist/Evangelicals have been shown as absolute hypocrites once and for all. I mean yeah before individually you could find lots of hypocrisy among any single Fundamentalist leader or sect, but Trump has given a single definitive example to mock all of them with.
