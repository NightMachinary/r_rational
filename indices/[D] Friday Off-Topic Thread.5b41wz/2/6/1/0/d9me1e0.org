False equivalency much? "consequentialist grounds". Fundamentalists don't acknowledge consequentialist moral reasoning in the first place, that's one of their problems (not that they don't use it justify themselves, they just retreat back to their moral absolutists stance whenever someone try's to push a pragmatic view I.e they'll vote Trump to get judges that will reverse Roe v Wade because baby lives are at stake, but they won't promote birth control and they will promote abstinence only education). Feminists as a group don't act like their leaders are supposed to be morale paragons. Fundamentalist Christians have nominally pushed the idea that their leaders should embody family values, only to back off if it whenever they get a politician they like (i.e. Reagan or Trump). So yeah Feminists aren't hypocrites for voting Hillary or even Bill because they don't try claiming an absolute moral mandate that they refuse to compromise on ever.
