I'm a total outsider to US elections, and the little I've seen of it has been very contradictory (the whole "there are two hundred sides to every story" thing), so I really can't tell either way.

But when you say your candidate is the best one with the best policies that will help everyday people, isn't that something that basically everyone thinks of their favorite candidates? Some people vote for candidates they don't like, but people who vote for candidates they like all think they're the most reasonable one, with the most sensible policies. For every Sanders/Clinton/etc partisan out there, there's a guy who thinks Trump is the best candidate and as a president he'll, I don't know, do great things for the common people somehow.

Also, I'm mostly quoting a guy who I'm relentlessly stalking for insightful political comments here, but aren't candidates who make it past the primary much more likely to get targeted by smear campaigns and to have dirt dug up on them? There might have been similar shocking revelations about your favorite candidate had he passed the primaries.
