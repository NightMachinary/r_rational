  But when you say your candidate is the best one with the best policies that will help everyday people, isn't that something that basically everyone thinks of their favorite candidates?

I'd call that a good test of whether you have a decently democratic system with a reasonably wide variety of candidates or parties. Unfortunately, [[http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/02/for-many-voters-its-not-which-presidential-candidate-theyre-for-but-which-theyre-against/][right now it's not actually true.]] Most voters right now are holding their noses.

The test would apply more easily in the primaries, where we have a wider variety of candidates, but even there, it didn't /really/ happen. Most voters in the primaries were consciously and openly voting for a compromise between desired policies and ability to succeed in the "general" (ie: runoff) election.

Now, I personally /disagree/ with my "side's" voters' estimation of who was a more viable candidate in the general election (ie: two-candidate runoff). Your test definitely applies within the primaries to the weighted mix of beliefs that mattered in the primaries.

Which brings up that my objection to this electoral process is systemic: despite the fact that only the primaries were even a compromised version of a real election (by the test of whether your standard applies), only 9% of Americans actually supported the primary winners. So the "popular mandate" of our two "general election" (again: runoff) candidates is about 4.5% each. /That was how this all happened/: first you get 4.5% of the population to support you, and then you get 51% to hold their nose because you're better than that other jerk.

  aren't candidates who make it past the primary much more likely to get targeted by smear campaigns and to have dirt dug up on them? There might have been similar shocking revelations about your favorite candidate had he passed the primaries.

Yes! Of course! That's /why/ it's important to run on more than personality. Every candidate is going to have smears thrown at them and dirt dug-up on them, and that's why they /need/ to be able to point to a clear policy platform (or party manifesto, as other countries would call it), a strong back-bench within their party infrastructure, and hopefully a popular movement behind them.

The first and third items are things that Clinton doesn't seem to /want/, and the second is something she can't seem to /achieve/ (the Democratic Party has suffered a collapse of its state-and-local back-bench since about 2006). For all that she portrays herself as an expert political insider, /she actually stands a significant chance of losing to motherfucking Donald Trump/. For all that she portrayed herself in the primaries as better able to build a party, she's /been/ doing that for all these years, and her party's back-bench of lower-level office-holders has /collapsed/.

Maybe she and they can fix that this Tuesday and take a Senate majority and a larger House minority. Maybe they'll be stuck with the Presidency against an adversarial Congress. Or maybe they'll lose everything.

Not my problem.
