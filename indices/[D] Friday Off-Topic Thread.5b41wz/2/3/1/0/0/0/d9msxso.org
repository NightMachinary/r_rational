The Democratic Party has a strong policy platform that Clinton herself has shown no sign of actually intending to carry out. She's changed her purported policies multiple times since the primaries and shows every sign of just trying to appeal to exactly as wide a coalition of voters as necessary (and no more than that).

In short, we have very little actual /signal/ about Clinton's policies, beyond her own previous /actual actions/, which are... pretty damn bad, I would say.
