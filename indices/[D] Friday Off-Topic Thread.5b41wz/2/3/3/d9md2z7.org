  In all seriousness, I feel like these are the situations that really do call for revolution. "The system" has now proven that it laughs in the face of the common citizen's needs, treats the interests and rituals of a narrow elite as moral gospel, and has no sanitary cordon against lunatic nincompoops.

Except for the fact that this is the 21st century, and the gap between those who are the most powerful and those who are the least powerful is much larger than it ever was before. If you rebelled against your ruler in feudal times, he would have you executed, but he wouldn't be able to nuke you. Also, artificial general intelligence will probably be invented in a few decades anyway, so there's really no point in rebelling at this point. I understand how upset you are, I would be too if I actually, you know, expected things to be better than this on some gut level. But ultimately you need to consider the decision in terms of consequentialism: will rebelling actually save more lives than not rebelling? If yes, then go ahead, but if not then it's a really bad idea.
