The problem for me is that Stein has too many dumb antiscience positions, like nuclear energy and GMOs, and Johnson is, well, a libertarian. I don't really want either of them to be president. I don't really want Clinton to be president either, what with the frequent greasy-but-not-quite-criminal (Unless it is now? Who knows?) behavior.

There is no Fully Automated Luxury Gay Space Communist Party, and even the actual transhumanist party didn't pony up the grand it takes to get on the ballot here.

But my state is contested, so the choice that optimizes for distance between Nazis and the white house is unfortunately Clinton. I really don't want some Brexit crossed with Nader shit going down, especially with a fucked supreme court.

Why the hell did nobody seem to notice he was a nazi when he launched his campaign promising racial cleansing?
