I feel like spamming EY's "Stop Voting for Nincompoops" everywhere. I voted early for the Green Party in a safe state. I kinda want the neo-Nazi killed or jailed, because that's what you do when you /actually seriously believe/ a major-party Presidential candidate is an actual Nazi. This actually gives me empathy for his supporters, who sound crazy but also seem to be the only ones /taking seriously/ the immense amount of evidence that their opponent is an influence-peddling criminal, that she conspired with the press corps to manipulate the primaries, and that the press has /volunteered themselves/ to act as her propaganda ministry in the generals.

I hate white supremacy as much as any good leftist, but the way the Dems are speaking "against" it only reinforces the framing of white Americans as an ethnonationality whose material interests conflict with those of other ethnic groups in this country. So I can't speak the language of the mainstream and have to sound like a crazy commie in a park with a cardboard sign because I don't want to incite race war or feed fascism.

The most popular Presidential candidate in the whole contest, my candidate - whose policy proposals are objectively moderate, tried-and-tested stuff meant to improve people's lives without risking radical change and whom people actually liked, trusted, and respected - was laughed out of the race five months ago as an unserious loon.

In all seriousness, I feel like these are the situations that really do call for revolution. "The system" has now proven that it laughs in the face of the common citizen's needs, treats the interests and rituals of a narrow elite as moral gospel, and has no sanitary cordon against lunatic nincompoops. I actually wish it was just me being a crazy leftist at this point.

I voted in the Presidential primaries and in the state and local primaries, for candidates who /won't/ bring about Fully Automated Luxury Communism or make everyone Sapient Pony Happy, but who /would/ and hopefully /can/ incrementally improve people's lives in ways the people understand, can cope with, and actively want for themselves. I've canvassed and phone-banked for the campaign I supported, and I'm doing more canvassing against a ballot measure I want defeated. My efforts were crushed by opponents who now want me in line behind them, except maybe on the ballot measures. The party who represent my beliefs about policy most closely are represented by batshit insane hippies.

And the whole country or world could go down in flames because a narcissist realized he could appeal to identitarian fascist sentiments to catapult himself to the world's most influential single office. He has sowed utter discord and crashed through the institutional rot of this society and he still manages to be worse than the toxic fungus he's against. A perfect Ork Warboss.

This election drives me to tears. I'm scared, I'm tired, and most of all, I'm scared and tired of feeling like the crazy person in the room because I point out how crazy it all is.

This isn't sane or fair or noble, and I just want it to not have happened.
