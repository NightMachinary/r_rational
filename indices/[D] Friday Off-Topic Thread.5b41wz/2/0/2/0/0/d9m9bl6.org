As much as I generally like SSC, that post is woefully inadequate in its criticism of Hillary. As Secretary of State, she presided over historically large arms deals to the very wahhabi Saudi Arabians - who are now using those weapons to kill innocent civilians in Yemen.

Yes Trump may cause some destruction. But Hillary wants to shoot down Russian planes and has personally pushed for military intervention like in Libya. Also I don't think military coups like in Honduras should be ignored, but there's a big lack of information on the specifics there.
