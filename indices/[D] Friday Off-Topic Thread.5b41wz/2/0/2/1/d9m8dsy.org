Assuming nothing too "out there" happens, I imagine Trump would be much less involved in our commitments and responsibilities overseas than Clinton would be, except for when he absolutely (rare, but it could happen) flips the heck out. If we leave aside his comments about surprise bombing civilian areas where we think ISIS leaders are (I don't think he'd actually do this) without letting people evacuate first, we can expect a significant drawdown in direct casualties from US shots fired overseas. So, leaving out the possible but unlikely "way worse than any possible policy" thing that Trump might do, I see how this could be less violent. And if that's all you measure, then this will be a great thing. I see why people might like this, and I respect that opinion.

I'm an American exceptionalist and a believer in American hegemony. I think that international geopolitical stability, and the promotion of democratic interests and the possibility for liberal democracies everywhere, relies on the United States of America. We're the best democratic republic, and the biggest, and the richest, and so many other things. This is why I donate to the ACLU, rather than just say MIRI. The dangerous future of AI isn't just an unfriendly or poorly thought out AI running wild, it's an AI that does exactly what we want it to, and us wanting the wrong things. We are the bastion of stability and democracy in the world. My boy Barack Obama agrees:

  But the world must remember that it was not simply international institutions -- not just treaties and declarations -- that brought stability to a post-World War II world. Whatever mistakes we have made, the plain fact is this: The United States of America has helped underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens and the strength of our arms. The service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform has promoted peace and prosperity from Germany to Korea, and enabled democracy to take hold in places like the Balkans.

Yes, we kill people, both enemies and civilians, overseas. Yes, we have a huge, expensive military designed for interventions anywhere in the world--and we use it. A lot. We patrol the trade routes of our world's oceans, we back people on one side or another of various civil conflicts, and we invade countries, sometimes for the right reasons and with good outcomes, and sometimes with less good reasons and bad outcomes. We are a world power. In some ways, we are /the/ world power. Blood will be shed for us to enforce justice in the world, and to bring order to chaos.

Jefferson once said, "What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is it's natural manure." At the time, he was dismissing concerns about a rebellion that happened in the US, saying that we shouldn't worry if this happens from time to time. Though it is oft misused, the quotation itself isn't completely wrong in other contexts. I support military interventions and the US Navy patrolling the sealanes and promoting our interests around the world. I think, given what's happening in Europe and how tenuous republican democracy is in other places, we have an obligation to make sure the torch of democratic civilization keeps burning somewhere in the world.

My full thoughts on this are a lot longer and more involved. So I guess I'm an American exceptionalist and an interventionist. But I do see why people think differently; most of my liberal friends disagree with me stridently on both these issues, and I don't think they're entirely wrong to do so. I think it's easy for people, especially young people, to discount just how valuable it is that our armed forces do what they do.
