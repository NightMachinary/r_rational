  Why don't you think he would do these things?

I mean, he /might/ do that stuff. But... I guess, if someone thinks for some reason that Trump and Clinton are comparable in any way, they wouldn't be swayed by me telling them that Trump actually has a chance to do these things. If someone thinks Trump is the more peaceful candidate, the only real way to approach them, assuming they're reasonably informed, is to point out that Trump has a long tail on foreign policy outcomes, and point out his other failings. I don't think it's really possible to change people's minds a lot in politics outside of unusual circumstances.

  You donate to the American Civil Liberties Union to keep American imperialist military hegemony alive? This confuses me. The ACLU is, like, de facto the Commie Defense League.

I don't donate to the ACLU /in order/ to support the American military. Sorry if I came off that way; that must be a miscommunication on my part. Let me rephrase: I support the ACLU. Also, /separately/ from my ACLU donations, I believe that American military influence and interventions in the world should be active and has a good place in policy. The ACLU enforces my values and vision for the world domestically, and the military enforces my vision for the world abroad and in international waters. The ACLU is not actually an anti-military organization. They are against the militarization of police and surveillance of American citizens, and want better rights of free expression for soldiers, as well as good access for journalists to US warzones, but these are all different than actually being anti-war.

The ACLU is not against the US underwriting global security, patrolling our sealanes, or bringing justice to foreign countries. They care a LOT about /how/ we do it, of course, but they're not against it. This is actually really good and I like this.
