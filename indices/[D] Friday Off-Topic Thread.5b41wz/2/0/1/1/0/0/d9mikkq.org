Thank you! Everyone talks about this civic duty as if it's an inherent truth of democracy that everyone must vote. I think the system would probably run a lot smoother if there were some sort of lottery that chose a small portion of people, and then those people would do all of the research and look carefully and then vote, and everyone else stayed out of it. If you get chosen 1/100 of the time, but your vote carries 100 times as much weight (because only 1/100 of other people are voting) then on average you have the exact same amount of influence you do in the current system. We could do this for any fraction, so long as the number of voters is sufficiently large to avoid significant statistical noise.

This wouldn't actually work, but the reason isn't because it's a bad system, but because people would refuse to accept it. Most people don't understand expected values and the idea of having a nonzero amount of actual value keeps people pacified even when things they don't like happen. The percentage system doesn't "feel" good or fair to the people who go their whole lives without being selected, even though in the current system your vote won't swing the election anyway.
