I was definitely a big anti-fan of Bush, but I was a young man at the time. I liked McCain much better than Bush but didn't like his pick of VP and figured he was old enough it might matter. I actually liked Romney quite a bit, though I still gave him no small amount of shit for turning around on Obamacare's concepts. I thought he was better than McCain or Bush, since he was far more centrist, and certainly he was the smartest of the three. The reason I gave for voting for Obama in 2012 was twofold; one, Romney, although a reasonable guy, would still be beholden to the Republican party with which I disagree on many issues. The other reason is outlined [[http://ordinary-gentlemen.com/2012/11/02/four-more-years-with-head-held-high/][here]].

So in my view I guess each new Republican nominee was better than the last, until Trump came along. I don't feel like I've been gradually saying each Republican is worst than the last, since it seems like the opposite is the case. I know there are whiners who always say "this is the worst Republican ever" but they're just not correct (except this time).

About voting mattering, I agree with what you're saying. In terms of an individual vote affecting an outcome, voting doesn't matter. But, bear in mind what I said! I didn't say you should vote so you could change the election; I said to vote because it is your civic duty as an American. As a citizen, you're entrusted with the power to vote. You have an obligation as a citizen of this republic to exercise it. Not a legal requirement, but a civic duty. Not a self-interested reason, or a belief that a single vote would sway the outcome, but a duty. That's what it means to be a citizen in this republic, in my view. That's why I vote, that's why I encourage my friends and family to vote, and it's why I'm an election officer. I take great pride in this civic duty.
