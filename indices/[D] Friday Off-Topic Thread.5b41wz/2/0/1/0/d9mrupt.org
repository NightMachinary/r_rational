Yeah, one of the things that make politics so hard is that everyone wants to be superlative at all time. The opposition candidate is never "not that bad, but clearly worse than my favorite candidate", they're THE WORST CANDIDATE EVER AND THE MOST CORRUPT AND THE MOST EVIL.

When Trumps says something about vets who commit suicide because they think they're tough but they can't take it, it's not "a clumsy statement from a good sentiment", it's Trump being the worst person ever. When Hillary says she might impose a no-flight zone over Syria, OH NO SHE WILL SHOOT DOWN RUSSIAN PLANES AND START WORLD WAR III.

This sucks because it creates an enormous amount of noise that make it really, really hard to find actual signals, and in particular it makes it way harder to spot /actual/ superlatively bad statements, like Trump saying he might shoot down Iraqi boats for taunting American warships (which sounds even worse in context).
