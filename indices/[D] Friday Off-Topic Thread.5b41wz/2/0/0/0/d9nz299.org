Some reasonable opinions! I don't feel like engaging about them here, but you seem well-informed and educated. I hope, if you are American, that you vote!

About this last bit:

  Your vote controls less than one bit of entropy.

This isn't what voting is about for me. As I said elsewhere:

#+begin_quote
  In terms of an individual vote affecting an outcome, voting doesn't matter. But, bear in mind what I said! I didn't say you should vote so you could change the election; I said to vote because it is your civic duty as an American. As a citizen, you're entrusted with the power to vote. You have an obligation as a citizen of this republic to exercise it. Not a legal requirement, but a civic duty. Not a self-interested reason, or a belief that a single vote would sway the outcome, but a duty. That's what it means to be a citizen in this republic, in my view. That's why I vote, that's why I encourage my friends and family to vote, and it's why I'm an election officer. I take great pride in this civic duty.

If the only reason you would want to vote is uh, controlling bits of entropy (do you mean having an affect on election outcomes? I didn't understand this, but assume that's what you mean) then yeah, voting isn't a good idea. If you like fulfilling civic duty and feel good about that, and also believe that casting an informed vote is your civic duty, then voting is a great idea. This is how I feel, and why I vote, and I'd like to think that it's on the backs of people like me that our democratic system rests, which makes me feel even better about voting! It's pretty great actually.
