I was starting to plan out a (more) rational /Timeless/ fanfic, but kept getting hung up on how to model their version of time travel. So I went searching and found [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3f21i6/bst_ripple_effect_time_travel/?ref=search_posts][this post]] which sounded almost exactly like what I was thinking of ... only to realize that I was the one who had written it, and was asking for help with the same thing I'm struggling with now. :(
