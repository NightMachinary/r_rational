It'll be coming back after National Novel Writing Month is done. I just sort of got off rhythm, which makes it hard to get back on rhythm. I've never done gymnastics, but when they're doing their routine and screw up once, then they screw up again, and the mistakes keep piling up because they're a bit rattled, so then they have to stop and center themselves before starting up again. That's sort of what I'm trying to do here, because I got off my rhythm, which leads to words coming out slowly, frustration with the words coming out slowly, second-guessing what I've written because clearly if the words came out slowly the viscosity of the words is wrong, wanting to write other words about different things, etc.

So I have the vast majority of the next chapter written, but it's going to be a while until I know that I can move forward at a decent clip, and will definitely be after /The Dark Wizard of Donkerk/ is done.
