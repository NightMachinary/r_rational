That sounds like it could make for a very interesting story and philosophical conversations, particularly the question of self righteous altering of history. I think the way you could rationalize the time machines is by changing the relationship between the two machines so that they both leave and arrive at the some moment, and give the machines a 24 hour priming for launch that the heroes can detect. You'd have to rework the pilot to explain how the villains got the machine, but I think it'd work.
