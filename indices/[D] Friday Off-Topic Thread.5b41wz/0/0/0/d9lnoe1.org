I want to write a Timeless fanfic mostly because there's a lot of potential for existential dread, values dissonance, etc. You start with "the past is a foreign country" and then move toward "the present is a foreign country". I'm still figuring out what the punchlines would be though, and I would rather have a time travel model that makes /rational/ sense rather than just /intuitive/ sense.

I agree that the show is mostly just okay, but I think that the supposed core mission of "preserve America" is a wonderful setup for a story that's about what America /is./ If the show grew some balls that might be what they would do, but I doubt that network television is the place for anything more than a whitewashing of history.
