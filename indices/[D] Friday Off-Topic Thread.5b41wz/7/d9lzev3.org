So an MLP fanfic called [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/27429/Quantum-Castaways][Quantum Castaways]] just updated. I'm posting it here, because the latest chapter is blowing my mind. Evidently, the "Quantum" part of "Quantum Castaways" has do with with [[#s][Spoilers]] and the latest chapter has a shitload of diagrams about parabolic dishes and other assorted magibabble. This is perhaps the most ridiculously in-depth theorycrafting about MLP magic I've ever seen, and I'm seriously impressed.
