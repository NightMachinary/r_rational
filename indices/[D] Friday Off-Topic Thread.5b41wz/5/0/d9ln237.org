As someone writing a rational horror, this was very interesting. I'm actually subscribed to them and I hadn't seen this video, so thanks for sharing it! Some of the stuff they mentioned was a bit basic for horror writers, but the difference between thinking you're going mad and the universe itself being a mad place was something I hadn't considered. It's kinda obvious in retrospect, but now that I'm aware of it, I think I can exploit better in my work.
