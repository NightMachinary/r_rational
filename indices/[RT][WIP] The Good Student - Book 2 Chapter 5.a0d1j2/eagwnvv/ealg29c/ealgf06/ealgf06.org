I agree with that. I posed the question in the last thread about whether he's had any real meaningful character growth and I frankly think he hasn't.

His behavior and outlook and approach to things make sense when we start this novel. He's nothing but a small town kid who has spent his last years studying. For some reason, the world changing events he has been at the center of haven't really affected this. Nothing that has happened since the end of book one has shown him to be any different. The only difference is the circumstances around him.
