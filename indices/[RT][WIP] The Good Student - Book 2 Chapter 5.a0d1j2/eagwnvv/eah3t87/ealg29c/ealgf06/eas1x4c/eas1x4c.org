Besides getting over the girl? Not really, but I don't know how to feel about it because he has yet to really /win/ with each victory he has he gets another blindsided by the fact that it wasn't really a victory, just him being hilariously outmatched and outplayed all the while thinking he is in the lead.

He also doesn't have any real ambition, the whole 'I don't want to be here' thing is getting annoying.
