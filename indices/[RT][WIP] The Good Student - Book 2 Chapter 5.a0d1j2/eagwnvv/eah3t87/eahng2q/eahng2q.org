They're all pretty good. You can imagine Davo's nose slightly raised in the air and eyes looking down on everyone as he talks. Fanny is the butt of comebacks and jokes but rarely he gets the upper hand, and those times always feel great.

Simole's flirting/teasing is amusing, especially when combined with Dizzy seething in the background. Nic originally feels flat as a character given his passiveness, but now he dishes it out just as hard to anyone who isn't Dizzy.
