Skyrim was interesting. More for mods. This requires a lot of time investment though. VR mod compatibility is worse than normal.

Super hot was fun.

I've enjoyed project cars and distance.

Pretty much any flying game is fun.

Space pirate trainer was fun though I'm not sure if this is because I tended to switch back and forth with others while playing it.

Honey Select is nice if you want something NSFW.
