Thanks!

I've been trying some meditation (alone, without a teacher - I read some of the book The Mind Illuminated, and tried the techniques described there), and found it surprisingly useful. after a session, I did feel noticeably more calm and focused.

I also found it difficult... Sitting even for a relatively short time without doing anything but focusing on my breathing proved harder than I thought.

In general, I really don't like all the spiritual talk around it. In the back of my mind, I wonder if it is all just an elaborate placebo (I also think about it during a session - which is very distracting...)

I read a lot of people on the internet (yes, I know, a very reliable source) talking about new mind states they reached during meditation (see, for example [[/r/streamentry][r/streamentry]]), and I can't help but thinking that this doesn't strike me as a reasonable outcome, and is most likely just imagination.

I've tried searching for serious research on the topic - but there's so many articles that I can't decide what is true anymore...
