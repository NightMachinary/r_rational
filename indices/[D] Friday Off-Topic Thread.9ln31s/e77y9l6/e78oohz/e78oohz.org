This is a weird place for me to bring this up, but I have been having an /amazing/ time with tantric meditation.

I have a sort of mental script running that s/woo/sensation/; for example, "touch the sacral median and feel your second chakra" becomes "touch the spot between your tail bone and lower back and feel what happens in your pelvis". In other words, although I really don't buy any of the theories or explanations for the sensations, the sensations are /amazing/ and I'm really digging the exercises.

Overall my body, emotions, and energy levels are /massively/ improved, and there's a bunch of neat life advice to be gleaned. Ex: I've had golfer's elbow pretty bad for the last month or so, and after each meditation session I notice a marked improvement in the pain/stiffness/etc.

The core meditation pattern is to focus as absolutely and intensely as you can on [THING] - in the woo explanation, shoving energy in - and then relax and invert your focus, receiving/listening/feeling - in the woo explanation, accepting the energy being emitted. This feels like a really good pattern for life; oscillate between a balanced and reciprocal attention and reception.

Part of the idea is also, apparently, to get to know your sense of attention the same way movement yoga helps you to get to know your muscles/bones/etc.

Anyway! It's been really neat and full of information for me.
