On a bunch of these past posts I've been asking for tips and people to talk to, to help deal with my severe depression. I'd just like to update you all and say that for the first time in a while that things are looking up.

I am on a new medicinal regiment after taking a genomic sequence and it's really helped me out. Turns out I don't produce L-methylfolate, which was causing long term drop off in effectiveness on my meds.

I've been keeping up with a 5 day a week fitness program and have been able to delve into some hobbies that I had become apathetic about.

I just wanted to thank you all so much for being such a supportive community. I really appreciate you guys so much and I don't know how to express how much your replies have meant to me.
