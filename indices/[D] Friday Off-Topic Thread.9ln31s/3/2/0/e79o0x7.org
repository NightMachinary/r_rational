It depends on what modules you're using and what models you're making. For example, a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombicuboctahedron][rhombicuboctahedron]] made with the module described in the linked image is rather fragile, because it's mostly squares and the module is based around 90-Â° angles, so there's barely any tension. However, a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboctahedron][cuboctahedron]] is quite sturdy, because half of it is triangles, so the vertices are tight and there's lots of tension. (On the other hand, a model that's /too/ tight may be difficult to assemble. An [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedron][octahedron]], for example, simply cannot be constructed with the basic module, because the angles are too tight for the assembler to insert the tabs into the slots---there are /too many/ triangles.)
