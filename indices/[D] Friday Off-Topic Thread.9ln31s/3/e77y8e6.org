If you're stumped for Winter Solstice gifts, try [[https://files.catbox.moe/sxv8gm.jpg][modular polyhedral origami]]. It's [[https://www.google.com/search?q=post-it+notes][cheap]], [[http://www.britishorigami.info/learn-to-fold/valley-mountain-folds][easy]], and exactly as [[https://files.catbox.moe/mlk9ey.jpg][modest]] or [[https://files.catbox.moe/2mb5pp.jpg][impressive]] as you want it to be.

I recommend [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboctahedron][the cuboctahedron]], comprising twelve of the very simplest modules, as a starting point.
