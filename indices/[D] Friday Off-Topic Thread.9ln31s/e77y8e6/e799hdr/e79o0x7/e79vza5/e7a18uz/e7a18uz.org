The simple "90-90-90-90" module obviously can't be used at all for pentagon- and hexagon-containing models (108 and 120 Â°, respectively)---but, in my experience, the analogous "120-120-120" module* works fairly well for the truncated icosahedron ("soccer ball"---all hexagons and pentagons). I folded one (years ago) and it certainly didn't "fall apart", though it /was/ (like a 90-90-90-90 rhombicuboctahedron) significantly more fragile than a smaller model made from the same module (a truncated tetrahedron or a truncated octahedron) would have been.

The integrity of a model depends /both/ on the model /and/ on the module.

*To make this module, [[https://nrich.maths.org/5372][convert your two squares of paper into equilateral triangles]], then follow more or less the same instructions as for the 90-90-90-90 module.
