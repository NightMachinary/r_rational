I enjoyed the arguing in this chapter. You can tell that Ram's parents aren't just country bumpkins and clearly realize that there is probably more going on than meets the eye. At the same time, nobody really know what that might be and the confusion threatening inaction comes through in the fruitless back and forth of the bickering.

I'm really curious to see how this all plays out now.
