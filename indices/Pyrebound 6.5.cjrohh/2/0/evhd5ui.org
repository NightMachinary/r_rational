Not at all like Worm. World is pretty unique; it seems to actually be two worlds that super-impose on each other with disastrous results every 4 days. Reasonably good so far; I binged it when 6.4 came out and certainly don't feel that I wasted my time. Lots of potential there, but the chapters/arcs are pretty short (took me about 3 hours to binge everything that is out so far) and that potential is still a promise to be realized. I'd at least recommend keeping an eye on it.
