I don't see why not. As long as the DM is willing to keep coming up with new kinds of anti-aristotelean magic, a munchkining player could just treat them as guns with limited charges, where you "fire the gun" by learning enough about the given magic system to exploit it toward your ends (and in-so-doing prove to the DM that you now know enough about that system that it will then be taken away from you.) After "firing" the Foo magic system and having it disappear from the world, you then throw away your now-useless Foo MU, and roll up a new Bar MU to exploit the new Bar system.

(I guess that also assumes that the DM will tolerate perfectly-healthy characters committing suicide for obviously-munchkining reasons. But it's kind of rational in-universe, insofar as these characters presumably spent their whole lives learning Foo and now, with Foo gone from the world, they suddenly have no other skills and no identity.)

Heck, with a DM who really /likes/ coming up with new magic systems, you could make this into a whole /thing/. A meta MU class who studies whatever the new magic system of the week is, then forgets all those rules to learn something else the next week---or, in other words, a *Fad Mage*. In that case, the DM doesn't even have to remove the magic from the game once it's found to be exploitable; one of the rules of Fad Magic can simply be that its practitioners are guaranteed to get bored once they've mastered something, and then forcefully blow away all the old knowledge to start over again with fresh excitement on something new. Every other (NPC) practitioner can keep on using the system.

(Famous Fad Mages: Mega Man; Ash Ketchum.)
