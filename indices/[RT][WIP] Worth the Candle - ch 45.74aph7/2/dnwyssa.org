A solution to the magic system being not "magical" is to have rules, but not have those rules all known to the player. So the players can have their set of spells, but because they don't know everything about the magic system they can't rule out lots of potential spells or circumstances without learning more. Because I've read it recently, a good example is The Gods are Bastards. The author has said that his magic system is basically completely mechanical. But because no one in the setting, aside from the deities, really knows how the magic works sufficiently well, there are regular occurrences of things that the characters think should be impossible.

You then have a system that still retains that hint of mystery and exploration, while not being completely arbitrary or plot driven.
