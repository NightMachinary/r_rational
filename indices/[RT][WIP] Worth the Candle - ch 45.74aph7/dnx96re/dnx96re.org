"When I grow too old I perform the rite of Yaxukasu Axud, which allows me to be birthed again. I have lived for four hundred and eight years, across a number of bodies. The Lost King was before my time, sadly."

My theory is that all the druids and Loci are waiting in the Hell's for the situation on the surface to improve, when things get better, they will preform this rite to be born again.

Story continues to be amazing.
