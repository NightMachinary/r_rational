I think people are going really wild with theories that aren't supported by anything in the text.

The fact that better understanding of the precise mechanics of something a druid is trying to do is sometimes detrimental to them trying to do it intuitively doesn't imply that worse understanding equals infinite power.

All the talk about memetics and what not seems to be overlooking the simplest answer which is that the locus is deliberately trying to throw attempts to analyse it so that any spell being cast for the express purpose of trying to understand how it works OR by someone who is naturally inquisitive OR somewhere where someone naturally inquisitive would have the opportunity to study it would fail because the locus doesn't want to be understood and would prefer to die rather than have its secrets revealed.
