  The fact that better understanding of the precise mechanics of something a druid is trying to do is sometimes detrimental to them trying to do it intuitively doesn't imply that worse understanding equals infinite power.

I agree.

Though my guess would be that the "detrimental understanding" thing is a feature of the magic itself, rather then something the locus is doing.
