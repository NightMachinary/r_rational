If I tell a Druid "you shouldn't have been able to do that" after they just did something, my statement is clearly false in the sense that the Druid's magic worked anyway. I wonder if this implies that the important thing is the Druid's confidence in their magic. A way to test this would be to feed a blinded Druid a plausible but incorrect explanation of why their magic shouldn't work and then see if they're rendered unable to cast the spell again in the future.
