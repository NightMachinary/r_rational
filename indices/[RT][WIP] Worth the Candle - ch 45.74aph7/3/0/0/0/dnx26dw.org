Counterargument: description of the quest [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/27832635]["Taking Root"]] states that "The world has but a single druid, tending to but a single locus".

Of course, if there /was/ such a conspiracy, I would fully expect the DM to play along with it, not reveal it at the earliest opportunity. I suppose I have no evidence contrary to its existence, then.

I do think game messages invalidate your speculations about the party meeting Solace previously, though. Or the locust, at the very least. *Edit:* Wait, you've said "a druid", not "this druid", nevermind.
