I assume the author knows that the author's current portrayal either makes druids:

a) dumb or dangerously ignorant (explains why most of them got wiped out)

c)

extremely overpowered

(No clear limits on complexity, even if the amount of energy were limited. You can trick druids into performing really complicated spells by sheer virtue of them not realizing that it's supposed to be complicated)

I could see Queen-Administrator-level shenanigans that are even worse than Skitter at her most powerful. And that is only the beginning. From my understanding, they could create sentient plagues etc. ^{Blacklight^{TM}}

d)

the most immoral/insane (and possibly the most advanced) magic users in the setting? Because not being able to know something won't actually stop truly determined researchers, it just forces them to be more ruthless and strategic. It just slows the research down by a little if you have to kill or memory wipe your researchers every so often.

See the SCP wiki for the [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/antimemetics-division-hub][antimemetics division]] and its operation procedures. Take a look at [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/we-need-to-talk-about-fifty-five][SCP-055]] for what I would consider the hardest thing to research, but they're still researching it.

They ARE not very nice because they deal with extinction-event-level antimemes.

Everyone there is more or less insane, and I wouldn't be surprised if the only reason they still exist were that they have ensured their own existence through a causality paradox of some kind that prevents them from being wiped out or automatically erases information that would cause this.

If that's how this druid operates, Juniper should be running away from them /yesterday/. For all we know the reason why she's the only druid left is that she used the other ones and their loci for experiments. Or maybe loci are the druid equivalent of Marion's memory eater.

e) The most vulnerable magic users

Again, see antimemes.

Even quantum mechanics is exploitable (performing extremely complex calculations), and that's literally the universe itself conspiring against you, not a magic entity that can be tricked into revealing its secrets by accident.

Edit: Here's a scary thought:

*This isn't the first time they've met a druid*, just the first time they remember....
