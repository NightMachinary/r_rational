A combination of a) and e) sounds like the right answer, though a bit uncharitable. The thing about c) is that we're given to believe not that a druid can do anything they haven't concluded they /can't/ do, but that the more you know about druid powers the less potent (in terms of power, complexity, what have you) they are. Unless we've been intentionally misled, all signs point to druids having concrete limits that merely constrict the more clearly you see them.

I say a) and e) because the druids died out because they were fixed to unmoving loci so once they were found they couldn't run or hide, and also because their nature as unordered and natural meant they pathologically rejected any of the actions that could preserve them. Being fixed in location makes them very vulnerable, hence e), and their unordered nature counts as stupidity or ignorance in an oblique way, hence a).
