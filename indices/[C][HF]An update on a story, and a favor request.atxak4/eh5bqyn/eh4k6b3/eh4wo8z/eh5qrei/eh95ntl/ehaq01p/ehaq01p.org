That's great, thanks for reading!

Soooooo the sequel exists, it's still on the internet, and it can be found even by searching this very sub. Or this thread. However, I'm providing that information without warranty as I feel like the sequel needs more editing than the first book, and it might be a different book by the time I'm done with it.

Instead, I'll link this short story: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/5m4jdf/alien_minds/]] It's about thinking in a way that readers of [[/r/rational][r/rational]] might enjoy.
