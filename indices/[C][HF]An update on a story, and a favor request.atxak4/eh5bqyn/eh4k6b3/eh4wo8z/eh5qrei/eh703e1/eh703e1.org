  Weren't you working on a sequel at one point? What happened with that?

There were two "books" in what went up on starter serials and I've only published the first one. The second needs more editing before it can go up.

I'd like to write a third, but I don't know if I'll be able to get any traction on Amazon and I'd also like to do a serial over at [[/r/HFY][r/HFY]] (I've got lots of short stories there, BTW, some might appeal to this group) so I'm not sure what I'll write next.
