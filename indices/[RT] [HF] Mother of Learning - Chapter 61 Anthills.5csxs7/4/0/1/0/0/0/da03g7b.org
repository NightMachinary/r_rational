True, but I feel if going the primordial route to immortality is actually viable, there should be rather a lot more safeguards in place to make sure there isn't a burning crater left of a major city if anything goes wrong. Like have a standing army right there, dozens of telepaths of all species, evacuate the city, that sort of thing. Definitely not something that could be set up in a month.
