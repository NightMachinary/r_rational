I guess he could've been cooperative to get as high up in the cult as he could get in 30 days to learn as much as possible about the ritual, the cult and the primordial as he could so he could maybe be in the best possible position to stop the whole thing once he's out of the loop.

Him being hostile to loopers could be explained by him fearing that they'll screw up his plans to stop the invasion that he made such elaborate and lengthy preparations for. From his POV it might have looked to be much easier and more definitely successful to just kill the loopers and remove their influence from his plans entirely than try to convince them to help even if his intentions were good, since he had no real way of knowing how evil the other loopers were and whether they'd stab him in the back sooner or later.

Or maybe he needs a mind-controlled primordial to stop an even greater evil, like maybe the gods aren't dormant but super evil and are gathering power for an attack on earth.
