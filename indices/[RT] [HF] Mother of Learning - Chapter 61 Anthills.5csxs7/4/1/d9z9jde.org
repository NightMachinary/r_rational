Since it is a time loop, going on a killing spree doesn't really require being evil, just sufficiently sociopathical and unstable. After all, everyone will be fine in a couple of weeks. In fact, fine-tuning the invasion despite the fact that a lot of things will be different in the real world (demon summoning) kinda supports that RR views it all as a mere game (not a strong argument).

On the other hand, messing with other time travellers is... and RR has done his share of that. So yeah, he probably is a bad guy even outside of (relatively) morality-free consequences-erasing time loop.
