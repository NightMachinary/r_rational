Well you see, the giant catfish was a wizard who messed around with transformation magic. It's a tragic story, everyone assumed he was attacked by the giant catfish and have been trying to take revenge for years.

The only way to protect his life's work was to swallow it. He's waited for years trapped in that body, waiting for someone to strip off those soul clothes. Waiting for someone special to give him that sweet release and make him feel like a man again.

Tragic.
