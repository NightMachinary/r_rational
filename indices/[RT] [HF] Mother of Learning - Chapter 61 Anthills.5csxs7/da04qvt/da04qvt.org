I feel like anyone coming out of the time loop would have to be really careful readjusting to the real world. The story suggests that there was a king 400 years ago that went through the time loop, and that he was in the time loop for 'many lifetimes'. How did he not accidentally get himself killed within a few months? Your whole perception of risk and danger would be so screwed up after dying a few hundred times.
