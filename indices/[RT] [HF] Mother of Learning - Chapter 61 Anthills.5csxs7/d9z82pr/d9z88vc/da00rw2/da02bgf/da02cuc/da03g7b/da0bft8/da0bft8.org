Allow me to speculate and ask myself what we believe and why.

We believe Primordials are evil. There is nobody alive who can tell us this first hand, and in fact the first Zorian heard of them was from a priest of Eldemar's official religion. All we can really be certain of is that the gods of that religion opposed the Primordials. It is highly likely that they imprisoned them as well, though all of this happened so long ago that they could have just been taking credit for someone else's work.

We know the gods vanished several centuries ago, so we have no direct accounts of their character. We know Zorian thinks these gods were probably less good than the church would have you believe, and though there are no accounts of the gods slaughtering entire cities for merely existing, it is entirely possible that a corrupt church desperately searching for a way to stay relevant in a godless world could have suppressed any such accounts.

We know releasing a Primordial requires blood sacrifice. We don't know how the seal was set up in the first place. However, we do know that it is possible for mere mortals with sufficient fanaticism to release a Primordial from a prison supposedly designed by gods. This seems to indicate either massively incompetent gods or that the prison was not designed by them. If it was designed by evil gods, they could have just set up the prisons to require blood sacrifice to open to make the Primordials seem more evil than they actually were.

We have further evidence of incompetent or powerless gods in the design of the Sovereign Gate. The weak AI that runs the thing clearly did not know about soul magic or that it might be possible to create additional permanent loopers with it, indicating that this was either an intended bug (seems unlikely) or an oversight by whoever designed the loop. Either the deity who made it did not consult any of their buddies for failure modes, or it was made by a mortal. In addition, the arbitrary one month cut off seems super, well, arbitrary, and allowing loopers to circumvent that seems like a cop out on the part of the Gate's creator, neither of which are behaviors I associate with anything I would consider worth calling a deity.

So. We have a gods who are not present to tell their side but are basically required to be either massively incompetent or possibly malevolent and playing a bigger game than we can understand. We have Primordials who these incompetent or malevolent deities opposed. The deities won, somehow, and probably imprisoned the Primordials, then continued being incompetent, then vanished for no known reason.

How do we know that Primordials are evil? The only sources we have are known to be both unreliable and inaccessible.
