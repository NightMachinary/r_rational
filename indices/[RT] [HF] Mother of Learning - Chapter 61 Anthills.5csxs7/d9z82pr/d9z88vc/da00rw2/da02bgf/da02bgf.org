I think the requirement of ritually sacrificing multiple children, along with slaughtering most of a city, puts it less in the realm of transhumanism and more into utterly self serving. Yes, if everything goes flawlessly they can make anyone immortal, but the cost of getting to that stage is unbelievably high, and the damage of anything going wrong is astronomical. In addition, I don't think anyone involved intended to share their pet primordial with the general populace.
