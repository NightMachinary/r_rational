Well, A good guy might feed them good information in the hopes of getting to the top of the conspiracy and maximum information, especially if it had no long term bearing on anything because of the loop.

He may have a belief that he would simply be better suited to deal with the threat and that only one looper can escape which would explain his hostile treatment of other loopers.

However, I believe he is evil and going to be a problem simply because if he was on their side the ending would likely be too easy by far.
