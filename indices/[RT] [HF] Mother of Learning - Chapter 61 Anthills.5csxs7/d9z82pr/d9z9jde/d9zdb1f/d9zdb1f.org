  On the other hand, messing with other time travellers is... and RR has done his share of that. So yeah, he probably is a bad guy even outside of (relatively) morality-free consequences-erasing time loop.

His actions in this regard could've been forced from the false assumption that only one looper can leave the loop (essentially, not die), so there could be no possible peaceful resolution with any other loopers, so there's no point in trying to enter into a dialogue with them at all --- it will only increase the risks to his/her person.

A bit similar to the dilemma of approaching strangers in a post apocalyptic setting: they may share information and resources, but they may also turn out to be a manhunter and\or backstab and kill you. Only here the risk to lose everything is much higher than the chance of gaining something valuable.
