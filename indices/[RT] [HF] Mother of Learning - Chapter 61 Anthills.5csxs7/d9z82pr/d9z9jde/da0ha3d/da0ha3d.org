  messing with other time travellers is... and RR has done his share of that
#+end_quote

His interaction with Zorian (right before Zorian's suicide via fall/explosives/carnivores) is very important in trying to understand him (which does rather highlight how little actual evidence we have of anything, when that brief conversation is a highlight). For example, his only question to Zorian was, "How many time travellers are there?" He didn't ask how they entered the loop; does that mean he thought it would be straightforward to duplicate his own entry? He did offer to teach Zorian a few things, but he made that conditional on getting the info he wanted, so it could well have been a lie; he didn't show very much willingness to cooperate - or even coexist - with other loopers.
