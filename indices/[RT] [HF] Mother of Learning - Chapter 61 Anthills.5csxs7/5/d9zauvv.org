Actual plot aside, that paragraph about two Z's adventures was very amusing, and I can't help but wonder if their targets are a reference to something.

Invisible mountain yeti, might it have something to do with similarly invisible pink unicorns? And that giant catfish sound like something out of chinese/japanese myth, and eastern-sounding river name doesn't help. And there probaly is some kind of famous Indiana Jones (or similar) movie starring a giant-insect-ifested temple.
