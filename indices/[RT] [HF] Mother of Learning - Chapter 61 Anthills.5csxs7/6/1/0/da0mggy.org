Not quite. The Marker anchors itself in the entire soul, but nothing says it requires a whole soul to function. Zorian entered the loop with only a chunk of it welded onto his own soul, so a complete outer soul layer with the marker would be plenty.

It doesn't resist copying, it invalidates older Markers when a new one is placed outside the Loop, and inside the loop the process for giving someone a new Marker is a forbidden action. Simulacrum handily bypasses that by duplicating the outer soul instead, which just so happens to be engraved with the Marker. No need to assign a new Marker.

Simulacrum duplicates the less important outer layers of the soul, so the resulting being "doesn't count" ethically. Once again, the Loop seems to grab all soul-stuff hooked up to a Marker, so it'd grab the hollow soul shell.

The last point is valid though. While there's several ways I could see it working (reassigned starting point, soul mobility, Gate fail-safes) none are confirmed to be possible. The simulacrum spell could still be one giant, red-robed herring. But the fact Zorian is being faced with a similar bodiless problem when he leaves the loop makes me think we'll see a work around soon enough.
