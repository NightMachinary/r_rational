If anything RR's violent outburst is evidence that RR /is/ Veyers that grew to control his temper (somewhat).

But I can't see young Veyers being the one who stole the marker. But maybe Veyers was chosen by someone more skilled as a recipient of the mark. Maybe the fact that Zach and Veyers have so much in common eased the transition.

I mean, they are of the same gender and age. Both lost parents to the Weeping. Both became heirs of Noble Houses as a result. Both have a bloodline. Both, presumably, have troubles mastering it. Both had troubles controlling their magic (remember, Zach was terrible at shaping because of his inhuman mana reserves). Kinda suspicious.
