About the "missing before timeloop start" thing, I thought that it could've just been a mundane case of not talking to people rather than outright disappearing. I wonder if divination magic can tell whether someone was at a certain location in the past week rather than whether they can be found in the present. (And whether the fact that the world is created anew each reset would cloud those divinations.)

Veyers, if he really was the third looper, could've certainly found some things to help control his temper over the years. But yeah, right now it can go either way - some pieces of evidence fit in (motive, attitude), some don't readily (red robe & connection to cultists).

EDIT: And how he found a way into the loop is also evidence against, yeah (saw your other comment, I didn't think of that).
