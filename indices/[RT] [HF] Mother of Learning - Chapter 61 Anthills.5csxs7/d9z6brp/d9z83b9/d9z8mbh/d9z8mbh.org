Erasing memory of Veyers is a great way to create a distraction. Oh you find it suspicious that you had your mind trawled for memories of this specific person? Yes you do. Have fun wasting time and mind space on this dead end.

Since red robed cultists are also high ranking officials, it's kind of trivial. Zach tried to persuade such people that the invasion is coming. And since they want to subjugate the primordial via mind magic, at least one of the red robes is a structured mind mage.

EDIT: I mean, let's rationalize a bit, what would this cultist local boss of mage Guild would do if Zach came to him and tried to persuade him that the city is going to be invaded soon. First he might ask the boy some questions confirming that Zach has top secret information. To Zach those questions seem perfectly normal. Then he tells the boy to return say next day to discuss this matter further. Then uses this time to prepare surprise attack. Executes said attack, uses mind probe, learns about time loop. Freaks out. Places a geas on Zach to return to him in the next restart. Erases memory of the current restart, kills Zach. Now he has a month to hijack the marker somehow.

The question is how do you copy the marker.
