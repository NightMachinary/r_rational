I realize Zach and Veyers have much in common, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5csxs7/rt_hf_mother_of_learning_chapter_61_anthills/d9ztit5/][in fact I've just written about it a couple of hours ago]] but you miss or ignore the part about him going MIA 3 or 4 days before the loop starts and he clearly doesn't show up.

So yea, technically possible that he comes to senses in the original timeline, and returns... Then Zach contacts him and entrusts him with a great secret (why would you do that? he's an asshole), and then he is careful and patient to copy soulmarker and fuck Zach with mind magic, and become the Red Robe. Now that he left the loop, the original Veyers persona is missing for good.

But it's sooo flimsy.

And then there is a much simpler solution. The Red Robe is actually a high ranking cultist, say that Mage Guild boss. Zach told /him/ about the invasion and got fucked by an actual malevolent skillful mage.
