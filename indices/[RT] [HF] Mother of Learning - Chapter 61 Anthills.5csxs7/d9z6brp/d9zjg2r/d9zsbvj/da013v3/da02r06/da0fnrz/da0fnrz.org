  and got fucked by an actual malevolent skillful mage.
#+end_quote

which that malevolent mage could easily do by:

1. Erasing Zach's memories of that encounter and about how the loop works
2. Placing a geas on him to compel him to avoid having his memory analyzed by anyone else
3. Setting up Veyers as a red herring for a fallback measure by finding someone Zach knew whose "starting position" at the beginning of the loop wouldn't be found by anyone (since people ejected from the loop show up as dead bodies in their starting position in each subsequent loop), ejecting that person from the loop, and erasing that person from Zach's memories so that if Zach or someone else ever got past the geas and went snooping, it would lead them straight to Veyers who's a dead end.

I think that's pretty likely.

But doesn't your dismissal of Zach being the original looper, telling Veyers, and Veyers managing to get himself onboard somehow assume that Zach knew what was going on when the loops began? If he didn't, he wouldn't even know that he should be careful about revealing his secret. Zach was telling everyone who would listen about the invasion, revealing his secret in the process. This could have happened after he was wiped when he no longer knew what was going on or that he should be careful, but if he was ignorant about the whole situation when the loops began, he would surely have done the same thing and could have told him then.

There's plenty of reason to doubt that he was properly informed when the loops began:

1. He doesn't have the looping artifact anymore since his family's belongings were taken
2. He's soul-stamped, but his parents died when he was young during the Weeping, so they may not have had a chance to tell him things about it
3. He's slow to learn to develop his soul sense, making it unlikely that he ever had control of it unless a malevolent mind/soul mage could erase a /sense/skill/ from him. This suggests that he never knew what was going on to begin with so he never trained it. Either that or he got screwed /really/ early on in his looping days before he could learn to control it.
4. The loops didn't start at the optimal time during the planetary alignment

One other possibility: Quatach-Ichl blended Zach's soul with Zorian's when he found out what was going on with Zach. If you turn back time and put people in the same situation, they'll do the same things. Maybe Veyers was the bystander that got blended with Zach the first time, bringing him into the loop, and then he eventually screwed Zach and managed to wipe his memory, either alone or with help. Though him having the red robe at the beginning is evidence against this hypothesis.

That said, based on learning that the higher-ups in the mage's guild are involved with the primordial thing and that Red Robe was working with them, I think it's most likely that one of the higher-ups screwed him when he went around looking for help with the invasion and they figured out his secret. (Though it's also possible that someone plotted to piggy-back off Zach's soul-stamp even before the loops began and that's why they had his guardian help them take the looping artifact from him.)
