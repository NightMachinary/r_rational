  This attempt doesn't go well, because... Veyers is missing! And his house is not cooperative unless you force them.

He got himself kicked out of school before the time loop, yes. But he's missing now almost certainly because he escaped the loop or was erased from it by Red Robe to throw people off his trail.

For all we know he spent every normal loop trying to get back into school, or just sulking in town.

Zach and Veyers have a lot in common, if you think about it.

- Both were pretty much failures in school. Zach had no mana control, and studied poorly, while Veyers got screwed over by a ritual.

- Both are kind of the last of their line (Veyers is the last of the core family), taken in by people they feel have betrayed them.

- Both are probably pretty resentful of the government, for much the same reasons.

Veyers was an asshole, sure, but he also got screwed over pretty badly. I can see Zach pitying/sympathizing with him.

  Here is the rub: he has no reason to, and it is harder than bringing any of his schoolmates in the loop.

Most people don't believe in the time loop. Only a couple of girls tentatively believe him. I can see Veyers being told about it, and being very insistent or eager to be added to it.

I mean, his whole life is basically down the tube at that point. The ritual fucked his emotions up, he and his family hate each other, and he got kicked out of the academy.

Zach spends a number of the loops kicking the shit out of his "Guardian" Tesen. I can see him empathizing with Veyers losing his temper.
