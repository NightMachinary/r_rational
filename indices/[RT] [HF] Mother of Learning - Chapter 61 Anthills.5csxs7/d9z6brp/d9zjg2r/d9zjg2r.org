  Back to Veyers!RR. Another issue is the theory that Zach sought out Veyers and Veyers took over. It does not add up, Veyers went missing before time loop started. If Zach tried to contact him in the loop (very improbable on itself, but whatever), he'd failed to contact the boy. The only reasonable solution to this conundrum is that it was Veyers who sought out Zach (why?) in the first restart, and became a passenger. This is... very weak, I think. Right now, I'm kinda out of ideas.

Zach has been absolutely desperate for company in the time loop. To the point that he literally tried to convince every student and teacher in the school, as well as most of the important officials in Cyoria. Only a couple people ever believed him.

You're operating under the assumption he never had access to knowledge about the time loop. How to add people to it with a temporary marker, and access some of the other hidden functions. But his mind has clearly been tampered with--we don't know what he started with.

Boranova is an unstable ass, yes, but he also has great reason to be desperate, and to seek revenge on pretty much everyone around him.

If Zach brought him into the time loop on either the normal fixed limit the time-loop entity described (I don't remember many loops it lasted), or completely unlimited, he might have had time to grow, tamper with the memories of a younger, more naive Zach, and save scum his way to power.

Heck, he might have been able to find a working version of the ritual by torturing his family members in ensuing loops, making him more stable fairly early on.

  "I would never have used such a spell," Zach immediately said, correctly guessing what Zorian was about to ask. "Never. Why would I torture myself by bringing people into the loop, knowing that they would suddenly go back to their old, ignorant self in just six restarts?"

Zach believes this now, sure. But is that his original believed, or a mental geas or other programming put on him by Red Robe? He's awfully reluctant to let Zorian look at his mind, which could be natural fear, or a compulsion.

Of course, this could just as easily be a clever ruse deliberately planted by the third time traveler to make Zach and Zorian focus on some innocent patsy (he could easily have just erased Boranova from the time loop, if that's not his identity.), but it's not that far-fetched that it really is who he is.
