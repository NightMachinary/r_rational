The problem with them being loopers is that the other time traveler already existed prior to Zorian being brought in.

The evidence is how the invasion plays out.

When the attackers were being fed information by the third time looper their artillery strikes targeted the dorm that Zorian was staying in. Zach had mentioned that Zorian almost always died in that initial barrage.

So in order for those two girls to be in a time loop then the third time looper had to have already existed, but only managed to get control over Zach after the start of the story. Which would also be strange, because if Zach was the only original time looper then he would have noticed that the invasion's effectiveness was changing during different loops.

I think the girls being loopers introduces to many strange inconsistencies.
