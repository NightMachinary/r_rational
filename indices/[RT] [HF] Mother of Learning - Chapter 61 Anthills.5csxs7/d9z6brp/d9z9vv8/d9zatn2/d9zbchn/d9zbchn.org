We don't know actual capability of that artifact, but it probably wouldn't work. Burns are the most obvious, but not the only damage fire does to human body: there is also smoke, and, more importantly, heat itself, raising body temperature as a whole to the point where brain and other organs would shut down far earlier than infection dies off. Also, if you are using the trasure to keep a human alive, you are probably likely to also keep it's microflora/fauna alive... which also includes the infection. So yeah, two points where it could go wrong.
