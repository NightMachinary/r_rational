I just had an entertaining/horrible thought.

Would it have been possible to use Alanic's divine treasure as a treatment for the Weeping?

It completely heals burns so long as the person is still alive. No fire based injury is beyond saving.

What if we burn the everloving shit out of anyone who has the weeping and use the artifact to keep them alive until we've destroyed every last trace of it from their bodies?
