Alanic Boranova idea isn't too crazy, but there is an easier explanation: we know that Alanic has a divine treasure that allows him to heal any burns, and we know that he is very stoic. So he probably underwent some lengthly high risk - high return training, probably burnng himself very badly in the process a few times, but healing just fine after that.
