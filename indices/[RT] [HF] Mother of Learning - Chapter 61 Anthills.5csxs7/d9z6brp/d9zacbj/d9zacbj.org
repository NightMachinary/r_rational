As for Veyers!RR thing, I think there is also a simple explanation. Back when Zach was the only time traveller, he probabaly still tried hard to counter invasion. He likely even saw some success, since the invasion plans were not keepeng up with him, and mistook it for his own skill. He then probably found a lead into the Cult, and tried to follow it, only to get captured, instead of getting killed, like usual. And probably found himself on the operating table of 15 capable necromancers, who clearly saw that something was wrong with the boy. They found the marker, and tried to copy it, and, that being very hard, only one of the copies actually worked.

Now how's that for "too crazy"? XD
