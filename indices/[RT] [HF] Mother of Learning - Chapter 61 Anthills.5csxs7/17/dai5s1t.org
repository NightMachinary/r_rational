Was there any word on why Zorian hasn't looked into RR's soulkill "purple beams" yet? It seems like an admin console function to boot souls from the loop would be a pretty decent way to get around the complications that arise from the crown being in the lich's possession. Once the protagonists are sure they are done with whatever testing they need to perform to take on him in the real world, they could just banish him and waltz into Ibasa or wherever he hangs out to collect the crown at the beginning of the loop iteration in which they intend to exit (likewise with all other keys that may be in possession of anyone troublesome).
