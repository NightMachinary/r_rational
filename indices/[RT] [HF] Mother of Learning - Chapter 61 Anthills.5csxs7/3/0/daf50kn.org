True but by the time you come out of the Time Loop, what are the odds that you run into something that can still accidentally kill you? Look how powerful Zach is in a severely degraded time loop, now imagine a fully grown person who went through a fully healthy time Loop. It would be full and far in between to find something that could easily kill such a being.
