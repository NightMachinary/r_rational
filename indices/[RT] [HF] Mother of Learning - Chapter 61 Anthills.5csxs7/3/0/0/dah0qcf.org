Magic competence and CONSTANT VIGILANCE (Mad-Eye Moody style) are entirely different things though. By the story's start, Zach should've already been in the loop for at least a decade, yet he still nearly got offed by a surprise attack in Chapter One and was brought down by disabling gas in Chapter Nine.

That said, if he's the type to learn after experiencing things once, he'd definitely be a hard nut to crack by the time the time loop ends.
