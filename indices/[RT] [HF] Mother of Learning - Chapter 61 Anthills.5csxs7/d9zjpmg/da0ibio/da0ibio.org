The Black Room is more practical than exciting. It's less useful than simply spending a month outside - but since their remaining iterations are limited, it's a way to get more.

Of course, there aren't many kinds of magic left for Zach to practise. So he's probably looking at a month of soul perception meditation. Perhaps he will get bored into semi-insanity and attack Zorian, giving Zorian an excuse to invade his mind :D.

At least a room with no ambient mana is good for Zorian to practise his mana-sensing. Or even Zach could practise that! He has great shaping skills, but has he thoroughly trained his mana sensing? And /did Zorian bring marbles/?
