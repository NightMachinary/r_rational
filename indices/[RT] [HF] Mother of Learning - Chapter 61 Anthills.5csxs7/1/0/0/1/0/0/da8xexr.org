Not necessarily. Remember kids, always buy your potions from Lukav.

"The problem is that sometimes people overreach and end up transforming too far, so you end up with a mage, say, transforming into a troll in both mind and body and killing his entire family before the spell runs out of mana and he reverts back to normal. Or they attach the transformation shell too firmly to their soul and can't change back, and are then stuck in the form of a sparrow or something and can't talk to people or meaningfully interact with their environment. That's why a lot of people don't do transformation via invocations and rituals any more, and just buy transformation potions from people like me who know what they're doing..."

It's also possible a random mage decided a giant catfish was the best place to store his valuables.

We may never know the truth behind El Gato the Catfish.
