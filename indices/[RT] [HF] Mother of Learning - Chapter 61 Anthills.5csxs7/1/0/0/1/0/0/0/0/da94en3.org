Considering the sentence before it, I don't think that's the case.

We know that enhancements use a small portion of the soul's mana reserves to maintain themselves (Although they affect the soul directly and aren't soul clothes). The soul is still a power source, so I think it is possible for a transformation to be maintained in a similar fashion if it is bound too tightly to the soul.
