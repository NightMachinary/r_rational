This chapter reinforced my initial doubts about Veyers the Red Robe. If he is /that/ unstable, and his focus is just fire magic, he is really not fit for a time loop passenger role. (Counter evidence: RR's fit of rage in soul kill restart?)

Speaking of fire magic, Alanic Boranova, anyone? What? Too crazy?

Back to Veyers!RR. Another issue is the theory that Zach sought out Veyers and Veyers took over. It does not add up, Veyers went missing /before/ time loop started. If Zach tried to contact him in the loop (very improbable on itself, but whatever), he'd failed to contact the boy. The only reasonable solution to this conundrum is that it was Veyers who sought out Zach (why?) in the first restart, and became a passenger. This is... very weak, I think. Right now, I'm kinda out of ideas.

And the situation about the red robe (physical object) implies that RR is a high ranking cultist.

Another suspicious thing is that Veyers is also an orphan, and of course, the Weeping is to blame.
