I'm thinking something along the lines of: imagine you are a powerful cultist who wants to recruit among the rich and powerful. Who better to recruit and influence than a stupid, angsty and manipulatable heir of a noble house? So around the time he's about to be kicked out of school he gets contacted by a cultist and thinks 'now i'll be able to exact revenge and get what i deserve'. Zach then goes and talks to Veyers who goes "i know high level people who can help you" those people capture a less experienced Zach and erase all memories of the incident including memories of Veyers. The reason he can't be found is that he's currently hanging with the cultists at the start of the loop or he was ejected from the loop to tie off a loose end.
