What? No, they were explained. At least one (maybe both of them) just find the idea of time travel romantic, and want to believe in it.

Zach just helps them study/cheat/whatever during the loops he spends in class, and they go back to being average/below average when he doesn't.

Zach is a lot more hormonally driver than Zorian, so he's spent a fair amount of time chasing women in general.

If he had more information on the time loop, I think Red Robe erased it a long time before the start of the story.
