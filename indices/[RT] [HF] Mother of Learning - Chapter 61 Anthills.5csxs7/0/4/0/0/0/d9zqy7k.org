What? No, I don't recall that. Could you please point me out the chapter that definitively establishes that? As far as I remember, this point is never revisited save in some of Zorian's musing. Zorian thinking to himself that this is the explanation doesn't really prove anything, nor does he think about it in too much depth. He is almost certainly mistaken.

There is no way whatsoever that just a bit of extra studying is enough to explain their sudden talent. They're that good by the first day of class, really? Maybe if Zach teleported to their houses first thing and immediately started training them nonstop until class started, but even then, you don't suddenly become top of the class with a few extra days of training.

But, if they've been in a few loops... I'm not actually disagreeing with anything you've been saying about them other than that. Yes, they go back to being average/below average. Yes, he's more hormonally driven. Yes, he's spent a fair amount of time chasing women in general. Which is /exactly why/ it would be absolutly something he would do to bring his groupies with him as temporary add-ons a few times through the loop.

Come on, that is /exactly/ what Zach would choose to do with the power to add others temporarily to the loop. Compare with him wanting only half jokingly to bring girlfriends with him in the time dilation rooms. This is /absolutely/ in character for him.

How I imagine it went is something like this: Zach. being his normal self, chases after the girls. Some of them find the idea of time travel romantic, and Zach offers to bring them along, and they accept (Or they don't believe him and Zach proves it by bringing them along). So they've been through the class before at least once before, which is why it's so easy for them. Once Zach isn't around to bring them through the loop again, they go back to being their normal selves. It's possible they are in a few of the loops during which both Zach and Zorian are in a coma for, until the loop limit on temporary loopers runs out, if that's how it works.

The thing that makes this interesting is that it would mean that Zach didn't lose his knowledge of this until some time after the story started, which is a quite interesting fact, if true.
