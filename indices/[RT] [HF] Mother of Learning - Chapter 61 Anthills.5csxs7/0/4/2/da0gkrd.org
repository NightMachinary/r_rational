  he could easily have just erased Boranova from the time loop

Not so easily. Ejecting a soul from the loop would leave behind a body. And since RR has left, he certainly isn't cleaning up that body...although it does occur to me that since Boranova apparently ran away a week before the loop started, it's possible that that body is in some random location.
