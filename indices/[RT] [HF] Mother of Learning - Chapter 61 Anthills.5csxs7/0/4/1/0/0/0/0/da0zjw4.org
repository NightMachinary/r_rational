We know thanks to Zorian's marker tracking ritual that RR was not brought into the loop using the same method as Zorian.

RR does not have an identical marker... wait did he ever perform the ritual before RR left the loop? This story man... I can't wait until that mystery is solved.

I find it strange that Veyers the heir of unstructured fire magic has not used any fire magic.

Zorian even mentions that just erasing the memory of Veyers was strange. I think Veyers might be a Red Herring instead of a Red Robe.
