  You're operating under the assumption he never had access to knowledge about the time loop.

Um, no. I'm operating exactly under the assumption that he had.

  If Zach brought him into the time loop
#+end_quote

Here is the rub: he has no /reason/ to, and it is /harder/ than bringing any of his schoolmates in the loop. Remember, Veyers went missing 3-4 days before the loop starts. Suppose uncorrupted looping Zach does want to bring Boranova as his companion. /[A huge assumption on itself, because who'd want an asshole of his proportions to be their companion when they can have a harem of pretty girls instead?]/ But assume for a second he does want it. This attempt doesn't go well, because... Veyers is missing! And his house is not cooperative unless you force them. It just doesn't make sense to waste so much effort on an asshole, while there are literally hundreds of better and easier candidates around you.
