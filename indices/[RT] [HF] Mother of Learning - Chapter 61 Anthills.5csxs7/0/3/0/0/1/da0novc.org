  If you're transplanting a complex marker with untested and risky soul magic, I would not be performing the ritual on myself.

Ah, but you're forgetting something. Soul damage to non-Controllers /doesn't matter/, because they all get reset with new copies from the template. So, if you learn about the time loop, and have no ethics worth mentioning, then you do indeed attempt the ritual on yourself, because the worst-case scenario is simply that it doesn't work.

And you would be very hesitant to give someone unstable and dangerous the possibility of succeeding - especially when that person similarly has no significant ethics, and will be free to do anything to you inside the loop without consequences.
