Most of that looks pretty good. Bonus if these Cultists had kidnapped Veyers themselves in order to study his bloodline, or invited Veyers with promises of teaching him to control his innate magic. In that case, erasing Veyers from Zach's mind means not investigating Veyers, which makes it harder for Zach to stumble across them coincidentally.

We still have the problem of marker + how well Geas/mind magic work to bring Zach back to them in a later restart. Can a geas be applied unilaterally? It seems like all the instances we've seen had the cooperation of the individuals with the geas. Could Veyers be used as a hostage against Zach, even though they hated each other?
