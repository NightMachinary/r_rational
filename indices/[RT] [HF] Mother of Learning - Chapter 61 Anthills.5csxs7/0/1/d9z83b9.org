It's still pretty much impossible to find a good theory for RR. If, as Zach and Zorian are currently assuming, he's a member of the Dragon Cultists inner circle, how the hell did he get a marker? Why would he remove all memory of Veyers from Zach?

Further questions of RR's identity aside, it was a fun chapter.

  "Well, in the case of that mage I memory probed, it mostly involves him being 21 and healthy again," Zorian said. "And having a bigger penis."

It's a cliche, but that doesn't mean it's not true.

Wonder how much time next chapter is going to be spent on the Black Room, and how much on the aftermath. I figure that Zach and Zorian are going to be kind of sick of each other once they get out.

Alanic as a Boranova would be a fun twist. I don't think it's likely, especially since he doesn't have Veyers weird snake eyes, but who knows?
