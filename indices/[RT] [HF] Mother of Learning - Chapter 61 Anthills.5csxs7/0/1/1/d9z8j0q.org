  It's still pretty much impossible to find a good theory for RR. If, as Zach and Zorian are currently assuming, he's a member of the Dragon Cultists inner circle, how the hell did he get a marker? Why would he remove all memory of Veyers from Zach?

Not sure about the Veyers connection, but RR being a mind mage plus cultists would make sense for gaining the mark. Zach assaults some cultist cell before he was stupidly powerful, loses without dying, RR finds out about the loop through memory probing, and uses some soul magic to imprint the mark on his own soul.

  Wonder how much time next chapter is going to be spent on the Black Room, and how much on the aftermath. I figure that Zach and Zorian are going to be kind of sick of each other once they get out.

I hope the next chapter only contains a summary. I don't see anything interesting enough happening in the black room to warrant direct screen time.
