I find it strange that I've yet to see my favourite Red Robe theory for the past 20-odd updates show up as a discussion, so time to pitch in!

Zach is RR.

Now, bear with me on this. Anybody who becomes the third looper needs to have a copy of the marker inscribed on their soul. We know it's possible to merge the marker into another soul in such a way that the marker heals onto the subject, but this process is incredibly risky. There is, however, a reliable method for creating another marker that has been brought up on numerous occasions.

Simulacrum. We've been told a lot about simulacrum, spread out over many chapters, but the key piece of information here was hidden in a discussion on ethics in soul duplication. That is, the spell duplicates the outer layers of a soul, which would mean it duplicates the marker. If Zach were to do this, it would create a looping individual with complete knowledge of the original and no body to return to.

Zach knew Simularcrum, tried to cast it, and has now forgotten the spell, forgotten it's location, and has no interest in trying to cast it again.

I think that "Red Robe" is Zach's original personality, jaded by the death of his loved ones and his subsequent betrayal by those they trusted most. At one point he created a looping duplicate. Either "Zach" was made as is, or the two fought for the right to their original body. I suspect "Red Robe" is the Simulacrum, but it works either way.

"Zach" is a hollow shell of a person. Compelled to maintain Mind Blank to hide his edited personality, he avoids magics and approaches that could conceivably catch "Red Robe" off-guard, holds almost no grudge against the nation that destroyed his family's legacy and brute-forces all his problems. It's possible that, if he's the original, he's been tasked with doing the boring grinding of his skills and mana. He's a custom-made shonen protagonist.

"Red Robe" started the Loop a month early to ensure the destruction of Cyoria. He is friends/allies with Veyers, who holds similar feelings of betrayal and so made sure "Zach" wouldn't run into him. He assumed "Zach" was somehow behind the Areana (likely by creating another Simulacrum), which is why he went straight to "Zach" the first chance he got. It's also why he panicked and immediately left once "Zach" had no idea what was going on, since he has no idea how someone could Loop without being Zach.

There's also the Plot angle, where presumably "Zach" will revert (possibly after merging into the same body with the simulacrum) and Zorian will find himself up against a powerful archmage who knows all his tricks.
