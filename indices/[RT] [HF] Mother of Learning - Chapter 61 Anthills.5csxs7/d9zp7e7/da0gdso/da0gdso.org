  the spell duplicates the outer layers of a soul, which would mean it duplicates the marker.

Nope. The marker is woven through the entire soul, and specifically designed to resist copying. The simulacrum spell almost certainly wouldn't be able to duplicate it.

Also, Batak the priest explained to Zorian that simulacra /don't have souls/, which is why the church doesn't think that dispersing them counts as a human death. So they surely couldn't be grabbed by the Guardian and inserted into a new body. And since the simulacrum isn't in the template, what body could the Guardian give it? It just doesn't fit.
