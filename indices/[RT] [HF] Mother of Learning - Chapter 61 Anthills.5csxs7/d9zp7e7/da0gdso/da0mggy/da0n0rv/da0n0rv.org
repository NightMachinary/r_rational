I suggest re-reading chapter 39. The way Kael talks about the marker - being designed to consult the core of the soul, send signals to the Guardian, etc - is not consistent with the mere shell that you're describing.

And Zorian doesn't have just a piece; take a look at the end of chapter 31. Apparently the marker grew throughout every part of his soul.

By the way, where do you find the statement that the simulacrum spell copies /any/ part of a soul? I can only find discussions of simulacra in chapter 26 and chapter 51, neither of which makes that statement (indeed, chapter 51 is where Batak states that simulacra copy the person /except/ the soul).
