This is a poetic theory, but the data is strongly against it.

Zach is the real deal. Pre-loop Zach was nice enough to be kind to pre-loop Zorian, who was, to put it bluntly, a whiny angsty bitch. In the past two arcs lots of Zach's character traits were examined by Zorian and were repeatedly found to be consistent with the current Zach. His jovial personality, his now-rectified academic failures, all fits. At this point we only do not know about Noveda bloodline and Zorian hasn't met his caretaker in person. These are the biggest white spots that could potentially surprise us.

The rest of the theory falls apart rather quickly. If Zach were to be evil, his obvious target would be royalty that betrayed him, not the low-born citizens of Cyoria. As it stands his caretaker and the king come out completely unharmed.
