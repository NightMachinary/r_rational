  The Guardian said only the Maker or his agents (with the key) could create a Mark
#+end_quote

I read it a little differently. The actual wording was, "The Controller is marked by the Key, by the Maker, or by its agents". My take on that was that the Key is a /third/ way to mark someone - not the tool of the other two. The identical wording - "by the..." suggests a list. Zach seems to assume the same, a few paragraphs later, when he says that the Key is long lost, and the gods (probably including the Maker) have long been silent, leaving only the Maker's agents to mark the Controller.

It's not impossible, of course, that the emperor was someone extra-special. He might have created the Key from his imperial treasures. Or he might have gathered them /because/ they were the Key. Data insufficient.

  (hrm--or RR had already exited before Zorian used the spell)
#+end_quote

Indeed he had. He apparently vanished shortly after attacking Zach in the bathroom, and Zorian didn't learn to sense his soul or perform the tracking ritual until much later.

#+begin_quote
  due to a bug or due to a purposeful exploit by someone with intimate knowledge of those parameters (via Maker-level access)
#+end_quote

Clearly a bug, IMO. Someone with Maker-level access wouldn't /need/ any exploit. The Maker can change all the rules. The Guardian clearly hasn't been able to work out that there are multiple Controllers, which it would if the Maker told it to do so.

  we don't know that Daimen is in Koth
#+end_quote

Strictly speaking, perhaps not, although presumably he had been in contact with his parents before they decided to visit. He might be able to return and yet conceal his return - but why would he bother to conceal it?
