It's an /interesting/ theory, and kudos for identifying the weak points. However, I have some more weak points to add:

- The Gate is in Cyoria, Daimen is (as of the start of the loop) in Koth. How is he supposed to have activated it?
- The Guardian already explained that marking a Controller invalidates the old marker. I'm not sure that inheriting a marker would be feasible in any case, but even if so, it would be void once RR was marked.

On other points - there is no indication that the first Ikosian emperor had higher access than any other Controller.

And it isn't really coincidental that Zorian would use a disguise on the one occasion where he knows that he's likely to meet RR, in a situation where RR will know he's a Controller. The only other time they met was just previously, when RR and QI crashed the party, and Zorian was just blending into the crowd.

However, the idea that the cult deliberately activated the Gate early does bear thinking about, simply because there has to be some reason why it was activated then despite the costs.
