Am I really the only one who's pretty sure that Red Robe is actually Daimen, Zorian's brother?

If not, the fact that his name keeps getting brought up every couple chapters, usually along with references to some super-secret amazing discovery he's recently made, makes him the biggest unfired Chekhov's Gun(man) in the whole story. Both Daimen and his big discovery are in Koth, the southern, habitable portion of the [[http://mother-of-learning.wikia.com/wiki/Miasina][continent of Miasina]], which also happens to be +where+ the same continent where the Ikosian Empire rose and fell. The Ikosian Empire, which gave rise to the modern forms of magic used by almost all humans, was founded by one Shutur-Tarana Ihilkush, who is very likely the last Maker-level user of the [[http://mother-of-learning.wikia.com/wiki/Sovereign_Gate][Sovereign Gate]] if not its creator. Five of his possessions are the keys required to identify as the Maker to the Guardian of the Threshold, so it seems logical that he was the Maker, or at least managed to obtain said keys and use the gate with Maker-level privileges.

Zorian just happened to be disguised during his only direct confrontation with Red Robe, so Red Robe doesn't know his identity, either. And that was almost the only time he's ever felt the need for a disguise. That seems a little too coincidental.

I also find it suspiciously strange that it hasn't occurred to Zorian to go find his amazing relic hunter tomb raider supermage brother and ask for help finding the four keys they don't know the whereabouts of. Fine, they aren't close and Zorian hates him, but help is help, and not dying seems like it would be worth it. Yeah, Daimen's supposedly on another continent, but that seems like a not-insurmountable problem given the kind of magic and technology in the setting--they have fast, mana-powered trains and teleportation but not boats/blimps/airships/planes/levitating conveyances?

It just feels right from a narrative perspective. If Red Robe isn't someone we know or know of, what was the point in making his identity a secret?

My current theory:

Daimen is Red Robe. He found between one and four of the Gate keys in Kosh along with enough information about the Sovereign Gate to activate it while marking himself as Controller, probably using one or more of the keys. The documentation also included use of the spell that he used on the aranea/mercenaries in the Soulkill loop to exclude them from future loops. He used his fame, wealth, contacts, and considerable magical talent to find and gain access to the Gate in the time dilation research black site in the Hole (freshly arrived there after its recent donation to the Crown by Tesen Zvari, caretaker/looter of House Noveda and Zach) at which point he activated it as the Controller. He is the driver behind the Cult of the Dragon Below's plan to summon and yoke the primordial, with the goal of achieving immortality and near godlike power, and he activated the Gate a month earlier than its maker intended (at reduced efficiency) because the primordial summoning had to occur exactly on the planar alignment to have the best chance at successful yoking. He activated the Gate to allow him to brute-force perfect the process of summoning and yoking the primordial without the huge existential risks that failure would bring. He's also behind the invasion, as he needed Quatach-Ichl and the Ibasan's military might to pull off the summoning, although they think he just wants to summon the primordial as an unguided weapon of mass destruction against Eldemar. The Ibasans already had the motive, he just had to point them in the right direction. He may have also needed Quatach-Ichl's crown for the Gate activation process, which would have necessitated an alliance.

However, like the Gate and it's creator, he didn't count on another Controller already existing in the Gate's pocket dimension.

House Noveda are the remaining descendants of Shutur-Tarana Ihilkush, who was either the last person to use the Gate (probably at all, certainly with Maker-level privileges) or its creator. After exiting the Gate and finding he was unable to use it again, he magically modified his bloodline. His modifications include the massive mana reserves Zach has and a copy of the Brand, the soul marker that designates one a Controller within the pocket dimension of the Sovereign Gate. He had to slightly alter the Brand to make it hereditary (or it isn't hereditary, but has been altered to allow it to propagate such that it can be passed down via a simple ritual implantation of a soul fragment from a bearer of the Mark to another, which is exactly how it got accidentally passed to Zorian via the lich's Soul Blender spell on the first restart we witnessed) which accounts for how Zorian could get it by accident and why it seemed partially broken--it was hacked by Shutur-Tarana Ihilkush to make it propagatable but still functional as far as the Sovereign Gate was concerned. (I'm slightly leaning toward Shutur being the last Maker-level user but not the actual creator of the Gate, keys, and Brand for this reason.)

The Sovereign Gate copies everything--including souls--for simulation in the time loop, so when Daimen activated it, it copied Zach, who already had the Brand on his soul, accidentally initiating a loop with more than one Controller. That's when Daimen's plan started falling apart. Another Controller made the loops far less stable and made it that much harder to brute-force the primordial yoking process. He tried to mitigate the damage by using mind magic to corrupt Zach's memories, retard his progress, and distract him, but with the eventual introduction of Zorian and then the aranea to the loop, the risk of another Controller figuring out how to leave and trapping him became too great so he left the loop, thinking it would collapse and eliminate the threat upon his exit.

Edit: Problems with pieces of my theory: * The Ikosian Empire was in the northern, now desertified, region of Miasina, not in Koth, the southern region of the continent, where Daimen supposedly is now and where his and Zorian's parents are heading to visit him. * As far as I can tell, primordial's summoning ends the loop, no matter when it occurs during the course of the loop, so it would only be good for the brute-forcing the invasion and summoning part but not the yoking (by far the more challenging part of the whole enterprise). * IIRC the primordial was summoned before the planar alignment during the loop where the army attacked the mansion. * Even if the loop didn't end every time the primordial was summoned, the loop seems like an unwise method of attempting to brute-force yoking a primordial. If it knows any mind or soul magic equivalents at all, even a looper might not survive a failure.

I still think the key points of the theory---Daimen = Red Robe, who activated the Gate, and Zach is a time-traveller because he already had the Mark before the Gate was activated---are on the money.
