To add to my previous post:

#+begin_quote
  They rushed *inside*, disabling the dazed mansion defenders they found *inside* before making [...]
#+end_quote

The above sentence is redundant. A better sentence would be made by removing the second "inside".

"disabling the dazed mansion defenders *they found* before making [...]"

Or even better:

"disabling the dazed mansion defenders *they encountered* before making [...]"
