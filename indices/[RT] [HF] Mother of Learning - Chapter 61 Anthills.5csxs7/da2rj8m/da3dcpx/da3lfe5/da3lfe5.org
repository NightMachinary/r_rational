As to your first point, we don't know that Daimen is in Koth; all we know is Zorian thinks he is and his parents are travelling there to visit him.

As to the second...you're right. The Guardian outright said that a new Mark invalidates all old ones before Gate activation and can't happen after. Still, the fact remains that somehow two marks were active in the loop, so the Guardian must be wrong. Red Robe must've had a mark to be able to leave as a Controller, and it was a different mark than Z & Z have or Zorian would have been able to pick up RR with his Mark locator spell (hrm--or RR had already exited before Zorian used the spell). The Guardian is a programmed interface that only knows how it was designed to work. We're definitely well outside the Gate's designed operating parameters now, though. The only question is whether that's due to a bug or due to a purposeful exploit by someone with intimate knowledge of those parameters (via Maker-level access) and lots of time to figure out how to do so.

Regarding the 1st Emperor having that Maker-level access, I really must disagree. The memory packet message said Zorian'd need the five pieces of the key to leave and that they were the Ikosian emperor's crown, ring, orb, dagger, and staff, all long lost on the continent of Miasina. The Guardian said the Gate was barred, and the only way to unbar it was with the five pieces of the key. The Guardian said only the Maker or his agents (with the key) could create a Mark on someone and start the loop. The Ikosian Emperor certainly used the key (his stuff, or what history now remembers as his stuff) and Gate, so it's hard to believe he wasn't viewed by the Guardian as the Maker or Maker's agent.

That said, upon further review of Chapter 55, I think Red Robe/Daimen needed all five pieces including the lich's crown to complete the key, Mark himself, and begin looping, which might explain why the invasion. The lich wouldn't have just handed over the crown, but certainly might have offered its brief use for one part of a grand revenge plan to topple his hated enemy. I doubt RR told him what it was really for, though.
