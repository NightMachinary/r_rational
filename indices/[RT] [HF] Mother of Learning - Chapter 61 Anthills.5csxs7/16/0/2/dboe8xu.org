One option might be to have snippets of dialogue, especially when listing lots of things that happened. Eg when ZZ go around beating up on monsters, you could include one-liners from the action: "Can I tell people I've seen a yeti now, or does this not count?" "You call yourself a lich? Sigh, undead standards are really slipping these days." Etc.
