I have tried on two occasions to read through this, and twice I have started skimming at the exact same place and stopped entirely shortly after: Chapter 18. I don't even like Kabuto as a character, but his portrayal in /Chiaroscuro/ leaves a sour taste in the mouth. It felt like watching a character get hooked off-stage with a cane in the most humiliating way possible.

It's the equivalent of Harry Potter pulling out a glock and blowing away Lucius Malfoy at the end of /Chamber of Secrets/. No, worse, it's the equivalent of Malfoy pulling out a glock and handing it to Harry so he can be shot, and Harry telling Dobby as he does it how tragic it all is, winking at the fourth wall.

At basically the same point in time that canon Kabuto kills a black-ops ANBU squad and escapes from Kakashi, he instead lets himself be captured. Then, roughly a thousand words are devoted to how he breaks down under torture and is summarily executed.

All the while Ibiki's thinking about how he's a sad, lost young kid, exactly what psychologically broke him, and how they dissolve his body in some kind of acid/base so he'll never be able to clone himself back to life.

The author can do whatever they like to move past a character they don't want to write about; after all, it's fanfic. But I found the whole fic up to that point had the taste of that almost-bashing of its canon material that littered HPMoR: why do something in the narrative when you can do it in the narrative and also take a little sideswipe at the source material?

Oh, and Shikamaru is definitely among my least favourite Naruto characters, which might have a bit to do with the way the fic seems at times less hard-R rational and more 'every stat except INT is a dump stat' wank at times.
