The particulars of how the story maps to D&D aren't really that important to the analogy; I think you get the gist of my point. Even then, I'd argue that Naruto is treated more like a cute puppy than 'effective' based on his empathy. Although, like I said, I have given up on the story twice at about the same spot, just ~20 chapters in. A story about ninja shouldn't be subtly throwing shade at one half of the muscle wizard equation the whole time. :S
