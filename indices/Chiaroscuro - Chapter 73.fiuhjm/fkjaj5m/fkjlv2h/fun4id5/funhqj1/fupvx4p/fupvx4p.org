I get the point you're trying to make, I think, but the difference between 'the mind is more important than the body' and 'one particular aspect of thinking is more important than the body or any of the other aspects of thinking' is pretty significant. The latter is an oversimplification, the former is to a first approximation /straightforwardly true/. And since ninja are all at a pretty high baseline level of fitness, for them it's true to a second, third, and probably several more-th approximation.

There's the anonymous aphorism "Bad generals master tactics; good generals master strategy; great generals master logistics". Applied to ninja, it's essentially the same idea as this; bad ninja master physical talents, good ninjas master short-term planning, great ninja master long-term planning. Ninja are all way above the threshold where physical skills are valuable on the margin; even an unmotivated, untalented genin (e.g. Sakura) is not going to get much value out of training strength, speed, or endurance harder. (Rock Lee, who has no other choice, does an absurd amount of training and /more or less/ keeps pace with people who do much less training directed in more effective directions.)
