While I'm assuming that most people here already know about this story, here's a quick summary for anyone ignorant.

It's Naruto fanfiction where Shikamaru has a drive like his mother and doesn't let laziness keep him from his goals. As a result he ends up as the Rookie of the year beating out Sasuke.

It's pretty good with a well-built ninja world instead of retreading the stations of canon and things go off the rails pretty quickly after graduation. The characters are actually clever and everyone can be intelligent in different ways instead of Shikamaru being the only intelligent person in the story.
