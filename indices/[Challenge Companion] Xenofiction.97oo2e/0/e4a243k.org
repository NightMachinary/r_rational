I'd love to see something psychological in a scenario where like, it's Han and Chewy, a human and the alien have known each other for a long time and they depend on each other in their work. The good thing about this sort of thing is you still get to tell the story through a human lens, while still making it all about knowing the mind of the alien.

Don't actually do Han and Chewy though, I don't think wookies are very interesting aliens, it'd just limit you.

I imagine these sorts of relationship would be very difficult IRL. Lots of moments where the human is just so frustrated with the alien and they want to walk away from the job and never speak to them again. That said, that doesn't always happen with relationships between humans and animals, so I'm not sure where this intuition is coming from.
