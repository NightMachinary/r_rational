I would add to the suggestions Peter F. Hamilton's "Pandora's Star" and "Judas Unchained" novel pair. Though perhaps they're too long to read before the end of the challenge unless you're a really fast reader with a lot of free time, and while entertaining they're also full of pretty eye-rolling moments, the main villain of the story, the [[#s][spoiler]], is definitely a great realization of a Starfish Alien.

Another great example is Frederick Brown's "The mind thing", about a small physically almost defenceless alien that can however telepathically take over control of any sleeping creature.
