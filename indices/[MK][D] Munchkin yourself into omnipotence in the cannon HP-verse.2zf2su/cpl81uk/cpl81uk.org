1) Brew Felix Felicis

2) Drink Felix Felicis

3) Use luck to create more Felix Felicis then your first brew.

4) Drink Felix Felicis, bottle the remainder.

5) Repeat from step 1. Soon you have infinite luck.

I don't know about how to get from infinite luck to omnipotence, but if it's possible I'm pretty sure grinding the hell out of your luck is the first step.
