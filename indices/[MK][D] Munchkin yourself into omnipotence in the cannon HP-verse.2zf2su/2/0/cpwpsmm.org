1: Drink Felix

2: Make more Felix while Felixed

3: Acquire currency to buy more Felix ingredients

4: Once your Felix supply is secured, study magic and science as much as possible, with Felix on.

5: Begin experimenting under Felix

6: Continue experimenting until you ascend to godhood.

Preferably within a short amount of time, as using too much or for too long is really bad. Do not use Felix unless necessary or during one of the steps.
