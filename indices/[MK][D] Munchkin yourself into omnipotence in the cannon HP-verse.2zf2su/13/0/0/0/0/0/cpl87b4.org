I'm not sure if Aguamenti necessarily breaks a physical law. How do we know the wand isn't just beaming in water from some far away comet/star using energy harvested from some farther away exploding star? Same goes with the matter for assembling fishes.

What's more likely, that magic is the extremely advanced use of energy according to the existing models of physics, or that it is a violation of the physics that everything else in the universe works on?
