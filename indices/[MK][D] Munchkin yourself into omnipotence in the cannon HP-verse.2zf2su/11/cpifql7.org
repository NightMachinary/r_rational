Grindelwald was invulnerable because of a series of blood sacrifices while he fought Dumbledore. See if you can set up the same protection for yourself 24/7 at minimal cost, either by distributing it over 7 billion people, or else some sort of specialized spell engine (maybe transfigure a p-zombie person, then sacrifice it every minute?)

Horcruxes are a bad idea, but may be necessary. Each one splits your soul in half, so 2 gives you 1/4 of a soul, 3 gives you 1/8 and so on until 7 gives you 1/128 of a soul left. Souls are presumably good for something, so you may want to keep yours intact.
