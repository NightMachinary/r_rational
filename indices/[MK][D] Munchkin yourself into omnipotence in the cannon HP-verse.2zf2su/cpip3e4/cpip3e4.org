Create a bunch of portraits of myself in this situation, creating a bunch of portraits. Then paint in something that gives them godlike powers within the world of the portraits. (Probably wouldn't work.)

I could probably set up a time-turner-based arbitrary answer machine using some sort of minions that couldn't be scared out of it. But ... precommitting to an action that would almost certainly cause a paradox seems like a Bad Idea if the universe timelessly prevents paradoxes from happening.

Can't hurt to look into whether you can pull off an intelligence explosion with wit-sharpening potions or /felix felicis/ or whatever, but I doubt you can - the mechanics of them are unclear, but it hasn't happened /yet/, so ...

Use magic to fork my consciousness - could use a Horcrux, if I have to, too lazy to figure out an easier way here - and use the various mind-affecting magics to turn one of them into a much better person. (Actually, assuming I'm not a psychopath, might be a good idea to do that to myself anyway to be a better God-Emperor to my subjects?) Chuck good!me through the Veil to whatever afterlife awaits.

Re-authorize long-term timetravel research (banned according to Pottermore because they're afraid of changing the past after There Was An Incident, but I just want to /see/ the past, pretty much) and find the Source of Magic, or whatever it is that created magical creatures. Copy that.

Check if Boggarts can create super-powerful magic if that's what you're afraid of - boggart!Dementors have fear auras, so maybe? But Lupin implied a boggart!Dementor was less powerful, so probably not.

The rules for magic-item creation are unclear, but they seem to be capable of pretty much the same things as regular magic (Room of Requirement can't create food, Fred and George made shield-charm hats.) So ... "only" teleportation, matter transmutation, and time travel. Oh, and mind control and creating servitors immortality and telekinesis and all sorts of magical sensors and... enough Moody-style cyborging up, with magitech created by mind-controlled Fred-and-George equivelents, and you're basically a god.
