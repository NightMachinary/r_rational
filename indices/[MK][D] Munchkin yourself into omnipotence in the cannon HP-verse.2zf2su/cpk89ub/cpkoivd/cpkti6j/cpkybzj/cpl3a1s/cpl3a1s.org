Well, the laws of physics form a self-consistent whole, as far as we can tell from the universe not /showing us/ flagrant violations of logic, so if I can violate one thing that's normally a law, I can Munchkin it into violating any law I need to violate. And those are really the two /hard/ ones, that ones that put an upper limit on the hopes of any living creature, so those are the ones I'd want to be able to violate. Those, and, of course, the limitary laws of computation and information.

Other than that, well, anyone can acquire "omnipotence" just by figuring things out to the point of understanding everything.
