I'm going to reference something [[/u/EliezerYudkowsky]] once said and answer in one word: /Aguamenti/.

I mean, Ravenclaw's Diadem will speed things up, but it's not strictly necessary. Though I suppose... I wonder if there's a spell that grants finite-time evaluation of a completed infinity... That's probably under DO NOT MESS WITH TIME, but it would grant access to much neater tricks than almost anything else ever.

And there's one magic trick I'll really have to try, just to completely fuck with the whole world. Transfiguring metric space to go non-Euclidean is basically just messing with gravity, which shouldn't be too hard since I'll know exactly how broomsticks and Hovering Charms do it. From there it's just a bit of ballistics.
