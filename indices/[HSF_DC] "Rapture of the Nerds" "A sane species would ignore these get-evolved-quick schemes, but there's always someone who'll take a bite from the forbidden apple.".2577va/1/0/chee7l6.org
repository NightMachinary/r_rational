You just reminded me to post /Accelerando/ (also Stross) - I read it shortly afterwards and it's the best singularity story I've read, for the first five-ninths. The remainder is excellent but still vaguely comprehensible, and loses points for that.

Imagine /Rapture of the Nerds/, but subtract /Makers/ and flavor with a girl who creates her own sovereign nation from the Jovian system with exponential 3D printers, a two month head-start, and pure nerve.
