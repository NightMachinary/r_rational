I have been enjoying this one. Sure, he stumbles on a cheat power early per genre convention, but it's sort of plausible given that he does it by leveraging a reasonable world difference (scientific knowledge one can get at any community college / bookstore / high school), so it feels less cheap than the usual convention of being granted special powers due to simply being a transplant / because the Powers Above thought it would be "interesting". And it's kind of hilarious the way he ends up bonking monsters with books, using a skill that apparently wasn't designed for combat.

Do low level peasants serve a useful function in a litrpg fantasy world? Well, for all we know at this point, peasants are encouraged to be ignorant and low level to allow easier powerleveling by the nobility, given that the system considers it relevant that 99% of the world doesn't know something. Perverse incentives and all that.
