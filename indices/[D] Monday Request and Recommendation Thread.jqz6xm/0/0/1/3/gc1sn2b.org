Modern first-world people have a terrible tendency to be hyperspecialised domesticated animals.

Peasants knew how to live off the land, and a single village of them contained far more of the knowledge and expertise needed to propagate the technologies they used in their lives than would be the case for moderns. In other words, medieval societies were far less /fragile/ over time than moderns.

Cut off a modern american farming from the outside world for 50 years, and do the same to a medieval european one- the modern town will eventually just be a less developed version of the medieval one, where the people don't understand their tools as well.

You vastly overestimate the quality of the average modern person. The process of civilization is to take men and turns them into insects.

(And, of course, medieval peasants were stunted, more stupid versions of their hunter-gatherer ancestors).
