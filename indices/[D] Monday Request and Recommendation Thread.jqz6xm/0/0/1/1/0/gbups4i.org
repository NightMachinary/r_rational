The individual examples you give are less important than the simple fact that we know more about how the world functions in a way that acts as a multiplier to our practical knowledge. Of course if you have 0 practical knowledge then it doesn't matter but anything that builds up is going to be much more useful.

  We're talking about shit like building a house, starting a fire, how to effectively farm the land they have, how to identify edible plants in a particular region from non edible ones,

Serf and peasants would definitely not know how to build a better house. They have thatched roofing. Any shmuch in highschool could pretty quickly put together something more stable with the same materials.

Starting a fire is true. Random teens wouldn't generally know that.

Peasants were shit at farming compared to the worst farmer we currently have in existence. Just crop rotation would change everything. Justin the average teenager probably has enough random farming lore from history class to make a much better farm.

Regional edibility is true but in general placed it the wild modern people know more about survival skills.

  This is of course without getting into how educated or socially mobile

They were uneducated and stuck under a lords control iirc. They had 0 education beyond what practical knowledge their father teaches them. I have no idea where the socially mobile thing is from. As far as I know they were highly immobile.
