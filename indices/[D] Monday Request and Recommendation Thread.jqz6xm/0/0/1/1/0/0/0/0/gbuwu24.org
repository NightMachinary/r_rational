In general you can assume that most pop history things wrt the middle ages aren't particularly correct - and for a long time even lots of academic research was stained by a particular 18th, 19th, and early 20th century very linear understanding of the world that presented society as more or less informally progressing over time to its current state. This isn't particularly correct and most modern research bears out what I've been saying. I'm at work right now so it's a little annoying to constantly reply to these so ya you are welcome to go look up some of this stuff but in general probably don't assume that humans in any era were a bunch of dimwitted folks who had no understanding of their position in the world or agency in that.
