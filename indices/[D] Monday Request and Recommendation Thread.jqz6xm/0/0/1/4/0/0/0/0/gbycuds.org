Fair enough. I'm certainly not an expert in this area, and was kind of taking a shortcut there anyway. The larger point I was trying to make is that IQ is surprisingly stable, and the stuff that affects it isn't the stuff we think affects it, it tends to be some combination of inheritance, iodized salt, not getting exposed to lead, or whatever.
