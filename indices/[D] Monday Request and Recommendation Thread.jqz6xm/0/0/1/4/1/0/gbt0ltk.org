  I don't actually know what the uplift genre is but if what it sounds like

Generally, it's stories about a person or group sent to a pre-modern world (whether our own in the past, or else an alternate world), who uses their modern knowledge to push society and technology much faster than happened in real life.

  You probably have 1000 random factoids that would make you far more capable than anyone else in a medieval society. Basic econ 101 would make you a decently successful merchant. Taking meds school or any degree would make you rich as hell

The problem is that actually applying that knowledge is very tricky and depends on a ton of details that aren't included in our education. Modern education is a fantastic base to build from, but includes relatively little that can be directly applied, especially outside the context of modern society.

Most scientifically minded people are going to have a general knowledge of, say, how a steam engine works, but will fall far short of the essential related knowledge you'd need to fashion one, or even just get metal with the right qualities to have it not fall apart.

The ideal situation, if we're talking about a pure single person with no extra reference material, would be to wind up getting dropped in as the ruler of a stable, well to do realm. If you had the ability to command craftsmen and laborers, you could easily make up for your lack of details with their own prebuilt knowledge and focus on just the differences that are needed to improve their methods.

Trying to do so yourself without something like a deep, practical knowledge base of metallurgy or other materials would leave you hopelessly behind if trying on your own. Alternately, a deep historical understanding would help if you knew in great detail what the /next/ step is from their current tech base, since you'd know that it was something achievable from what they can already do.
