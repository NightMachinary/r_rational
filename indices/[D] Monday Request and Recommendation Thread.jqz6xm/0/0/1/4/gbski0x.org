Education and intelligence are correlated, but causation is a lot less clear than might be intuitive. Hard to establish this kind of causation with a study, but I think the smart money is on intelligent people deciding to spend more time in school and/or wealth being a third factor that influences both. IQ is 40-80% heritable (ranges depending on age, apparently), so that puts a ceiling on how much education can even affect it. Other biological factors like diet are much more likely to contribute to IQ than education, iodine deficiency alone can account for up to 15 IQ points, but there would almost certainly be non-deficient populations and individuals. There's some other research that kind of suggests higher modern IQ (Flynn effect, some suggestion of modern superiority in abstract thinking, which is less useful in most circumstances than people on here might think), but I think the correct framing is to think of the archetypical medival peasant (honestly that generalization is so broad as to be pretty ridiculous) as being basically similar to us, but in quite different circumstances.

I think the right frame here is to think of useful cognition as being instantiated in three ways (a generalization): hardware, software, and infrastructure. We moderns have the same hardware, alien software, and better infrastructure. That is, we are biologically largely similar in IQ, we operate on different but not really dramatically superior memoplexes, and our infrastructure is dramatically better. To the extent that we can do more and better, it's because we have discovered specific theories that we can look up, or we have better tools for thoughts available to us such as programming, easier to contact experts, and so on.

This is really why uplift is a BS genre, as fun as it is. A modern would be worse than useless in a premodern setting without a ton of handwaving. Maybe if someone was able to go back with a carefully chosen skill set, reference books, and equipment, and then got lucky, but that's really just acknowledging how critical the infrastructural component is. Moderns have an overinflated opinion of themselves, and the more you go back and read the (alien but intelligent) writings of the early moderns (~late medieval) the more obvious this is.
