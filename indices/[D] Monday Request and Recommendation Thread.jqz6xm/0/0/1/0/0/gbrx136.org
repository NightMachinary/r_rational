Oh a system or litrpg setting provides infinite potential for advancement and education. None of what I said applies there. An average peasant there either has the ability to level stats or there's a convenient explanation for them still being an underclass even with the system.

Peasants are dumb makes sense. Peasants even existing at all makes 0 sense in a litrpg world. It's one of the cornerstone reasons why I detest that genre. It has almost no internal logic or coherence. It's ideas from an intentionally unrealistic place (video games) placed into a setting with /presumably/ some realism. Expecting any amount of world building that doesn't make you want to kill yourself is a recipe for disaster.
