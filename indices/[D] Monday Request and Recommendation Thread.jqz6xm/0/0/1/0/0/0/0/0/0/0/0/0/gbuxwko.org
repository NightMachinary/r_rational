You're still making tons of unfounded assumptions.

  I touch on this in an earlier comment but the easy opportunity to advance beyond your station necessarily leads to the elimination of that class group.

Who says there's an easy opportunity to advance? It's a perfectly valid litRPG system design to say that there's no multiclassing and class choice is based on your childhood. So if you are raised as a surf the system will assign you the [Surf] class and your potential is strictly limited and never rises beyond your station.

Or to say that a [Fighter] and a [Baron] of the same level are evenly matched in combat. But a [Fighter] levels up by forming an adventuring party and seeking out dungeons and other risky things with a very high fatality rate. But the [Baron] gets experience every time he collects the harvest tax. So typically the [Baron] is one of the highest level fighters you're likely to see.

  A state cannot function without a monopoly on violence.

The state monopoly on violence is a fairly recent invention. It did not apply to feudal societies where at a minimum every lord had the right to enforce the law violently in their own lands.

  The fact that citizens can refuse the rule of law and reliably survive guarantees the total collapse of society.

More unsupported assumptions. There's no reason to assume the RPG mechanics mean a citizen can refuse the law and survive. If anything it means the opposite.

Every [Bounty Hunter], [Sheriff], [Town Watchman], will have superhuman powers for tracking and apprehending criminals. A [level 10 Blacksmith] who rejects the rule of law. Lets be generous and say the system promotes him to a [level 10 blacksmith]/[level 1 Outlaw] multi-class. How is he going to get another ten levels of Outlaw before the superhuman [level 10 Sheriff] tracks him down?

I can think of ways you could still make criminals plausible in such a system. But to say any citizen can reliably refuse the rule of law and survive, you're making massive unsupported assumptions about how the system works.
