  That would highly encourage a wildly different way of raising children. It would not lead to more peasants. It would lead to the complete elimination of undesirable classes as people raise children according to a particular class desire.

Desirable by whose criteria? If a [Yeoman Farmer] is more productive as a [Peasant], but also has a good chance of raising [Blacksmiths], [Merchants], [Monks], various adventurer classes, etc. and thus requires constant incentives, legal rights and privileges, etc in order to induce them to ensure they continue to produce generations of farmers who'll till the [Baron]'s land. Maybe the Baron would rather have the [Peasants].

I think this Barron is making a bad choice, in the same way that any real world ecconomy deciding to not educate the working class is a bad idea. But history shows that bad decision can shape society for a long time.

Or take take that other set undesirable classes, criminal classes. If the [Barron] is oppressive the [Peasants] might encourage their kids to perform minor crimes as one of the few ways out. A [Blacksmith] might want payment to take an apprentice, but any kid can try to nab a pheasant in the [Barron]'s forest and unlock [Poacher]. And that's a stepping stone to a real criminal career if they can level up enough to evolve the class.

Maybe the reason the [Barron] prefers peasants is because in the right circumstances a [Yeoman] can evolve into [Prince of Thieves] and start turning Peasants and basic outlaw classes into [Merry Men], and before you know it you've got a kingdom scale threat.
