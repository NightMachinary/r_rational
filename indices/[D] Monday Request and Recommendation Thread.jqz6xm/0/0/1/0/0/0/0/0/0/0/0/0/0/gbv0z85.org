  The state monopoly on violence is a fairly recent invention. It did not apply to feudal societies where at a minimum every lord had the right to enforce the law violently in their own lands.

What do you think the monopoly on violence is? This is it. A regional power over legitimate use of force.

  So if you are raised as a surf the system will assign you the [Surf] class and your potential is strictly limited and never rises beyond your station.

So people will stop getting serf classes.

  Or to say that a [Fighter] and a [Baron] of the same level are evenly matched in combat
#+end_quote

The fighter has the ability to level above the baron and anyone else. Meaning he cannot be controlled by him.

  There's no reason to assume the RPG mechanics mean a citizen can refuse the law and survive. If anything it means the opposite
#+end_quote

I assume that levels exist and increase your power.

  Every [Bounty Hunter], [Sheriff], [Town Watchman], will have superhuman powers for tracking and apprehending criminals. A [level 10 Blacksmith] who rejects the rule of law. Lets be generous and say the system promotes him to a [level 10 blacksmith]/[level 1 Outlaw] multi-class. How is he going to get another ten levels of Outlaw before the superhuman [level 10 Sheriff] tracks him down?
#+end_quote

This. This entire scenario. You fundamentally don't understand what I'm talking about. That's not rejecting the rule of law. He is under rule of law. That is rule of law functioning perfectly.

If a citizen has the /capability/ to level to a point where he no longer has to obey the law then it has no legitimacy. I want to stress that a high level person doesn't even need to exist yet. The fact that he can exist means that this society would inevitably buckle under the strain of constant and unending power struggles.

The baron has no legitimacy of he doesn't have the force of arms to back it up. Force of arms being levels.

It would be an autocracy of the highest level individual. With thousands of individuals constantly dying and rising up.

An apocalyptic wasteland as ever more powerful people make their way to the top and end up dying.

The nobility would die out before 3 months because they killed a guy's dad and he got to level 80 after x years of grinding and wiped them all out because he held a grudge.
