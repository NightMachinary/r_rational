Googled it, most of what I found was the same thing I told you. A large percentage of people were literate, not a high percentage, or most but a large percentage.

It increases after the black death, and we can't know the actual rates for vernacular literacy i.e being literate in their native tongues but not latin..

Your 'evidence' is the blog of a guy that speaks like an uneducated person. Saying things like:

#+begin_quote
  In 1330 only about 5% of the population could read or write. It was extremely rare for peasants to be literate. Some lords of the manor had laws banning serfs from being educated.

Respectable historians and academics in general don't speak like this, because it depends on region, context, semantics etc. There's nuance, we know very few things factually.

Here's a more nuanced view: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1exdna/what_level_of_literacy_was_there_in_europe_during/]]
