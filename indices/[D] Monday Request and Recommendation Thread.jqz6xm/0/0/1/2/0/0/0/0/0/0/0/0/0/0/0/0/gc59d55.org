Give me more links with percentages I honestly found almost none and I looked for it using your exact phrasing, opened several tabs ctrl+f all of them for % and percentage and found very few claiming to have percentages.

​

Literally the first link on duckduckgo: [[https://www.sarahwoodbury.com/literacy-in-the-middle-ages/]]

Here's one the fourth link claiming 15%- 25% literacy rates in the 1300s: [[https://www.quora.com/What-were-literacy-rates-in-Medieval-Europe-How-did-they-compare-to-literacy-rates-in-the-Roman-Empire?share=1]]

Where did you find your link 4th page on google ? The first one to justify your views ?
