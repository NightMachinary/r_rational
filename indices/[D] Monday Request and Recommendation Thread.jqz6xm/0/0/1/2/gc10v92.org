I have to disagree with you on several points here. Peasants usually lacked formal education in the medieval world, but not always. There were Church run schools for peasant children, and it was normal for peasant teens to go to medieval universities.\\
The nobles did not withheld the education from the peasants. Usually they did not give a damn either way, but occasionally it was the nobles who ORDERED peasants to go to schools, usually to become clerks for the benefit of the manor. Nobles also did not fill their heads with religion or dogma; for one, it was the nobles who were most often lapsed parishioners, and had conflicts with the Church. Religiosity of the serf spread mostly via word of mouth and cultural osmosis.

Peasants in medieval age did not " stay on a farm for 30 years and then die ". For one, almost every young person would be expected to marry outside of their hamlet, and thus lived most of their adult life not where they were born. Two, every craft except for farming required the kids to quite literally travel to find a craft Master, become Apprentice, and then a Journeyman (named so because they were travelling craftsmen). Whole groups of peasants, like lumberjacks, seasonal workers, masons (hence, "free mason") were required to travel the land looking for work, getting experience along the way.

It was not uncommon, for example for a dig-digger peasant from France to travel the whole Europe back and forth and end up in say, Norway, digging moats, foundations and graves along the way from Iberia to Trondheim.

And ATOP of that peasant levies were supposed to form and join armies, often being recruited for 2-3 years in a row, if not more. And they were not just the memetic "peasant in a grain sack with a stick" but scrupulously trained, armed and armoured infantry, archers and siege engineers, who might have seen battlefields from Scotland to Rome in a single season.

So, your average peasant was actually someone who traveled a bit, met various people, held several different jobs, possibly fought in several battles, and probably licked some formal and informal education along the way. He would very likely be a "jack of all trades" who could do simple accounting, stitch a wound, dig a grave, ride a horse, shoot a bow, repair a cart, fight in a pike formation, sail a simple boat, survive for weeks in the wilderness, recite a dozen prayers and a hundred folk songs, play a simple instrument, and haggle. All of those skills would require maybe not intelligence, not precisely, but a kind of hardcore cunning, practicality and people skills that combined together would be indistinguishable from being smart.
