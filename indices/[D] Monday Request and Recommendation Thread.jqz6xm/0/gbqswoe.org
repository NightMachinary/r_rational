[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34945/copy-paste-the-misadventures-of-milo-two][Copy, Paste: The Misadventures of Milo Two]] has been really fun. It's rational adjacent, but in a sorta satirical way. The protagonist is a munchkin at heart and tries to find ways to misuse his skills, and discovers some cool stuff for sure. He also thinks he's being logical when he makes impulsive assumptions that are almost definitely wrong, and then when he's proved wrong by his assumptions he's like "Yeah that was pretty stupid."

It almost feels like a jab at this community haha. Milo is 30, tall but pretty thin. He works out, but he isn't a powerlifter. At the start he's unemployed, and has been jumping from one job to another for most of his life. He's got a very short attention span and gets bored quickly. When he's offered the choice of getting power he impulsively goes the mage route because of the cool spells he'd get, and then tries to munchkin those spells. This almost kills him a few times because he's too busy trying to munchkin his skills instead of paying attention to his surroundings. He sits down and tries to make a focused plan for his future, and then immediately breaks it when he gains options to choose new skills. It's more of a jab at the royalroad community than here, but still, it's been a fun story. I'd recommend, at least as far as it's entertaining. There has been indications that the story and characters are deeper than they appear, and I've been liking the way the author drip feeds Milo's current state of mind chapter by chapter.
