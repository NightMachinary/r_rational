I really like Forge of Destiny, it does some pretty clever and unique things and the character development and focus is phenomenal. You really get a feel for all the characters, I don't think any other xianxias go into the individual characters as much as Forge of Destiny, which I really appreciate.

It takes a different direction than a lot of other xianxias too. The MC isn't some solo traveling murderhobo cultivating their way to the heavens faster than a rocket ship, she's more grounded in her speed and ability but is still what you'd call a "heaven-defying" genius in comparison to most other cultivators. And she's attached to CRX and her family as a vassal, which I thought was really cool and opens up to a lot of possibilities.

I also really like how female characters aren't just meant to be sexualized with no personalities as is common in xianxias and web novels in general. More than half the cast are ladies, all with their own backstories, personalities, and motivations, and I love how they're all developed. And they're all major badasses too, from snake girl to CRX to our humble MC herself. The MC is especially great, she's a support-type Cultivator who's taller than almost every male character introduced, badass, and intimidating as fuck.

Absolutely phenomenal xianxia, I put it up there with Forty Milleniums of Cultivation and Cradle as my favorites.
