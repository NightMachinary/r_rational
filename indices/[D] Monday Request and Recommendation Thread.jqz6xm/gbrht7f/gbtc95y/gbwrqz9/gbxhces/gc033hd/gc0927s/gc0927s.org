I'd speculate that's partly because Washington's time doesn't map as perfectly to medieval fantasy as Japan's warring states period. But also because, say, the Confederacy can't be separated from the immorality of its goals. Meanwhile, Nobunaga's was simply total conquest, and that's much more palatable.

There are quite a few stories where the US remains a colony, though, but it's true its historical characters don't show up as much.
