When the author describes the local area and power structure, even with magic Deus ex, you begin to realize there is no way the infrastructure around the town is able to support the amount of 'abandoned' people. You start to question 'how big is the town', 'how big is the inn' because for plot reasons the described surroundings are just not sufficient to support the population and town building the MC is doing.

Also early on, when they described wood-gathering and whatnot, the amount of physical labor starving kids are doing isn't in line with the limitations or abilities of a low-stated kid. I got around that one, but basically, it set the tone for 'think too hard about it and the story doesn't make sense'.
