Just sprinted through that one, I've gotta give it a second recommendation.

It's two universes I'd not even have thought of blending and it turns out fantastic, it's a bit on the short side for my taste but it's better to be wanting more I suppose.

I've gotta give the author credit for the language barrier, and the reasons for it here and why there isn't one in SG1 as a show. Sticking with getting characters to interact while only being able to communicate singular concepts is difficult and it's pulled off well here.

Toph is also sassy as fuck. As she should be.
