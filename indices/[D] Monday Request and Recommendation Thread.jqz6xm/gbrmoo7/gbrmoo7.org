After that viral tumblr post I bought a copy of "[[https://www.amazon.com.au/Trans-Wizard-Harriet-Porber-Parasaurolophus/dp/B08B386R6J][Trans Wizard Harriet Porber And The Bad Boy Parasaurolophus]]", and it is everything I dreamed it would be.

The worldbuilding is very interesting and I'm actually going to post the magic system on the worldbuilding Wednesday this week.
