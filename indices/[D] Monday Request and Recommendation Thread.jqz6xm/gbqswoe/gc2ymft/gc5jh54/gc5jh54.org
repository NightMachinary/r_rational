I was thinking about how Yashima Chronicles doesn't measure up to A Young Girl's Political Record the other day. My current hypothesis is that where AYGPR was focused on politics, Yashima is following a comparatively simple (so far) set of circumstances, and this leads to the protagonist's actions being really... obvious, maybe?
