So I read some more royal road trending stories.

Unfortunately all of these are short and quite incomplete, which makes it tough to get a good feel for them.

--------------

Primal hunter [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36049/the-primal-hunter]]

Decently written. MC gets lots of super cool awesome stuff for no reason, but still has threats and other people get pretty cool stuff as well. Minimal other character development. The psychopath literally gets the most character development. Really don't like how MC decides he no longer has a crush out of the blue right when his crush does something bad in a flashaway. Also the recent ambush is pretty bad idiot ball / power incontinence

--------------

Cadence Lee [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35925/the-many-lives-of-cadence-lee]]

Pretty interesting. The many lives seem pretty pointless without something else tying into them. It is good enough that I get interested in the people in each life, but there's no closure, and all the character development other than MC is lost each life. Maybe necromancers will actually be part of the story? It also really seems to cut away right when the story is getting interesting. Generally seems like it might need to be a lot longer to judge, since there doesn't seem to be a real drive or goal.

The system is really stingy. This could be good or bad.

--------------

Copy Paste: the misadventures of Milo Two [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34945/copy-paste-the-misadventures-of-milo-two]]

Pretty Enjoyable. Competent writing. Hints at an interesting world with nobles monopolizing dungeons, and odd survival scenarios. The MC trivially finds a way to become very powerful in a way that lots of people ought to be able to figure out. I love using "non combat" powers cleverly to be relevant in combat, but scribe is hardly an impossible class to get, and telekinesis and slow time are obviously incredibly powerful and don't make that much sense for their supposed scribe use (slow time for a few seconds to read a book fast?). Personally I'm not a huge fan of the cheeky meta monster themes.

--------------

Apocalypse: Generic System [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35669/apocalypse-generic-system]]

Fun. Characters have some actual character, if kinda cliche. Interesting magic system with strong light analogy (lenses, filters, etc). MC does have a bit too much of an easy time making awesome toys, but given the context and current info its plausible enough. Also, quite importantly the other characters also get pretty cool classes and abilities too.

--------------

System Change [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35372/system-change]]

Junk food. super OP MC accidentally migrate to a new "System" Decently written, but needs some actual motivation and risk.

--------------

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35660/the-weirkey-chronicles-reborn-across-nine-worlds][The Weirkey Chronicles Reborn Across Nine Worlds]]

By Sarah Lin of Street Cultivation fame. Quite competent writing. Cultivation means building a house in your soul, which explains why all the special materials are valuable and provides a nice analogy. The actual mechanics seem pretty vague and wibbly wobbly, so its difficult to predict what is possible. Huge scale threats and mysteries are hinted at in the beginning, but it looks like it will take a really long time to learn more or actually engage with those threats. Very slow growth for MC -- he just got his first ability. The demon enemies we do see are boring and generic. They just spawn out of nowhere and attack. Frankly the "Oh no, there are even higher tier demons!" is pretty meh anyway.

--------------

Artificial Jelly [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34030/artificial-jelly]]

Okay. Pretty decent premise. Kinda slow start. Considering how long MC was stuck in dungeon, doing... nothing really. The initial premise of an intern made a seed AI and snuck it into an MMO is fine as far as my suspension of disbelief is concerned, but the resource requirement / awakening other NPC's is definitely a strain in that regards.

--------------

Prophecy Approved Companion [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35549/prophecy-approved-companion]]

Okay. NPC becomes conscious. Some quite funny bits. Seems a bit rudderless. Not really sure where this is going, as it seems stuck in the Hero and NPC both having suspicions, but never quite have any realizations.

--------------

My Servant Is An Elf-Knight From Another World [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36796/my-servant-is-an-elf-knight-from-another-world]]

Okayish reverse isekai. Hmm, I feel like the continuous frenetic action and immediate threat of the last two thirds kinda wasted the stranger in a strange land / mystery / romance build up. One fantasy elf appearing in the real world was interesting, but a bunch of other fantasy creatures appearing at the same time all centered around the MC is just a bit much.

--------------

New Life of a Summoned Demoness [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36308/new-life-of-a-summoned-demoness]]

Surprisingly Decent so far. Tropy kill things to consume their essense and take their powers.

--------------

Yashima Chronicles [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35875/yashima-chronicles]]

By JacobK, an author I usually love. Unfortunately I haven't been as taken by his recent original works. This is clearly a Yojou Senki analogue, which he wrote excellently in A Young Woman's Political Record. It's enjoyable enough, but kinda... bland so far. MC gets a gamer/litrpg system gifted from a goddess, but then pisses the goddess off so much they lock the system away. Pretty amusing premise so far. They train magic and fighting on their own, and become vastly more powerful than anyone else with ease. In fact it was so easy they assume that everyone else is still much more powerful than them. There's very little tension, and the MC's strange mindset feels a bit out of nowhere, likely because its a carbon copy of Tanya's -- Tanya's ability was high, but felt much closer to what skilled enemies were capable of (with the exception of the cursed divine orb that had serious downsides). Her ability to win fights, but not the war also made things have consequences. The characters here are barely developed, making it seem much less meaningful.

--------------

Genesis Wave [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35943/genesis-wave]]

Losing interest, but decently interesting premise.

--------------

Sylver Seeker [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36065/sylver-seeker]]

I'm definitely enjoying it. Gore seems a bit over the top, but its on brand for necromancer. Frankly the flashbacks seem pointless so far. Plot is clever, and MC is a pretty good level of OP, but still threatened. Kinda suffers from a common syndrome where MC is supposedly super selfish and mercenary, but then doesn't really act like it. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as a unsympathetic MC is usually a very bad thing.

--------------

Shade Touched [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34473/shade-touched]]

Cute monster child is too smart. Needs more world exposition. Decent read, but a bit lacking in drive.

--------------

Soul Power 9999 [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36249/soul-power-9999]]

Kinda silly/dumb story about a soul that accidentally consumed all the other souls in Hades when the system took over and mulched the previous supernatural world. They go around accidentally head exploding everything they try to possess. Skipping the system taking over seems like kinda a shame, since the one flashback we saw was frankly more interesting than the MC's adventures so far. MC is way OP, but needs to protect their golem body, so there's some tension.

--------------

Fluff [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35958/fluff]]

Cute and pretty competent. Superhero fic about an accidental Villain who summons younger sisters / minions who want to help her be evil. Seems like it is headed towards being pretty dark, as the world is not fiat nice / comedic. This does have an interesting interaction with the cuddly premise.

--------------

Dead Tired [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37251/dead-tired]]

Very short. OP Lich wakes up to a Cultivation based world instead of a DnD fantasy. Wonders what went wrong. Pretty funny so far, but the humor is the type that (I suspect) will soon grow rather ... tired.
