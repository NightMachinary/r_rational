So glowfic is text roleplay, usually between two authors and written in a format meant to be read by other people. While it's an offshoot of rationalfic, it's inherently about interplay between characters due to its coauthorship, so there is equal focus on relationships.

People in the glowfic community have lower boundaries, being tightly-knit poly Bay Area people, and so in their fiction, it is normal for friends to pet each other's hair and cuddle. (Excepting Silmarillion elves, who see hairplay as sexual and instead cuddle and sing.)
