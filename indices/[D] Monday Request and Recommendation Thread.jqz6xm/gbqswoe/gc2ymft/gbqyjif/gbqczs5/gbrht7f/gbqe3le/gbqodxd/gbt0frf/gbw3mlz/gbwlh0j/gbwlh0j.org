For merchant/trade based stuff, try Spice and Wolf. It's not particularly rational, but it's a wonderful romance with some econ 101 lessons thrown into the mix. The caveat is that it's a japanese romance, which means any development takes forever and the couple are absolutely christian in their adherence to chastity.
