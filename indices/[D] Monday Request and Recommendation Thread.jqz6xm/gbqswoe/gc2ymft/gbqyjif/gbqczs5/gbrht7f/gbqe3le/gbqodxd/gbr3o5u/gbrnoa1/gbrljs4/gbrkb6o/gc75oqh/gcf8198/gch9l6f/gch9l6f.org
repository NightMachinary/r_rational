I'm still enjoying this section, but not as much. The author has mentioned an intention to have her reincarnate as an /inanimate object/ at some point in the future, too. I suspect that future incarnations won't belabour the same points at least - they've also said they'll probably summarise incarnations where nothing novel or interesting happens.
