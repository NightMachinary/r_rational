[[http://www.archives.Erfworld.com][www.archives.Erfworld.com]] For the best webcomic and story out there (probably on indefinite hiatus, several "books" into the plot, due to author's personal tragedies. Still very worth the read though). Main character is a tabletop gamer geek thrown into a gameworld, and figuring out the mechanics and magic system is core to every step of the story - with much of it discoverable/guessable by the reader as you go, so every page adds intriguing depth and worldbuilding mechanics, compelling you to think of the implications. Good luck to your productivity this month.

P.S. if you make it through the main story, read the Backer Stories, which are canon and are sometimes even better than the main plot. Fascinating stuff

P.S.S. "Signamancy" as a concept needs to be a core teaching of all fiction. Ungodly useful concept.
