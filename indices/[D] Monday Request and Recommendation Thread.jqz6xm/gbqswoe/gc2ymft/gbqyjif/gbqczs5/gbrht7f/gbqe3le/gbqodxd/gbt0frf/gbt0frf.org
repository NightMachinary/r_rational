Still on the hunt for Crafting/Merchant/Trade based stuff.

I finally took a shot at Forge of Destiny on RoyalRoad and it was pretty well written. I enjoyed how fresh the xianxia take felt even though it felt like these were tropes that I should be getting tired of. The MC did not have some kind of magic star break down or find memories of a 9 million year old saint or anything. She comes from nothing and works her way up the ladder. Plot points are extrapolated and built on to world build properly. There's a wide cast of characters and each are portrayed uniquely. I would recommend it to anyone looking to indulge in some progression fantasy or wants to have a xianxia flavor of the week craving satisfied.
