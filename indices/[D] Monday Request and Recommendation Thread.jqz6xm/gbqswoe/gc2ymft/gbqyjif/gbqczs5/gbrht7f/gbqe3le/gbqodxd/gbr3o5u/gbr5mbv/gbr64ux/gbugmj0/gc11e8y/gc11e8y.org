exactly. The only reason early iron production made any sense was due to the fact that bog iron is fairly common, and once you know how to smelt it, it makes no sense to purchase bronze. Early Iron age tools and weapons were mostly crap (you could bend an iron sword over a knee), but it could be made locally, without the need to import tin, copper or bronze from across the continent.
