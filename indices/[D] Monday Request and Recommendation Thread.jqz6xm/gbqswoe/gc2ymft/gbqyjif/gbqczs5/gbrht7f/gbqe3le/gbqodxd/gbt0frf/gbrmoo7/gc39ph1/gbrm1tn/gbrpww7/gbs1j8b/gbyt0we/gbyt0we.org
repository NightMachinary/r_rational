Definitely look at [[https://www.twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig]], Wildbow's third webserial. The POV character is Sylvester, but the other members of the Lambs, a group of Academy-created experiments, are equally important main characters. In the beginning, they're children, even if they're somewhat monstrous in their actions. They're roughhousing a lot, but also casually sharing space - usually leaning against each other, having their arm slung around the others' shoulder, sewing each other's wounds shut... Later on, Sylvester actually starts sleeping in a literal cuddle pile of his friends to keep his mind from falling apart.

If the setting doesn't appeal (very dark alt-1920ies with lots of biopunk, think Frankenstein), the main characters of his latest novel [[https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/][Pale]] are also very close and often hug each other to show support or offer comfort. Later on, they get a sort of fourth member of their group who they all take turns caring for.
