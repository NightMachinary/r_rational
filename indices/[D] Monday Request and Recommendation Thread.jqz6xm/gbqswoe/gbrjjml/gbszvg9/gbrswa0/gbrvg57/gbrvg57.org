Your point is valid, but it's not quite what I'm getting at. Specifically, it's when a protagonist gets isekai'd, lands in a "System" world, and then, first thing, goes "a-duh, why don't you just do X to get super powerful Y. I am the first person in history to think about super obvious Z, now bow before my genius, because there's no way that you rubes would've ever thought about this completely novel idea without me" and then you hear the collective forehead slapping of every native king, archmage, multi-millennia old elf, etc. who somehow missed something so obvious that some random 21st century white dude figured out within days of arriving in a completely alien world with alien rules. Yes, the peasants aren't the sharpest tools on the farmstead but the world isn't 100% peasants.
