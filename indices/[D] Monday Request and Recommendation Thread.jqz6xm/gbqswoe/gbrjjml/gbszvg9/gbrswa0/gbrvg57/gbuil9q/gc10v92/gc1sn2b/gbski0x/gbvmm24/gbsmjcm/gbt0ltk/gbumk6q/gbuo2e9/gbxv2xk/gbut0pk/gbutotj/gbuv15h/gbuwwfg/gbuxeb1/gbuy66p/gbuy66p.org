Really? The knowledge a doctor gets in med school is nothing to medieval doctors I guess.

I don't know why you think the only skills a doctor can use are from the resources around them but that's just not the case.

There's a reason that people yell doctor when someone is injured on the street. They can provide medical care without their tools because they know more about the human body than anybody else.

I don't know how to convince someone who genuinely believes that modern medical procedure has no practical value. Just insane to me.
