You are quite ignorant when it comes to history, getting most of your information it seems from pop culture, and yet you dare dismiss and outright disrespect a well intentioned informed person on the subject just because it doesn't match what you already know. Shame.

​

Keep in mind that sometimes teachers went to college 20-40 years ago, what they learned may be outdated. What you have been taught may be outdated or not match the current consensus among specialists..

​

Instead of leaving an immature scathing comment in response, you should instead have checked, done some quick googling and in general been a more humble person because that's more conductive to learning and getting closer to the truth.
