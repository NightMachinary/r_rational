Lmao no. These things happened but not in the quantity or quality of experience that you think they happened.

  So, your average peasant was actually someone who traveled a bit, met various people, held several different jobs, possibly fought in several battles, and probably licked some formal and informal education along the way. He would very likely be a "jack of all trades" who could do simple accounting, stitch a wound, dig a grave, ride a horse, shoot a bow, repair a cart, fight in a pike formation, sail a simple boat, survive for weeks in the wilderness, recite a dozen prayers and a hundred folk songs, play a simple instrument, and haggle.

No. I don't know where your conception of the middle ages comes from. This is simply not true. Of course all of these things happen but they don't all occur in the average peasants.

What you described are extremely exceptional circumstances and then applied them to an average that doesn't exist.

They could most likely dig a grave, ride a horse, shoot a bow, repair a cart, recite a dozen prayers and a hundred folk songs, and haggle but the rest are /highly/ specialized.

The fact that these two (several different jobs, possibly fought in several battles who could do simple accounting) are included in what the average peasant does makes me doubt you have any idea what you are talking about. Peasant levies are a function of war which was probably <1% of anyone's average life. And tradesmen have /one/ job that they excel at.

The fact that you think the average peasant was able to do anything beyond the most basic math is incredible.

Literally. In. Credible. As in every single thing here lacks credibility because of this statement.
