I agree mostly about the intelligence difference having a multitude of factors and being a lot more complicated than more education equals more smart. I was kinda just using that fact to snowball into the education difference impact.

I don't agree that a modern person would be useless in a premodern setting. We as a people are incredibly educated and capable when compared to the average serf. Just taking highschool would give any person an incredible amount of advantages in practical knowledge. You probably have 1000 random factoids that would make you far more capable than anyone else in a medieval society. Basic econ 101 would make you a decently successful merchant. Taking meds school or any degree would make you rich as hell. Can you imagine an architect going back? Lucrative life just ready for the taking.

I don't actually know what the uplift genre is but if what it sounds like (modern culture inserted into a premodern setting) then it sounds like boring political thriller at best and a pretty stupid and ill though out fantasy book at worst. There is no practical way to /uplift/ a society without boring gradual reform (which fails 9/10 times) or violent destructive revolution (which often backslides to a less functional world).
