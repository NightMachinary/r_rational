Lmao of course they wouldn't build anything from scratch. I said so in a later comment but I should reiterate here.

None of these people (serfs moderns and pretty much most people) can exist on their own. A peasant can't build a house on their own. Can't farm on their own. They need innumerable material and tools necessary to farm and build. Or do basically anything necessary to live on their own. Modern people would integrate into society and their knowledge base would give them an undeniable advantage. They aren't skilled enough to do ANYTHING on their own. No way. They would die in 3 days. But so would a serf.

It was my understanding of the middle ages that most serfs were contracted to a lord who essentially owned them. They had no human rights and little freedoms. What bargaining power they had was easily overruled by any lord and they had no recourse beyond banditry or starvation.

Iirc serfs didn't go to another lord for contract. They were traded and sold to different lords with no say most of the time. I don't know how city serfs fit in to the dynamic but I can't believe that nobility gave them much power given how they treated most people.

I genuinely thought that crop rotation was invented in like the 1600s lol. History class has failed me.
