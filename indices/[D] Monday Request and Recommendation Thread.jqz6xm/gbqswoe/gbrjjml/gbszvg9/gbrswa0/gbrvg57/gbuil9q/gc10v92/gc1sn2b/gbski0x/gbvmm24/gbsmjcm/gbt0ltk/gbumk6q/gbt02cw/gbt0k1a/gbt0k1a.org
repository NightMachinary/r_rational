I've never seen any torture-porn but I can deduce from what others say that I wouldn't like it.

I have never been to Disneyland but from others I can guess that I might like the experience.

I have never flown on a plane but from description of it it sounds kinda boring

I have never done/seen/read many things. I can still derive opinion on them by comparing them with previous experiences and the opinions of others.

I have heard enough opinions and read enough writing /about/ uplift stories to be confident that I wouldn't like them. In the same way that reading the description on the back of a book might give me a clue on whether or not I might like it.
