  We have mechanized industry and the internet this is not a comparison. You are delusional.

We have mechanized industry /as continent-spanning hives/. Cut off a town, and watch it shrivel when the fuel and foreign-made medicines and shipped-in foodstuffs run out. And then look at the people in there- frontend webdevs, baristas, hair stylists... A lot of people who'd have to learn a lot of things, quickly.

  Each man lives as the most indolent ruler did 500 years ago. Indolent. How fares a king if you take him out of his castle, and put him in the woods? Worse than a woodsman, I suspect.

(Also, this isn't true. A major part of the value of being an ancient king would be that you're /high-status/. There's a legion of people beneath you. Modernity can't give that to every man; likely nothing can.)

  val peasants societies were far less fragile over time than moderns

  A broken bones was very likely to permanently cripple them. This is false.
#+end_quote

You misunderstand. Their /societies/ were less fragile, not the individuals.

There are a lot of things our society does better than theirs, but a lot of things were lost along the way.

You seem quite attached to Whig history. Why?
