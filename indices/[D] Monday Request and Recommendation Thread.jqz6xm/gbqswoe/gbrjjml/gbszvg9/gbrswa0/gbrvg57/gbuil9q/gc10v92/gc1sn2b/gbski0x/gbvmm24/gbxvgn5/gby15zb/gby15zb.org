I guess I worded that poorly - I'm quite familiar with the studies you're talking about, and I didn't mean to turn this into an argument about semantics. The point I was trying to make is that your claim, namely

#+begin_quote
  [the heritability of IQ] puts a ceiling on how much education can even affect it
#+end_quote

is not a valid statement - the two things have nothing to do with each other. (to be more pedantic, heritability is an (estimate of the) upper bound on how much genetics can influence a trait, and nothing more)

twin studies do in fact measure heritability, not "genetics" or "heredity" or anything else

anyway, to not go to far afield, and lest you think I'm being overly critical of you, I'm in complete agreement with your takeaway:

#+begin_quote
  A modern would be worse than useless in a premodern setting without a ton of handwaving. Maybe if someone was able to go back with a carefully chosen skill set, reference books, and equipment, and then got lucky, but that's really just acknowledging how critical the infrastructural component is. Moderns have an overinflated opinion of themselves
