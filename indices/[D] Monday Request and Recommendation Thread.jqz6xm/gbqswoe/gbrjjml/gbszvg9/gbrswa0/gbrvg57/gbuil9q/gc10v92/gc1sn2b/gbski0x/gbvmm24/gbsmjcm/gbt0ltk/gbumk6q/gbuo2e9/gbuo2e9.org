I talk about this in a later comment.

It's a base of knowledge that was be built on with practical education in the given setting.

Of course you won't just show up and know everything about everything in medicine or architectural stuff that would be dumb.

Also the idea that modern medical practice wouldn't be a sharp improvement if unreal. /Sanitation/ wasn't even an idea back then. Just that would rock their world. Plus of course architects wouldn't just start doing their thing out of nowhere. They would apprentice with a current one and assimilate their knowledge base into a cohesive whole.
