Norway is a western nation. Just read the Wikipedia article on the FLynn effect, it was pretty decent with some OK citations, makes me feel like I want to read that 2007 book. They don't really know the mechanism but the leading hypothesis seems to be related to living conditions like diet, and then after that more familiarity with tets. As nations become more fully developed this ceases to meaningfully change, so they stop, but most of the world's population is still in developing nations, maily India and China but also in Africa and South America, so the effect probably still has some gasps as a global average thing, though it seems you're right that it's dead in the west or the global north or whatever we're calling rich nations these days.
