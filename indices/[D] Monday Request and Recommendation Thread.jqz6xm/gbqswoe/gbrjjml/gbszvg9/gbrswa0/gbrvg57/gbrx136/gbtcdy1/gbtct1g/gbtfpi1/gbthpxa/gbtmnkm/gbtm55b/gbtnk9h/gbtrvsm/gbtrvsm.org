the idea of peasant (individual that farm/grind for "society") is valable in any setting I think.\\
the idea of peasont (weak and stupid/non-learned individual that cultivate to feed a society) can only be true in a society that keep them weak and nonlearned voluntary or unvolontary.

examples of litrpg where peasant can be a thing :\\
levels can only be obtained in rare place or with difficult to obtain. Here we could have farmer-king, they are king because they have the power of good food source. Or we could have warrior-king, they have the power of saying to other give me food or else.\\
(with complementary noble and other class and state sanctionned assassin in case a non state accepted individual became too trooblesome to contain)\\
(incidantally this seem to be the world of "milo two" on royal road)

levels can be hearned pretty easily but are skewed toward combat and magic. This is the standard litrpg trope, where we do have boost to strength, but no boost to "grow speed" of plants, magic is an elistist art that snob dirt bound individual or is only capable of launching ball of destructive power (good for digging stuff in non-combat application, but not to grow food) meat would be major part of the food culture if monster/beast meat is edible\\
(this seem te be the world of "Azarynth Healer" en royal road)

level can be hearned pretty easily, they uncompass all potential skill that are acknowledge by "users\\
I have yet to see a good representation of a world building of this type of litrpg.\\
I have read good writing and compelling character, but not extremely good world building.\\
if you really want to dig deep in the "litrpg cant be good at world building" you need to take a look at three fact that are easily dismissed (the common way to dismiss this is the creationist mythologie : the world is like that, the end)\\
1) what relation does "the level system" have with "reality" ? is level a summary of reality ? when you level up, does it rewrite reality ? are level a new kind of "muscle" that the user can manipulate (generaly expressed as the "soul" in story) ?\\
2) beast/sentient divide : you need to answer that phylosophical question for the fictionnal world, otherwise, you cant say that animal cant have skills. where do you put the bar "can have skill" and "this is a person; an individual"\\
3) how did life evolve with an extra dimensional muscle (the level system). Are muscle weaker in general because it's more efficient to rely on the "strength" modifier ?\\
if the level system is a summary of reality and there is no divide of beast/sentient, does it mean that there are a lot less evolutionary dead end because living being in general are more informed of what they are and what are the consequence of their act are ? or maybe it means that all of reality is sentient in some way, because since there is no difference between beast/human, what make the difference between beast/non-living being ?
