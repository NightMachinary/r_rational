If you only rely on the high level farmers (who are inevitably older) then when they die you're shit out of luck. You have to have the lower levels doing their part because otherwise within a generation you won't /have/ any high levels.

And then there's the unique timesinks of such settings: magic items and rare ingredients. A high-level farmer could farm faster than a low level one, sure, but maybe his expertise is needed to farm the finicky magic crops the city's alchemists need to brew potions? Perhaps going up levels only lets you farm regular crops twice as quickly, and the reward is being able to handle superior crops at all?
