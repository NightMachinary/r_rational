Not to mention a Baron self-aware of these rules would seek out and destroy medium-leveled people he can't control (whether or not they're lawful/criminal) to maintain power, likely while maintaining a propaganda veil to ensure the rest of the population cooperates. "Noble lines" might just mean a Baron's children have a levelling advantage and are more likely to take the power as it's passed on. Couple this with many "tiers" of this power, where every Baron is paranoid of his populus, and every King above him is paranoid of his Barons - or power vacuums which could feed new leveling. Then as soon as the first peasant newcomer manages to overthrow his local Baron, he's likely to get a stern talking to by the Higher Powers (even if they were secretly helping him) and will be encouraged to play nice by the game, with increased scrutiny if he tries to keep climbing. Overthrows may then just be shifts in power from one person to another, with the overall societal structure staying about the same. This is all, of course, perfectly aligned with the common medieval fantasy conception, and not too far off from reality - but with taxes and armies instead of levels and personal power.
