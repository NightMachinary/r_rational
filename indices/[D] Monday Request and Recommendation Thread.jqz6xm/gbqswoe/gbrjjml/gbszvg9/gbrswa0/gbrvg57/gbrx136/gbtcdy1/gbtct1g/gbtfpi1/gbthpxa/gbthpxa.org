Those are all wonderful ideas. If the baron existed. If he had the ability or power to hold land. If 90% of the population didn't have the ability to completely override any authority he has given sufficient time.

The landed gentry are not capable of holding land in a litrpg society. They shouldn't even be able to be classed into because that assumes they have ever existed in the first place. Second of all the ability for farmers to even function in a litrpg society is also super questionable given the existence of 1000 monsters per each farm and a lack of sufficient manpower to ever cover all the farms needed to feed a country.

A litrpg country would be fed by monster meat, magic, or not fed at all.

You have reached the first layer of making a consistent and logical world, the appearance. A litrpg world is incapable of holding up to any scrutiny or basic logic beyond appearing to have some.
