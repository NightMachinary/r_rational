It's not impossible to write it so it has some self consistency. E.G. you don't pick a class, the system assigns it to you based on your upbringing when you come of age. The peasant class provides highly limited advancement opportunities, and peasant parents raise peasant children. That would create even less social mobility than reality, since the nobles, or even the yeomanry would be stronger, smarter, etc than the peasantry.

However I would still expect levels to have an effect here, a small number of high level peasants should be more effective at running a farm than a large number of low level peasants. Which should have major effects on the worldbuilding.
