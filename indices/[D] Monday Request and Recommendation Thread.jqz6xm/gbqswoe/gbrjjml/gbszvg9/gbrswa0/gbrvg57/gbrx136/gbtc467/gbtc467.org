A litRPG system world that looks like medieval fantasy feels innately implausible to me since medieval fantasy worlds are defined by the feudal pyramid where most people are farmers, and litRPG systems lead towards quality over quantity.

If one high level farmer is worth many low level farmers, what is all that spare manpower doing? [[https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/bsaire/how_many_soldiers_would_it_take_to_kill_a_level/][A quick google suggests a level 20 fighter can defeat 80 to 100 level one guards.]]. So what would be the consequences on a medieval society where the food supply was fulfilled by 100th of the manpower?

(Note, a story that explores what a society with this kind of system would actually be like would be catnip to me)
