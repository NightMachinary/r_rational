You're making strong assumptions that are not in any way inherent to the genre.

There's nothing inherent to litRPG that implies the monster density has to be high. Nor is there anything that says 90% of the population can override the gentry's authority given sufficient time. A [Baron] or other Noble class might get better per-level progression than most classes. And as a hybrid of a land manager and feudal fighter he might get the enviable ability to level up his combat abilities without doing dangerous things like raiding dungeons full of monster. That would severely limit the percentage of people who could override his authority.

I'd say there's only two real rules. A RPG style system encourages quality over quantity, and a RPG style system encourages people to specialize in their class' area of competence.

Neither of these rules veto the existence of a landed gentry. If anything they make it easier, since the quality over quantity rule makes it easier to run a society based around a small high level elite who're loyal to each other.
