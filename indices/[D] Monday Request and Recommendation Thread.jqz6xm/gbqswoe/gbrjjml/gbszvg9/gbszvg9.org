I agree with the criticism, at least tentatively. We don't really know where Milo lands on the power scale yet, we only have one person to gauge his strength against, and give the social restrictions that person is apparently under, he is probably on the lower end of the scale. For all we know Milo may be decidedly average, at least for the upper class.

That said, its my favorite new read from royalroad recently, so I hope it stays good.
