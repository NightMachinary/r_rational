I second this, It's been a rather good read so far. My only criticism is that the protagonists' power level feels a bit "cheated". Yes, he has knowledge that puts him far above the 99th percentile when it comes to average scientific understanding of a medieval world but he unlocks frankly ridiculous abilities (notably Skim which is potentially "gamebreaking" and Fetch Book) within a couple days of arrival and almost instantly becomes far more effective in all classical adventuring roles (scouting, fighting, ranged, utility, etc) than his companion, Backlebutt, who's been living in the world for decades but is seemingly completely combat ineffective because he doesn't have a bow.

This falls a bit into one of my pet peeves: Authors (often subconsciously) assuming that people in medieval or primitive settings are stupid when this is just plain wrong--in fact there's a reasonable argument for stating that people used to be more intelligent than they are today because their ability to think correlated more directly to their survival odds. Yes, people in ye' ole' times didn't have as much knowledge as we do today, but it's not like they wouldn't be able to munchkin a system
