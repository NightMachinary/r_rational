I guess I need to demonstrate that knowing the inner workings of something has practical value?

I'm not a doctor but knowing how the human body works has got to have like a billion practical applications. I don't understand how you can just handwave medical school and say medieval people already knew that stuff. That's just not true. They had an extremely large deficit of knowledge.

I genuinely want to know how you think a modern doctor would work in medieval times. Would he just be useless? All the other doctors of that time would know more/be better than him? If you believe that I have a very nice bridge to sell you.
