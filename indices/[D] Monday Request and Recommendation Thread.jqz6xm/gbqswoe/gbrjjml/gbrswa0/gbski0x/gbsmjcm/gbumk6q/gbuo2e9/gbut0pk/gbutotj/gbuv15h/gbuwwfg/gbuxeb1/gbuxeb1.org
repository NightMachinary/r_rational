It is probably the case that medieval doctors, who understood the tools and resources they had at hand, would outperform a modern doctor for a very long period of time unless the modern doctor also knew how to manufacture medicine without modern tools, yes. It's like I said my dude modern medicine is only as effective as it is because of the tools and resources and infrastructure involved. Without that infrastructure, it is considerably less effective. You're mostly just looking at vaccination, which is indeed useful, but also required a centralized state for dispersement and uh that's a big no go there.
