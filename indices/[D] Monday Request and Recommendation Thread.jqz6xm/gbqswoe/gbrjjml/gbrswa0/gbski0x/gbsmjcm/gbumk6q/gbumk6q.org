Basic econ 101 would be close to useless in a medieval period because the fundamentals of how markets and economies in general functioned was completely different. Even something like a medical degree would be close to useless because so much of modern medicine is entirely reliant on modern infrastructure in order to function. This problem is basically repeated again and again for most things of that sort - a modern architect would be much less useful than you would think because modern architecture relies on modern tools and infrastructure and materials.
