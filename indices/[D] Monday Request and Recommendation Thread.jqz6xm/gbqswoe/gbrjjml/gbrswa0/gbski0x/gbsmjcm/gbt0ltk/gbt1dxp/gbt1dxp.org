  The problem is that actually applying that knowledge is very tricky and depends on a ton of details that aren't included in our education. Modern education is a fantastic base to build from, but includes relatively little that can be directly applied, especially outside the context of modern society.

Yes. That's a good way to phrase it. It gives an extra head start to whoever goes back and then they can add to that with real practical know-how of the premodern setting. Just going back and using advanced knowledge has tons of logistical and practical issues that would be worked through but in the end any modern person would be able to find successful use out of modern knowledge.

There are so many things we take for granted. So many incredibly original ideas that haven't been invented.

French fries. Hamburgers. Snowboards. Tennis. Chess. Music.

All of those have logistical and practical issues but it's a limitless supply of cool ideas to implement and profit from.
