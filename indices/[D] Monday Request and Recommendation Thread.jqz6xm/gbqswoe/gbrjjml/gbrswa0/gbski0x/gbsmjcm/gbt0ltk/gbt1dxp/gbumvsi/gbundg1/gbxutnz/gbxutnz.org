I think the point that the things you mentioned are not new inventions is actually pretty valid. Really what you're describing are cultural shifts. People ate fried potatoes, skiied, and yeah, they had chess. Early moderns would almost certainly hate modern music, old people from a generation before tended to hate rock and early moderns would be like 7-15 generations before. If you went back in time with a guitar and a knowledge of mdoern pop people would be as likely to laugh at you as to enjoy the music. It's certainly not a slam dunk
