I could see some similarities, but I think there'd definitely be some differences too.

In Xanxia non-cultivators are usually portrayed as living rather normal lives. But in a litRPG world, even peasant farmers would have a thing going on where a small number of high level peasants would be more productive than lots of low level peasants. And they'd acuminulate levels by farming so you'd expect to see most farmers reach a decent level as they age. That will have a big worldbuilding effect.

More relevantly for a typical adventure story. Typically in Xanxia when you level up you improve in all respects, you're faster, stronger, tougher, etc. In litRPG I'd expect to see a lot more disparities. You'll have tank classes who at high levels could stand their ground against a charging elephant. You'd have wizards who could flatten entire battlefields but might die from one well aimed arrow. So unlike Xanxia you'll see interdependent and synergistic teams as opposed to individual masters.
