  So people will stop getting serf classes.

How? Surfs and their children do not have much freedom to peruse personal advancement. Your father is a surf, you're stuck surfing until you come of age and the system assigns you the surf class.

  The fighter has the ability to level above the baron and anyone else. Meaning he cannot be controlled by him.

  If a citizen has the capability to level to a point where he no longer has to obey the law then it has no legitimacy.

This is nonsense. Society will not fall apart overnight because it's possible for someone to level up to the point they're stronger than the current authority system any more than actual medieval society fell apart because it was possible that one day the neighbouring kingdom will get strong enough to invade. Historically the possibility of invasion didn't cause society to instantly buckle under the strain of constantly building bigger armies.

All you need is a strong incentive for the majority of people to participate in society rather than obsessively chase power. If the system makes it clear that you're already out the running for top dog once you get [surf] or [blacksmith] that would do it. If the baron is the highest levelled and most powerful fighter around, and most people who try to sneak of and grind die before they hope to catch up with them that would do it too.

It's certainly a world where it's easier for a small group or lone individual to make trouble on a national scale. But there's a long difference between that and society not existing.
