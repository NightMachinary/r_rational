I am 75% convinced that a completely thought out worldbuilding of litrpg would look a lot like a XanXia world (sects of increasingly powerful people) that is mainly inhabited by the elves in the Azarinth Healer story.

The way the xanxia look would be flavour at this point. For example: monster around the centre of population is made of wood and fast breeding and getting exponentially powerful give a sedentary city of hunters that regulate fire.\\
another example: beasts in the continent breed slowly and do not grow in power. This lead to either a weak society that look a lot like medieval life, but with the occasional kaiju monster. or a society of nomad that hunt according to the power of the beast and/or organised breeding of beast.

anyway, that my two cents.
