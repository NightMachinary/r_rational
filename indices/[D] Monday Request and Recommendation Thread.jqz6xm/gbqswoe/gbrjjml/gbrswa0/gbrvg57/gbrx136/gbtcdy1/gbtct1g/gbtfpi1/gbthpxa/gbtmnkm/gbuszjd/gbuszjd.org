I guess this needs more explanation. First paragraph is about how a ruling class needs little to no opposition to function. Second is about the effect of social groups gaining more power.

A baron cannot exist if his people can oppose him without enacting some cost that makes it not worth it. For example a president exists because the cost of killing him would be astronomical for other countries much less an individual citizen. But when all of your people have a chance to become invulnerable to physical harm (or high level enough to repeatedly oppose him) then the baron has no way to enforce his rule.

I touch on this in an earlier comment but the easy opportunity to advance beyond your station necessarily leads to the elimination of that class group. We see this in history as well. When a specific class of people has the ability to rise out of poor circumstances that inevitably leads to it's dissolution. Serfs don't exist (in western society) because the people gained enough bargaining power to guarantee things like human rights and basic freedoms. In litrpg the serfs have infinite bargaining power.

A state cannot function without a monopoly on violence. This doesn't mean only the state can be violent just that a government has to have the only /legitimate/ use of force. When everyone can legitimize their own violence through overwhelming force it doesn't function. The fact that citizens can refuse the rule of law and reliably survive guarantees the total collapse of society.
