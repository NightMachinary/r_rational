People in medieval or primitive settings are /ignorant/ generally speaking. They (serfs only) lack knowledge because of a lack of formal education. This generally means they are dumber. Not because all people were just dumber but because education correlates very well with iq.

A average peasants ability to think does not correlate with survival. They never gained any survival skills period. Because all they did was farm or die from preventable diseases. A 14 year old kid from Indiana has a better chance of living on their own. Because peasants stay on a farm for 30 years and then die. They never needed to or were approaching any kind of intelligence. Deliberately. The noble class withheld any form of literacy or education and filled their heads with religion and dogma.

Peasants are stupid. 1v1 modern people beat peasants in every metric. They are just shitty versions of us.
