I guarantee if you randomly selected 10 people from 14-40 years of age living in the US, you would find maybe 1 person able to farm at all or live off the land at all or build a house from nothing. This is even an exaggeration. Crop rotation also dates back to 6000 BCE lmao. Cash crops are what led to soil depletion, not a lack of knowledge. Also, while serfs were generally rooted down, they were also the minority of peasants. Peasants in general were able to move around, contract with other lords, and so on to bargain for better conditions and the like. This was most prominent after the bubonic plague but was also a thing before it. Peasants also obviously had to move in to cities - not all urban growth occured as a result of industrialization. In general, the stagnancy and stratification and general lack of knowledge of the middle ages is pretty exaggerated compared to how it actually was.
