This isn't remotely correct and is especially not correct for what we would think of as primitive societies. Serfs in particular were more tied down and had less skills than an average peasant but even they would have much more knowledge when it comes to survival skills. We're talking about shit like building a house, starting a fire, how to effectively farm the land they have, how to identify edible plants in a particular region from non edible ones, and so on. None of these skills would be remotely present in your 14 year old from Indiana. This isn't to say that a modern person isn't smarter or stronger than your average peasant or serf but that's mostly orthogonal to their survival skills. This is of course without getting into how educated or socially mobile peasants actually were. The idea that a random 21st century teenager or adult in the US or another western country would have even close to the survival skills of a random peasant or serf is just completely laughable.
