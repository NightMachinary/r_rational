Tell you what I really don't enjoy, the author's constant inane commentary about their ranking. Who cares about that other than them?

It's also so transparently manipulative that it's irritating, it reads like a company's marketing department.

Complaining that people leave half star ratings while begging for five stars so that they can be the top rated story so they can get more views so they can get more money. Obviously the story is not a half star but it's not remotely perfect.

At the end of the day it's not a super big deal but after every chapter here is another sentence just to ruin your immersion

Also it seems likely that anyone else who had his class would try those things unless they can't see the game interface
