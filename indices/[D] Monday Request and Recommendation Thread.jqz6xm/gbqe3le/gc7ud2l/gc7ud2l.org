This spawned a binge read of the whole series this week. (They're only just passed Leviathan so far!) Pretty cool, for the concept of the character and the committee-style writing if nothing else. Enjoyed it a lot. Think the point system is a bit cheesy and ends up in min/maxing more than choosing for storytelling, but it's interesting that this aspect is kinda also part of the personality and power of the main character - so it ties in. Interesting to see "bored with life because it's all just a game with no real consequences" as a power personality - it's a feeling we've all known, just from beating a game too thoroughly or falling into internet nihilism, and it really fits Echo well - and means something when he overcomes it. One Punch Man similar theming.
