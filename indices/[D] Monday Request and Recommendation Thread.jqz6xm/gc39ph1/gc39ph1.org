I'm looking for a story about puzzle solving. Not Sherlock-holmes-style "look how smart and deductive the MC is" puzzle solving, but actual "here's an interesting puzzle, see if you can work it out" puzzle solving.

Good mystery novels and/or DnD-style puzzles would be great, but I'd really love to find a story that involves logic or math puzzles, if anybody knows of one.
