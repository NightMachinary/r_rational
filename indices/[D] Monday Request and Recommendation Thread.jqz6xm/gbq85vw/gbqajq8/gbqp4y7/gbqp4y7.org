This story's a bit controversial on this site, with as many people liking it as disliking it. There's no question that the protagonist is OP, but I really like the way the OPness is done. Despite his supreme talent in making new, powerful spells, the protagonist is a terrible combatant, at least for head-on combat. However he excels in doing what mages are good at, precision drone strikes with nuclear payloads.
