I read this and liked it, but I was slightly put off by the rational for the main plot. It wasn't real clear why the protagonist wanted to stop the antagonist, nor what the antagonist was even really hoping to achieve. I don't mean that reasons weren't given, it's just that they felt penciled in as though they didn't matter beyond being needed to set the narrative struggle in motion. It would have been a much better book if this was more fleshed out.
