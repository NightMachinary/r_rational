[[https://fanfiction.net/s/7679074/1/The-Dragon-King-s-Temple][The Dragon King's Temple]] is an excellent /Avatar: The Last Airbender/ and /Stargate: SG-1/ crossover in which Zuko and Toph have to work with the SG-1 team to get home (and defeat a nasty spirit on the way). You can tell that the author has put /a lot/ of thought into how to make two different series mesh, and it works really well. The characters are mostly rational, and when they're not, the author is doing it on purpose and has a good reason for it. This is one of those stories where instead of you saying “Why didn't the author think of that?”, the author makes you go “Why didn't /I/ think of that?”
