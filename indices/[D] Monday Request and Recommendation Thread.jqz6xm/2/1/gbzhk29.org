Currently reading this based on your recommendation. I'm about halfway through.

If you don't like stories that kind of... praise themselves on how amazing and quirky and whatever their characters are? this might not be a story for you. (I think this is a common fanfic thing where the author write about characters they think are awesome and get stuck talking about it a lot instead of just having them continue to do awesome things like in the source material). There have also been some displays of headcannon/lore changes/attitude changes that don't seem necessary and kind of grate. But maybe they will pay off in the latter half?
