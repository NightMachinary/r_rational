Yep. I would say tin and copper seldom being found in the same place is one of the defining aspects of the bronze age. It fosters those complex international trade networks I mentioned and it's why you can find tin from Britain half the world away

On the topic of the story, I was really pleased it acknowledged early iron tools were worse than late bronze. Massive pet peeve of mine.
