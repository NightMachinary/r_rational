I started reading [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35925/the-many-lives-of-cadence-lee][The Many Lives of Cadence Lee]], and it's been pretty good so far.

There's your typical "reincarnation with skills in another world" that define so many LitRPGs, but with a catch - every time the MC dies, she's reborn in another world that she hasn't been to before. And she's "graded" on her past life, which in turn influences her next life.

Also, mild spoiler, the MC isn't always reincarnated in medieval European setting. Her third life is as the princess of the equivalent of ancient Egypt during the Bronze age.
