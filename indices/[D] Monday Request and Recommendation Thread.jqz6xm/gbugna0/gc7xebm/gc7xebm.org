There's [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-wand-for-skitter.730018/][A Wand for Skitter]] that's unlike any other Harry Potter insert I've ever seen. It's kind of an SI, since even though it's a crossover insert, it only barely resembles the nominal character.

I should warn you that story is kind of like the video of "It's the Bee Movie but it speeds up every time someone says the word Bee." Except replacing 'bee' with Harry Potter and murder.
