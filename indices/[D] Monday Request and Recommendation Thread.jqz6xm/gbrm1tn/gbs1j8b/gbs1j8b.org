Kushiel's Dart by Jacqueline Carey maybe? The whole world has a different view on sexuality and religion, which the author infuses wonderfully into the daily lives of the main character and those around her. There's a lot of kinky sex, but it never feels gratuitous, and there's a lot of skinship as well between characters as well (not always romantic either!). Highly recommend because it's a great book and series, not just because of the romance and sex.

/Maybe/ Spice and Wolf by Isuna Hasekura. It's primarily a romance series between wolf goddess Holo and traveling merchant Lawrence. There's intimacy and skinship between the two that slowly progresses. However, it being a Japanese Romance, the development is slow as fuck and takes forever. However, the banter between the two is great, and the exploration part of it is also satisfying. YMMV
