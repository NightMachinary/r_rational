After reading a couple of books that have this dynamic, I am really craving novels where the characters aren't so physically distant. A pithy way of putting this would be "why are these people not playing with each other's hair if they're such good friends"; as examples, I'd offer The Long Way to A Small Angry Planet and especially The Boneless Mercies by April Genevieve Tucholke (not that I'm suggesting those are rational/ist works, mind you).

(This request is brought to you by me missing my friends, whose laps were great pillows for reading books on.)
