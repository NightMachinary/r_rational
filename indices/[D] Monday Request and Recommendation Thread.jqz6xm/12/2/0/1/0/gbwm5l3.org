I'm not refuting your point, but I feel like that mostly applied only to his own field of magic? For any other field he actually has to spend the time experimenting and studying to make any headway. I'd say this is especially noticeable in the later chapters when he's trying to figure out [Teleport] and other basic spells.

Also, the author mostly fixes that plothole by making it a part of the plot itself. All archmages have their own specialties in magic, and the rhymes are Erick's specialty.
