I attempted to have some characters play this way in [[http://www.amazon.com/Forging-Divinity-Andrew-Rowe-ebook/dp/B00TKFFR36/][Forging Divinity]], but I "cheated" to some extent in that the true Chessmaster characters are barely seen on-screen. It would be significantly more challenging to show all of the character's actions in detail.

I do a bit of this with Jonan, one of my perspective characters - he's sort of a fledgling at the Chessmaster game. My primary means of showing this is that he's all about gathering information - through conversation, through spies, through creatively applying his magic, etc. Similarly, he tries to control how important information is distributed; the more control he has over valuable points of data, the more leverage he has over his competition.

He's still a novice at this type of thing, which is deliberate - I want to show him growing into larger and more complex plots over time and gradually realizing how far behind the curve he is compared to characters that have had generations to plan.

I'll also recommend the Metropolitan Man by [[/u/alexanderwales]] as a higher level depiction of it.

You also get hints of this type of character later on in the Mistborn trilogy by Brandon Sanderson - [[#s][spoilers for book 3]]
