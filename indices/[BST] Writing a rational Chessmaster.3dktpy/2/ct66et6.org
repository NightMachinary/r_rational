Also, a Chessmaster doesn't need to have plots for every individual, although extreme ones can. A means to access the key individuals in a network with the most influence on everyone else is enough. Littlefinger from ASoIaF is an example: true, he has wealth and mercenaries, but his chessmastering is accomplished through individual relationships with nobles he knows well, or people who have a prior connection to such nobles. Being able to predict these few people, and having general contingencies for the outcomes of chaotic situations (the tactical, spontaneous side of chessmastering) is enough.
