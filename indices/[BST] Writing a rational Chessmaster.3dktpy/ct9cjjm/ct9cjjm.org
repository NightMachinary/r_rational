Doing realistic Chessmasters is difficult. But if I had to write a /Guide For Aspiring Magnificent Bastards/, it would rely on perhaps these three principles:

- *Grand Strategy*: Clearly define your ultimate goals, and choose all your actions based on whether they advance those goals or not. If you have a sufficiently large goal that will require a lot of subsidiary steps, you'll automatically come out of it looking like a Chessmaster, for the simple reason that you're unconcerned with individual battles, as it were. You can just as easily 'lose' a battle if it moves you towards your goal. Moves that look locally suboptimal, or even like accidents or setbacks, are simply folded into your plans, because they are /globally/ optimal (with respect to your ultimate goals). In that sense, being a Chessmaster is more about the long view and perfect focus on one's objectives than some kind of perfect predictive ability. To a great extent, this is actually how real chess players think.

- *Expand Your Options*: You can take it for granted that for any sufficiently complex goal, there are too many variables to make perfect predictions. Something /will/ go wrong. There's nothing for it to be keep adapting your plans as circumstances change. For this purpose, it helps to maximize your options. Someone with ten available actions is better off than someone with only two or three. Luthor in /Metropolitan Man/ is an excellent example: his wealth gives him options that most people don't have, and the same goes for his criminal connections.

- *Seize Opportunities*: The flip side of the previous principle. Things never go quite the way you want them to, but sometimes that's good. Keep your eyes open for random factors that improve your position, and incorporate them into your plans whenever you can.

There are probably a few more things you can put in that are specific to this kind of character. Off-hand, I can think of things like keeping your true goals secret (less opposition that way), constantly acquiring and updating intel on all the major players, and playing the various sides off against each other.
