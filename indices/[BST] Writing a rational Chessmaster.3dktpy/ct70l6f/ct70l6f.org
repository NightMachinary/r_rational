They have to manage three forces.

The people's will. The vast unwashed masses of people who may fight, pay or watch whatever schemes. They have to consider the social views of them, what pressures there are, and how to use them. Can they raise their anger to pressure someone? Lower it to support some scheme?

Key individuals. There will be a number of key individuals whose reactions they must manipulate or predict. Politicians, warriors, mages, whatever. They should try and understand the motivations of these people and predict how they would fit into their plan.

Alternate sources of power. The death star. Kryptonite. The printing press. How does their thinking wrap around great technology? How are they evading problems and increasing their power using it, how could it be used against them?

For each group they should have spies, several plans and backup plans and goals, and the story can cover how their plans and goals influence each of those people. They don't have to consider all of them simultaneously.
