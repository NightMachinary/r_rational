/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][The Metropolitan Man]]/ has Lex Luthor as a Chessmaster, and I tried my best to make him rational.

If you want a Chessmaster that's believable, he can't just be pulling plots out of his butt, at least not until he's already demonstrated sufficient planning and preparation to the audience (even then, use sparingly). This means getting in the Chessmaster's head; the reader should be able to see which plots are being hastily abandoned and which ones are (surprisingly) going off without a hitch. He should have contingency plans for when he fails. He doesn't have one monolithic plot that can collapse, he's got several self-contained plots that can act like crumple zones on a car if something goes wrong.

Most of what you want is that rational quality of actual cognitive effort. Think about the resources that your Chessmaster might have, then think about how he would accomplish his goals, then think about all the ways that the plan could be refined, and how it could go wrong. Figure out all the branches of plotting, then show some of them to the reader. (The biggest problem is that you want these plots to make sense, which usually means doing straightforward things. That tends to be less fun.)
