I suppose the problem with normal fiction is that you either have it go right from the beginning, or you have someone say what's supposed to happen and then have it go wrong. That means you can show off at most one back-up plan. Or more accurately, you can show off as many as you want, but they have to happen in series. If you want to make someone look smart, you have ten different things that happen correctly in succession. You can't do it by the more realistic method of having ten different backup planes based on different ways the very simple original plan might go wrong.
