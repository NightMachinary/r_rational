When you set things up so no matter what someone does you win, that's a Xanatos Gambit. When you set it up so it works based on what you know they'll do, it's a Batman Gambit. When you set it up based on a long series of actions that you'd never realistically be able to predict, that's a Xanatos Roulette.

A rational Chessmaster would stick to Xanatos Gambits.
