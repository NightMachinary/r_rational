This is a Mage Wars fanfiction I started writing a couple days ago. Not entirely certain whether it counts as a reverse portal fantasy, since in the story our world is a magical simulation within the world of Etheria. The story is tentatively titled "5000 PE" where PE means Pax Etheria, and 5000 PE refers to the year.
