Hm.

[[/u/eaglejarl][u/eaglejarl]]'s [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11361802/1/What-if-SG-1-weren-t-stupid][/What if SG-1 weren't stupid?/]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11530632/1/Supernaturally-Rational][/Supernaturally Rational/]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11583263/1/Episodic-Parody-The-Flash][/Episodic Parody: The Flash/]] would probably count.

[[https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/27/a-modern-myth/][/A Modern Myth/]] is fairly light-hearted, but I'm not sure if it's light-hearted enough.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][/Harry Potter and the Natural 20/]], /Harry the Hufflpuff ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff][{1}]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7330591/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff-2][{2}]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10843543/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff-3-Harry-s-Year-off][{3}]])/ and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][/Seventh Horcrux/]] are fun, but their rationality is dubious.

That's... all, off the top of my head.
