A Black Comedy, by the same author as Seventh Horcrux. If you liked the latter, you'll like the former. Basically a buddy-cop story between Harry and Sirius, except they aren't cops, and they don't respect the law at all, and in fact make a mockery of self-respecting institutions such as the Wizengamot,

Don't let the title fool you, it's really got very little super serious stuff. There is a bit of seriousness, but it's pretty dedicated to being humorous throughout. Not quite a crack fic, but as close as you can get without being one. It's kinda like the silly portions of HPMOR except a whole story of them.

(also, it's the origin of the name David Monroe. or at least it's where Eliezer got the name from. Warning: if you haven't read HPMOR, reading this fic and learning about the character David Monroe could spoil the big reveal in HPMOR.)
