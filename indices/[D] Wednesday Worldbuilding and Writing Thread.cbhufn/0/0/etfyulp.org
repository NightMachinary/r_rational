it would be very interesting but difficult to pull off, I feel. There's a lot of problems to resolve about a realistic take on yugioh's world, starting with the logistics of Duel Monsters. Frankly, the card game really shouldn't be that popular unless it is liberally being bankrolled by Pegasus or Kaiba. You have the implication that the most powerful cards are only printed in extreeeemely limited runs (exodia and BEWB), but also that there are so many cards someone who lives in a game shop can be consistently surprised by them, but despite this is still considered a competitive game.

Still, I'd definitely read it if you managed it.
