  I think it'd be better to just have the original protagonist be a little smarter and fill the role you're describing instead.

/Maybe/. But as he's rather a Gary Stu in canon, there's something to be said for him not getting everything right.

The villains didn't accelerate that hard on purpose. One of the kidnappers got careless, the girl kicked him in the gut, and he fell onto the controls.

  What form does the energy come out in? Is there a minimum amount of matter that can be transformed at once?

That's not made entirely clear, but it's apparently possible to produce nearly pure kinetic energy, since the first ever result was that a copper bath from a lab went flying out of a window at supersonic speeds, and the second test sent a wire through a brick wall. It's equally possible to simply make a large bomb, which has a mushroom cloud etc but negligible fallout.
