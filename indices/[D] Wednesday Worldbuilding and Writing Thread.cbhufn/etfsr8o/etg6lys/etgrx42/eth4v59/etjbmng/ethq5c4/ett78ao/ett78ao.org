Would food, for example, be affected? People think of food pretty often, and expect it to be filling and hopefully tasty. Food is already filling, generally, so is it unaffected or is it more filling?

I'm a little confused on what kind of ideas would be usable. If there's a million units of thought A, and one unit of thought B, where B says something happens because/through A, how powerful is the effect of thought B? Should the process or the pool be focused on?
