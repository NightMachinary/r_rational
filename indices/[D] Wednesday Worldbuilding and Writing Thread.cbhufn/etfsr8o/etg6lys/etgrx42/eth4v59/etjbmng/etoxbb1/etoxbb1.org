What specifically do you imagine that the idea of a serial killer does? What abilities does a 'serial killer' have? They don't tend to be particular good fighters and with my limited horror movie experience I think their only thing is knowing where their prey is and being able to teleport, is there anything else?

If the knowledge of the world functioning like this became wide spread, then yes it would seem that realistic horror movies would be banned, or at least severely limited.
