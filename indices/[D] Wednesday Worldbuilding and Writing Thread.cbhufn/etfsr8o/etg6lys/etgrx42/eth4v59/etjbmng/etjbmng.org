Soooo... how crazy powerful are serial killers in this world? I imagine that's an idea that gets a lot of input (due to horror movies) but has a fairly limited ouput due to the lack of serial killers available. So then, wouldn't any individual serial killer have an enormous amount of power to draw on, making them Jason Voorhees-level powerful when they do their thing?

Would making movies about true crime, or other "realistic" horror be forbidden in this world?
