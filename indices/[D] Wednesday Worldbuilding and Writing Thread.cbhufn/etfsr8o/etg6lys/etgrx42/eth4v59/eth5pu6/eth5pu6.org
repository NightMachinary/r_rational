Thanks!

I agree that sky in itself doesn't do anything. It's adjacent to 'heaven' in the memetic landscape which have a host of actions associated with it and the Greeks are definitely drawing power from the planets by the association of names.

There are definitely [[https://psychics.co.uk/blog/cloud-reading-divination/][people who think that they can read the future from reading clouds]] which would establish a link to the cloud idea and drain power that way. They should be in the minority though so the connection is weak and infrequently used.

What kind of abstract concepts? Freedom is a counter-idea that works against say direct mind control and possibly other things. Good has a connotation of sacrifice and eventual victory that would seem to affect probability somewhat.

Not seeing anything for photons or math. Great ones.
