  If a brain grows from "nothing", there's no reason for it to have a "rawr kill humans" zombie utility function: it's either going to be a "blank" brain (i.e. baby, doesn't have the neuronal circuitry to control its body), or a "snapshot" from some time (either when the severing happened, or when the human was turned, are the two obvious points).

This logic is only as valid as you want it to be. You'd be totay justified in saying that, idk, epigenetic effects in the vampiric genome cause a regenerated limb to create a crazed murder-brain instead of a docile baby brain.
