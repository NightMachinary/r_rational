So, based on your post, here is my somewhat modified proposal:

*Proper way to make new vampire*

- Black Goo produced in stomach. Black Goo is for body enhancements; it makes you faster, stronger, self-repairing, and allows very limited shapeshifting.
- Yellow Goo produced elsewhere (doesn't much matter where, liver is fine). Yellow Goo contains the personality, the memories, and, in short, much of the /mind/. Black Goo is designed to be inert unles provided with a Yellow Goo mind to work with.
- Black Goo and Yellow Goo mix in small intestine, producing Green Goo
- Green Goo is excreted from small intestine by natural means (far easier to get hold of the stuff than battlefield surgery) and thrown at the enemy. As soon as Green Goo gets inside the enemy (via mouth, nose, wounds, anything) enemy becomes vampire very quickly.

--------------

Both Black Goo and Yellow Goo are self-repairing and self-correcting; to a degree. However, modern vampires completely lack Yellow Goo.

Black Goo was mostly designed to be inert without Yellow Goo; but it has a higher priority than that, which is to keep its host alive.

*Modern way to create vampire*

- Black goo produced in stomach
- Extract Black Goo from stomach in any way you like (vomiting it up works). Black Goo is inert until activated; a human eating it will have no effect due to lack of Yellow Goo.
- Put Black Goo in Recently Dead Human Heart by ripping open chest cavity. Black Goo recognises that it is in Rapidly Expiring Human Tissue and emergency programming takes over; it begins to ensure that subject /survives/ (providing oxygen to the brain and so on). Subject is kept sedated, in anticipation of rapid arrival of Yellow Goo.
- Yellow Goo never arrives. Eventually, after sufficient time, an internal timer rolls over and a buffer overflows, causing the Black Goo to think it should be active. Vampire wakes up, retaining his original mind.

Since the Yellow Goo never arrived to overwrite the new vampire's brain, he retains his old brain. If his head gets cut off, he grows back a head that contains a brain that's an amalgam of his brain, his Siring vampire's brain, /his/ Siring vampire's brain, and so on back into antiquity; with the result that only the things all those vampires held in common are there (i.e. limb control), while the higher brain functions are an incoherent /mess/.

This implies that you might be able to go direct to Vombie by ripping apart the subject's head and putting the goo into his brain instead of his heart (but I have trouble seeing why anyone would want to do that).
