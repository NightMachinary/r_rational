has it been 19 days already i need to stop procrastinating replies because your ideas are always so wonderful i never feel like i have the time to properly respond to them

--------------

I like black + yellow = green = proper vampire mixture, and the... rectal delivery mechanism (WHY DIDn"T I THINK OF THAT), but I don't think I like the chimpanzee school of warfare that's implied (... vampires are meant to be sexy and it's not very dignified). I think your description of the modern vampire creation process is really good, too.

I do ike the fact that your vampires don't have the Yellow Goo any more due to a bug (or maybe, a Jurassic Park style "feature" meant to avoid reproducing in the wild - turns out life, uh, finds a way). However, I like the fact that under my most recently posited system the yellow goo builds up in the intestine, backs up into the stomach, and then creates dilute green goo in the stomach that can be used for vampire creation in an old enough vampire. I feel like this answers the question of why older vampires have better success making babies, and why the success rate is so low. HOWEVER, I don't like the obvious fact that you pointed out which is that if the vampire is able to will herself to poop (or just vomit and give herself an enema and mix the resulting fluids), she'll be able to make super potent green goo and given that rubbing fermented piss on your body is something people today think cures cancer I'm sure a vampire tried it at some point in 2,000+++ years of recorded vampire history.

And my decent-layman knowledge of the digestive system doesn't give us any real way to do it. The digestive system doesn't like working "in the wrong direction" for obvious reasons. The stomach-intestine divide is pretty strong because of the acid and all.

So the only way I can think for Black Goo to get more potent over time is it ferments, or there's just /more of it/ over time. So I think you're right in that, if we assume Yellow Goo exists, it is no longer produced by vampires (or maybe is produced in the gall bladder but never released, if we want to leave ourselves open to sequel hooks).

I /love/ the idea of the Vombie brain being the "base state" brain of all generations of Sires, because that gives you basic bodily functions (walking, but probably not very gracefully: perfect vombie) AND the hunger for blood (since they'd all have the blood hunger).
