  If I'm understanding it correctly what you get is that the zombie is alternatingly in a crazy frenzy killing machine and lying down drooling(babies learn to crawl after 7+ month), depending on whether EH is on or off?
#+end_quote

Exactly that - but I think they won't be learning to crawl because the adult brain physiology is different from the baby brain physiology and (probably?) can't learn this sort of thing (though actually I think they've taught adult monkeys to control robot arms with their brains, but those adult monkeys are adults and can think/reason/move other limbs, so it's not a direct analogy).

  I should point out that in this case the zombies does have some moral value, they can be taught to be real people by a dedicated handler

If we say that vombies learn to crawl after 7 months, talk after a couple of years, etc, then yeah, they have similar moral worth to a newborn baby: and I'm kind of in the Peter Singer camp that a newborn baby in itself doesn't have moral worth until it reaches a certain (very young!) age, so this doesn't bother me. If we say vombies aren't capable of learning due to Brain Science Which I Don't Understand, then they have negligable moral value.

Fun fact: if this ends idea up shaking out, and it looks like it does, vampires with body doubles keep them staked in coffins (i.e. immobile and in the dark and probably in the quiet) until they may be required (usually to fake their own death). Even if they're in ExHun mode, I have to imagine this would not be conducive to turning a "newborn baby" into anything resembling a mentally healthy "adult". It was actually a way I was considering handling the vombie issue - giving them the Memories at Turning and the zombie behaviour is just a consequence of them having gone insane from such a long period of isolation. Though, now I think about it, if a vampire is buried in, say, an egyptian tomb and is let out after two thousand years, once she eats I want her to be "normal" (but probably a little off) - so probably the staked state is more akin to sleep than sensory deprivation. A pity.

  What happens if vampires feed on other vampires? I feel there is a certain connection between that and some mental change.

Hmmmm. Let's quickly go over the way vampire feeding works: the vampire pulls out the human's blood and at the same time deposits their... "pee" i guess... back into the human: a bunch of dead blood cells as well as waste products. Mechanically I'm not sure how this works: perhaps there's a reason there's two fangs, one in fang and one out fang?

So, let's say hungry!vampire!Agnes feeds on full!vampire!Beatrice. I imagine that this will make Agnes feel less slightly hungry and Beatrice feel significantly more hungry. If Agnes was full and Beatrice was hungry, I'd imagine Agnes would actually overall feel about the same level of hunger but Beatrice would still probably be worse off.
