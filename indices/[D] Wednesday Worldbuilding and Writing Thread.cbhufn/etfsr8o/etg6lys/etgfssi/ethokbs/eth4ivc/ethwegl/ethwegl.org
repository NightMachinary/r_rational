There could be something about the way that vampire brains are wired which makes them [[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Precociality][precocial]], or able to move about and act and so on from birth. Ordinarily, vampires don't really notice this, but someone who was crippled, then healed of their injury, and then immediately turned into a vampire would require no adjustment time (I'm not sure if becoming a vampire heals injuries in itself, but if so, this would be highly relevant and probably be the reason for it).

When a vampire is beheaded, what comes back lacks memories but is still wired as a vampire, meaning that yes, it's kind of a blank slate baby, but it's a blank slate baby in the way that precocial animals are, meaning that it doesn't need to spend years learning how to walk or anything like that.
