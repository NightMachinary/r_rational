We know some animals can run around when they're born. Humans obviously can't.

What if the limiting-for-humans thing is that baby brains haven't finished developing physiologically. That, as much as a lack of experience, is why babies are so helpless.

So, your vampire is regrowing an anatomically adult brain. I'm not sure if we should expect them to be baby-level limited.
