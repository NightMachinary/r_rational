The thing is the physiological developments of the brain involve neuron pruning and stuff to control the body - and also that memories and personality are also stored "physiologically". So, I guess if I had to summarise it, the issue is that the ability to walk/etc is a TYPE of memory (or memory adjacent) - and foals/etc are born with that "memory".

So if you say that a human brain grows back that has been pruned to control the body, then you are saying that the vampire technology stores the brain structure pre-severence to save the "pruned" state of the brain. In which case, why doesn't it store the brain with the personalities instead? (Maybe the society that created vampires had a taboo against duplication of minds, but I think part of this setting being Rational is occam's razoring these things, so adding an element of culture to an ancient society purely to let me have vombies seems excessive)

Like, you have these options for the regrown brains:

- Grows back with memories of original vampire (at turning OR at decapitation OR at least backup) - NOPE, has moral value

- Grows back with "template" memories of exemplar vampire (soldier?) - NOPE, probably has moral value, definitely is not vombie mode

- Grows back with no memories but with the ability to control the body - ??? - it seems more difficult to grow back a brain without the memories but with the ability to control the body, the old adage about mixing glass A of water and glass B of water together and then trying to separate them back out down to the last molecule seems relevant

- Grows back with no memories or ability to control the body - NOPE, can't be an evil monster
