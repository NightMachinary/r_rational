I'm suspicious of the idea that humans are uniquely bad at passing down ancestral memories. Why would would we be worse than basically every species at "remembering" to walk?

Instead, it seems likely to me that 'walking knowledge' is hard coded into the structure of an adult animals brain, along with a general map of their body.

New born humans are special in that we're effectively born "premature" so that our heads can fit through a birth canal. A consequence is that our brains take longer to get to their adult shape (and thus unlock the knowledge that comes with this). Once we reach the adult shape, I'd assume that we have at least as much "innate" knowledge as a crocodile or a chicken.

And I'd address "regenerating personality" by saying that regeneration knows the genetic layout of a body, but not environmentally determined specifics.

So, if I lose a hand, I'll regenerate 5-fingered hand. But I won't regenerate any tattoos or scars.

Personality and sapience might require experience to develop. But stuff like walking or throwing objects is probably close to hard coded.
