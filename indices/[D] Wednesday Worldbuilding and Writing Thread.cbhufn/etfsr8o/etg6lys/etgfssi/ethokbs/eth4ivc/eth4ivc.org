Making another comment to give feedback to your last suggestion.

If I'm understanding it correctly what you get is that the zombie is alternatingly in a crazy frenzy killing machine and lying down drooling(babies learn to crawl after 7+ month), depending on whether EH is on or off? I like it. It feels natural if the Vampire Tech can override the persons actions directly and it's natural that you would have the full Vampire Package including EH despite not having a full brain. I should point out that in this case the zombies does have some moral value, they can be taught to be real people by a dedicated handler, however a reliable and steady supply of food is needed. There is a chance though that people wouldn't know this as it's a health hazard to have even a docile zombie around.

What happens if vampires feed on other vampires? I feel there is a certain connection between that and some mental change.
