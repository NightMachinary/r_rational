The show makes more sense when you realize it was only there to sell the card game.

I think a story could be cool -- I'd throw out everything but the storing creatures in cards mechanic. To be properly rational, though, you're going to have to put some serious thought into how the world would be different with such cards (do the monsters exist outside cards?, how are they made?, how long ago were they discovered?, how does the government control them?, etc.)
