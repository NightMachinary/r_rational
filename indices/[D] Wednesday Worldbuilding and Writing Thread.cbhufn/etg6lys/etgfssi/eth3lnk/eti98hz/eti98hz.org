  Option 1: The vampire tech intentionally don't regrow brains to avoid identity crisis and instead uses a template brain, possibly with parts from a different animal.

Vampires /were/ originally created as a superweapon (and all the weaknesses are a result of people "hacking" them to make them less super), so the idea that the original way to create them was to get a freshly dead human, vampire them, and then cut the head off and let a "default" head grow back could work. However you'd assume that the "default" head would identify enemies somehow, so the indiscriminate zombie like hunger for blood is... less likely.

  Option 2-4

The whole zombie thing is an extreme edge case, so any of these could work, though probably the one that seems the most "default" would be the easiest sell.

Thanks for those ideas, they're very creative!
