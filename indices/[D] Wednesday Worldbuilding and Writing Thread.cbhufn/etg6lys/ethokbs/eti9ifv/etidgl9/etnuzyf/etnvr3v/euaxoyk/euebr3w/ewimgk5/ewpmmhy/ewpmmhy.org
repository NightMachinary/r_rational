Unfortunately, the chimpanzee warfare comes with the rectal delivery system. I honestly can't see the one without the other. If it's any help, though, the average human's ancestors were probably doing similar things if you go far enough back;this does not prevent modern humans from being, on occasion, both dignified and sexy.

  However, I like the fact that under my most recently posited system ... this answers the question of why older vampires have better success making babies, and why the success rate is so low.

This seems to be the biggest upside that you're finding in your system. I've been thinking about it over a couple of days, and I think I have a solution.

It involves having two sorts of Black Goo - corrupted Black Goo and uncorrupted Black Goo. Now, the vampires rely on having Corrupted Black Goo, because that is what allows it to work without Yellow Goo. However, under certain circumstances (i.e. when automatically resetting, in order to fix severe damage, or when creating more Black Goo) the Corrupted Black Goo can be factory-reset into Uncorrupted Black Goo. (This generally doesn't affect all the goo at once; only part of it). Over time, however, Corrupted Black Goo will eventually corrupt Uncorrupted Goo; but it's an incredibly slow process.

So, here's how vampirisation works, paying attention to this new divide:

- A vampire pukes a load of goo into a prospective vampire's heart. Some of this goo is Corrupted, some is Uncorrupted
- The goo picks up that this is a human heart in desperate need of repair. A whole bunch of the goo gets factory reset (into Uncorrupted Goo) and then starts rebuilding the heart.
- If enough of the goo remains Corrupted, then it starts slowly corrupting the Uncorrupted Goo.
- If there is a high enough percentage of Corrupted Goo in the new vampire's body, he awakens. If not, he just... never wakes up.

This way, the higher the percentage of Corrupted Goo in the sire's goo, the better the odds of success in the Turning... but at the same time, certain wounds (like cutting open a vampire's stomach and spilling a lot of the stuff) can set him back along that path by a decade or two.

  So I think you're right in that, if we assume Yellow Goo exists, it is no longer produced by vampires (or maybe is produced in the gall bladder but never released, if we want to leave ourselves open to sequel hooks).

Never released is certainly an /interesting/ sequel hook. How would an Atlantean super soldier survive modern times?

  I love the idea of the Vombie brain being the "base state" brain of all generations of Sires, because that gives you basic bodily functions (walking, but probably not very gracefully: perfect vombie) AND the hunger for blood (since they'd all have the blood hunger).
#+end_quote

Yeah, I kinda like that one, too.
