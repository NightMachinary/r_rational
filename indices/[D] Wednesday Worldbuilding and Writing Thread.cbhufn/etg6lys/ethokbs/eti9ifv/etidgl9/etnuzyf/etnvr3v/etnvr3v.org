  .... ok, the "before if possible" has given me a bit of a bug. imagine a vampire with a third of a head attacking... even though it can't eat you because its teeth haven't grown back?
#+end_quote

Yeah, though the lack of eyes will be a bigger problem - this is very much the "random flailing" school of attack.

#+begin_quote
  wouldn't that mean that any injured soldiers you recover will start killing friendlies?
#+end_quote

Yes. Yes, it will.

Bear in mind, though, that a lot of the vampires on the battlefield are made from enemy soldiers, in the thick of the action. You do /not/ want an enemy brain inside your supersoldier's body, and you /especially/ do not want an enemy brain deciding who is friendly and who is not.

Think of war vampires as super powerful attack dogs - you drop them on the enemy and /really mess him up/, but you don't expect them to come up with anything in the way of strategy. He's a weapon, not a person.

I'm thinking that it grows with a default brain; that default brain is (like a baby horse, which it may have even been partially modelled on) able to at least manage basic limb control (though it's going to be shaky at first), hates anything that moves, is /really really angry/, and can probably figure out how to bite and drain blood after a couple of hours. (I imagine the ability and willingness to fight was considered more important than the ability to sustain itself).
