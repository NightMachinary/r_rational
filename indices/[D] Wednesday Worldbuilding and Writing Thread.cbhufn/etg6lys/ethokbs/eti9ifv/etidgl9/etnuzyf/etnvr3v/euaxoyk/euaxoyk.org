IDK, I always envisioned vampires being made in a field hospital - surgery is involved. The reasons My Vampires have such low success rates in turning is because they are not able to replicate the surgical conditions exactly and are probably missing important steps.

That said, it raises a few questions:

1. Where did they originally get the bodies?

2. Why does the vampire-making goo only get potent after ~100 years of development in the body?

For #1, realistically we're either looking at the output of a hospital (you know... "do you want to donate your grandfather's body to the war effort?") or, as you said, fallen friendly/enemy combatants. Either way, realistically you're probably going to want to put a default mind on: as you said, you can't turn enemies into vampires and expect them to be on your side if you don't overtake their minds too.

Perhaps, as you suggested, the retaining of the original human mind IS a bug rather than a feature - in going with My Vampires being software that's got 100,000 years of built up bugs thing. It would also mean that the original way vampires functioned may have been the nanites holing up in the brain and just hijacking it while the consciousness watched helplessly, which is dark and I'm here for it.

So, maybe the "bug" is that the nanites can't go past the blood-brain barrier somehow? IDK. So... it does make sense that when the vombie head grows back, it has nanites in it, because the nanites are working to assemble it, so they're able to take control of the brain As Intended and become a weapon. But...... then you run into the opposite problem, which is that you expect the nanites to make a competent fighter (you know: strategy, ambush, etc, not zombie mindlessness). This plan ends up making them much further from a zombie than I'm comfortable with - they almost become a Horror Movie Vampire.

OK, let's go to #2: vampires propogate by getting goo out of their own stomachs and shoving it into a dead human. This goo gets more potent and thus works better after a few hundred years, but... why does it exist at all? I suppose if you assume your army is full of vampires anyway it's convenient to keep the goo factories inside the vampires, but why doesn't it make a potent enough good? I guess the idea would be to refine it somehow, or perhaps the stomach!goo is only 50% "of the way there" and the real magic happens when the gall bladder adds something to it in the small intestine?

Like:

*/proper way to make new vampire/*

1. Black Goo produced in stomach

2. Yellow Goo produced in liver, stored in bile duct

3. Black Goo and Yellow Goo mix in small intestine, producing Green Goo

4. Green Goo is extracted surgically and surgically put into Recently Dead Human Heart

5. Human becomes vampire very quickly

*/shitty way to make new vampire/*

1. Black goo produced in stomach

2. Vomit up Black Goo, put it in Recently Dead Human Heart by ripping open the chest cavity

3. Do a bunch of things afterwards to give the weak Black Goo enough time to work before the body decays

4. Human becomes vampire VERY slowly (I actually want My Vampires to take a year to ripen, so I like this)

You can say it's more effective in older vampires because perhaps the Yellow Goo or Green Goo builds up in the small intestine and some of it goes back into the stomach (a vampire was never meant to live 100 years, after all!). I wonder if this means the really old ones will sometimes just yakk it all up for no reason. Perhaps that's part of a reason they make new vampires: it relieves that horrible abdominal discomfort.

..... hmmmm, I can live with this. What do you think? (thanks, again, for being such a wonderful and reliable sounding board).

it does make me wonder if vampires have ever given each other autopsies (necropsies?).
