  it would make even more sense for them to be both able and willing to fight the instant their heads finished growing back (before, if possible)

.... ok, the "before if possible" has given me a bit of a bug. imagine a vampire with a third of a head attacking... even though it can't eat you because its teeth haven't grown back?

  they'd have to follow the "hit it and bite at random" school of fighting, helped along by a good dose of berserker rage

wouldn't that mean that any injured soldiers you recover will start killing friendlies? I think once the brain is obliterated, either the enemy will destroy the body completely (due to knowing a vombie will result), or the friendlies will recover the body in which case it's a liability? IDK, it depends whether the friendlies are more ilkely to want to recover the body to use or whether the vampire is more likely to fall behind enemy lines

  In fact, ideally (from a weapon-of-war point of view) you want all the vampires to be mindless, unreasoning beasts, especially those of newly-turned enemy soldiers; it's possible that the current strain has developed a few flaws along the way, and one of those flaws is that the consciousness of a person can survive the vampirisation process (if present at the time)...

This is definitely something I've been thinking.

copy of my reply in the other thread since it's mostly relevant and i'm guessing that you're not going to see it otherwise:

--------------

The thing is the physiological developments of the brain involve neuron pruning and stuff to control the body - and also that memories and personality are also stored "physiologically". So, I guess if I had to summarise it, the issue is that the ability to walk/etc is a TYPE of memory (or memory adjacent) - and foals/etc are born with that "memory".

So if you say that a human brain grows back that has been pruned to control the body, then you are saying that the vampire technology stores the brain structure pre-severence to save the "pruned" state of the brain. In which case, why doesn't it store the brain with the personalities instead? (Maybe the society that created vampires had a taboo against duplication of minds, but I think part of this setting being Rational is occam's razoring these things, so adding an element of culture to an ancient society purely to let me have vombies seems excessive)

Like, you have these options for the regrown brains:

- Grows back with memories of original vampire (at turning OR at decapitation OR at least backup) - NOPE, has moral value

- Grows back with "template" memories of exemplar vampire (soldier?) - NOPE, probably has moral value, definitely is not vombie mode

- Grows back with no memories but with the ability to control the body - ??? - it seems more difficult to grow back a brain without the memories but with the ability to control the body, the old adage about mixing glass A of water and glass B of water together and then trying to separate them back out down to the last molecule seems relevant

- Grows back with no memories or ability to control the body - NOPE, can't be an evil monster
