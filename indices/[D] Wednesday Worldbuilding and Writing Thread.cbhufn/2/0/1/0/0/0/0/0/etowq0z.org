This is a little outside the original scope of the question since there's additional in universe circumstances to the natural sciences. The scientific revolution was artificially instigated to create a very strong anti-idea that counteract the effect of all ideas that doesn't follow the natural laws(which is pretty much all of them). The hard sciences, including math, are by design set up so problems solved using them don't cost energy but gives energy to the ideas. This ties back to that the cost of the effect of ideas depend on how far the effect deviates from baseline, with proper math not deviating at all from baseline.
