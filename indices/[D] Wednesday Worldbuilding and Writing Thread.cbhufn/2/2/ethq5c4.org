Important question - how good is mass communication in this world?

If we have modern levels of mass communication (e.g. TV, radio, internet) then it's trivial to become incredibly powerful, if you're in a position of being able to broadcast a single message around the world at the same time. Even a mere modern printing industry can make an imaginative author very powerful very quickly, by churning out cheap but popular novels.

This becomes significantly more difficult in a medieval-technology world.

--------------

Example (via printing press): Tell a gripping story about a man (matching the author's description and general personality) who writes really well. Have him defeat an evil corporation by using his writing abilities to drown them in negative PR or something (the plot isn't important, the character is).

Shortly, there's lots of people thinking that someone who looks like the author is an incredible writer, who writes stories you can't easily stop thinking about. Next, use this to write an even more gripping narrative of a hero of similar appearance who combines his authorial skills with (insert whatever ability you want to gain here).
