Food are affected yes. It depends on the specific idea regarding the food though. It is generally ill advised to add substenance to food as thought constructs in your body only lasts as long as there is idea power to sustain their continued existance and it's really unhealthy when parts of your body suddenly disappear. A lot of food poisonings happen this way but chefs use it in their cuisine to add taste by making the food look appetizing.

That's a great question. I haven't actually thought of this specific mechanic. I imagine that it depends on a few factor ssuch as how strong are the memetic link between A and B are and how many ideas are competing about idea A, etc. What do you think makes sense?

Religion are already weird and in cults it's usually only the top guy who claim to be able to do anything in particular. Classical christianity had only priests being the ones who could communicate with God.
