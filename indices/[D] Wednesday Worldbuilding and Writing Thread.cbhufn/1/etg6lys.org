I'm struggling with this and have begun to realise why people don't write rational stories most of the time. I've talked about this here before but about a year ago and I'm going to whine again and see if I can think of an out.

Goal: I want my vampires to be able to turn into fast zombies and ALSO to be able to make zombie body doubles.

Essential facets of zombies I want: Relentless hunger for blood, mindlessness, no moral qualms with killing them (i.e. they are not "human" in any meaningful sense)

Good thing: The rules of My Vampires allows them to make body doubles like starfish make body doubles - they grow back from the severed part under certain conditions

Problem: Rationally, because of how brains work, the body doubles have to either be complete copies (down to memory) OR newborn babies (can't control themselves, flail around cutely)

Detailed explanation of problem: If a brain grows from "nothing", there's no reason for it to have a "rawr kill humans" zombie utility function: it's either going to be a "blank" brain (i.e. baby, doesn't have the neuronal circuitry to control its body), or a "snapshot" from some time (either when the severing happened, or when the human was turned, are the two obvious points). So either you have a useful but not scary body double, or a perfect duplciate of yourself who will not be "rawr zombie".

How I'd most likely do it if it wasn't Rational: Something about being a vampire, or souls, means that the vampire copy doesn't have a soul or whatever so it just runs on Vampire Base Instincts of find food (and I can't use souls as a gimme in-universe as My Supernatural Creatures all run on Sufficiently Advanced Technology)

Candidate Workarounds:

- I do already have vampires act in a zombie way if they're drained of blood (extreme hunger), but this means that the zombie would become a normal vampire when it's managed to catch and eat something, so it's not morally OK to kill them (it does make it, like, very horrifying to think about, though, which I like, but I feel like someone would have figured it out by the Present Day so the zombies wouldn't be around to be plot relevant)

- Have the doubles start out as babies but slowly work out how to walk / run / eat, so maybe it's harmless for a month or so but becomes a zombie later. It means that the vampire corpse in the basement all of a sudden attacks you two months later.

My favourite work around that I just thought of writing this post:

- If vampires run on Sufficiently Advanced Technology, the same fail-safe mode that activates during extreme hunger is potentially activated in a severed body part. Extreme Hunger mode isn't actually controlled by the vampire's brain like non-hungry vampire is controlled by its brain; the Vampire Tech takes direct control over the body to get food. The brain is a "baby brain" incapable of controlling the body, so isn't suffering or anything. The only problem is, the Extreme Hunger mode must get deactivated when the vampire isn't hungry anymore, so the zombie would presumably get deactivated after eating and become a "baby vampire" until it starved again and became a zombie. This is interesting and maybe a Feature; otherwise I suppose I could say that the Extreme Hunger mode is deactivated by the vampire "willing" control back or some bull like that.

Thanks, thread, for helping me with this. Any comments would be appreciated (especially how easily you'd swallow that last paragraph), but as you can see, this was mostly a "thinking out loud" exercise as it turns out.
