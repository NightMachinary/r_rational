Why not? A vampire comes from a human, it makes more sense that it would default to human milestones than a completely different species.

I do get your point, though, but like I said above, it seems "cheap" to go "vampires can control their legs once their brain grows back for Reasons". The other thing is that baby brains do a lot of - I don't know I'm not a brain scientist - neuronal pruning, or something? And they're actually qualitatively different from adult brains in some way, anyhow. And since a vampire definitely knows what age it is when it grows back limbs/heads, it stands to reason it'd be an adult brain, which puts me back onto "surely they'd have a whole personality (maybe a brain scan from a good soldier?)" camp.

In the end I think the creators of vampires didn't think "what if the head was cut off but the body wasn't destroyed perfectly and then a week later the head grew back?", they were in the warmongering business after all and presumably were able to track their "fleet" and deal with them appropriately when they fell? Or they figured any fallen soldiers wouldn't be decapitated but killed by other means? Or they figured that their enemies would take them as prisoners and best to leave them unable to give military secrets? IDK.
