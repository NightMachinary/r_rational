another two week procrastination period! I AM THE PROCRASTINATION CHAMPION.

  Unfortunately, the chimpanzee warfare comes with the rectal delivery system.

You're probably right. Let's not think about this too hard. None of this is going to be reader-facing, at least, and if it ever is I can just completely gloss over it.

  It involves having two sorts of Black Goo - corrupted Black Goo and uncorrupted Black Goo.
#+end_quote

It's getting too complex, and I am not liking that. I think it might be time to take a few steps back, and say "at the moment, we've decided there's some sort of reaction meant to be happening in the digestive system that isn't finishing, and that is why vampires have a relatively low success rate at procreation".

#+begin_quote
  but at the same time, certain wounds (like cutting open a vampire's stomach and spilling a lot of the stuff) can set him back along that path by a decade or two.
#+end_quote

That's interesting: vampires surely know their success rate increases the longer they go between children, and if someone wanted to prevent other vampires from making a coven, spilling stomach contents might be a good way to go about it.

    So I think you're right in that, if we assume Yellow Goo exists, it is no longer produced by vampires (or maybe is produced in the gall bladder but never released, if we want to leave ourselves open to sequel hooks).
  #+end_quote

  Never released is certainly an /interesting/ sequel hook. How would an Atlantean super soldier survive modern times?
#+end_quote

It'd probably be a generic monster movie: awakens from slumber, terrorises the antarctic base (the portal to Atlantis was in Antarctica, don't you know?), and the army comes in to nuke it from orbit (it's the only way to be sure), and the final shot of the movie is something moving under the rubble.... (but seriously any weapon strong enough to shoot off the head would solve the problem temporarily, and fire permanently, so bombs in general would work well).

    I love the idea of the Vombie brain being the "base state" brain of all generations of Sires, because that gives you basic bodily functions (walking, but probably not very gracefully: perfect vombie) AND the hunger for blood (since they'd all have the blood hunger).
  #+end_quote

  Yeah, I kinda like that one, too.
#+end_quote

So, at least: VOMBIES ARE POSSIBLE. DISCUSSION THREAD OFFICIALLY DECLARED A SUCCESS.
