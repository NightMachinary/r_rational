If the Vampires had appeared randomly, yes, then it would make sense to base them on human developmental milestones. But if these Vampires were genetically engineered as apocalyptic war weapons, then it would make even more sense for them to be both able and willing to fight the instant their heads finished growing back (before, if possible). And the example of the horse suggests that this is a plausible way for an engineered newborn brain to be.

Sure, they won't be able to use martial arts, or any sort of decent fighting style; they'd have to follow the "hit it and bite at random" school of fighting, helped along by a good dose of berserker rage. You don't /need/ a whole personality in there, especially as whole personalities often do embarrassing things like form unions and petition for the right to vote.

In fact, ideally (from a weapon-of-war point of view) you want /all/ the vampires to be mindless, unreasoning beasts, especially those of newly-turned enemy soldiers; it's possible that the current strain has developed a few flaws along the way, and one of those flaws is that the consciousness of a person can survive the vampirisation process (if present at the time)...
