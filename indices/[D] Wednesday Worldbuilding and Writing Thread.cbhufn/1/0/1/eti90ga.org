IDK, I feel like hand waving and say "the vampire technology just works to give me zombies sometimes because Zombies are Cool" is kind of... the definition of irRational, if you get me? Like, as much as I want something to happen, if I can't justify it based on what vampires actually are, then it's not coherent.

I try to keep myself honest as I already have a few vaguely tentative gimmes (invitations, silver, stuff like that) and the more faithful the whole suite of powers and drawbacks can be to the premise, the better, IMO.

The best thing though is that you end up finding some really cool details and twists that follow naturally from what you end up choosing: like, the concept of the zombies being a fast!zombie until they get a meal at which point they flop helplessly to the ground seems novel to me, and would make for some interesting plot points.
