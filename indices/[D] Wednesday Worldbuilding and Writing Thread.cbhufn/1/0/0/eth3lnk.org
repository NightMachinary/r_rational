I was thinking something similar to this.

Option 1: The vampire tech intentionally don't regrow brains to avoid identity crisis and instead uses a template brain, possibly with parts from a different animal.

Option 2: The vampire tech stores information about how to control limps/other non-personality related brain parts from the user in the DNA and rebuilds the brain with only those parts remaining intact and the rest being from newborn.

Option 3: There's a flaw in the vampire tech and it doesn't create a prefrontal cortex(or whatever part of the brain that stops vampires from always trying to feed)

Option 4: As 3 but instead of a flaw that removes a part of the brain, the flaw is instead that the part of the brain that activates 'Extreme Hunger' is too big or is otherwise broken/overly active.
