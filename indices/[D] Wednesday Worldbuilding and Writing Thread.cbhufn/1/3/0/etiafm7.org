Yeah, that's come up a few times in this thread, but I'm not sure I like adding "oh by the way vampires are precocial that's why they become zombies when their heads grow back rather than drooling babies" - it feels like a cop out.

It looks like the ExHunVombie/FullDroolingBaby dichotomy works, and it's more "interesting" in that it's got a unique sort of "twist" on the zombie concept with the baby aspect, and it follows from already established lore in universe which is so much the better!
