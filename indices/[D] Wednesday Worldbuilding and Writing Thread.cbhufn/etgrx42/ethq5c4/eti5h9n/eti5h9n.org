Communication is as today.

I think that you are underestimating the current ecosystem of ideas. There is a lot of fighting for our attention. Heck, commercials are literally paying money for our attention to increase the rate of which we think of that corporation. And aside from mundane fights for ideas and attention(which translates into money to companies and political support), there are already people in the world who know that this exists and who want people to think of specific ideas to remain in power.

If it was as easy as you say to gain attention, you would expect all politicians to write books or hire people to write compelling books around them, such that they gain public attention which is one of the things that transforms into votes.

For a fight of ideas notice how rebels/resistance/freedom fighters always are framed as terrorists by the ruling class. The battle rages between the ruling class to establish the idea that the resistance are evil terrorists while the resistance tries to promote themselves as fighting for the people to gain support.
