The thing is, there /are/ people who compete - and in some cases very successfully - for idea-space in the modern world. By and large, they are not politicians (except around election time), but celebrities. (Politicians want people to hold certain opinions, but generally not to think of those opinions all the time).

When Prince Harry has a child, this goes to news headlines around the world - and millions of people think, even if only for a few minutes, about that child. Frame the story right in your world, and you could give that child heat vision, which is /really/ not something a small baby should have.

In the world you envisage, a suitably shocking news headline (and I don't just mean a sensationalist headline, I mean one that genuinely /shocks/ people), published on all major networks, can generate a /vast/ amount of speculation, discussion, chatter, and thinking about the headline - for at least a day or two. Make it a suitably specific story, and you promptly have a truly massive inflow into an idea with, if you've crafted the story carefully, has fairly minimal outflow. You can then /use/ this (perhaps brief and temporary) inflow for, well, whatever you want...
