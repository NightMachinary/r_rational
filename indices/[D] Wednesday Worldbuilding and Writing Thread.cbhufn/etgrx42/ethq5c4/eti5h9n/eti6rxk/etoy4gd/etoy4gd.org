There exists books about politicians but not all politicians write books to gain votes and those books that do come out don't get a lot of attraction.

Perhaps I haven't been clear enough on this but it isn't only the strength of an idea but also what the idea itself does. Granted I don't follows the new much but is it correct that the idea of Prince Harry doesn't really do anything supernatural even if he gets a lot of attention?

I actually like the idea of a writer that convinced people of the idea of him being a good writer to improve his writing.

I also like the idea of creating a sensational story to create a temporary idea. What story would you create?
