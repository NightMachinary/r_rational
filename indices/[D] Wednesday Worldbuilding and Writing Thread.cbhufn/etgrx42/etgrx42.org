This is a brainstorm post for a system that I refined based on prior feedback.

The world is split between the physical and the plane of ideas. When humans think of a thought, the brain converts biological energy into power that goes to the corresponding idea in the idea plane.

Ideas the world in a way that is defined by the idea. For instance the idea of a chair doesn't do much and just keep building up power. The idea of the western bastardized version of karma(do good things and the universe rewards you) actively affects probability in favour of people who have a 'good karma score' and decides on what 'good' is by referring to the idea of 'good' in the idea plane. Gods exists and have a pseudo-consciousness that is determined by the idea of them which they use to take actions. The idea of 'wizard' can be tapped into if one conforms to one of the wizard stereotypes(strongest are ancient wizard(gandalf etc.), and flamboyant and young(Dr. Strange etc.))

There's a lot of things that go into how strongly ideas can affect the real world but important contributors are internal consistency(how 'focused'/'narrow'/'clearly defined effect' an idea is), how much the ideas effect deviates from the baseline world, the current power reservoir, and the inflow/outflow ratio(how much is the idea being thought about versus how much energy is drained from the energy).

Intuitively we might think that love have a really strong power level, however think about how much 'true love' is supposed to fix and you'll see that the outflow is pretty intense.

What ideas would you think would have a very high power reservoir? If you were in this world and you wanted to draw power from the ideas by creating a new idea that connected to an existing ideas power reservoir(like Karma connects to Good/Evil) what would you cook up?
