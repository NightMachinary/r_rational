For me, a serial killer has two fundamental abilities that are shared across most movies and other media: the ability to track prey, and the ability to stalk prey uninterrupted. For the first, it's extremely rare for a character to truly escape one once a chase scene has initiated. For the second, it's also rare for a chased character to actually come across someone who could help them while being chased, unless it's someone who already knows they may be in danger. Consider it a “don't notice this” aura that is difficult to overcome if you don't already know the victim is in danger, with additional bonuses towards cutting phone lines, locking escape routes, running out of battery, etc.

That second isolation ability is what would make them especially dangerous. And here's an interesting thought: do you think that governments and companies would start creating secret pseudo-cults, worshipping very specific gods and rituals to try to influence the stock market or provide beneficial divinations without having to share that influence for other purposes? Or is the amount of “thought” required to make an idea powerful more than any private organization could monopolize?
