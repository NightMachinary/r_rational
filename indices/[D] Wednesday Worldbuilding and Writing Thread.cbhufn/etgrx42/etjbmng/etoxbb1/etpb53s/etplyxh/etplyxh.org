Serial killers would definitely have the first one.

The second effect seem to be part an improved but specific skillset, probability manipulation and part vague mind control. Mind control is to a large degree countered by the very strong idea of 'Freedom' and there are other probability manipulation ideas around(such as the western bastardized version of karma)) that might counter the probability manipulation part. Nothing comes to mind that would counter the improved skillset though. Thank the gods serial killers tend to be rubbish at actually fighting.

In fact I imagine that this was how gods started out. A single organization could create an idea that would give some power but it can hardly compete against just tapping into one of the existing ideas, such as using Tarot cards when you are about to make a major purchase. Granted, there are of course many ideas out there that messes with future divination, including future divination.
