I had an idea about a possible rationalisation of The Skylark of Space, by E. E. Smith, but I'm not sure I'd have a high enough level of physics knowledge to do it properly. The premise is that the protagonist discovers a metal that, basically, catalyses the conversion of matter - specifically, copper - to energy, in a somewhat controllable fashion. Thus, a nearly unlimited energy supply. So far, so sci-fi.

Naturally, there's a megacorporation that wants to kill/neutralise him and monopolise his discovery to revolutionise power generation and make themselves rich. But most of the story is about him building a copper-powered spaceship and meeting/befriending/fighting aliens. Missed opportunity here.

Now, what I'd be interested in is a divergence from a relatively early point in the story, where his girlfriend is kidnapped (to force him into a deal) in a copy of his spaceship, and in her struggles, she accidentally triggers the engines at full power. In canon, apparently the floors and chairs are "special" designs and the result is simply that everyone passes out until the ship's power is depleted and its acceleration slows. The protagonist chases after them, they all end up far away from Earth, etc. Clearly this part is bogus, since there is no possible way to design a floor that would let a human being survive the kind of acceleration that is described. The girlfriend, the villains, and the pursuing protagonists (assuming that they attempt to use a similar level of acceleration) would all be goo on the floor of their spaceships.

So what I'd be interested in writing is the perspective of a staff member back on Earth, who has been given the job of taking the available samples of this wonder material and redesigning their power plants. Knowing that the previous researcher working on this managed to vaporise his entire neighbourhood, and the company's best expert on the subject was on one of the spaceships (because he's the hero's nemesis, that's why) and is therefore presumed dead. The difficulties he faces in making the reaction controllable at all, working out the best way to turn it into usable power (would steam turbines still be the best approach?), dealing with management expectations, and above all, experimenting without destroying the planet.

But as I said, though I can recognise some of the junk science in the original, I'm not sure I know physics well enough to do it right. Anyone's thoughts?
