Yeah- it's HTML and [[https://archiveofourown.org/help/skins-creating.html][a subset of CSS]] that's pretty permissive except for custom fonts. It's mostly set up the way it is to prevent people from hosting arbitrary/potentially dangerous content as a fic. This chapter was pretty much just done with tables and some styling to mess with font size and padding and so on! (h/t Nostalgebraist for an example of how to do it in The Northern Caves.)
