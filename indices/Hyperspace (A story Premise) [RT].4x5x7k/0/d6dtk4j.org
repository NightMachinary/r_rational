There's some things that annoy me.

- An Alcubierre drive can be used as a time machine. They should be testing that.

- An Alcubierre drive is not a jump drive. I'm fine with using a drive that doesn't work with the known laws of physics. Just don't pretend it's a different one that sort of does.

- Black holes probably wouldn't naturally form that small. It would be pretty surprising, but they shouldn't eliminate the possibility of a black hole that formed from an unknown method without a better hypothesis.

- We've noticed planets by the tiny gravitational effect on stars. How did we not notice this?
