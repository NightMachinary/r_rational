  It was a real slog getting through all that exposition. Is it really that important how the engine works? The main benefit of soft sci-fi over hard sci-fi is that you can sweep the physics questions under the rug and get on with the story. Your readers either already know what an Alcubierre drive is (and they'll know it's subtly different from what you're describing), or they don't care.

Knowing how it works lets me pull the sci-fi equivelant of magic A is magic A, wherein the characters can actually use technology to solve problems without it seeming nonsensical. That in mind, it does make for some clunky exposition.

  I tittered at "Have you checked the boot?" when I realised it was a pun. You write good dialogue. I got a nice sense of the characters voices and personalities from the way they talk.

That's good, because that's something I worry about.

  I was a bit confused when we got seven paragraphs in without being told there was a third person in the room. Important detail, there.
