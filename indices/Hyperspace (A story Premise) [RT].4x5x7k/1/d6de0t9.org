It was a real slog getting through all that exposition. Is it really that important how the engine works? The main benefit of soft sci-fi over hard sci-fi is that you can sweep the physics questions under the rug and get on with the story.

Your readers either already know what an Alcubierre drive is (and they'll know it's subtly different from what you're describing), or they don't care.

I tittered at "Have you checked the boot?" when I realised it was a pun.

You write good dialogue. I got a nice sense of the characters voices and personalities from the way they talk.

I was a bit confused when we got seven paragraphs in without being told there was a third person in the room. Important detail, there.

Not sure why you mention that. Is gravity plating more "cutting corners" than spinning the ship?

I'm curious what rationalist themes the story is going to touch on.
