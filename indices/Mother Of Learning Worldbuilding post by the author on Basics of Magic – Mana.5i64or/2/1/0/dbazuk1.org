But all radiation of the same frequency is equivalent. It doesn't matter whether your microwave oven got its microwaves from an internal or external source, what matters is how it's used.

Here, the source matters. If it's yours, it's perfectly safe. If it's somebody else's, it's safe but unwieldy. If it's ambient mana, it creates a degenerative effect in the user.

The question is why ambient mana is uniquely damaging. It'd be like if everyone on the planet had a compatible blood type, but blood plasma on its own was toxic.
