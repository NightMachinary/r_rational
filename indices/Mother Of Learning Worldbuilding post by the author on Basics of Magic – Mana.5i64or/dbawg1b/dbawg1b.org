  This is unaffected by the size of one's mana reserves -- those will higher reserves will simply regenerate more mana per minute.

If you're siphoning ambient mana then surely larger mana reserves would benefit less from ambient mana? Or can they siphon more at once too? Still they would regenerate slower to full in places of limited but not zero ambient mana. Assuming equal assimilation rates, but maybe larger mana pools have better rates too?
