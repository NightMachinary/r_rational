  This is unaffected by the size of one's mana reserves -- those will higher reserves will simply regenerate more mana per minute.

Does the level of mana in your pool affect the rate of mana regeneration (with or without ambient mana absorption)? For example, does it take the same amount of time to go from a mana pool being 10% full to 20% as it does to go from 45% to 55% or 90% to 100%?

  If separated from the soul it has been attuned to, personal mana will rapidly degrade into ambient mana -- which seems to be the default form of mana when not attuned to anything. This makes attempts to create an external storage of personal mana doomed to failure. Regardless of the method used, the mana will un-attune itself in a matter of minutes.

Since the mana remains attuned to you for a brief period, could you re-absorb the mana before it un-attunes itself (for example while imprisoned, you could dump most of your reserves, to make it seem to your captors like you have nothing left, then pull some or all of it back into your pool)? Would this be a faster absorption rate than your safe absorption rate of ambient mana?\\
What if you build a box (or bag or jar or whatever, simply to keep the mana from floating off, not to stop it from un-attuning), or rather several (let's say X) boxes. You fill X-1 boxes with mana, then before box 1 can un-attune, you re-absorb the mana from box 1 and push it into the last empty box. Pull from 2, put it in 1, pull from 3 put it in 2, all the way to pull from X, put it in X-1. Since your own passive mana regeneration is still going, you eventually fill up your own pool in addition to the boxes. You'd be limited by how fast the mana un-attunes, and how fast you can move the mana around, so you won't exactly be doubling your pool size. But by essentially "juggling" mana, you can have access to (X-2)*(amount of mana stored in one box) additional mana attuned to you. Mind you, this setup with the boxes won't exactly keep you mobile so it's not battlefield practical. With a bit of setup time, it should be good for (depending on whether you can directly pull from the boxes while casting) 1 (assuming you can pipe it directly into the spell) or 2 (empty your pool, refill it from the boxes, empty it again) good strong surges of magic.
