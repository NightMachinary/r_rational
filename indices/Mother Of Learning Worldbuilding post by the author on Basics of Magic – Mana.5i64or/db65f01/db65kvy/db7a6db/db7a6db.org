Well, MoL's mana is very psychoreactive. It has to be, since things need a brain to think, and you need to think to cast, at least on some level (even if that level is low-level functions of a magi-beast's brain).

Since mana is psychoreactive, it does make sense that, were a super spooky wyrm exist in the Deep Forgotten Tunnels of Deepness Long Forgotten^{TM} that shat out enough mana on a regular basis that the entire planet was more or less suffused with it, it could actually be a fairly toxic thing.

Here's another question:

How can raw mana only degrade physical structures when "absorbed", whatever that means, if it functions as a sort of radiation that penetrates solid matter?

How can it be both intangible enough to just say "lol, what nuclear bonds?" and permeate stuff, yet tangible when, for lack of a better term, spiritually ingested? What sort of state-change does it undergo?

On top of that, why is it presented that souls generate mana from nothing?

Could it not be that souls have a type of metabolic function on the spiritual level, and that mana is either the or an excretion of that process?

I mean, MoL has different planes of existence. Souls could be feeding on the plane of infinite punch energy, and simply digest metaphysical punches into mana.
