  The second, and probably the most widely used method, is to utilize ambient mana to augment the regeneration of one's mana reserves. This is done by slowly drawing upon ambient mana and assimilating it into existing mana reserves. In the past, this was a rare and ill-understood ability -- it is only in the last 200 years or so that mages figured out a reliable and easy-to-learn method to attune ambient mana into one's personal mana reserves. This was mostly done by closely studying magical creatures, who passively and unconsciously use this method to â€˜feed' upon ambient mana. Even today, most magical creatures are still better at assimilating ambient mana than the average human mage.
