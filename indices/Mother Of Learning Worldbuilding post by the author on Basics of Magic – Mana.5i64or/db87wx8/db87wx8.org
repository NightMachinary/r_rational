  A soul bond, such as that between a familiar and caster, makes sharing mana easier. Frequent mana sharing between same people will cause them to gradually get used to each other's mana, likewise easing mana sharing... though only between those specific individuals. Some creatures and bloodlines can innately use other people's mana with greater ease than normal.
