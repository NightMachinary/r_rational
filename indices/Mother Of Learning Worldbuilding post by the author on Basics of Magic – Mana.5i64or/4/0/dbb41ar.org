  However, if too much ambient mana is channeled through an object too inadequate to bear the pressure, it can still break, burn or melt.

Plus some other likely negatives:

- inflexible (magical items usually only do 1 thing)

- harder to control (surely doing magic through the aid would be more unwieldy)

Your simulacrum idea might make a more flexible casting aid. But if you are a good enough mind mage to control your simulacrum, your simulacrum is too (and it knows your weaknesses). If it becomes insane that would be problematic. You would need to bind them very tightly to your will at the start (or use someone else's simulacrum).

Maybe. But seems hard to exploit. I think there are many possible reasons the author could give for this to not work.
