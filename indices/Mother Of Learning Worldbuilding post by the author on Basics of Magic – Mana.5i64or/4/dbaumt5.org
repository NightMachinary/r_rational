The distinction between ambient mana being used by a mind versus a machine seems pointless and exploitable. A machine is just the physical extension of a brain's ideas - the brain wants to do something, so it does it by sending signals down nerves etc. In this case though, the brain wants to do something, so it, using the body, creates a machine to do magic, and but on use the machine gets damaged, which feels weird.

Thus it seems like the entity actually doing the channeling of ambient mana gets damaged, not the intelligence behind the actual usage or the agent that the spell will actually help. So, if we make a wand-like device (maybe a mini mind bound simulacrum?) capable of executing arbitrary spell instructions as programmed by a mage using ordinary mana, the mage could arbitrarily harness ambient mana while only hurting the "mind" of the proxy.
