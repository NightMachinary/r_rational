Considering what the DM said about manipulating events so anagrams could work, "for the sake of plot" is a valid reason.

Edit: I dislike "flashback revelations" in stories, if Amaryllis' past crime becomes a major plot point now 160+ chapters in when it wasn't even mentioned in detail earlier. It feels like a cop-out instead of properly foreshadowing things.
