It has been represented as a complex political attack on her, (spearheaded by Larkspur?), where the legal aspect was only a small part.

As far as I remember, Joon has never looked deeper into it, because this description has been enough for him to file it as blah, blah, politics.

See for example the bio in ch. 15:

She was once a keystone member of a bloc of power within the Lost King's Court, but now she has been cast out through means both semi-legal and downright nefarious.

This is enough to explain why it hasn't been discussed, but yes, it does leave the door open for the specific crime to be interesting.
