My impression is that when you bang against one side of a void crystal, it sends a packet of "void" flying out the other side.

Therefore, a void pistol is literally just a trigger mechanism attached to a crystal. Press the trigger, the hammer bangs on the crystal, you get a hole in the distance.

Keep in mind that Mary was in a machine shop when he found her - a competent scavenger should be able to make a simple "pull lever, bang crystal" apparatus out of the scraps in your average garage.
