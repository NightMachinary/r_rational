It is probably electricity that does it, at least that's how you get them to explode. ch 60:

"All you really needed to make a void crystal explode was a sufficiently powerful electric charge, which would cause it to radiate void out in all directions, eliminating matter from existence."

It would stand to reason that shooting works with a smaller charge. But yes, very simple to do once you have a crystal and a machine shop.
