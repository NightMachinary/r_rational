Kind of a tangent: how the fuck was Mary able to randomly make a void pistol immediately after landing in apocalyptic zombie land? Did they have lots of void pistol parts just kind of lying around? That part always felt to me like Minecraft, where after punching trees for a few minutes you can make a crafting table and stairs and shit.
