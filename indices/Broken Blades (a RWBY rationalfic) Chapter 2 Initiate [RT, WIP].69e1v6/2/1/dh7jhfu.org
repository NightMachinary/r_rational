It looks like this fic only changed some details with characters, rather than the plot or worldbuilding. I'm fine with that since I quite like the show as it is. Volume 2 is where the setting and story started to get interesting and more complicated, but the show ultimately is and always will be about cute girls in colorful outfits fighting monsters with crazy weapons and hanging out with friends from school.

I think it executes that premise well, certainly better than similar shows I've watched, but if you're not interested in that from the beginning the series will never satisfy you. The show is good for what it is thanks to nice animation (even if Volume 1 cut corners), likable characters, over the top action, and continuously improving writing. It's not a masterpiece, but it goes the extra mile when it could've been much more generic.
