That backward jump was a little confusing at first... thought for a moment there that we were about to get either a Groundhog Day style loop, or to find out that Nic had been in an Arcanum induced dream or demon-run simulation of events unfolding, only to be brought back to the beginning for another go-through.

But no, just filling in some recent history. That's fine too.
