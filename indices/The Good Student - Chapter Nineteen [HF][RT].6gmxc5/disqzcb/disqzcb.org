The Chapter at least solved some Problems i saw comming with the level of storytelling, now we know that part with the demon and the weird teacher etc. is finished in a way, and not him suddenly having the capabilities of stoping a demon/disrupting arcanum etc.... to save his friend , no matter in what way. So its more likely to go back to what the story was about before , his school life and well him being a book worm, not the op mc , newly awakend master of arcanum or some bullshit. Almost like dodging a bullet ^{^} I really hope this story goes back to his more mundane problems and lifestyle and also back to the writing style showcased in the first 14/15 chapters. Basically before it went nuts. I think the Story is very refreshing in a way ,and I hope that the author takes his time in developing the story and the world.
