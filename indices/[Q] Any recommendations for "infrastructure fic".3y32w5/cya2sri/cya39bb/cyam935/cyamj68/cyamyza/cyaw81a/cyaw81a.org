The screwed up human interactions didn't even make sense in-universe. Whatsername was supposed to be 'normal intelligence' in contrast to all the rest of her cohort, and yet they all suffered from selective amnesia. I mean, one plot point was that a significant fraction wanted to go on to another star, but it was stated right from the beginning that wasn't possible until they had the ability to build a launching laser. Which was suddenly 'remembered' a couple of chapters later. That's like a whodunnit where the suspect's alibi was that he was in Sydney while the murder was in Denver... and everyone forgot it for half the book.

That they came up with a 'solution' is irrelevant ... the people arguing for going on /knew the problem/ and /didn't have the solution/.

Then there's the whole physical impossibility of high levels of abiogenic free oxygen, which everyone ignored until it became a plot point.

And the infrastructure problems were complete diabola-ex-machina. They didn't actually make sense.
