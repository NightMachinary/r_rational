Completely agree on seveneves, I think I picked it because it was a recent listen, you summed it up nicely. I did especially enjoy the heroic culture of astronauts being willing to die to do the impossible, though the nuclear power inaccuracies/sermonizing/strategic failures were fairly annoying, though the depiction of a fuel element failure was fairly on point. Beyond that, like you said KSP fanfiction.
