Posting from mobile but regarding the blast radius I'd handwave a thermal to electrical efficiency to calculate thermal vs electric output then compare it to the wikipedia values for fuel air explosives then fat finger some % mediated by the process undergoing negative feedback (this would be part of a safe design the question is how fast it happens) but in a loss of containment my rather uneducated (on applied non exponential fusion process) perception is you a small sun escaping a magnetic bottle.
