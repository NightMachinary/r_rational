Is there any way you could offer any advice to an amateur rat-fic authour who's included a nuclear reactor within their own story?

(In the particular case I'm thinking of, the current write-up says it's fusion rather than fission, designed by an unknown but possibly weakly-superhuman artificial intelligence, fits inside a standard cargo container, provides 60 megawatts electric, uses about 7 milligrams of lithium per second at full power, and the troubleshooting section of the manual includes the phrase 'estimated crater radius'. I'm willing to tweak just about any of that to increase realism, if there's reason to.)
