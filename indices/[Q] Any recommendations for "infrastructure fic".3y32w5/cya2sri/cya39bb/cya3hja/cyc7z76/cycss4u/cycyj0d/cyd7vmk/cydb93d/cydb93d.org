  How is the pressure and the mass of the litium within the reaction chamber maintained as 7mg/second is converted into Helium?
#+end_quote

In the current draft, the design uses inertial electrostatic confinement; basically, a souped-up fusor.

  What happens when pressure or temperature goes up, goes down? How quickly does this affect the rate of power production: i.e. how much margin is there between critical (stable normal power) and prompt critical (bombs and Chernobyl)
#+end_quote

I have insufficient knowledge to even try to answer that. Any suggestions you can offer are welcome.

  What method converts heat to electricity?
#+end_quote

Half the energy produced by the fusion is bremsstrahlung X-rays, captured in a lithium heat engine. The other half is highly charged Helium isotopes, decelerated by an electric field which results in an electron beam, which is run through a Rankine MHD. The notes I have list 360 MW thermal.

  I have a hard time imagining anything with a "estimated crater radius" being allowed in society.
#+end_quote

The story is set post-apocalypse, and the reactor's primary owner doesn't always advertise its existence or presence. (If it makes you feel better, my quick calculations based on a role-playing-game's build system imply a crater radius on the order of 15 yards. Again, I'm open to suggestions for revision, if you have a more realistic source.)
