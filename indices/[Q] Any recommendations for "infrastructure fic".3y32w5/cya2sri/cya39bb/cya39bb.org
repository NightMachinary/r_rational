Seveneves wasn't Infrastructure fic, it was really good Kerbal Space Program fan-fiction.

Which I enjoyed, up to where the physics got literally impossible, and the sociology astronomically unlikely. But the first two thirds was good.

Other stuff in the same vein you might enjoy: Heart of the Comet, and the Queendom of Sol trilogy, and The Wreck of the River of Stars.
