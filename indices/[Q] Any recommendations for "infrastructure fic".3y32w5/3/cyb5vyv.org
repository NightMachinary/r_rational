They aren't existing canons, but /The Traitor Baru Cormorant/ and /The Laundry Files/ both hit similar notes. If you want to read about vampires using a burndown chart or the Occult Secret Service doing paperclip audits, /The Laundry Files/ is the series for you. /The Traitor Baru Cormorant/ is largely about the intersection between people and economics.

I've also heard that the Star Wars EU novel /Tarkin/ is largely about the construction of the first Death Star, but it's still in the mail, so I don't know whether that's true (or whether it's good).
