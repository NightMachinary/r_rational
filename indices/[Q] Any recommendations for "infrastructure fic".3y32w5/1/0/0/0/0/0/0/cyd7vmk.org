How is the pressure and the mass of the litium within the reaction chamber maintained as 7mg/second is converted into Helium?

What happens when pressure or temperature goes up, goes down? How quickly does this affect the rate of power production: i.e. how much margin is there between critical (stable normal power) and prompt critical (bombs and Chernobyl)

What method converts heat to electricity? Nuclear reactors usually use a steam cycle which has a theoretical maximum efficiency of 60%]([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rankine_cycle#Description]]) and a real efficiency of around 20% (i Think it's been a long time) followed by steam trurbines which have efficiencies in the 90-99.9% percent range. Thermal or photo voltaic is much lower efficiency with today's technology (though it'll be great for space travel if we can get a long life cell with good efficiency) so that means 60MW electric would be 300MWt (t -thermal) that's a little over half the thermal output of a Nimitz class aircraft carrier [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A4W_reactor][A4W reactor]] So pokling a hole in that reaction chamber would be very bad, and I think I rember his was a vehicular design, so I'd imagine you'd need a rod from god to break the containment.

I have a hard time imagining anything with a "estimated crater radius" being allowed in society.

The difference between your reactor and the A4W is the A4W physically can't go boom without someone basically re-designing, and then re-building it. I honestly can't imagine a reactor that can go boom without someone first disassembling it maliciously reassembling it ever being legal in North America because of the culture of design safety that has evolved due to the rational fear of designs that can go boom, and because basically that means you have a nuclear reactor that occasionally can be used as a nuclear weapon. I like the second amendment a lot, but I doubt society is ever going to trust you, I, or anyone, to own something that can be used as a nuclear weapon.

I also imagine the reaction chamber after inital use would be prohibitively activated such that anyone maliciously taking it apart and altering it so it would could go boom couldn't do so without dying in the process and or assembling infrastructure that would make people ask pointed questions.
