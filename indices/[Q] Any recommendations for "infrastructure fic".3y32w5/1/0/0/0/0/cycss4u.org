Dumping a nuclear reactor when they don't have a source of fissionables.

I'm unsure how accurate the snow reactor is, because it is a exotic heat cycle, that is to say not a pressurized water reactor, and because the fuel element failures produced what seemed unrealistically high amounts of contamination. I got the general "just say no to nuclear power" moralizing vibe. I qualified as an engineer on a S6G reactor, but I'm a civilian now, so I'm effectively NDA'd against math on the topic without doing a several hours wiki walk to define what is public knowledge.

If I have time after April I'll do that wiki walk find the papers on the power turning characteristics, cladding material requirements, for comet reactors if there are ones and the orbital characteristics of comet ejecta and do the math. One thing is sure if that reactor failed the way it did, then it wasn't built under NR or NRC regulations.
