I'm glad you're giving it a chance! Can I ask how far you've gotten? There's definitely an upward curve, but the climax to the Waves arc is almost universally beloved so if you don't like that you might be disappointed.

Also, when you say you're hearing great things, do you mean here on [[/r/Rational][r/Rational]]? Or is the story being discussed on other forums as well? Because that would be pretty neat if so.
