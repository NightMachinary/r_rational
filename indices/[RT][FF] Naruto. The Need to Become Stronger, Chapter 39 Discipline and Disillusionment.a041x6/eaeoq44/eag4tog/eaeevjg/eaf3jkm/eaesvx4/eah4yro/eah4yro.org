The comments on this chapter remind me that I need to go and re-read this one of these days; I'm looking forward to it! Some thoughts:

​

- The bit where Sakura figures out the truth behind poison-release really made a bunch of loose threads click for me. The whole story became clearer after reading about her realization. Maybe that was just /my/ moment of insight, but good job! I'm really starting to see what the overarching conflict of the story is about and it's hitting all of the points that I'd always wanted to see addressed.

​

- It seems like our main characters inherited a world in a precarious equilibrium, with a worldwide conspiracy to keep people from figuring out the truth about chakra and techniques, and the more ordinary conspiracy that the military-industrial complex has shaped politics to keep itself alive forever, to the detriment of regular people everywhere. I'm excited to see what each character learns about this ugly world and what they do about these two big problems.

​

- Right now, it looks like Sasuke is the only one who's okay with the status quo regarding the two conspiracies, but narratively I expect that to change. That makes me expect that the truth behind the Uchiha massacre will be related to changing his opinion on at least one of the conspiracies (my bet is on the military one).

​

- If I were writing this story, my endgame would be Team 7 starting a political revolution by teaching all of their followers about the secret to techniques and then their faction managing to dissolve the stratocracy.
