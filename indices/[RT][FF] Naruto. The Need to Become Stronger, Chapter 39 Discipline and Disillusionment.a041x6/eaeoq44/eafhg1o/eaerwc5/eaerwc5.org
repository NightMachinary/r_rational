I hear what you're saying, and this is more of a literary device than a rational analysis, but genjutsu are essentially the only thing with any possibility of restraining them, so they are what have to be used within the narrative.

Then when characters employ things like the sharingan, which the original material describes with such hyperbolic language that they may create 'perfect' genjutsu, it doesn't matter how smart and powerful the kyuubi is because it is not PERFECTLY smart or omnipotent.

The interplay between the original work and fanfiction allows for liberties, I remember yudkowsky saying that his readers would have criticised and questioned the existence of Azkaban if he had invented it, but because it was in the source material he had much more liberty to play with it.

Not a perfect response and I have no time to edit, my flight is taking off. I hope this describes at least the direction of my thought.

But also, you're right.
