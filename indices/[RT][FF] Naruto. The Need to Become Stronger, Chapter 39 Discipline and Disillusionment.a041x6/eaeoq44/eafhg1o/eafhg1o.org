Good observation! I do in fact have an explanation for this. This is one of those times when I would have liked to write much more about the underlying mechanics, but it slowed down the pacing of the story too much for me to fit it in. I did however manage to include this segment in the Forest of Death:

  “He's right,” said Sakura. “Humans that lived in areas like these slowly evolved to use chakra consciously, as opposed to ordinary animals which only ever use it passively. Some scholars even say that the reason we grew intelligent in the first place was because it allowed us to use chakra better, by harnessing the power of our concentration and imagination. Although, that does raise the question of why most people are unable to become ninjas, despite the clear evolutionary advantage it offers...”

And then in [[https://needtobecomestronger.wordpress.com/2017/12/18/chapter-29/][Chapter 29]] from when Jiraiya was teaching Naruto the summoning technique:

  He looked up again. “Dad... this mount whatsit place where the toads come from -- you said you've been there, right? Was everything else there really huge as well?”

  “Oh yeah. Giant trees the size of mountains, huge toadstools... you'd have to see it to believe it, kiddo.”

  “So just like the Forest of Death then,” Naruto said, realizing. “Did you ever summon toads in another area with huge trees and plants like that? And did the contract last longer then?”

  Jiraiya blinked. “Huh, come to think of it... I summoned Gama Bunta in this weird valley in the Land of Grass once -- huge place filled with crazy stuff -- and he never popped ‘till we got into combat with this rogue Grass ninja and he took a few bad hits. Never really thought about it, but that was pretty strange.”

  That settled it. “Dad, it sounds like these giant animal spirits can only survive in areas with lots of natural chakra like the Forest of Death or this Mount place they're from, and if they go away from there they slowly run out of chakra until they die from it. I'm guessing whoever invented the technique made it so that it automatically calls the spirits back to the place they were summoned from when that's about to happen.” And in fact, that implied they were not spirits at all, but just unusually intelligent chakra animals.

And of course, all of this eventually leads to Naruto summoning Gaara when he releases the One-tailed beast, as explained by Hiashi afterwards:

#+begin_quote
  “So that's how you did it.” They all turned to look at the person seated at the far end of the table: A pale man dressed in white robes and brown haori who could only be the lord Hyūga himself. “You knew from your own experience that when a host loses his struggle with the daemon within, he becomes vulnerable to targeted techniques such as genjutsu and sealing, the same as any other spirit. That is how you summoned him to your position and slew him despite the sheer difference in power. Ingenious.”
#+end_quote

It's never stated explicitly, but the idea here (and what Naruto definitely realized, even if he never said it out loud) is that humans and chakra creatures like animal summons and the Tailed Beasts went through two different evolutionary paths: Humans evolved to use chakra consciously, and so acquired a resistance to foreign chakra such as techniques that might otherwise be used against them. Chakra animals instead evolved the ability to absorb chakra from their surroundings, giving them incredible natural strength and resilience (as well as weird mutations) but making them vulnerable to techniques that inject foreign chakra into their system like genjutsu.

The obvious question then is how Sages work, but that will be explained at a later point in the story. :)

​

tl;dr: Spirit animals cannot resist foreign chakra because they /are/ giant balls of foreign chakra.
