I really like the direction Sakura is going in, and can't wait to see how a rational story handles ninja medicine. One of the things that fascinated me the most about canon, was the medical stuff; the biology of ninja powers, and how its one of the few things about Part 1 that the creators actually thought about it, and extrapolated into Part 2. In a world where having certain cells/genes/organs can grant you powers as extraordinary as manipulating time and space or X-ray vision, characters like Danzo and Orichimaru felt like perfectly natural villains. Maybe it's cuz I do a lot of biology in real life, but I can't to see how this story approaches bloodlines.

I love how Naruto is more Ninjutsu oriented, but I did feel like almost every rational Naruto story missed an opportunity to explore how truly broken somebody could become in the Naruto universe with magic chakra powers, rationality, and an in-depth understanding of biology. I think Sakura, in this story, is really going to scratch my itch for good old fashioned biological transhumanism in a Naruto story.

Though when you think about it, in this fic Naruto is already a lot like a good version of Orichimaru. If he started looking into medicine, that parallel could become even stronger. It would be interesting to read a story where the whole Generation Xerox thing is swapped, because, when you think about, even in canon, Naruto fights a lot more like Orochimaru than Jiraiya. Reliance on weird, basically innate abilities? Check. Incredible regeneration? Check. Summons (shared with Jiraiya but still)? Check. Add a flair for invention and curiosity about the deeper workings of ninjutsu and chakra, and you basically have the Snake Sannin, reborn.

Plus that would mean two characters looking into two different kinds of biological transhumanism, and that would actually make my day :D

Awesome chapter, as always.
