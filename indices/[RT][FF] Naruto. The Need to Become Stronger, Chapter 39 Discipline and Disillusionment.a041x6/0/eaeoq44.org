Not exactly related to this chapter, but something is bothering me about genjutsu in NTBS's world. So to dispel genjutsu you need the intelligence to realize you're in one, and the chakra to purge the hostile chakra, so why can't the nine-tailed fox, and other spirits, who are both intelligent and have chakra defend themselves against genjutsu?
