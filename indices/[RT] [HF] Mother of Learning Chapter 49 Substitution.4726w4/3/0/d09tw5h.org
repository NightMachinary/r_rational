Yeah, I always had the theory that everyone in the loop was just being "dreamt" by the primordial or something powered by it; the loop will eventually end once the primordial runs out of juice.

Furthermore, I feel like there's only going to be one soul that "escapes" from the loop. The Matriach's packet said something similar, about how there can only be one.

The final battle will be something out of Highlander; Zach throwing supernovas of mana, Red Robe summoning another primordial and Zorian, off to the side, ready to snipe whoever's left standing.
