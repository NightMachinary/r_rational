I think it's more likely that Red Robe (or whoever started the time loop) is another member of Zach's family (or someone else with a vested interest in Zach's survival), and that part of their "win condition" is that Zach needs to survive the events that they're putting into motion.

I've also been suspecting that it's Neolu for ages - or that, at a minimum, Neolu is working with Zach the way that Kael is working with Zorian.

From way back in Chapter 3:

"Neolu finished in only half an hour," said Akoja after a brief silence. "I bet she'll get a perfect score again."

"Ako..." Zorian sighed.

"I know everyone thinks I'm jealous but that's not normal!" said Akoja in a hushed but agitated voice. "I'm pretty smart and I study all the time and I'm still having problems with the curriculum. And we've both been in the same class with Neolu for the first two years and she was never this good. And... and now she's beating me in every single class!"

"Kind of like Zach," said Zorian.

"Exactly like Zach!" she agreed. "They even hang out together, two of them and one other girl I don't know, behaving like... like they're in their in their own private little world."
