A couple options there:

-The plan involves keeping Zach safe, but Zach wouldn't approve of the plan.

-The plan involves keeping Zach safe, but Zach's knowledge of the plan would encourage him to take more dangerous actions.

-The plan requires Zach to be alive at a specific point in time, but keeping Zach alive is not expressly part of the objective. (For example, Zach needs to be sacrificed to wake the Primal, but this consumes his soul and can only be done once...or something.)
