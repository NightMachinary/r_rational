Just because that's Zach's motivation doesn't mean she can't have something else going on. Maybe Zach is letting her in on the timeline stuff when he chooses to visit, similar to how Zorian is telling certain people. Zach may also have developed his own methods of passing information from other timelines - or maybe a sufficiently powerful mind mage (or someone with a similar skill set) can get that info just from being in contact with Zach.

I do think the "other girl" is also an intriguing possibility, however.
