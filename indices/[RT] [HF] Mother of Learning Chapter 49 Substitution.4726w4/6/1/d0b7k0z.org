If we knew what RR has been up to the last dozen loops or so it would help a lot with speculating. But Boranova does sound like a decent guess.

There was another noteworthy line in that chapter.

  "A topic for another time," Ilsa said without missing a beat. "For now, I want you to take notice of what happened when you dispelled the spell on the bowl -- it dropped like a rock, and if it had not been magically strengthened, it would have probably shattered upon impacting the table. This is the main problem inherent in all disruptor spells. Disruptor spells are the simplest form of dispelling, and *virtually every spell can be disrupted if you put enough power into the disruptor, but sometimes disrupting the spell can have worse consequences than letting it run its course.* This is especially true for higher-order spells, which almost always react explosively to disruption because of the vast amount of mana that goes into their casting. Not to mention that 'enough power' can be far more than any mage can provide. Place your bowls on the table and put a few torn pages from your notebook into it."

Possibly even an apparent time loop spell? That could be interesting.
