  "You realize what this means, right?" Kael asked him. It was apparently a rhetorical question because Kael immediately answered it himself. "Every one of those times you died during the invasion, your soul was likely sucked into that thing along with everyone else's."

  "Yeah, so?" asked Zorian. "The time loop mechanism clearly doesn't care about that. It just plucks my soul out of the pillar and goes on to do its thing like usual."

  ..."Yes, and the collection process is apparently sufficiently benign that you have suffered no soul damage from being exposed to it multiple times," Kael said.

Yess, like I said in the previous chapter discussion XD

That said, that was a good chapter. Zach reminds me of Naruto too much to even consider him a Red Robe, what a clever plan, Zach, I'm fairly sure you can't devise it. Xvim being awesome was expected since he showed his perfect mind shield, Xvim being /this/ awesome wasn't. Politics make sence, and that's a good thing.
