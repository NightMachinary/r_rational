That seems kinda complicated. I think your theory needs shaving with an ocaam's razor.

I think it's pretty likely that there really are only two time loopers: Zach and Zorian. Only Zach and Zorian have that soul marker from when the lich did his evil spell thing, or at least, theirs were the only markers Zorian detected. If someone was concealing their soul marker, they would have to both 1. be a soul mage and 2. be in the loop. Unless the marker isn't indicative of someone who's looping.

We don't actually /know/ what Zach's motivations are, nor Red Robe's. If Zach was Red Robe, and if he had already deduced that Zorian was the other time looper, maybe Zach had no compunctions about killing Zorian because he would just be back in the next loop. Red Robe might be a simulacrum of Zach's. Have we ever stopped to consider why Red Robe disguises his identity? I mean, if Red Robe is in the time loop, then what does he have to gain from the disguise when no one will remember what he does in the next loop except for another time looper?

Maybe it's so that the ibasans don't recognize him as a noble from Eldemar, so he can gain their trust? While that does seem more like a Zorian tactic, remember that there is a possibility that part of Zach's soul was separated from him and fused to Zorian's, which could explain why Zorian got pulled into Zach's time loop. And Zorian has been fighting more openly and directly now than he used to, which seems more like a Zach tactic.

As for how the time loop itself works, maybe there isn't actually a time loop. Remember how the Aranea died? They never came back after the loop reset. Other people who die in the loop are back to life after the reset, but the Cyorian Aranea aren't. This feels like it should somehow be a big clue, especially combined with how "time travel is impossible" has been repeated so many times throughout the story it feels like forshadowing. So what could be going on?

I'm going to just take this theory and run with it for a bit to see where it goes.

Limits:

1. no time travel
2. not cosmic in scale. the phenomenon is limited to Eldemar and the surrounding nations, or maybe even just Eldemar if the Ibasans are already arrived at the start of the loop.
3. Zach is probably Red Robe, since it's pretty late in the story and no other major characters that we've met seem equally plausible as Red Robe yet. Even if Zach only has a 40% chance of being Red Robe, it seems at this point like everyone else is even less likely to be Red Robe.
4. the phenomenon is fueled either by the ambient magic, or the trapped souls, or some combination of the two.
5. It is possible for someone to be removed from the phenomenon. I.e. the Cyorian Web. Their corpses are still in the phenomenon, but their souls are no longer in it, otherwise they would be back to life at the start of every new "loop".

4 makes it seem like the phenomenon has something to do with the attempt to summon the primoridial, since that would be an obvious place for the ambient magic used up with each "loop" to go.

This rules out dimension hopping, because that would require the Aranea's souls to be erased from time after a certain point in all universes that are identical up until the "loop". Since that would be cosmic it breaks limit 2, and so is very unlikely.

Possible ways to remove someone from the phenomenon would depend on the nature of the phenomenon. If it is some sort of simulation (i.e. a "dream" of the primordial) then the Aranea could have been removed if their real bodies outside of the dream were killed. Supposing they're not time travelling, because of limit 1, they're not dimension hopping, which means that everyone in the story really is in the same place, which means that when the "loop" resets, everyone is replaced with a version of themselves that is one month younger. Or the changes to their souls accumulated from that month are erased.

Maybe all of the "loops" exist simultaneously, and Zorian is just jumping from one instance to another, replacing whatever version of him is already there. If that's the case, then maybe the phenomenon isn't being "fueled" by the ambient magic or trapped souls at all, and that's just an indicator of which "loop" he's in. When it "runs out" that means that Zach has been to every "loop". In other words, a finite number of "loops" all existing simulatenously. This is unlikely because it doesn't explain the mechanism for how Zach and Zorian are jumping.

Here's a thought. What if Zorian's soul /never actually/ escaped from its imprisonment? Nor anyone else's? If we're going by the simulation/dream hypothesis, then this would make sense, but it still doesn't explain why nearly every trapped soul is reliving the same month over and over without remembering any of it. Nevertheless, the "dream" theory is one of the simplest explanation so far that seems to fit in text evidence and it incorporates the soul-collecting machine better than the other theory above does.

I'm quite sure the starting points and ending points of the "loop" have to be very significant. Since Zach is the original "looper" we need to pay attention to what he does and what happens to him and in Eldemar in general at the start and end of every loop, especially the first loop. So what happens, generally? At the start of each "loop" Ibasans prepare to invade, Zach defeats his caretaker and runs away. At the end of the first loop, Zach was fending off the invasion when he got affected by the lich's spell. The lich's spell interacted with the phenomenon, pulling Zorian into the phenomenon. If we're going by the dream theory, and Zach had some way to remember things after every reset, then getting part of Zach's soul spliced onto Zorian might make Zorian remember too.

Maybe Zach snuck in some sort of device into the mansion to transmit memory packets to and from his trapped soul? This seems unlikely.

If we're still going by the dream/simulation theory, then we need a mechanism for how Zach remembers things after each reset. I think it's probably a memory packet. The question is how he's storing the memory packet. It would have to be stored in something that lasts through each reset. It could last through each reset if it's outside of the soul-collecting machine. It could also last through each reset if it's stored in something inside the dream that is still there with every reset. Maybe the memory packet is stored in the ambient magic that decreases with each "loop". After all, that ambient magic decreasing with each "loop" could somehow be hiding Zach's degrading memory packet. When the memory packet has completely degraded, Zach and Zorian will no longer be able to store new memories from each "loop" and therefore will no longer be able to "loop" and will lose their memories with each reset just like all the other trapped souls. The next question then is why Sudomir's soul would be in the machine if he's the one who created it. Someone would have had to kill his real body outside of the phenomenon. He said he created the machine for "political reasons". What sort of spell could he be gathering those souls for that would fit political reasons? He's not ibasan, and he's the mayor of Knyazov Dveri, and the people there love him, and aside from being a soul mage, he is not known to have been involved in any crimes or conspiracies against Eldemar prior to this one. It's clear from some of what he's said that he's not really on the Ibasan's side. He's just using them. So what could the Ibasan's give Sudomir? The ability to teach and practice soul magic openly perhaps? That doesn't really go well with his killing off of all the other soul magic experts in the nation. What about bringing someone back to life who is useful to him politically? Qtach-Ichl is the king of the Ibasans, right? Since he's a lich and that means none of his heirs could succeed him. Maybe Sudomir is trying to bring back one of Ichl's heirs, and is using the souls he captures to try to open a door to the spirit world? This would make more sense, but it would need some in text evidence supporting it. Hmm...

So in summary there are a couple of theories that are most likely:

-They're all trapped in a dream/simulation inside the soul machine -Zach is Red Robe -the reducing ambient magic with each reset is or somehow represents a degrading memory packet, and the memory packet is what is making the phenomenon possible.

I bet those psychic mice might have something really important to do with all this. They're clearly not ordinary evil psychic monsters. If they were, they probably wouldn't be any more dangerous or foreboding than a threatening Aranea tribe. While they could be being used by the Ibasans for spying purposes, i'm not sure if they've actually been in Cyoria every reset. Have they?
