Thanks. Of course ocaam's razor. I was perfectly aware that it was speculation, and tried to have a correspondingly smaller amount of certainty in it, although in light of what you have said, I think I was still overconfident in spite of that. I really should reread the book.

Don't worry about sounding patronizing. It was unintentional and kinda justified lol.

I'll take you up on that offer if I can finish a full reread before the story ends lol.
