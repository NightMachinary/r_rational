*If you're unwilling to read through my whole mess, [[/u/Sailor_Vulcan]], read the bottom-most section, separated by the line.*

Yeah it still is kinda complicated and has elements not backed up by the story. Few things on Gods, Portals, and stuff.

In many ways it would be simpler to only have two loopers - one marker is better than two + the king's loop was only him. I'd say it's pretty likely that Zach knows Zorian's in it though: Zorian has given so many clues that if Zach was paying the least of attention and wasn't dumb, he'd have found out.

I'm not even sure it's possible to hide the soul marker; if so, it'd be super hard (probably). No hints towards that.

If Zach was Red Robe, he would've killed soulkilled Zorian already, considering he probably knows Zorian is a looper and Red Robe's 'kill every potential looper'/'kill hundreds/thousands of Araneans'.

Good point of the disguise. Of course, if capturing Zach went wrong (assuming diff people) then he would want the Simulcrum to hide himself.

How could he control the Simulcrum so well, though? We know for certain Red Robe isn't a telepath (otherwise Zorian would know). Perhaps when alone it would be possible, but probably not on the ground (as Zach) and attacking (as RR) at the same time. A potential solution would be Soul Switches bullshit, but Occam's Razor.

I could definitely imagine Zach!RR as a fourth party in the whole politics thing (Eldemar, Ibasia, Sudomir, Zach!RR). That would be more likely than him being good or bad. It's still problematic though (limping in when he first comes back sick, but he could've been fine and wanted to keep up appearenced for Zorian). Mmmmmmm, perhaps, perhaps. Doesn't fit with Zach's personality that Zorian's taken on though.

The Aranea plus *the assassins* were soulkilled, which is why in particular they are dead at the beginning. The time travel is impossible could be important, being right by simulation. We don't quite know what's happening with Soulkill though. I'd wager time travel is more likely than soulkill.

1. Difficult to say. Simulation's simpler than some other semi mind mess-with-people.
2. Again, what would happen when you exit the area? Especially by having an area so small, people would find out.
3. Less likely, yes, but not him more likely. There are more hoops to jump through with Zach than some random person. It's possible, but hard to tell. Random Idea:(With Daimen, Domagoj started off as world building, and just added that in as characterization for Zorian. Points for Zach?)
4. It's very hard to say. If more local, then maybe the souls, a very real possibility if the loop is what Sudomir wants. It fights the idea of the original loop with the king, though. Yeah, solutions, but Occam's Razor. | Regarding ambient magic, unless there's a well, the world is mostly a mana desert. (With the exception of the dungeons.) I was thinking alignment mana or something, heart of the world magic, or godly magic/mana.
5. There are definitely possibilities in every case as for why someone can be removed. As with some real time messing, it's simply trapping the soul (perhaps by attaching them to yourself in some way) to prevent them from returning to their body on reset. Or it could be souls leaving immediately after the reset. | A simulation would be a simple delete/don't return on something. A person with the marker could effectively have root level permissions to control the loop. That's the point of the switches. | As for your no real loop, it's less defined. Perhaps getting fully caught in Sudomir's soultrap? That would be debunked because of Kael(?)'s saying Zorian would be getting caught each time. It just gets more complicated to solve, which I definitely could.

Yes, the primordial could be involved in some way, but there is no confirmation on its existence. (Idea: it needs the soul container, but Sudomir would never let that happen if that was the case.)

Dimension hopping/Multiple worlds Multiverse sounds unlikely in either case. It's implied that the souls aren't actually killed, just moved/trapped/something else. Nothing requires they be erased, for anything. As for a godly or primordial dream, they would just be modified.

Mmmnn it's getting hard to respond. Sorry I'm tired. You're going into more and more speculation. More complicated than simulation anyway (not the most likely thing, anyway).

#+begin_quote
  Maybe all of the "loops" exist simultaneously, and Zorian is just jumping from one instance to another, replacing whatever version of him is already there. If that's the case, then maybe the phenomenon isn't being "fueled" by the ambient magic or trapped souls at all, and that's just an indicator of which "loop" he's in. When it "runs out" that means that Zach has been to every "loop". In other words, a finite number of "loops" all existing simulatenously. This is unlikely because it doesn't explain the mechanism for how Zach and Zorian are jumping.
#+end_quote

Just no. Why limited? Why simultaneous? It's so goddamn complicated. I love Occam's Razor.

#+begin_quote
  If we're going by the simulation/dream hypothesis
#+end_quote

Of which there are many, that is, by a god, by a primordial, in the trap. The trap is unlikely because why would Sudomir go nuts? All of the dream ideas are simple in some ways, but have little basis in the story/foreshadowing.

#+begin_quote
  Since Zach is the original "looper" we need to pay attention to what he does and what happens to him and in Eldemar in general at the start and end of every loop, especially the first loop.
#+end_quote

Yeah. He's important.

#+begin_quote
  Zach defeats his caretaker and runs away.
#+end_quote

There's more to it than this.

Also Zach's first loop was not Zorian's first loop, right? At most a decade for Zach, I can't quite remember.

As for joining, parts of their soul swapped, and Zorian joined the loop. Thus, Zach keeps his soul and Zorian keeps his at the beginning of each loop. This is why they keep their magic abilities too: it's not just memory. The book actually says this.

I couldn't read your final paragraph. It was... uh ... too off base.

*If you're gonna take anything away from my critique take this.*

--------------

I love how you posted a long-ass response to me. That's awesome. However /you really need to reread the book/. Let me repeat, *you need to reread the Mother of Learning*. You're missing some important ideas that the story almost goes out and states for you. Without these proven ideas, it's really fucking hard to theorize. I've read 3 times, I think, and I'm ripe for a reread. Also, this is in my top two stories, so I love to theorize about it.

Forgive me if I'm patronizing or anything. I really don't mean it and want to enjoy the story with you :P

After you do that, we can come back and be theorizing buddies. Also, sorry for not putting quotes in front of each comment. Just pull up what you wrote along side what I wrote.

:\ It's probably real time looping and Zach is probably not Red Robe, but he could be.

Also, you spelled Quatach-Ichl wrong. Hell, I might've spelt it wrong.

In progress edit: The summary doesn't really need commenting on this. The brainrats have always been in Cyoria, just not always commented on. The Aranea have also prayed on them, too, especially after Zorian started helping them.

Thanks for the thought man. I'm also close to character limit, wow.
