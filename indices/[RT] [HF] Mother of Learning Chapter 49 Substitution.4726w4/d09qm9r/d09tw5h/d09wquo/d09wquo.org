:END:

I think it would be unlikely to only let one person out (too complex/Occam's Razor) but that ending would be super awesome. I think the end of the second arc would either be the memory packet reveal (which would be either total information or barely enough which would be because plot realizations or foreshadowing respectively) or would contain some nuts stuff with the soul container (or whatever it's called).
