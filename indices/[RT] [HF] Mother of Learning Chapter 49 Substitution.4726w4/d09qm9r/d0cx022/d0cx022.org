I just read this fic and love it. My theory is similar to yours. There were references to a machine or a room +that house Noveda had possession of+ (Black Rooms, mentioned in Ch 9. It was mentioned in the context of Zach's skill but had no connection to house Noveda.) for giving someone years of experience in a short time. I believe Red Robe used this machine as a basis for creating this time loop. It only works for House Noveda so he had to have Zach join to loop. Zach has the soul marker because that is how the machine identifies its master and give the master control of the machine. Red Robe did not expect Zach to be a problem because - he's young and incompetent, he doesn't know what's happening, Red Robe knows who and where he is and could disable him at the start of every loop if needed. Somehow Red Robe is able to join the loop without a marker, or maybe he has a market but can choose not to join or observe the effects from outside. The machine is protecting Zach's soul, which is why the lich's spell was broken. It may also protect his mind, preventing Red Robe from erasing his memory or something, which it seems Red Robe would have done already if he could have.

The powerful factions of the invasion are working together but not entirely aligned/trusting. The Lich knows there is a time loop but does not know the details. For example the Lich did not recognize Zach or know the loop could be messed up by soul magic, causing the whole mess for the invaders.

I predict they will find something wrong with astronomy as Xvim suspects. After the time loop completes it will return to the real world near the time when the loop began, though some time may have passed (minutes, hours, or days). Red Robe used a spell to remove the achanae souls from the loop/simulation. They will be alive as normal when the loop ends (it's possible they will remember the loop they died in). I believe Red Robe is currently trying to identify the other loopers by doing as little as possible. Maybe doing something to cause Zach to get out of the way so Red Robe can better isolate the other actors.
