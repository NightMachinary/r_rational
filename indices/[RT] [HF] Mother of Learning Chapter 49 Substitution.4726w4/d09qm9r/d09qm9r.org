I originally posted this on [[/u/nobody103]]'s Patreon. Read for theories :)

--------------

Here's a legit question: Why is the chapter called Substitution? My best guess would be Xvim thinking Zorian had been substituted. Nothing else I can think of works, and the titles tend to have more significance/relation to their chapter. This chapter has more than just that.

Now: the speculation.

Zach could be Red Robe, but that'd be a bit silly. I think Zach would be able to figure out it was Zorian from when Zorian said sorry to Zach before leaving to see the soulkill (if my memory serves). Also his skill during the fight (at least the coin).

There has to be more than Zach wanting revenge. I think that the relevant authorities were in on the invasion with the Ibasans. Perhaps Zach's families knew stuff about portals & the Ibasans. My memory is fuzzy on them, but they were military and /I think/ led the push against the Ibasans. Could the Weeping be man/lich-made? I think the politics must've been huge. Essentially, the Ibasans targeted the Novedas. When the Weeping didn't kill them all, Tesen Zveri was asigned as his caretaker to finish them off. It was all a conspiracy that Sudomir is taking advantage of. Please correct me on the Noveda family/Weeping if I'm wrong.

Regarding the scale of loop. First, the simplest thing would be to assume that the spiritual world exists throughout the whole universe too (or permiates). Now, it's also weird to assume that someone made the loop; I remember you writing that generally, previous mages weren't as powerful. Could the gates not be manmade, but god/spirit/something else-made. Something that either collaborated with the humans or the humans stole like every other piece of their magic.

Now, putting a limit on the boundaries of loop is complicated, eg. what would it be like outside of it? At the edges? Of course, it could be a simulation where say the Earth (or whatever it's called) is high quality, but the stars are lower. There may or may not be a boundary, like becoming high quality when viewed. But that's super complicated and has many nuances. So, if it was made by the gods/another powerful figure, then why not let it go across the whole universe, if the gods created it.

I like to think of it as a god taking the world as it is, then in a split second, preforming the simulation until it falls apart. Then, after the final loop, the souls that may be changed (time travelers) are affected. For everyone outside the loop, only the time travelers are affected. They are affected the point in time when the loop supposedly starts. I hope that makes sense.

The god puts (a) mechanism/s to interact with the loop inside it (soul switches, soulkill spell which I think is a switch, gates?)). Here, the two mystic gates aren't related. One is teleportation and the other is the single gate for the loops.

I guess this solves the stuck in soul trap thing and everything else. The looping construct would be just that, a construct. It's meant to fall apart (like the Matriarch said).

As for Kael's stuff: he can tell because Soul Sight. Second: his stuff is going to be used for something important. Perhaps there's another Soul Sight potion he's going to share with Zorian. Yeah, I'm a big fan of this theory. Also waiting on the purpose of the Silverlake chapter. All in good time, I'm sure. I bet they're going to meet soon.

Other holes? Misconceptions? Other theories? plz share
