We have no idea what arch-mage means in the MoL, it could easily be a primarily political or academic position or it could be mere threat type, ala artillery mage, mind mage, etc. If the position was primarily political or threat rank, than definitely not.. If it's academic, he might be one I guess, but from what we've seen so far that makes for a relatively common title. His feats are not that impressive, the marble thing is clearly not intended to be done as directed, remember the tests was to knock students down some pegs, just sensing the mana isn't something he be shown capable of doing. Also you describe zorian as both "top mind magic experts" and "budding mind magic expert", and couldn't zorian could break his defense thanks to his mind magic's flexibility?
