Hmm. Nah, Imaya's mysterious husband is Quatach-Ichl. That makes her ancient, too, so probably she is Baba Yaga, therefore Silverlake.

Come to think of it, didn't Kael warned Zorian not to ask Silverlake about her last name? And Ilsa warned Zorian not to ask Imaya about her husband. An obvious similarity.

On a sidenote, Silverlake being Baba Yaga [[http://mythicalarchive.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/baba1.jpg][explains]] the mystery of her disappearing house.

And if Baba Yaga is related to Quatach-Ichl, that makes Quatach-Ichl Koschei the Deathless, a lich from Slavic folklore. And guess who author is? Croat!

IT ALL FITS!
