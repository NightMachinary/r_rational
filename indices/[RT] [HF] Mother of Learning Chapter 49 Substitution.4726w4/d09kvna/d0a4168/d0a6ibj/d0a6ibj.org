No, Zach says that the reason he hangs out with Neolu is that she's the only one of their class who believes him when he tells them, since she reads a lot of adventure novels and is a 'na√Øve dreamer'.

I'm curious about the other girl that he hung out with at the start however. She's never been mentioned since. She won't be in their class since we've met them all now, and Akoja will know everyone in their class anyway. So she must be an older student like Taiven, or a student from the first or third tier of classes.
