That's a very good question. Maybe that implies that Zach either:

a) Zach having agency is important to the "win condition" of the loop;

b) Keeping Zach incapacitated is either difficult or not worth the expenditure of resources;

c) Whoever initially started the loop isn't actually active within the loop and/or has restrictions on their behavior.

Food for thought.
