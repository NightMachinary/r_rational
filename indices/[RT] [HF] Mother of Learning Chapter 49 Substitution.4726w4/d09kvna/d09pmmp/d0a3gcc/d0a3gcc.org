If Zach /is/ Red Robe (which I am much less certain of) then it's time to seriously consider that Red Robe might have a motive that does /not/ ultimately involve pointlessly kill people. It doesn't make much sense for Zach to be incredibly evil. Recall that having a piece of Zach's soul made Zorian /more prosocial/ and interested in other people's lives and well being. If Zach's prosocial exterior was a facade then his soul shard would have a different influence. We might potentially imagine Zach to be /good but morally weak/ or /manipulable/ at worst, but I'd be very surprised if he ultimately ends up a real villain.
