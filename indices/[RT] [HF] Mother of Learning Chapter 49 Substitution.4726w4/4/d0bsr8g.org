Huh, everybody noticed it?

This chapter:

#+begin_quote
  /"First it was a lock keyed in to my mana signature, and now this. How exactly did the academy acquire my mana signature? I don't remember giving it at any point," said Zorian./

First chapter:

#+begin_quote
  /"The lock on your door is keyed to your mana, so you'll have to channel some of your personal mana into the key like you did just now before it will unlock," [Ilsa said]./

  /"Ah," said Zorian. Idly he spun the key in his hand, wondering how exactly they got a hold of his mana signature. Something to research later, he supposed./

There /still/ are Chekhov's guns hidden in the early chapters, and such a small ones. Unbelievable.
