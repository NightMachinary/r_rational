I do wonder what Zorian is going to learn once he kills/steals from the grey hunter and how that is going to be combined with the knowledge he gains from the Arenea memory packet.

And as others have said Zach in some form might just be the red robe, where up to that point without really thinking about it I was betting on Daimen, not so much now.

Well, as always, things are exciting and intersting in 'Mother of Learning' :)
