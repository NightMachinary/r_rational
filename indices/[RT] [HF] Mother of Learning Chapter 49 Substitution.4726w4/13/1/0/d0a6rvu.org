Mind magic is still magic, which the big bug is resistant to. Otherwise the human mages wouldn't have so much trouble with it.

What I don't understand is why mages can't use non-magical means of attack, facilitated by magic. Things like setting fire to the area or covering its hole in rocks or inhibiting its movements with alchemical goo. Obviously this is all useless to Zorian, who needs the eggsac, but professional battlemages shouldn't have quite so much trouble.
