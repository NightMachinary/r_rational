I find it extremly unlikely that Red Robe is Zach.

What does this Red Zach /wants/? He wants to burn Cyoria to the ground? Well, he did it dozens of times by now. Why didn't he exit the loop? He wants to munchkin the loop before exiting it? Then why he wasted time on invasion, and why he wastes time on this game with Zorian? He wanted to play chess with himself, and then, when it bored him, he created Zorian to play cat and mouse? That's far too Occam-unfriendly theory, on the level of 'it's all just a dream'.

Really, even Daimen!Red_Robe makes more sense.

That said, everybody who paid attention know that Red Robe is actually *Veyers Boranova*, and this chapter's ending all but confirmed it. He is from Noble House, too, if you missed it.

Think about it. From in-story perspective, low morals --- check, bad temper --- check, motive to see Cyoria burn --- check, a reason to hide his identity (from Zach) --- check, political reason to help Ulquaan Ibasa --- check, opportunity to notice the loop --- check, access to resources necessary to hijack the loop --- check.

From reader's perspective, do you think /nobody103/ of all people just dropped Boranova's name in early chapters? Like, as a background detail? Oh, who am I kidding.
