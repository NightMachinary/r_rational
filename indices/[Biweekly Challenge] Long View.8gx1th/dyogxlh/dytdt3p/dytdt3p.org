I wonder why the stop was programmed in. Sentimental value? Seems like an inefficient and value-less excursion if the idea was to have the ship persist as long as possible.

I'm trying to wrap my head around the mental gymnastics of programming this into priority 1, but also deleting any capability of the ship to understand or appreciate the sentimental value of visiting that system, unless it triggered something in the sentients it housed unbeknownst to the narrator/ship.
