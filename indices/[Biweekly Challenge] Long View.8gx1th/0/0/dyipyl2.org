(Edit: Huh, the previous spoiler tag format isn't working any more. Beginning experimentation.)

Hypothesis: [](#s "There is only one extraordinary event, and no coincidences.")

Corollary: [](#s "By killing her, specifically, he bought his planet an indefinite length of time, not just a few weeks.")

More detailed reasoning: [](#s "His and her minds are pretty-clearly being handled on a different priority level from everything else, whether that's the category of 'things important to her' or 'human minds' or 'brains' or something else. Consider the paragraph on her capability; somewhat backed up by her portrayed mental ability throughout the text; posit that she has a surpassing-normal-specifications, very-abnormal mind. From the hypothesis that there are no coincidences, posit that her abnormality and the observed world's abnormality are causally correlated in some way. Occam's razor--assume that if her existence was a trigger to deliberately end the simulation, either a safer (for her sake) or more immediate (not for her sake) way would be used for shutdown, whether the means were pre-programmed or supervised. Note that this also applies to the phenomena if her abnormality is anthropic, just high-sigma rather than meaningfully special--if a deliberate outside decision, more plausible that it would have been carried out in a more goal-serving way (quicker or safer, given the observed higher priority level of their minds); more plausible that it's symptoms of an internal problem in a hands-off state.")

Elaborated hypothesis: [](#s "Her mind itself is what has been gobbling up the universe's resources. In one of the sillier possibilities, the system on which runs the simulation--which gives higher priority to minds or her mind at least (the higher priority being the bug itself also conceivable, as long as it also directly explains her abnormal mental capabilities)--allocates a set pool of resources to the simulation according to the reported resources needed (maybe there are many simulations, or other resource-intensive programs, running on the same system (whatever its form may be)?), and the special-priority-level-for-minds simulation reports an amount according to the world's parameters and the number of minds in existence. One mind that's using up more resources than it should be, and everything starts getting laggy, getting problems. Emergency intended-temporary resource free-up, certain processes momentarily operating at a simpler level to keep the minds operating smoothly, except the simpler operation isn't 'momentary' because the problem isn't momentary, the simpler process doesn't get to get more complex because the abnormal mind is still there and using up its freed-up resources, and then when the next resources-allocation comes the new estimation calculation is according to the persisting simpler-level process and the number of minds, the lower-amount-of-resources-to-work-with gets locked in, and the world ratchets downward, as though its required budget were being reduced in an off-by-one error each time. That explanation is actually most appealing to me, as the main other would be that her mind is exponentially growing and gobbling up all the system's available resources by itself, for which I would hope there would be additional insight/capability displayed.")

Ah, before I forget again, a weeks-related calculation: [](#s "(Known) human minds went up from 500 million to 7 billion with no apocalypse, then down to 2. If every human-mind death could actually grant a few weeks (rather than, say, a thousand dying in the same day granting the same reprieve (depending on ratchet function) as one dying in one day) before the ultimate end, then treating 'a few weeks' as at least three, 7,000 million * 3 / 52 ~ 403.8 million years before that 'ultimate end' already would have been bought. Even if that ultimate end were about to immediately arrive when the population first started dropping, that's too much time for it to arrive already by 2288.")

Elaboration/Restatement of the corollary: [](#s "Her mind able to die from physical occurrences, and her mind's abnormal operational parameters hypothesised to be the cause of the abnormal behaviour of the simulation, the death of her mind either immediately frees up all the exhausted resources, or else locally frees up the resources she was using while getting rid of the bug that caused putting-on-the-thumbscrews inaccurate resource need estimation. (Or something else I haven't thought of.) Either way, her death specifically allowing the simulation to return to normal operation--Probably, the only hope any of humanity had was for her specifically to be noticed and killed (or even just frozen!) quickly, and by her having been kept alive so long all the rest of humanity has been doomed. Then again, I can still sympathise with that course of action, particularly if she herself suspected it! The 'Even if carrying a virus that would kill everyone else on the planet, still wanting to struggle to live even if it makes everyone else on the world one's enemy'--or the similar 'I will be your ally even if the entire rest of the world become your enemies'... though at least trying a medical coma to see if that had an effect on apocalyptic changes, earlier, or staking everything on being frozen and then being reawoken once humanity had gotten advanced enough to do something about the problem, either on her side or the world's, would have been particularly tempting to me at least...")

Now we get to the confusing part. [](#s "I can't fathom why she would aim for the gut. Was explaining it to him so important to her that she would choose that method, even with how inhuman it was, rather than even the throat? Was there something else she was going to tell him, in the greater die from gut-stab death compared to throat-cut death? Did she predict he wouldn't let her do it if she explained it first--even though, with his current personality, he probably would have and not resisted--and yet not think about how he would react if taken by surprise? For that matter, why did she leave the handle in there? More death-slowing, wanting to give a really really long explanation? And then, able to kill others, yet not able to react/dodge/roll when taken by surprise? Given her displayed personality, and the timing, I can't see it as a deliberate assisted suicide to overcome difficulty in doing it herself--unless the death of her hope when the moon was gone was her despair at confirming the truth, and then only wanting to die together with her father? There's also a semi-funny possibility (though one I don't favour) of her guessing the existence of an afterlife system, trying to get around a necessity-murder-allowed-but-suicide-not rule, or just trying to save him and not herself, since if knowledge didn't interfere then she could have explained it to him first...")

Incidental note of what memory (of a fiction) most resonates with the ending: [](#s "Near the end of the Doc Future prologue. --Huh, the spoiler tag erases the link. [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/34751426243/doc%5C-prologue][http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/34751426243/doc\-prologue]] ")
