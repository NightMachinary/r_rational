Regarding proofreading: I'm mostly thinking about a specific larger project, so consistent reddit checking is not as critical. I'll send you a DM once details crystallize (probably a few weeks in the future).

My mental model of the resource free-up was as follows: There are n server-hours left (let's say a year's worth of full resolution simulation, to grasp a number out of thin air.) The simulators let the next year run at half resolution (which would probably be unnoticeable, as there are a lot of details that can be abstracted away). Now they have a half-year of server time left. Proceeding as before, after ten years have passed in the simulation, we only have 0.098% of the details left, and after another year, they will be further halved. The numbers are arbitrary, of course.

Now the question is how the simulators' resource allocation interacts with the natural decline of the required resources (i.e. humanity dying out). I guess that's where I could finagle the details until the story seems reasonable.
