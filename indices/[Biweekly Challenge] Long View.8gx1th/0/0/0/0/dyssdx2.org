I cannot guarantee consistent reddit checking, but I would be happy to read through and comment on anything I see in my inbox!

I'm happy to get the anwer about all having the same priority; I still don't have a clear mental model about how resource free-up works. In-story, what year (approximately) did humanity last have 7 billion members alive? Let 'The End' be the point at which system simplification directly causes death of any humans still alive; in the story, The End would have come for the two surviving humans at a certain point, and the death of one made enough resources 'free' to delay the ultimate date+time of The End by a few weeks. Does a human death when humans still had 7 billion members delay the ultimate date+time of The End by the same amount, or by much less? (Does the birth and then death of a human result in a negative amount of resources freed up, rather than 0?)

(...even if resource chewing-through at a faster and faster rate, unless the death of a human later somehow gives a greater amount of resources than a human dying earlier... or else, the chewing-through rate /starting/ really fast, then getting slower and slower... but no, still doesn't work if the resource cap decrease-per-unit-time is external... unless it's percentage based, the more 'free' resources there are the faster it gets consumed, in which case... yes, one way or another there has to be a way that 100 deaths (through simultaneity or timing) doesn't delay The End as much as 100 * the delay from a single death, but specifically how...)

(7 billion * 2/52 =..!)
