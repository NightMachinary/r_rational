Unmarked spoilers below (I assume everyone who wants to read the story has read it by now, especially before reading the comments.)

As [[/u/eroticas][u/eroticas]] said below, I intended for them (and in fact for all humans) to have the same priority. Your theories are interesting, though :)

As for your calculation, you're indeed correct that the system ran fine with 7 billion humans, at least for a while. The loss of fidelity is a result of the simulation running out of resources, not anything happening internally. (My main inspiration for this story was Tsuki Project, a thoroughly weird anime-themed suicide cult based on a similar idea; the servers are getting shut down, and the rest of the simulation is run through at an accelerated pace and decreased resolution.)

Why did she aim for the gut? Good question. This is certainly one of these times where I could have thought things through more thoroughly. These short stories are usually planned for less than two weeks and written within a few hours, and it shows. (I should probably resolve to do more proofreading and editing for longer works, though. Would you be interested in proofreading with a focus on logical and consistent behaviour? I always enjoy your comments.)
