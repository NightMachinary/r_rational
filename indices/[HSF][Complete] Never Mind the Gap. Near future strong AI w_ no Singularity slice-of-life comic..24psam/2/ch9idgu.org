view is one of my favorite sci-fi webcomicists, right behind Howard Tayler of [[http://www.schlockmercenary.com/][Schlock Mercenary]] and Christopher Baldwin of [[http://spacetrawler.com/][Spacetrawler]] (complete) and [[http://baldwinpage.com/][One Way]] (ongoing).

All of view's stories are amazing, and worldbuild in beautiful directions. (Space Pulp has at least a dozen different humanoid sapients all with a common ancestor lost to time, it's awesome to see a setting where humanity has diverged in a bunch of different directions.)

That being said, view doesn't shy away from the sex, so while you shouldn't consider the works porn or erotica, there are still plenty of pages which are strictly speaking NSFW.
