Self-described as a "Sci-fi small-town romance". Not explicitly rational, but there is no Idiot Ball and problems are solved through the characters using their intelligence. There are humanoid, sentient robots but no Singularity and no other strong AI (though there is plenty of commodity AI a few years more advanced than today's), explained as nobody ever having figured out how to create sentient AI that wasn't based on the human mind. The robots are realistically depicted, needing regular maintenance and not possessing physics-defying strength, agility, etc. It starts out a little slow but you'll fall in love with the characters quickly, and then the story picks up a bit.
