I will once again recomend the manga Ajin. There's an anime, but I haven't finished, and I know the two deviate from each other, so I will only recomend manga, but if any one can vouch for the anime, feel free.

I feel like Ajin is among one of the most rational manga out there. It's not perfect and it has that Rationality = Spock thing going on but it's downplayed and you might not even notice if one character didn't explicitly stated it.

The whole concept is: A very small number of people called Ajins (Demi-humans) can't die of anything but old age. If they die, they reset, all injuries vanish, limbs re-attach and if they are too far away, grow back. Dying is also the only way to find out one is an Ajin. As there are very few of them, governments around the world want to seize them for experiments and also to use them as test subjects to drugs, automobiles, etc. The Stories follow Kei Nagai, a student, who is found to be an Ajin after an accident. He's shown to be a /very/ rational character, as is the villain. Characters make mistakes, but the story is pretty much devoid of stupid decisions I really think people should give it a go.
