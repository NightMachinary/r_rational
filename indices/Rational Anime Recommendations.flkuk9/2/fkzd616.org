It seems the battle of wits genre is the closest thing to rational anime. If you've seen all of the usual recommendations (Death Note, Code Geass, Kaiji) can I recommend Liar Game? It's a manga, and never got an anime adaptation, but if shows like Death Note and Kaiji interest you for the battles of wits, this will be right up your alley.

That said, I couldn't answer an anime recommendation post without mentioning Legend of the Galactic Heroes. The original, not the remake.

It's a pretty old series from 1988 about an ongoing galactic war between the autocratic Galactic Empire and the democratic Free Planets Alliance. The two "main" protagonists (There are dozens of named characters, and most of them are developed heavily) are Reinhard von Lohengramm, an Admiral whose sister is concubine to the Kaiser, and Yang Wen-li, a Commodore in the Alliance's fleet. The story follows the two men on opposite sides of the war as they rise through the ranks in pursuit of their goals.

As far as being rational, it's pretty solid. Everything that happens has a cause and effect relationship with the rest of the plot. Most characters have agency and use it to try to achieve their goals. Some characters early on hold the Idiot Ball, but it's acknowledged and justified, and the incompetent are weeded out of the story by the end of the first quarter (it's 110 25-minute episodes).

Its only big flaw is its length. 110 episodes might seem like a lot, but it's so tightly plotted that by the end of it you're left feeling it was too short.
