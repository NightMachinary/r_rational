It dismays me that no good examples come to mind for me. Reading through the comments, only two series immediately come to mind as worthy of (further) mention, though in both cases they're 'bonus points for...' around a few scenes rather than having opposing sides be satisfying.

Fate/Zero: Though sorely little of note, the clash between Kiritsugu and Lord El-Melloi in episode 6 has a fond place in my heart. Perhaps further of note in regards to Kiritsugu's approach to the world (episodes 18 and 19 Kiritsugu's coming-of-age, episode 24 Kiritsugu and the Holy Grail's intended implementation of his wish following his thought process).

Madoka Magica [edit: I missed at first this had been already been mentioned in one of the comment threads, thus spoilering and moving to second]:

Kyubey's world outlook is delightful for me to witness, particularly when the eggs of people's assumptions/expectations-treated-as-obligatory/irrationality/incompetence smash against it. Not necessarily a fully realistic thought process, but fun to imagine as 'all the human characters are holding the standard Idiot Ball, and here's the one character who isn't'.
