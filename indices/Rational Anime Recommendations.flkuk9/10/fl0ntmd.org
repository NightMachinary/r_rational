I recently read a manga called 'Battle 5 seconds after meeting' which was alright:

[[https://helveticascans.com/r/series/battle-after-meeting/]]

The setup is relatively generic shonen: A bunch of people are kidnapped, they're forced to fight in a tournament (at first), each is given 1 special power, for example 'turn your arm into a cannon equivalent to an anti-materiel rifle'. There's various different ones with greater or lesser combat utility. (Listing specific powers with all limitations and capabilities would be a spoiler, but they run the gamut from teleportation to super-strength, some mental ones, some meta-powers, etc.) Characters tend to use their powers quite rationally, I find.

The protagonist gets, verbatim, 'your power is whatever the other person person thinks your power is'. The story is about him trying to figure out exactly what that means/how it works, and then mindgame everyone around him. Pretty fun.
