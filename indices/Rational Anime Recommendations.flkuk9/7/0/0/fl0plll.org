I am curious to hear more about your impression of the good parts of this! I poked my head into it a little but was unable to maintain interest, with my remaining impressions being "I have to save one of two people, one who has been entrusted a position of power by large number of people, one who presently has very little influence on the rest of the world.

That'll teach 'em position can make you worth the best bodyguard but only ever the second-best doctor...at least when the best doctor is me." and "Scary isn't it how someone's been killing police officers like us with poisoned candy lately? Hey, that woman just gave us free candy, let's eat it!".
