I'd say it's the decrease in the writing quality first and foremost. There are much fewer mind games after the third arc (out of six or so that currently exist), and the whole story becomes significantly less tightly plotted. I can't remember any points where the story jumped the shark or even employed a really bad deus ex machina, but overall, it slowly became less and less enjoyable with each chapter.
