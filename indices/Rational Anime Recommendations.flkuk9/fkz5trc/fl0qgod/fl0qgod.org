Un-recommending /Promised Neverland/. Anime's first (and currently only) season is great for sure, and it definitely fits the bill, but I've read the manga, and let's just say it slowly went in a very, /very/ wrong direction. The content for the next season is also going to be fun, but after that, it's going to be one major disappointment after another if anime remains as faithful to manga as it currently is.
