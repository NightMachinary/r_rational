Expanding on the list I posted on the linked comment thread:

Transhuman and sci fi detective stories:

- Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex: Old classic sci fi anime everyone loves. Cyborgs. A handful of really nice episodic mysteries centering around some transhuman concept or another. Eventually settles into a longer mystery that I didn't find as engaging. The rest of the franchise is good too, though I think GITS:SAC is the best.

- Psycho-Pass: Very similar to GITS, usually considered an "almost as good" substitute. About utility functions I guess? I think Psycho-Pass's one-off mystery episodes are weaker, but its multi-episode plotlines are stronger than in GITS. Also everyone says the second season is terrible but it's like 80% as good as the first.

People having quiet adventures:

- Spice & Wolf: Economics and romance in a fantasy world. All the drama is in few-episode-long economics/markets plots, while the romance story takes the entire season to slowly go places. The fact that it's a fantasy world doesn't matter. The microeconomics occasionally went faster than I could keep track of, but I got the impression it was all correct.

- Kino's Journey: Kino goes from town to town and sees how people live their lives. The towns are all philosophical or science fiction thought experiments, with completely different tech levels and ways of life in each. Don't think too hard about how they're all sitting in the same world; they're all well-realized and thought provoking separately. Kino doesn't give an opinion on the places, so you're stuck with your own thoughts on these things.

- Mushishi: Similar to Kino's Journey, a traveling medicine man helps people with problems with spirits. Spirits are like... magical intangible versions of tiny animals? More hydras and corals than dogs and cats, I mean. They get places they shouldn't be and our protagonist helps people out with them. Not really rational, but it does have a protagonist that solves weird problems with knowledge. I liked the dub.

Something else:

- Shinsekai Yori: Life in a remote village of psychics. Really cohesive, careful worldbuilding, even when (especially when) it seems like people are acting weird or the authors forgot something. Hard to say much about it without spoiling it though, it completely thrashes the status quo every few episodes. Also really dark, watch out for that.

- The Devil Is A Part Timer: The dark lord of a fantasy universe gets sucked into a magical portal, stuck in Tokyo, and gets a part time job at a McDonalds. The premise gets stranger, but everyone handles it like sensible adults. Makes people handling things well funny.

- Madoka: Deconstruction and reconstruction of magical girl anime. It's good if you like those or deconstruction/reconstructions.

Not rational, still recommending:

- The Eccentric Family: A thoughtful, nuanced look at what it's like to be a magical talking raccoon in modern day Japan.

- Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru?: Not rational, but it might make you want to work out, which means watching it is rational.
