it wasn't anything major, but for me, the katanas were just the straw which broke the camel's back. Katanas are incredibly intensive to create (as are many swords), and take a significant amount of practice to learn to use. Spears are cheaper to make, easier to use effectively, and it's easier for multiple spear wielders to fight together. And they already have spears! Katanas were hands down a massive waste of time for them.

The fight in which they were used showed an even bigger problem - they weren't willing to use their weapons to kill their enemies. The natural consequence of this is should be that they get steamrolled, regardless of their technology level. Past this point, I know the only reason they're alive is because of plot armour, and I lost my investment in the conflict.
