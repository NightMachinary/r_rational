Yup, should probably have mentioned that the show is extremely celebratory of otaku culture (and the idea of escapist fantasy in general), including some of the aspects that are very off-putting (if not outright disgusting) to some. And yeah, it's not the most rigorous story out there, but I still feel like rational fiction readers would find it fun in general rather than annoying, like, they're asspulls but at least they're inventive/funny.
