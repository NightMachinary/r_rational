No game no life - A pair of superhuman shut-in gamers get transported to a fantasy world where violence is supernaturallly banned and all conflict is resolved through games. The show revolves around them overcoming impossible games through wits and social manipulation on their path to world domination

Log Horizon - The entire playerbase of a popular MMO gets transported to a fantasy world based on that game. The show focuses on a group of influential players attempting to form a proper society.

Dr. Stone - The entire population of the earth gets petrified by an unknown force. 3000 years later, a teenager who's really into science awakens from his petrified state and attempts to rebuild modern society. The show focuses on him climbing the tech tree while fighting against various different antagonists (I won't spoil who). Technology is portrayed fairly accurately (lots of chemistry and mechanical engineering).
