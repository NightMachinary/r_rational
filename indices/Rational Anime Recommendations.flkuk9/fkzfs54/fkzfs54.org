If you're open to manga, I recommend [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/51493/Murasakiiro_no_Qualia][Qualia the Purple]]. MC's power gets munchinked all the way through and maybe even some more.

I don't see this recommendation in this subreddit often, but HunterxHunter's current arc is great. It's a political thriller with various plans and strategies going around from various sides and they are all competent. For example, a person that was first seen as grappling with a lion is actually a brilliant commander and has a strategic mind. It also helps that this arc focuses on the MC that constantly thinks.
