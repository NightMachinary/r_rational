I don't think there's much point in distinguishing amoral and evil. Most "evil" characters do bad stuff because it benefits them, not because they actively like causing harm. Either wa, the main character did stuff that I am not comfortable with the main character doing, and I'd rather have not had to find that out the hard way.
