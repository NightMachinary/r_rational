Hmm... I would say it has good character development (especially in the later parts) but all in all it is not that important to Jojo.

Its main selling point was always its puzzle-like approach to battles. Doing things others could not see, out-of-the-box thinking and trickery are fundamental. Though it can get too silly and outlandish at times, hence my slow-recommendation.
