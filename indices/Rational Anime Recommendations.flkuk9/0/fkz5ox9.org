There's Death Note with its cat-and-mouse games, but I think that's more a study in what it looks like to pretend you're rational and succumb to hubris and egomania.

Anime that focuses around a game (as opposed to a sport) tends to be more cerebral and hinge on clever exploitation of rules and the opponent's psychology. In that category there's Akagi (game: Mahjong) and Kaiji (general gambling, using unorthodox games and rulesets). I understand that No Game No Life also fits this category of unorthodox games won by cleverness, but I haven't watched it.
