Don't get me wrong, I love me some Jojo, but it's definitely not thought through on the same level as Worm. Granted, they do have a lot in common, like unique powers and rules of combat, but Worm does these far better than Jojo.

The main thing is consistency. In Worm, characters almost always maintain the same abilities throughout, and if they get a new ability or figure out a new exploit (like coating bugs in chemicals), they continue using it and building on it. In Jojo, characters regularly show a cool new move and then forget about it forever, even in situations where it could save their life.
