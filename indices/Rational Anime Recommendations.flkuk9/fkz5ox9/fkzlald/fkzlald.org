No Game No Life is in a similar category to Kaiji, but far more shameless wish-fulfillment and blatant fanservice- of the sort that can get pretty uncomfortable if you don't have a tolerance for it.

Seconding all this thread's recommendations for Kaiji though, manga and anime. Every game gets explored from tons of angles, psychological and otherwise, and it does an excellent job of making the stakes feel real.

I'd also say Jojo's Bizarre Adventure actually has a lot more in common with this subreddit's tastes than you might think at first. It's basically the case study for battle anime that treats battles like puzzles to be solved, centered around deciphering your enemy's weird abilities, and figuring out how to leverage your own. At the very least I'd call it about as rational as Worm.
