Yes, in the manga. Manga maintains the quality of the first two parts, so I recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the anime. 4th and the current part is different as in there is no real gambling, but the psychological battle is still there. 3rd part is mahjong and 5th part is a poker variant. 5th part actually seems to be regarded as the best part from those who caught up with the manga, but I really enjoy the different approaches of 4th and 6th part.

  I was also going to mention Jojo but decided not to for the same reason. There's always a puzzle of the week but you couldn't really figure it out yourself - the protagonist pulls a solution out of their hat.

Yes. I absolutely love Jojo but I don't have the heart to recommend it to this subreddit with a straight face haha.
