I'm really enjoying Kaiji's current arc. Unlike the usual gambling, it has more laid back feel to it even though the stakes are still high.

No Game No Life is similar to Jojo in their cleverness. They /are/ clever and hype, but really farfetched or not something that would work in real life. Not rational material, but enjoyable nonetheless.
