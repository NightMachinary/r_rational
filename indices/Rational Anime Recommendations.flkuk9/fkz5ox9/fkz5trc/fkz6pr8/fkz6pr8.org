I'd have to disagree with Erased. The MC is an adult who goes back to his childhood. Yet does not display any rational or logical thinking you would expect of someone that age. The whole villain thing was exceedingly transparent and should have been seen through as well as other decisions made by MC. Ugh that show frustrated me on how stupid the MC acted.

People like it, yet not a fan.
