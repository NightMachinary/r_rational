I asked this question in an open thread and got some good suggestions: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/faw0dx/comment/fj177oe?context=1]]

Erased, Promised Neverland, and Death Note are the strongest examples I've seen.

My feelings on Log Horizon have changed since that thread. The show got a lot better in literally the next episode after I wrote that comment. It's still not the best example of a rational anime, but it has rational elements to it and it's been engaging overall.
