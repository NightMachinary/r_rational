God I loved that series especially the first novel. It was just so beautifully written and the fan translation on bakatsuki was so incredibly well done. Unfortunately it's been taken down and I don't know how competent the official translation is. First novel is legitimately one of my favourte novels out of the hundreds of books I've read.
