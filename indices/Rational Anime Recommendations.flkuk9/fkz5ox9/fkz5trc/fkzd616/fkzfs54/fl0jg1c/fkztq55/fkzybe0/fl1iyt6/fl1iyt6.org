I think I can dig up my copy from when Bakatsuki had it available online for downloads. Do you want them?

EDIT: Actually the wayback archive has the text of all 7 volumes [[https://web.archive.org/web/20160205125531/https://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/?title=Utsuro_no_Hako_to_Zero_no_Maria][archived]]. You just can't download the pdfs from the wayback archive.
