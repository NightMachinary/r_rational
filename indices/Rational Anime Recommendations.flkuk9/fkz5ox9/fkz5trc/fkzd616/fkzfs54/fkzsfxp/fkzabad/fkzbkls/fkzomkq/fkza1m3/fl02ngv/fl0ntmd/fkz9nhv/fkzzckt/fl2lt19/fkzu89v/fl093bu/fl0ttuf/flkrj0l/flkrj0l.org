Hero and Demon King is a good example. Basically the Hero goes alone to confront the ruler of the demons, rather than fighting she asks him to help put an end to the war with minimal loss of life. The romance subplot is shoehorned in but that's not a biggie. I particularly like how the hero sometimes feels useless despite his immense power because destruction isn't useful in this situation, the Demon King introduction of potatoes is portrayed as, and is, more significant than the time the Hero blew up a mountain.
