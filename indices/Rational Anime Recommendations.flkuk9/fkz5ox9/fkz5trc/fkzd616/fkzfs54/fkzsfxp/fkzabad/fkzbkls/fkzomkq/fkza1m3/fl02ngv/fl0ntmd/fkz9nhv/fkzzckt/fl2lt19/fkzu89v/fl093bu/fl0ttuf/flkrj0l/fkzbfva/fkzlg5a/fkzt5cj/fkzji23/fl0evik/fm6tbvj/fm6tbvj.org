The katanas? Isn't that just a one note thing, to give people weapons? Sure the whole thing about the best sword ever made is annoying but the bigger question would be if making a fancy sword is even a good use of time when your fighting stone weapons.

Im on episode 22 of the anime and I'm trying to figure out why they don't make, like repeating crossbows. Like, why do you need guns? The thing they're working on right now instead of the guns. Give me a break.
