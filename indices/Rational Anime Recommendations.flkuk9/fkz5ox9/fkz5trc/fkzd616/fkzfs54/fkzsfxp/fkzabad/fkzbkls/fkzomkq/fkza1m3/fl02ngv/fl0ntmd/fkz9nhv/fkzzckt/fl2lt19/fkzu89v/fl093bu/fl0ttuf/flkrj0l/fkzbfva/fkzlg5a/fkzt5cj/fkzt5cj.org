No Game No Life has a great premise for a rationalist story (though possibly a bit anvilicious) but it messes it up by having the main characters be terribly irrational. Winning that consistently shouldn't be possible, especially since many of those games depend on an element of chance.

While I do recommend Dr. Stone, I feel like it falls someone short of rational when it's revealed just how long the people in the nearby village have been around. They should have had plenty of time to repopulate the earth and rebuild civilization. Especially given that there's the ruins of the old civilization and they're descended from astronauts, who would have done what they could to get them started. What's especially bad is that one of the astronauts is Senku's dad, and he put a lot of effort into sending messages to Senku on the assumption that he'd somehow turn back from being stone. He was right, but there's no way he could have guessed that.
