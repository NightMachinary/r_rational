The Irregular at Magic High School. /A school that discriminates based on innate magical power between the elite Blooms and the reserve Weeds, with the main character, Tatsuya (a driven and prudent man) being an apparent Weed./ Spends some time laying out the magic system and explains how battles are won in a way I think will be somewhat appreciated here. The first arc (Enrollment, 5~ episodes?) was honestly great anime.

Parasyte. /Brain-invading aliens who impersonate and eat (other) humans. One alien, Migi, fails and merges with Shinichi's right hand only. Migi turns out to be a cold-blooded survivor who decides that the best course for him is to work together with his still-sentient human host./ Can't remember if the fighting was particularly rational but Migi thinks and speaks clearly. One of the classics.

Utawarerumono has a fairly interesting skeptic and strategist-type main character.
