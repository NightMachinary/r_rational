Personally I can't recommend Die Neue These, unless you're already a fan of the series. It's not a bad series on its own, but the original has a timeless quality that no modern adaptation is going to be able to match.

Let me first say that I actually watched Die Neue These first, and switched to the original after the first season.

The remake does stay true to the /themes/ of the original, however due to its length, so much is stripped from the series to fit the runtime of modern anime that it's more of a cliff's notes summary of the plot. As I've said, the grand sweeping story of an entire galactic war, from almost every conceivable perspective, barely fits into 110 episodes as it is. The remake focuses more on the major plays by the main characters, and while that doesn't make for a bad series, it can't compare to the sheer scope and depth of the original's portrayal of such a vast conflict.

I also feel that much of the timeless feel of the original is lost in the remake. There's a reason that people can still get into a 32-year old series even today, because of the meticulously hand-drawn art and the soundtrack which is almost exclusively classical music. It makes the setting seem almost historical, despite being set over a thousand years in the future. It may seem daunting, but within a few episodes, once you're immersed in it, it's truly unmatched anywhere. The remake has a much more standard sci-fi look and feel to it that makes it much safer to release today, but with its generic feel and overuse (in my opinion, of course) of CGI, in 5 years or so people will be once again pointed back to the original when they ask how to get into the series.

By all means watch whichever version you want, but even as someone who watched Die Neue These first, I really can't recommend it compared to the original.
