No-one's mentioned "Moribito: guardian of the spirit" yet. It's a surprisingly well-told fantasy in which people often act rationally to further their goals, and has some nice depictions of people doing actual research.

Also, 12 Kingdoms - while characters often act irrationally, the intricacy of the worldbuilding is very pleasing. On that note, Centaur's Life is another surprising one for worldbuilding - the overall impression is that although the author is paid to draw soft porn, what they /really/ want to be writing about is the evolutionary biology of fantasy monsters. (This comes through even more strongly in the manga)
