Adding on to this Liar Game and Alice in Borderland. I think most know Liar Game so I'll elaborate on the other. Alice in Borderland is a death game isekai. I think [[/r/rational][r/rational]] would really enjoy some of the games (mostly the diamond ones). However, it starts out significantly edgy and if that's holding you back I would say stick until MC's friends die.
