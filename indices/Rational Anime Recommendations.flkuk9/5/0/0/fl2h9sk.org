Ehhh... I don't think that's really true. In the light novel and manga it's clear that the protagonist thinks of the people in that world the same way your average gamer thinks of NPCs, which makes sense because he's been playing in the VR version of that world for a very long time when all the inhabitants truly were mindless NPCs. It's not too surprising that he retained some peculiar mental habits as a result.

When a gamer kills a battlefield full of NPCs, the act doesn't even register for him/her as morally abhorrent because the NPCs are nowhere close to being actually alive in the first place. In fact, a gamer would probably feel less conflicted killing a horde of NPCs than they would killing an insect in the real world. So extrapolating that to the behavior of the protagonist, I think it would be more accurate to say that he is amoral rather than evil.
