AFAIK Ainz never really gets clever or rational though. While I cannot say much about more recent volumes, for at least half of the series he is the same immature bully that he was at the start. Basically all of his successes are achieved due to overwhelming power and ass-pulled abilities rather than him actually thinking rationally.

As for other characters, they can be generally divided into three categories:

a) worshippers of Ainz that always interpret his actions in the most favourable way,

b) caricatures of villains that stand in his way and invariably look down on him

c) and relatively normal bystanders, who in most cases either die early or just passively observe.

Only the last ones exhibit any sort of somewhat realistic responses, but they have little to no impact on the plot.
