Baby Steps where the protagonist uses logic and thinking to become a bettee Tennis Player. Has some common shounen/sport tropes (e.g. waxh opponent has a special move), but it's mostly super realistic. The MC loses a lot because he's not skilled enough and need to train harder, instead of being super talented.
