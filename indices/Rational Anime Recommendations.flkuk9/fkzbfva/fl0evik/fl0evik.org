The science in dr stone is /mostly/ accurate, it's about the level where they've heard about these things in high school/university, but don't really understand how they work.

For example, in the first few episodes he mixes nitric acid with ethanol to produce nital because it's an industrial solvent. But in industry, they add ethanol because nitric acid is /too strong/ for their purposes, and they need to dilute it. There's no reason why senku would want to /dilute/ his acid.

And don't get me started on the katanas. Literally everything outside of the science is highly irrational.
