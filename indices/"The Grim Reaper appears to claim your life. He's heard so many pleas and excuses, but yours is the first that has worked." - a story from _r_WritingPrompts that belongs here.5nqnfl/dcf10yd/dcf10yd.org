I'm more interested in the fact that Death seems to be willing to ferry you to whatever afterlife you want. Not only that, but it seems to be a specific feature of his office, as he seems to be completely dependent on the newly dead person for direction as to where to go.

There has got to be a way to exploit that to gain effective godhood.
