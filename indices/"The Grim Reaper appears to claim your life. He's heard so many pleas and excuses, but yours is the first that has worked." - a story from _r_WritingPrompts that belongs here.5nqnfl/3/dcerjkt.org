Eh. I honestly wasn't very impressed. The avatar of death seemed pretty unaware of a few key elements of his /primary function/ which, to me, doesn't seem very likely. Especially considering he's ferried about 100 billion people (definitely googled that figure) to the afterlife. Dave's reasoning here doesn't seem so far out there that he would be the first of 100 billion people (ok, let's assume not EVERYONE pleads to live but even if 5% do, that's 5 billion...) to take that sort of angle. Or another angle that would work, considering how simply fallible Death is portrayed here.

In addition, in like 100 billion ferryings (not a word, sue me), you still think that Death would be incapable of detecting death? That seems very unlikely, to say the least.

Overall an amusing read. But I'm not wow'd.
