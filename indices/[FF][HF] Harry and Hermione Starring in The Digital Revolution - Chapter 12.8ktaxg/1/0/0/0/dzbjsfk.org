But it doesn't need to be magical! I imagine some system where data can be written by a muggle computer, like printing out dots on paper. And then a magical interface reads the paper in order to program the device. Hopefully a higher density storage medium will be possible.

So... a magical computer isn't particularly useful. Automating computations is a solved problem. That's not the goal here. What they're after is /Self-Spelling Wands/. Maybe also enchantments that can change their configuration and function in real time. The end-game here is [[http://princeofamber.wikia.com/wiki/Ghostwheel][Ghostwheel]].

Also, Verilog? I guess VHDL sucks pretty bad, too. Can't we get a /modern/ hardware description language already? Do we really have to rely on third-party pre-compilers if we want to use a high level HDL?
