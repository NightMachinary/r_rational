Yessssss! Magic computers! Although it looks like magic is just standing in for electricity here. I hope magic computers can have unique advantages to electrical computers beyond just able to operate in Hogwarts. I doubt magic switches can get as small as modern transistors, but not needing to be physically wired together could mean more layers of magic transistors are possible. If magic traveled faster then light, or was more instantaneous than flowing electrons then you could break the gigahertz clock-speed limit. If magic signals could hold a superposition, then Hermione and Harry could easily surpass our current quantum computers. That would be quite magical!
