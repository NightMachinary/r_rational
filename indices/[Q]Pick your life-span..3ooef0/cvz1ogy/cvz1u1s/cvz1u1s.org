You can't die. Not until the time you decided arrives.

You can't be permanently frozen/unconscious either. Statis and being trapped are both crapshoots, with it being unreliable the longer you are under (and then the option being blocked when you come out so you can't come out/be released for three seconds, reset the timer and go back under).
