The interesting point here is that I'm going to live and remain healthy. That implies that the universe cannot end or become completely unfriendly to humans until I die...and I can't die.

This means that if I choose G(G(G(G65))) or some other ridiculous number, I can help the human race survive past the currently projected end of the universe.

It also means I don't need a spacesuit for ET EVA work. That's pretty awesome.
