. . . Um I'm not sure how you are defining the terms immortality and infinite time, and it bothers me.

Could you please explain how these are not synonymous. Note my underlying assumption is that survival guaranteed for infinite time is the definition of immortality if continuity of "self"* is maintained. Is your difference based on this if, or on something else, and if so what?

Note: Self like should is a +five letter word+ short word starting with s, which +makes it+ can be at least one worse (*quantity needed, perhaps order of magnitude) than four letter words for how dangerous they can be, both socially and to convey meaning.

Edit: I can count, sometimes, really I can >.< I'm still really interested in what distinction [[/u/Articanine]] is making
