Can you though? I mean, doesn't this imagine that you'd have sufficient lead time to do so? You are after all, as far as I know, another random human, not The Doctor. No powers, no hyper-intelligence, no nothing. Hell, even with lead time you're still just "going the long way round". No future tech knowledge (assuming that humanity doesn't regress massively in the interim) and we do a good job of updating new scientists on relevant old material already.

I mean, think of trying to solve the...the Cuban Missile Crisis. Right now.

I think that's my general problem, and applies to all other plans (like breeding new life). Ability to act here is more limited than it seems /and/ the psychological issue also seems like something that can't be ignored when trying to set yourself up to exist longer than our planet and species.
