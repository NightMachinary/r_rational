Immortality allows you to accumulate money over time. Not to mention that you need to care a lot less about healthcare and healthy living as you are pretty much exempt from any chronic issues (or at least I hope so because if you aren't then everything will be horrible after just a few lifetimes). And through said money you should have a good amount of power. At some point maybe even enough to enact actual changes.

And outliving our species is already a pessimistic stance in and of itself for any time span not approaching whatever age that the universe itself will go through fundamental physical changes. If humanity manages to survive the death of our solar system I don't know what other mundane threats could make us go extinct.
