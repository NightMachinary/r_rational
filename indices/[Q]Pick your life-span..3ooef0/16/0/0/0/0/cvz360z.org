If I was immortal I would definitely be very interested in ensuring humanity's continued existence out to the end of my period of immortality. But you know...I'm already interested in ensuring humanity's continued existence, and being immortal would help me do that. I could try and study myself to uplift more people, I could use my long lifespan to ensure certain knowledge is retained through disasters and help rebuild society in the wake of calamity. I could slowly acquire the funding over the course of hundreds of years to start building space colonies and research immortality.

Sure everything could go bad in the end, but I'd be around to try and stop things from going bad. I want humanity to live to see the last stars in the universe go out. (what comes after that is a bit more of an open question). You'd be offering me the chance to never have to step aside and hope for the best. I would be fit and healthy the whole way through.

But even if humanity was wiped out, and there's still immortal me, still running around on the slowly recovering earth in the wake of mankind's extinction. At that point I could, I don't know, start selectively breeding animals to create another intelligent species? Playing god in a weirdly direct way? As long as I had /stimulus/ I don't think I would go completely nuts, even in the absence of other humans.

That's obviously not ideal though. The goal isn't to be a god among sentient parrots, the goal is to /win/, and winning means humanity survives to inherit the night sky. If I fail, and humanity goes extinct? Well maybe I deserve to go insane for failing.
