  There's no reason a virtual electron pattern couldn't use an underlying base which extended outside the skull, or was replicated offsite in real-time, unless it was actively suppressed.

There's no reason a physical body can escape being trapped by fiat either.

There isn't certainty here, just like with the escaping from being trapped issue. Your body will just reject and "reset" if you cross a certain threshold, that threshold being biased towards preventing mental enhancements to the point of uploading. Get a prosthetic leg? Sure. Replace everything except your skull with a Terminator exoskeleton? Reset, to right after the decision and lose it all.
