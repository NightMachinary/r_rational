I don't know of any such game, and I agree noncomputable functions are "cheating" in a sense but it's much less cheating than just saying "infinity" because that's not an increasing sequence of natural numbers and the busy beaver numbers are. Even if you do allow noncomputable sequences there are interesting things you can do.

That was all completely pedantic and pointless but I typed it out so I'm clicking save anyway.
