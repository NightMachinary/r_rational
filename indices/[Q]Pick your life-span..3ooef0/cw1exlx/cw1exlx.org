The life of the universe up arrowed to Gramh's number up arrowed to the quanity being up-arrowed, upparrowed to it's self a Gramh's number of times hopefully by then I'll have figured out how they did it as well as how to create my own reality substrates.

I'm hoping to arrive at Lazuru's Long's "I didn't show up for the apocalypse", if nothing better comes along first.
