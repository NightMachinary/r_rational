A 'physical' mind is simply a pattern of electrons in wetware. Replace each neuron with something else capable of doing the job and the mind is still a pattern of electrons (real or virtual) on a physical base. There's no reason a virtual electron pattern couldn't use an underlying base which extended outside the skull, or was replicated offsite in real-time, unless it was actively suppressed.

What's the minimum requirement for a 'physical body'? Head cut off and stuck on a robot body? Squishy brain cut out and placed in a robot head? Wetware neurons replaced by hardware?
