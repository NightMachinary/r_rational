A trillion years. Eat me, heat death!

... huh, Wikipedia claims that you can still get negentropy from black holes for a googol years.

Anyway, my point is that I don't anticipate getting bored of eternity. Why would you? The overwhelming majority of people have anticipated living forever in the afterlife; the "angsty immortal" trope seems pretty damn flimsy, and largely invented to keep characters relateable in modern fantasy.
