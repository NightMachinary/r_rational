Yeah, I like being sane, but not more than I like being alive. I figure I pick some immense number - G65 years or something. I'm guaranteed to experience an unmatched magnitude of suffering, but I also get to see the ultimate fate of the universe, personally. Hell, I might even be able to sculpt what comes next, if this immortality binds my substance to existence, the only node of curved spacetime in an immense flatness. Perhaps I become a lonely god, drifting through every configuration of atoms possible, including the ones that include meaningful other entities. Perhaps there's nothing, and more nothing, and more nothing, and whatever degree of change my broken mind is allowed has it reform into coherence and insanity a number of times beyond all human comprehension.
