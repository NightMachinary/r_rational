I'd say a million years at the most, probably lower. I don't think you guys really comprehend how long a million years is. Recorded human history is only a couple thousand years long and look at all the stuff that's happened. A million should be more than enough for me. I'd imagine after a couple thousand years things would lose their meaning pretty rapidly. What does sex matter after the hundred thousandth time? How many kids do you need to have before they bore you? How many books can you read before it all becomes iterations of previous books?

Humans haven't evolved to live that long, we are not designed for it. We get happiness from doing things and what happens when you've done everything? Artificial drugs to dope you into happiness?

Ten thousand years later you'd likely be bored out of your skull and want to die. That or you'd start taking big risks. You'd train to become the best gunman in the world and go around killing people, or get involved with wars, or become a politician and make wars. You'd be richer than anyone else (because of investments and interest) and more skilled than anyone else.

Then what happens? You can't die so killing people becomes boring. Worst that can happen is you'd be restrained, then you'd probably experience horrible pain for a hundred years or however long it takes for them to give up or die, or forever if you can't escape. So you probably don't want to go around killing people.

After a million years you'd likely go insane or become so twisted that you seem insane. Boredom or insanity, take your pick. After thinking it out I'd say twenty thousand years. Enough time to experience and do everything I could ever want, but not enough to go insane, hopefully.
