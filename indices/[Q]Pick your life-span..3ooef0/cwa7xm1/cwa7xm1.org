Forever, duh. Heat death just broke, because according to these rules my own body is now a neverending source of free energy. I have a moral responsibility to pick "forever" for the far-future's sake regardless of my personal gratifications - there may come a time when humanity itself runs on my bodily functions.

Anyway, subjectivity is easily manipulated. On the day I feel all hope is lost and it ceases to be worth it, I just do suicide without death by wireheading myself out. I think a wireheader done correctly is at least not an abomination - at worst morally neutral.
