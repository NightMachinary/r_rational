That is of little use to me if they all die and I have to re-build an entire species from scratch. Perhaps a few thousand years such data could be made to last, but what if there is a real bugger of an extinction event and I am stuck having to wait for an ice age to end before breeding an intelligent species from shrews? Then I would very much regret not knowing genetic engineering.

Of course, I would also amass wealth, and pay scientists to figure out the best solutions to this problem, but the knowledge would be a good backup. It would hardly be a chore to learn, with as much time as I would have.
