I think if I wanted to ensure the survival of humanity, then within the first century I would learn genetic engineering. After, I would plot out a tech path from stone age all the way to the tools necessary to achieve human cloning, then learn the principals of all the steps along that path. Then I would make several repositories of human DNA in all its various forms, and a few repositories of all of our knowledge. Plunk one in the marianas trench (I don't need no stinking swim suit, I'm immortal!), and a few others in various places.

Then, if humanity dies I can bring it back. Worst case scenario I can use my own DNA to do the job, though there would be far less variation which would cause problems for many hundreds of years unless a workaround can be found.

It may be that it is impossible to create a proper genetic lab from scratch with no civilisation. In which case I would have to follow your plan of uplifting parrots or something until they had enough technology for me to achieve my goal. The worst thing would be the religions that would spring up. It would make me very uncomfortable to be worshipped.
