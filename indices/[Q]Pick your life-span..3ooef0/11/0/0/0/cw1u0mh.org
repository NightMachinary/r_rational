Inebriation or sarcasm I'm not sure. My point in the extra comment on dangerous S words was their lack of a fine grained definition.

I work with a few people who say things like "it should work" which is usually a clear sign that it hasn't been investigated at a sufficient level of detail. In general "Should" is a word that tells me to look three times at the assumptions, and when it comes to really long term living self is likely to be a concept requiring a similar level of caution.
