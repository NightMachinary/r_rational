The intuitive way we think about it, buried alive, in a cell, etc.

The further it gets from that intuitive sense the less likely you are to be rescued. Trapped on an island with free movement? Takes longer. Much longer.

"Trapped" on a world with no people (they've all died out)? Enjoy what you have, you're unlikely to leave.
