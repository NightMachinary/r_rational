Precisely. What's 'trapped'? If you're on an island which can provide all you need to survive, are you trapped? If you're confined to the surface of the Earth, does that count as trapped because you can't get to the rest of the universe?

What if a planet is terraformed to be Earthlike, and you're put on it and it's fired off to randomly wander the galaxy? Are you trapped?
