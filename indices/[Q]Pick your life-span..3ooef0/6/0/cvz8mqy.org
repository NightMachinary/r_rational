Sure, but the angsty immortal actually has the advantage of existing in a time with people too.

And Heaven is literally eternity by fiat.God tells you it'll last forever /and/ that you'll have fun. God can do stuff like that, being a concept invented to make those things possible. /You/ have to worry about danger, in many forms. You can't be trapped but being stranded in many ways is still a possibility, then you're in an actual hell.
