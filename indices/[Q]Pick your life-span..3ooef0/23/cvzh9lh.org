This is easy. Infinity, of course. As soon as medical tech makes it safe I wirehead with a timer. If anything unfortunate happens I can spend time in infinite bliss. And isn't the heat death of the universe going to reverse over infinite time due to random chance and EVERYTHING being possible?

When medical tech makes it there I'll install the tech to modify my mind to be happy and fulfilled in any situation I specify, doing anything I specify, to find beauty and wonder in anything I specify, with occasional checkups from my unmodified mind to see how I would really feel about the situation. I'd also have the tech to edit my memories as I see fit when checking in with my normal mind.

I suppose additional safeguards might be a good idea. Something to bust me out of any loops where I and my normal self decide to torture myself for infinite time. And to bust me out of any loops where my normal self and I decide to giver me really weird memories. So I'd need backup for all memories deleted, and occasional automatic reviews by various versions of myself to see if any need reinstatement.

What's infinite lifespan regret when you can edit yourself to be happy about /anything/ and find meaning and fulfillment in /anything/? This tech, plus infinite lifespan sounds like pretty much the definition of heaven to me.

When you think about it, humans are paper clip AIs designed by evolution to turn all matter in the Universe into happiness and fulfillment and other such human rewards rather than into paper clips.

Can I upload a copy of myself that can become superintelligent?
