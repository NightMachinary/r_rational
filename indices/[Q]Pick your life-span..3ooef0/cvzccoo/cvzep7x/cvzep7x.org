  So the only thing I have to worry about is boredom.

Or extinction or just being kept away from everyone (being in say...a low population density area is not being trapped). Or everyone figuring out who you are.

  How long does the convenient anthropomorphic alien give me to think this through?

The length of an average doctor's appointment. It's sitting there waiting for you to make a decision. Think about how long a doctor gives you to decide on a course of treatment that isn't life-changing.

Maybe...fifteen minutes to decide the rest of your life? Good luck!
