Honestly, bringing up my book backlog did more to convince me than all the talk of solving death for everyone else or living to see interstellar civilization or living till heat death.

I probably need like 500 years just to catch up on all the nonfiction books I have stockpiled /right now./

For like, four times the average audiobook length of a book as a /hyper-optimistic/ estimate it'll take me a fuckton of time to read all of the books that might conceivably interest me.

The hard part is just not getting famous until scifi-style face replacement takes off.
