Isolation doesn't concern me. Do I have access to sufficient entertainment? I'm fine, then. Outside of maybe 100 hours worth of TV shows / video games I've been reading and writing for the past year. I believe outside of the occasional forum or reddit post I may have interacted with people 3 times.

Let's call it a nice, round, 5,000 years humans have been writing. Call it a pessimistic estimate that we'll exist in a state to continue to produce creative works for something like another 5,000 years.

It took me about 6 months to catch up on the backlog of HP fanfiction I was actually interested in. It's 18 years old, but has one of the largest fanbases for producing works. Between it, Worm, and time I write, new works consume about 2 hours a day.

A quick glance of my backlog of original fiction I intend to read at some point shows me about 200 series / independent books on log. If I extrapolate and take in the lower producing fan bases, we might get up to 4 hours a day worth of newly produced works to keep me occupied.

Expanding population, increasing availability to both internet and time free of work to produce entertainment...

I wouldn't request anything less than 100,000. And I've got another 10 minutes to think about it.
