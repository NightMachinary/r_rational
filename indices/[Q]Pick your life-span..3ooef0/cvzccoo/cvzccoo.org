This...this is a pain in the ass.

On the one hand, I'd enjoy living "forever", though a better way to put that is probably indefinitely.

I'm also not bothered by the concept of death. I've no idea why the concept of permanent 0 is supposed to be scary.

So, so long as my existence is at a +1 value, I'm happy to continue living. If it's at 0 then I'm indifferent and if it seems like it's going to be below 0 for prolonged periods of time then 0 is the obviously better solution.

So yes, this situation is a pain in the ass. I don't want to pick a time frame that would kill me while I'm still existing at a positive value. But I don't want to pick a time frame that would leave me alive in a prolonged negative value.

Fortunately, you specify that I'll never be trapped, with entrapment being one of only two things that register a -2 on my scale (with -2 representing things that death is an immediate better alternative to.)

So the only thing I have to worry about is boredom.

How long does the convenient anthropomorphic alien give me to think this through?
