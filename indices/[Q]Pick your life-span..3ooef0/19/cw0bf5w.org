Hmm.. most likely, my life will get more valuable, not less, as time progresses, if most people realize my existence substantially increases the size of the pie, which it probably will (generations to learn, so the hard part is the relearning), and cooperate- even if the relationship is with me as an inferior is still better than it is now, so long as the standard of living gradually rises.

The biggest downside is i have to see freinds die, but i won't get to avoid that either way, it just means i see all of them die- which there's a non-zero chance would happen either way. I'd probably choose probably a huge number, but i don't know what it would be. a googol sounds dangerous, since your definition of trapped means tossed into the cosmos to drift at 15 MPH for all eternity is going to take quite a while to be freed from (since i can theoretically go just about anywhere), and more after. probably in the billions- i'll always want to not die, but significant brain memory expansions seem like a shortly-before immortality or shortly-after immortality tech, so it's not that likely that it'd make the difference, and at that point, every experience is being overwritten by another. either humanity is still around, and immortality and revival is really impractical, or humanity isn't and i might be bored to death anyways, or humanity is and tech is high enough that i can be rescued at this point in time- just enter a cyrogenic state- temporary, and short enough that i don't escape automatically by probability manipulation, and if i do, and die from the probability manipulation effects of the death, i still profited, and made the gamble i felt best. Yes, I'll die permanantly one day, after the effect ends, but i predict there will be a point where i'll want to die, even if i've never reached it yet. (that may be depression speaking, though.)
