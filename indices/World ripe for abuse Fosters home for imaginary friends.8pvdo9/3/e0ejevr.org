It depends on the limits of the imaginary friends you can create. For example, I can imagine a perfectly friendly omnipotent AI/god/genie who's willing to make the world a better place, and capable of instantly deleting any other imaginary friends people create that would interfere with this goal.

Creating any imaginary friend is such an open-ended power that it's hard to think of ways in which it /couldn't/ be abused. It might be a little tricky to get a kid to think of the above concept, but I'm sure there are plenty of pre-teens out there who can imagine it.
