You have to remember, it takes place it in the same world where kids use gadgets made out of garbage to fight adult tyranny, professors accidentally make little girls with superpowers, old people depend on their dog to save them from monsters, abused children can build elevators to the moon and eat the sun but can't get 25 cents, and the grim reaper is now the slave of two little kids.
