Limitations:

- the imaginary friend stays around (I'm not sure if Imaginary Friends vanish if no human is their friend)

- personality grows on there own (observation from [[/u/earzo7][u/earzo7]] ) and maybe influenced by the personality of the creator?

- only children can make new ones (and maybe only one?)

- they still need calories in form of food (and maybe have to pay the creation cost later or start with a weight of zero)

- just good old laws of nature like entropy

- it needs time to make a new friend (and enough interactions and belief from the child)

- there are limits to size, strength, intelligence and complexity

- maybe they are made of imaginary atoms that vanish after a time (so they need to replace them with real food). That just has the midi-chlorians feeling of ugh.

Who knows maybe some god grants each Imaginary Friend their existence. So the god prevents anything from abusing the system too much. And the god just doesn't want kids to be lonely or grow up into horrible adults. (and isn't smart about it)
