In line with "take time", a good source for process and dynamics might be the modern interpretation of Tulpas. So, only the physical body actually is created in defiance of physics, the mind of the friend is part of the same brain as the child, just a mostly isolated sub network that somehow got a remote projection. If it becomes more real and replaces it with actual atoms, that might cause the neurons to teleport over gradually with the child actually losing each one the friend gains, and no information being added.

Possibly, the existence of a mind without a body is what causes the projection as well, and in this universe this is a consistent law causing stuff like brain damage that causes locked in syndrome leads to the brain creating and teleporting over to a new body after a few days.
