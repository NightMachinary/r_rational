  Yeah, especially a piece of paragraph-long exposition. In first person, it can read as though the character is thinking about this thing, rather than focused on the conversation, which isn't really how conversations work.

I once had someone ask me in the middle of a conversation to explain what I was thinking about with regards to what they were saying. In the time it took to explain the first paragraph of thought that had come in between their previous two sentences, another dozen paragraphs of thought had taken place.
