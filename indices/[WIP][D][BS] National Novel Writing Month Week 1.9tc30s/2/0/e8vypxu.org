Either set up a Google account under pseudonym, or post to some site without the full functionality of Google Docs, e.g. [[https://archiveofourown.org/][Archive of Our Own]], [[https://www.fictionpress.com/][FictionPress]], or [[https://pastebin.com/][Pastebin]]/[[https://hastebin.com/][hastebin]], though those might require making a secondary account anyway (not Pastebin/hastebin). There aren't a whole lot of good alternatives though, no.
