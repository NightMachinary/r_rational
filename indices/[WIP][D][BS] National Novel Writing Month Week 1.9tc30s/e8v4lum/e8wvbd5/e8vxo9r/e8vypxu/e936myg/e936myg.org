I'll add [[https://www.wattpad.com/][Wattpad]] to the list. It's slightly less known/used but seems pretty popular for self-published books of sorts, and most stuff on it has a more professional appearance (with covers and such). Still, the average level of writing is only marginally better than what I've found on other such sites, most of it is rather mediocre IMHO.
