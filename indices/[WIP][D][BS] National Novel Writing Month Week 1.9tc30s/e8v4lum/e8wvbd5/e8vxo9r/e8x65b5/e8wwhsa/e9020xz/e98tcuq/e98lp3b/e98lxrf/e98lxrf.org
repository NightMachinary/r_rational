It originally started in the San Francisco Bay Area, and was named "national" in a sort of cheeky way, because almost all of the participants were within a thirty mile radius of each other. I think they had their first international participant starting in the second or third year, when the scope implied by the name was becoming less of a joke, and it's just never been changed, despite fairly wide-spread adoption in other countries. Call it a failure of imagination on the part of the organizers.
