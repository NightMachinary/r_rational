/Real/ flirting is so subtle that you're supposed to second guess whether it's even happening. That's why /fictional/ flirting requires the narrator to spell it out a little

(e.g. if I wanted to write a scene where someone was flirting but I want the reader to understand that it is manipulative with no true feeling behind it, and I want the protagonist to see through it, I might say: "He shook my hand a little longer than necessary, looking me in the eyes while he did so")
