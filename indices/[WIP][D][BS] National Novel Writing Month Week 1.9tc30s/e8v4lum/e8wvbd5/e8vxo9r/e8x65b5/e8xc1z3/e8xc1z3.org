With the caveat that I've been married for six years and haven't actually flirted with anyone for a long time, I think most of flirting is about:

- Showing personal interest and enthusiasm for conversation
- Physical cues and bodyspace
- Tone
- Attempts at connection

These things can be a bit difficult to capture in text, but for the most part, can be done outside of dialogue itself.

An example:

  "Where are you from?" he asked. He put a bit of a smile into it, like they were sharing a joke.

  "Nebraska," she replied. She looked away from him and touched the rim of her glass.

  "Corn country, right?" he asked.

  She looked over at him, finally meeting his eyes. "Right," she said. She raised an eyebrow. "Are you ... into corn?"

  He gave a well-practiced laugh, then smiled at her, letting it reach his eyes. "If you really wanted, we could talk about corn," he said. "I was just trying to make conversation."

  She looked him over, finally paying attention to him. "And you?" she asked. "Where are you from?"

  "Take a guess," he said with a grin. "If you get it in the first three, the next drink is on me."

  "Ah," she said. She was meeting his eyes now, with her gaze occasionally roaming his face. "And if I don't get it? What's my punishment?"

(Obviously a quickly dashed off example.)
