Yeah, especially a piece of paragraph-long exposition. In first person, it can read as though the character is thinking about this thing, rather than focused on the conversation, which isn't really how conversations work. You can do the exposition within the dialogue, but that can get super awkward too, especially if the exposition would be for something that both characters already know and wouldn't explain to each other.

I have a preference for parentheticals as an aside to the reader, but they don't work in all contexts and "voices", and even those still grate on people.
