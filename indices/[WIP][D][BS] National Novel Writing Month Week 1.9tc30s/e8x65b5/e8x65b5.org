anybody have any advice for writing a flirty scene between two people who just met?

I need to write a scene where a guy is kind of flirty, but not, like, overtly flirty.

(He's actually a spy and he's trying to test the waters to see if a romantic approach is useful for getting close to the protagonist, but he can't overdo it and risk scaring her off.)

Thing is, I don't even know how to write a normal flirty scene. How does real, non-caricature flirting work? I'm guessing the answer is something like "genuine-sounding, non-shallow compliments". Is there anything else?
