Thought I started strong by getting a good 4k words under my belt on the first day, but coming back to it today feels significantly more difficult. I think the key to making it through will be pacing myself rather than trying to write as much as possible.

As a side note - setting up a typical hero's journey (even in order to eventually subvert it) is surprisingly difficult. There are a lot of moving parts that need to be finagled very early on, and I'm worried I've missed out some key elements in the interests of writing more.

Well, Nano is for getting first drafts down. If I actually complete it I'll probably go back and edit.
