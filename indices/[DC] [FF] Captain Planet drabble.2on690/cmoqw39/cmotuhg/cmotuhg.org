"Also, holy shit the planet has a sapient life-force. On behalf of humanity, we are SO sorry... but why are you only manifesting to us? Pop into the next UN meeting and let's get some political pressure going against the polluters."

It would actually be interesting to see a Rational!Captain Planet where Gaia doesn't really care all that much for humanity, and things like global warming are unfortunate for us but not really a big issue for Her. What would a sapient planet's values be, and why care about humans in particular? To avoid huge meteors? I guess She'd want to keep human society around and progressing for that.

"Meteors are nature's way of asking, 'So how's that space program coming along?'"
