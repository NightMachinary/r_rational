The "there's an even more powerful entity behind the bad guy!" thing usually is pretty unsatisfying. I think it only ever really works as glue for a very long series.

Having Gaia's motives be unambiguously evil, and we go along with it anyway because we have trouble sympathizing with planet spirits and her motives are so convenient for us (we'd like to terraform Mars too), is definitely interesting. I like the way that interplays with her having had the opportunity to influence our development; what does it mean to make a decision for yourselves when you know your preferences have been molded by another?

I don't think Gaia needs to be responsible for evolution. Natural selection is a natural consequence of a bunch of really basic assumptions; I'd sooner toss relativity than that one (and for comparison, Eliezer would sooner toss conservation of energy than relativity). Natural selection does inherently let her steer our development though; she could just repeatedly kill off any hominids that are likely to be capable of empathizing with abstract nature spirits and evolution will take care of the rest.
