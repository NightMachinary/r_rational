This is fantastic, I really like the malevolent planet spirit take.

I'd discard the "human time scales aren't even noticeable to planetary anthropomorphizations" trope though. Something capable of working on human time scales will make a better antagonist. Or to ramp it up, a being that understands time on both human and geologic time scales, and everything in between. (The additional cognitive resources for the villain seems good for a rationalist fic.)

The exact desires of the planet spirit would be worth getting into. Just wanting to kill all other planet spirits and replace them with her descendents is evil, but it's also really convenient for humanity. Story-wise, it would probably help to have some more values mismatch. Then again, since our entire evolution would have been influenced by this being, maybe it makes sense that we'd be generally okay with her goals. Which... how do you even fight back against that?
