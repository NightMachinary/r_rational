In that case, let's give Gaia the ability to comprehend much /smaller/ time scales than humans. From our point of view, anything it has the information to figure out will be known instantaneously. And it has a lot of information. It may take it a long time to figure out, but that's a long time as measured in Planck intervals. Humans are so thoroughly outclassed that they don't even notice Gaia exists until some other planetary spirit tells them. So of course Gaia goes public (in a benevolent superhero guise) shortly before then, or long enough to be established as a force for good.

Also, it invented natural selection. Or some other planet did, and it used it to create intelligence. Evolution isn't really a force of nature, just of Nature.

As for why it wants to overwrite its equals, it hasn't really thought about it. The reason, unknown to it, is that it's a weapon [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeds_There_a_Man...%3F][being tested by an even more powerful entity]]! Too meta?

And /do/ you fight it? Even if the other planets are sentient, it could conceivably be worth killing them. Maybe loads of humans are going to die otherwise, and the spirits aren't necessarily utility monsters. Though they of course think they are.

I think it'd be interesting to see something where Gaia's motives are unambiguously evil, the other planet spirits are sapient and unambiguously innocent, with no Kick The Dog moments to confuse things, and the humans side with Gaia anyway. Especially if this is somehow portrayed as obviously right and not even a hard question.
