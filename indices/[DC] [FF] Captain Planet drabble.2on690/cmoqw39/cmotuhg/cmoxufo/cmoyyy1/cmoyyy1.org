There's a few possibilities for a sapient planet character:

1. Operates on such a huge timescale that it scarcely notices life on earth. If you're an intelligence that exists for billions of years, a hundred thousand years of humans is only noteworthy when things start to go wrong. This sort of character would be vaguely Lovecraftian (utterly indifferent, making decisions that may destroy us without even knowing).
2. Has a personal interest in the development of life. Could have any of a variety of goals (e.g. biodiversity, improving intelligence, encouraging life to colonise other planets). Some of these would be better for the survival of humans than others.
3. Doesn't particularly like life except that it alleviates boredom. Compared to 1, this version would /feel/ billions of years old. Sapient life would be the latest in a string of entertainments it creates for itself. Natural disasters would be intentional things done to see our reaction (e.g. "Oooh, what if I have a tsunami hit this nuclear reactor?").

There's probably more, but those are the big ones that I can think of; indifference, encouragement, entertainment. You could add in "outright hostility", though it'd be a little hard to believe that the planet was (a) sapient, and (b) genocidal and yet had not managed to kill us all.
