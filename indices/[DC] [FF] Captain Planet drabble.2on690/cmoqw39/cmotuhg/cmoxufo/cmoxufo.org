Would a sapient planet even want any lifeforms? If we assume the planet's sapience is unrelated to presence of life, then wouldn't Gaia prefer to have as little life as possible to muck up her surface and disrupt the environment? I remember that humans aren't the only animal species to radically change the surface of the planet, just the fastest. Gaia might not have been happy at all the plants sucking away her cozy, warm carbon-dioxide in exchange for the reactive oxygen causing combustion and fires.

Silly joke: Would you say that Mount Everest is a giant zit?
