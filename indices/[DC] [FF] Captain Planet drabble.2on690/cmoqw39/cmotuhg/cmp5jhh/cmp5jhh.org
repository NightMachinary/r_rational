  It would actually be interesting to see a Rational!Captain Planet where Gaia doesn't really care all that much for humanity, and things like global warming are unfortunate for us but not really a big issue for Her.

Nasuverse x Captain Planet crossover:

- You could make the planeteers into unwitting pawns of Gaia, or make them misanthropes actively aware of all Gaia's effort to kill humanity, or make them into Magi seeking to find a compromise with Gaia by stopping the more over the top evil polluters.

- All the evil polluters are magi seeking to kill the planet because they know all the crap it has done to humanity. Or magi disguising insane experiments on large areas as pollution.

- Gaia could straight up hate humanity, or it could simply be trying to survive

- Captain planet is a Gaia terminal

- Lots of opportunity for game theory and such (Gaia has values alien to human values, with some overlap like continued survival)
