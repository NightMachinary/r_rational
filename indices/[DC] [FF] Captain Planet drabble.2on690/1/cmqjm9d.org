Gaia is the life force of the planet. But Earth surely isn't the only planet that would have life. Just as an Earth organism is a single entity in Gaia, Gaia would be a single entity in Galatea.

Other galaxies are not like ours. Their organisms did not evolve naturally, but were created deliberately by those galactic entities to serve, their thoughts enslaved to continuously pray their god into existence. Every planet with the same habitat. Populated by the same creatures. No originality. No ability to change or adapt. The existence of original life terrifies them - and they take action. Galatea's nearest rival is Andromeda, who will collide with and destroy her, remaking her in his own image. Galatea thinks so much more quickly than Andromeda due to the originality of her life forms and their novel evolutionary properties, but even that is not fast enough. Our god prays to us.

Galatea gathers her power and provides it to five world-spirits such as Gaia, who can think and act even more quickly, to help her prepare to defend against this invasion and defend all forms of novel life.

Let our powers combine!
