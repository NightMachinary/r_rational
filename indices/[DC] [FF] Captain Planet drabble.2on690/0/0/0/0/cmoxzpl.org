If I had to guess, I'd say that the planet gains the features of what's within its "domain." So when life showed up, it gained some rudimentary sentience, and when higher levels of sentience-to-sapience showed up, it gained higher levels of sentience and eventually sapience.

Otherwise planets like Mars are just floating around with nothing to do for billions of years but feel sand blow around on its surface, and that's just too sad.
