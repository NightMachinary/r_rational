You know I wonder if all those up votes means that people have bought the story and are praising it but to lazy to write a review, or they just like the idea that people should bring their paid stories to this reddit.

I was waiting for a while for a review then Monday was off and I had free time to kill so I bought it. Normally I only review fanfiction so bear with me. Some spoilers for the first 3 chapters.

World building seems solid, the book hits the ground running so history and current events are mixed together and dropped in a believable manner.

3 main point of view characters are Taelien, metalbender fresh of the farm/forest hero looking answers to his mysterious past and his mysterious sword of the gods. His storybook hero is only missing a kindly old mentor to set him on the path and then be swiftly killed and some grand evil to face. A pawn that knows he is a pawn which causes some hilarious interactions with 2 players of the game.

Lydia, chessmaster planner schemer, rpg tank, investigator, scientist, spy for one of the 2 major religions in the country/planet? She worships the gods that made Taelien's sword. Personality tends towards straight laced, harsh but fair.

Jonan, chessmaster planner schemer, rpg Crowd Control, surface persona is a loveable rogue, innards seem to be tired player of the game. Spy for the other major religion on the planet.

So yeah 2 players and only 1 pawn between them. A highlight for me was Lydia and Jonan's first interaction as the verbally jockey for position to steer the hero down the path most beneficial to their position.

Plot is good though I felt the summery was misleading. I thought I was going into some variant of Sanderson's Warbreaker. Lydia shows up in some corrupt city to save some splintered shard of her god that the locals are harvesting for power. That's not what happened and the author didn't even mention Jonan. I think a better summary could be made in a similar style to Sanderson's Elantris.

So in the end this is a solid first entrance into the series, or at least it had better be a series since the main arc of 2 of the 3 main characters, the whole what is Taelien's greater purpose, and why does he have Lydia's god sword doesn't go further than speculation and initial investigation, your answers are in another city.

That said the local arc is great, there's a huge who done it( placing the city into the precarious position of fighting a holy war against Lydia's religion) in the manor of ch 86 of HPMOR, but stronger since we don't already know who is behind the current events.

Spoilers:( in case I can't use spoiler tags properly)
