Sorry for the slow reply, I recently started a new job and I am still settling in. I have placed a slightly shorten version of the review on goodreads and amazon.

Looking at your previous versions is interesting, personally I liked versions 3 and 4 best. I will note that Sanderson's books usually have a 200-300 word blurb, which was what convinced me to buy mistborn, 8 hours later I was back at the book store getting the rest of the trilogy.

Welp here's where I put up my own summery that I had in mind:

The City of Orlyn is a rising power where divinity once again walks among men. Rumor has it that godhood can even be granted to the worthy.

Taelien Salaris, a swordsman from the forest of blades, seeks the truth about his heritage and answers about his sword the Saeken Taelien, a legendary sword originally belonging to the Tae'os Pantheon.

Lydia Scryer, a court sorcerer of Orlyn and undercover paladin of Tae'os, wants to prevent a holy war between her religion and Orlyn.

Jonan Kestrian, a spy for the order of Vaelien, has orders to investigate the claims of the local divinity and stop their growing influence.

Here the characters are shown in the same order that we get their points of view in the story, along with a small, true, tantalizing portion of their arcs.

I liked all the main characters, my worst issue with them was sometimes Lydia and Jonan sound very similar in their internal monologues which I mostly put off to them both being spies.

I think that the appendix should be placed in the front of the book so readers know that is there and can flip back to it whenever they get confused about the magic system. I know I felt that I should have been taking notes to understand things on my first read through when I didn't even realize that there was an explanation in the back.

I also have so places of confusion. Location 465:

As a result of these cultural differences, Lydia estimated that the sorcerers in Orlyn numbered in the low hundreds , and the three who sat with her now were among the most influential. By contrast, Velthryn had hundreds of sorcerous students in their academes at any time and thousands of trained sorcerers in the city as a whole.

I thought it was established earlier that the number of Tae'os worshippers in Orlyn was less than 5% of the total pop so there should be no way that there are that many Velthryn sorcerers in Orlyn. Unless you're talking about the Velthryn country and not Orlyn.

I'll try to bookmark more spots as I do my second much slower read through.

It's good to hear that this is going to be a long series, any idea about what you're going to call it?
