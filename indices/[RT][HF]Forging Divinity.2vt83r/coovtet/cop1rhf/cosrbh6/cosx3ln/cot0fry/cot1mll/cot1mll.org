I'm glad you have questions - that's probably a good sign. =D

You have a good point about the characters in Sanderson's books usually being novices. I've actually written a couple books more like that (within this same setting), I just never ended up publishing them for various reasons. It might be wise for me to publish a prequel or intro story or something at some point to introduce people to the systems in a more traditional, "You're a wizard, Harry," fashion.

Great question. Velthryn is the capitol city of a region (very creatively called the "Velthryn region"), as well as one of the current cultural centers on the continent.

The answer to the Tevinter/Xixian question is basically "yes". There are also some cities that were never part of the Xixian Empire - it didn't quite span the entire continent. Xixis, the capitol city of the empire, was in the north western corner of the continent, and they expanded outward from there. They never got as far as the north east corner, which is where Valeria is located, or the utter south.

There are also relatively new cities, like Aayara. (The fact that this name is the same as a character name is deliberate. Characters in the setting debate if the city was named after her, or if she was named after the city).

This would probably be easier to picture with a map. Unfortunately, the only decent quality map I have is later on in the timeline, and it has some serious spoilers. =/ I'm working on getting a new one made.

The relationship between humans and Rethri varies from region to region. Rethri are fewer in numbers than humans almost everywhere, but they outnumber humans in many parts of the Forest of Blades, which is where both Jonan and Taelien are from. (Jonan grew up in the city, for the most part, whereas Taelien grew up in a small town until he was sent off to a military training facility.)

Vaelien is usually thought of as the "Rethri god" by people from outside of that region, and most Rethri do worship him, but he has plenty of human followers as well. He's just really prominent in a region where Rethri are comparatively common, and he's also described as appearing to be a Rethri himself. The Thornguard worship Vaelien and have both human and Rethri members.

Of the areas in the Forest of Blades, two of the main cities - Liadra and Keldris - are ruled by Rethri monarchs. Selyr has a city council.

Velthryn has a monarchy, but it's largely considered symbolic at this point in history. The Senate has the majority of the real power, and old Rethri families control most of the Senate. This is the source for a great deal of tension, because while Rethri were the majority of the founders of the city, humans outnumber them significantly now.

Rethri are comparatively very rare outside these specific examples, and generally considered second class citizens in many of them. Conversely, /humans/ are considered second class citizens in places like Liadra and Keldris. Very few cities treat them equally.

Most of the technology that puts the story at that tech level is subtler stuff. Medical technology is pretty advanced, because diagnostic sorcery has given insights into how the human body works. This is why Jonan can have several pairs of glasses with different prescriptions, for example.

Construction and metallurgy are also pretty advanced, and some cities are experimenting with ideas for mass production of goods. They're basically progressing toward an industrial revolution.

Sewage and irrigation systems are also pretty advanced. Some rich people even have early "water closets".

Explosive powders do exist, but they're not in broad usage, and there are no guns on the continent yet. This is, in part, a thematic choice. Within the story, the primary reason for this is that flame sorcery is the single most commonly researched dominion, and sufficient mastery of it is generally more useful than having a firearm. Sorcerers define a large part of how battle is traditionally conducted on this continent - things are different elsewhere in the world. =)
