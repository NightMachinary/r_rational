That's a really fantastic review, and I think you caught some of what I was attempting to do perfectly. If you want to do me a huge favor, I'd love it if you could repost that on Amazon and/or Goodreads. You can be honest with whatever number of stars you feel is appropriate, I just think it's a great assessment of the book.

I struggled with what to do with the synopsis. I actually ended up cutting out the other two characters based on feedback, both from friends and from what I was hearing from posting my initial synopsis on [[/r/fantasywriters]]. From a [[/r/rational]] perspective, I definitely think putting Jonan and more details about the magic system would have been helpful. From a general marketing standpoint, that might have been overkill - I'm honestly not sure. I'm very new at this.

If you're interested in seeing the iterations I went through when trying to figure out my synopsis text, you can see several versions of it [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/197LUV_ZnMQcZoITei3umCUTZyOKjBmMEsXvK7zpORWI/edit][here]]. I tinkered with several styles, some of which you can see are closer to the Elantris style or even the Way of Kings style.

I'm about 33,000 words into the sequel, and the game plan is to expand this into a significantly longer series.

You gave great character summaries - which one(s) did you like? Did you dislike any of them, and if so, what elements did you dislike?

Thanks so much for taking the time to write the review. You've made my day.
