So can she guess the composition of an object by seeing if the spell fails? I.e. get a bottle of water and use the spell on salt to see if it's fresh water or not, or touch a patient and target the spell for malformed DNA to scan for cancer? Or touch a scratch-off lottery ticket and do the locate spell on a variety of numbers to see which ones are not there? Or does she immediately know which numbers are there just by touching the ticket and doing the spell? Can she read minds by touching people? What happens if she tries to read her own mind?

Can she touch (and thereby intercept) wireless communications?

Also, and I guess this would tread on spoiler territory, but how does the ship of theseus work with this? Does she get all the places a rock has ever been by touching it? Can she get the entire, complete history of the earth by touching the pavement?

Can she get the combination to a safe by touching it?
