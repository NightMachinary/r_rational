Yes, if she cast a spell on an invalid target she would be able to use that to narrow down characteristics.

There are several methods by which she could try to determine the numbers on an unscratched lottery ticket. If she had a spell designed to search for a specific number, she could cast it several times to search for each number and record the results. She might have a spell that's designed to scan all text and return the results, which would be more taxing, but it would also give her all of the numbers immediately.

Doing this with something on the scale of a lottery ticket is plausible, but things that are longer would be very unreliable. Gaining "knowledge" from a spell does not guarantee that you can remember it, so it would be the equivalent of seeing a series of numbers once.

Whether or not she can read minds is discussed in the early chapters and has some minor spoilers, so I won't go into that.

Wireless communications do not exist at the technological level of this setting. It's roughly 1600s to early 1900s level technology, varying based on specific locations, and with certain types of technology developing at different rates from the real world because of the presence of sorcery, social and cultural differences, etc. Would it be possible if she was in a modern time period? Yes, but touching probably wouldn't be the appropriate targeting methodology.

Getting the history of an object actually falls more into the territory of the Dominion of Memory. Knowledge is what's called a "Prime Dominion"; they tend to be very conceptually broad in scope. Memory is a "Deep Dominion", and they have narrower, more specific functions.

Even with the Dominion of Memory, spells would not give you the entire history of something all at once; your spell would need to have more specific search parameters.

The broad answer to the "Ship of Theseus" question is that people attempt to specify a target and a result when they cast a spell, and that the scale of the spell determines the cost. To make this a little clearer, I should probably give you a basic overview of the magic system as a whole.

The broad system is called Dominion Sorcery, and practitioners are called sorcerers. Sorcerers cast spells by using a part of themselves to signal a Dominion to create an effect. The type of cost is dependent on the Dominion, and the scale of the cost depends on the intended effect.

To give you a simple example, the cost of casting a Dominion of Flame spell is body heat. So, if a flame sorcerer wants to cast a traditional fireball spell, they're going to need to expend body heat to do it. The amount of body heat expended for the spell is much lower than the amount of heat within the fireball; the Dominion of Flame is what is generating the actual result. More powerful sorcerers are more efficient at using their own bodies to create a connection with the Dominion; thus, a powerful flame sorcerer could throw a fireball for a relatively low cost in body heat, but a newbie sorcerer could drain him or herself to hypothermia with the cost of lighting a candle.

One analogy I sometimes give is that the sorcerer is lighting a match to start the fire of a gas stove; the amount of flame created is much greater than the amount expended.

As a sorcerer uses a particular Dominion, their body adapts to the use, developing a stronger connection - but using too much in a short period can cause permanent damage. Think of it like exercising a muscle. In some cases, overuse of sorcery can be fatal.

"Spells" are a way of reliably reproducing a specific effect. Lydia uses incantations for most of her spells - this is not actually necessary, but it's used as a method of making certain the results are what she is looking for. It's a specific focusing methodology, and different schools of sorcerous training handle that differently. She discusses methodology with another sorcerer within the story.

Once a sorcerer has a spell, different sorcerers have varying levels of ability to modify that spell "on the fly". This is a separate discipline, generally called "Core Sorcery" by scholars. A simple example would be that a spell might make a sphere of fire, but Core Sorcery is necessary to make that sphere move or detonate. A more experienced flame sorcerer might be able to split a sphere of fire into several smaller spheres, or control it to home in on a specific target, etc.

Learning how to conjure a particular type of energy from a Dominion (Dominion Sorcery) and how to control energy that's already been summoned (Core Sorcery) are separate from each other, and also must be learned on a Dominion-by-Dominion basis.

I'd rather not get into too much detail - a lot of this is explained within the book, and probably better than how I'm explaining it here, since you'd have more context.

Lydia could probably make a spell for finding the combination to a safe if given time, but she doesn't have a spell for that specific function that she's already learned, nor would it be easy to modify her existing spells for that exact function. The Dominion of Memory would make this super easy, but you could make a knowledge spell for trying to determine the amount of wear on each of the numbers, for example.
