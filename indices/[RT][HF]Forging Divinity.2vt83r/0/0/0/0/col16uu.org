I can see why you'd ask that, but no. =D

She has to actively cast a spell, and when she casts the spell, she specifies a target. It's not that she has a passive info-gathering ability that happens whenever she touches something.

There are certain types of spells that are tailored for gathering different types of information, as well as spells that are designed for use on different types of targets.

If you're wondering /how/ Lydia can target say, a "person", without getting other things (e.g. the bacteria you mentioned) in the process, that gets into deeper magical theory than I probably shouldn't be discussing on a thread like this, since it could involve delving into spoiler territory. Targeting methodologies are discussed within the book and will be elaborated on in future works.

The simple answer is that Lydia does have some level of control over what she's choosing to try to gather information about.

Does that answer your question?
