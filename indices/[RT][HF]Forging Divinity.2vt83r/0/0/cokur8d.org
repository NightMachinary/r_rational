Great question. The line in the summary is an over simplification of how her abilities work, but I wanted to have a good hook line that illustrates the type of thing that she does.

She doesn't really have a single "ability" to identify - she's proficient in utilizing the Dominion of Knowledge, and she uses it in a variety of different ways (not all of which are limited to touch) throughout the book.

She absolutely could gather information about herself, or about active spell effects that are on herself, through using specific spells in her repertoire.

Similarly, she could determine the strength of her own connection to specific Dominions, including the Dominion of Knowledge, which might be the closest application to what you've asked.

If you're thinking about this in terms of her attempting to identify the mechanics by which sorcery itself functions, that's explored within this book. Sorcery theory is a big part of my writing.
