Yeah, I already have the Look Inside option enabled for the Kindle version, but I have to set it up separately for people to be able to preview the print version. CreateSpace and Kindle Direct do a lot of things differently and some of the disconnects are kind of bizarre.

Edit: And if you were just pointing out that my book is available on Kindle Unlimited, well, I feel a little silly. =D
