Do you mind telling us your experience with Kindle Unlimited? I've been asking around for anyone who has it what it's like before deciding whether or not to join up. It seems like a reasonable deal and a third of my wishlist (~30 out of 100 books) can be found on it, but I worry about being pressured to read more books than I have time for to benefit from the money savings.
