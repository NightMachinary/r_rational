Oh wow, I am such a newbie with reddit, I didn't even notice the pm until now, thanks! Boy you sure like to throw your readers into the deep end of the action. I have so many questions, like what happened to Taelien, but I suppose I can wait until the next book is released.

Sanderson can put his magic system at the end of the book because his point of view characters are usually newbies who spent a considerable amount of his very long stories learning the system. You've taken the harder and more interesting route of having all three of your main characters as experts in their respective fields of magics, arguably geniuses since they individually have come up with novel applications for their own magic. And all of this before the book even started.

Yes that would make it clearer, though now I have some questions about the state of the world. I originally thought that Velthryn was country like America not just another city state. So after the Tevinter imperium... I mean the Xixian empire was overthrown, did the empire just fragment into city states?

What is the general relationship between humans and the Rethri? I originally thought they were some sort of despised underclass because Jonan thought they were being quietly disappeared to fuel dark rituals. But given that he is following their religion, I am confused.

You mentioned in an earlier post that the tech time frame was between the 16th and the 19th century, but I didn't notice anything beyond medieval tech. Most obvious is the lack of gunpowder, swords and spells seem to be the mainstay.

Thanks for the quick response.
