No problem! I hope your new job is going well. And thank you so much for reposting the reviews - that means a lot to me. I PMed you a preview chapter as thanks. =)

I like your synopsis, and I think it's the type that would hook me. It's along the lines of what I did for version 3, which is one of the ones you noted that you liked the best. I like that style a lot, too, but the other readers I showed it to thought introducing all of the characters at once was too much.

To some extent, I think the summary comes down to personal preference, although I do think that your suggestion comes across as more representative of the actual story, and I think that's important. I'm definitely going to lean in that direction for future synopsis. Thanks for the advice.

I agree with your criticism that Lydia and Jonan's internal monologues sound very similar. While it's true that they are both spies, as you mentioned, I probably should do more to emphasize some of their personality characteristics. Jonan tends to be more cynical and self-deprecating, for example, and Lydia - while relatively rational as a general rule - leans on her faith more than Jonan does.

I'm iffier about moving the appendix. Using Sanderson as the example, he always puts his at the back of his books, and that's typically what I see for other reference materials (like the glossaries in Michael. J Sullivan's stuff, for example). I'll think about this.

Regarding the # of sorcerers, I think I just phrased those sentences too ambiguously. She's comparing the number of sorcerers in the entire city of Orlyn to the number of sorcerers in the entire city of Velthryn. The second sentence probably should be rephrased to something like, "By contrast, in the city of Velthryn, there were hundreds of sorcerous students in academies and thousands of trained sorcerers in the city as a whole."

Would that make it clearer?

The current series title is "The War of Broken Mirrors".

Thanks for the feedback!
