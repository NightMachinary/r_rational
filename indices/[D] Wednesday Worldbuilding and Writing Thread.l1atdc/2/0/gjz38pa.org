In my opinion, making up a system for personal enjoyment and making one for a story are two completely different things. This is something people often miss, they look at the worldbuilding in a popular work and think that it could be better, that it's too simple or handwavey. The problem is that one *cannot frontload complexity in fiction.* Anything made up to go into a story has to be simple to understand, especially when first introduced. Complexity, intricacy, exploitability, these all have to be emergent aspects, gradually revealed; the system must make overall sense without the reader understanding it granularly. Why?

Because you're writing a story, not a worldbuilding bible. Even on dedicated worldbuilding forums or thread(hi mom) where all involved are of a subset people that are specifically interested in the subject, it's still difficult to get someone to actually read my dry as fuck musings on make-believe metaphysics. That should tell you something.

So my advice, for what it's worth, is to view all aspects of worldbuilding that will be delved into as being part of plot or a character's arc. Not just character, character arc. An simple example would be how Rowling writes about Harry being a parselmouth. Revealing that he can speak to snakes when he first does it(book 1 chapter 2) , describing the mechanics of it, saying that he would become a social pariah, that would not be very engaging for the audience, as all untethered exposition is basically homework. What Rowling does instead is have Harry reveal it /when it's relevant/. He does it inadvertently and /in public/, and then rowling show the immediate consequences, as well as knock-on effects, where suddenly he's a suspect for the Heir of Slytherin, he's isolated from his classmates, and so on and so on. Instead of just being copy-pasted from the writer's worldbuilding document ##cough##the-entirety-of-litrpg ##cough##, that aspect of the magic system is used to advance the entire trinity of storytelling: character, plot, and setting, and that's way better.

Or so I believe, anyway. To put it into words, my philosophy is that properly done, worldbuilding can be an integral part of character, plot or setting, rather than just setting as most people seem to believe.
