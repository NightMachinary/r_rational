Coild the magic "focus" distribution be based on a character's valuation of each of those 3 potential focuses? It'd further align their power and stuff with their motivation and beliefs.

Although having it be the inverse would also be interesting (ie. A selfish/narcistic person is vulnerable to the whims of the world and society), and reinforce the aspect of fighting against a world that molds itself to fight back in a way.
