Some stories I've seen have used either nanotechnology or simulated reality as the source of their magic. Not going to mention which, it's a spoiler.

Nanotechnology could possibly do a lot of things that seem like magic, especially if you allow there to be nanobots spread out everywhere in a world, including the air. The nanobots could do voice recognition for spells, although the spell effects would probably be somewhat limited. Visual effects would be relatively simple, and therefore so would divination spells and prestidigitation effects. A summoning ritual for a creature would be possible, I'd just expect it to take a very long time unless you have a source of solid nanobots (or if the whole world is made of nanobots...).

The crux of this is assuming that nanobot-based metamaterials and self-replicating nanobots are feasible and powerful enough to do all that, which they very well may not be.

The theoretical foundations of a nanobot system to create magic probably won't be created within this century, so it's hard to say how soon it could. Given that it would have to be a world spanning effect with enormous amounts of nanobots that all need to be powered, it would also take a lot of time to make a reality. Overall I think it'd take a few centuries.
