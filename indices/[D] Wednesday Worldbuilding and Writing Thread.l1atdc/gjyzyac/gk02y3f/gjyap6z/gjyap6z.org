Not totally sure if this should go here, or if I should take it elsewhere, but I wanted y'all's thoughts on a magic system I'm working on.

I am creating a work of speculative fiction focusing on worldview and bias, where I am looking to use the magic system of the setting to literally represent the ways that people and society interpret the world. *Within this system, there would be three things that influence any part of interpreted reality: the personal perspective and beliefs of the individual viewing things, the general consensus of agreed upon beliefs and reality of the community or society, and the wishy-washy subjective sort-if reality that seems to exist beyond.* Each of these comes together to produce a similar yet individualized interpretation of reality for each person, massive on it's changes at a large scale, but still close to our own idea of humanity and reality at a small one - which will let me use elements of the magic to literally represent things like unspoken rules, conflicts of belief, and so on.

The problem I run into, however, is how to balance self, society, and world without one overriding the others, or one being lost. I don't want everything to be defined by the individual, as then there is no consistency when moving between perspectives and I am unable to talk about how much of bias is inherited or societal. If I focus on the societal, with individual power being fairly weak but the consensus of a society changing the world, then the individual begins to lose agency, and I can't talk about of individuals are what make up that society. If I say that there is an objective reality that people are misinterpreting, then that invalidates the experiences and understanding people have of the world.

To condense the problem, I want to create a system through which to use magic to literally talk about worldview in a systemic manner as so for the reader to be able to understand the bias in context and use the system themselves to figure out how other characters or themselves might use 'magic'. I also want the character's in universe to be aware (or at least some of them) of how their bias can alter how they see things, and be able to actively work to change it. To do that, I need to have a sold way through which power is exchanged and reality is determined. However, the more I systemize worldview, the more I have to reduce it to baser components, reducing the individuality and complexity.

*What can I do in my magic system to balance the influences of the self, society, and world? How can I make the magic an actual system, without reducing the topics it focuses on? Are there examples of rules or limitations I could put in place that still preserve the core idea? Or is finding a balance here not possible due to conflicting goals, and if so, what might my options be for changing it?*

​

Examples of things I would be interested to include:

- A school with intensely divided cliques. To the students in the school, there are literal lines in the ground between groups, that shift and move but cannot be crossed without a important reason. A new student with no understanding of these lines arrives at the school and, unknowing of the divisions, literally crosses lines they didn't know were there. As a result of this, you both have the new student begin to see the lines over time, as they realize there is something there that exists for others, but also you have the others idea of the objectivity of these lines challenged, and start to chip.
- A boxer is training for a match. They believe in their ability, believe that if they train, if they put in the work, it will have results. This comes, in part, from a society that also believes in this. This combines with the pseudo-physical nature of reality, and actually does help the boxer improve. However, the boxer enters a match with a champion renowned for their great strength - who in part has gained that strength because of that general belief. In the fight, you would have The boxer's own belief in the work they put in, the local crowd's belief in the strength and 'obvious' victory of the champion, the general societal bias towards an underdog story, and the physical nature of the fighters bodies, all at work to determine the outcome.
- A society has a shared understanding in the existence of ghosts. When someone dies, a immaterial visage of them will remain, slowly fading until the original person fades from the memories of all those living, when it will fully dissipate. A resident of local are moved here a few years back, and instead comes from a community that believe that there is no soul, and you are nothing after you die, but they don't let this difference of belief stop them from getting involved in this new community. Then an accident happens, the newcomer dies, and they create a ghost. At the funeral, and argument breaks out between the local friends and the family of the newcomer, on if the ghost is actually the newcomer, or instead the community's shared interpretation of them.
- A city where talking is often overlapped with a direct sharing of feelings and experiences telekinetically. Here, the government, rather than being run by people directly, is run by an All-Mind composed of the interlinked consensus of every mind in the city, along with a council of representative officials. For the citizens, they know that their thoughts and interests have a part to play in politics and tend to believe they have an impact, however small, but also tend to consider themselves disconnected from the process themselves, due to it being largely subconscious. A new bill is proposed, focused on the limitation of a new mindsharing device, and the All-Mind is unable to decide, revealing the community is split on the issue, resulting in more person to person debate.

Also, if you have any questions about elements of the world, or thoughts on things that might exist in such a setting, please do ask. A lot of this is still in the early stages, and most any help is welcome :).
