I would definitely agree. Worldbuilding, is best used to push forward elements of character, theme, or intention of the creator. It's something I keep in mind while writing, but I think a little context might be of help as to why this mindset specifically is a part of what I am doing in my questions above.

To begin with, the project I am working from has combined analytical, worldbuilding, and writing elements, for an ultimately academic purpose. To your point on the product, it *will* be containing a worldbible, alongside a series of short stories from a series of perspectives, and a research paper based on survey data I have been conducting alongside this project.

I would add on to you points, by saying that worldbuilding should not just/only emphasize character arc, but be a means through which the writer brings into play the themes and intentions of their work. Especially in a collection of short stories/fiction from many perspective like I am doing, that secondary meaning often become prominently important.

The reason I ask these questions now, and am looking to solve this complexity, is not because I want to explain it all to the readers at once, but because I want a solid system for I as a writer to use, which will allow for the elements from story to story to be consistent in a manner that readers can pick up on. I won't be saying "well let me tell you why perspective matters", but I will be having characters who share experiences or mindsets that I want to literally show through their magically altered perspective of the world. The point of the system is not to explain, but to make it so that when I do show things, it's not me as the writer making things up on the spot, but a part of a pre-existing framework that can be understood through observation, examples, and context. Going off of your Harry Potter example above, while Rowling does often introduce concepts in way that promotes the narrative, they also often feel inconsistent, or need to be explained after the fact.

The main reason I am using worldbuilding here, is because I specifically have certain themes and views that I want to literally represent in ways that can be talked about, and I am using worldbuilding to develop a setting that facilitates that. To give an example of something similar, in Wildbow's Worm, the superpowers in some ways serve as a literal metaphor for the perpetuation of someone's trauma. A person will go through a traumatic trigger event, and that event will shape what they can do and how they think about it, often leading them back to the situations that caused the event to begin with. By making this process a literal story element, you gain the ability to address the subject in your text in a way that even those without the experience can understand, and apply to situations beyond the text. And as you said, the idea of powers is introduced first, with the actual mechanics of how people get powers slowly revealed later, but by having the system made to begin with, that reveal is one the readers could have come to on their own, and remains consistent across the whole of the text.

The problem, as I said in my initial post, is that to make a system that supports the themes and stories I want to tell with any consistency, would also mean in some ways reducing those things it represents. And yet if I approach each character on their own, I lessen my ability to talk about themes of interconnection, and the work as a whole.

Does that clarify at all? I'm not trying to disregard the suggestion, just that it's something I was already taking into consideration.
