  Once you've got the staggering abundance of energy and resource that comes from fusion and functioning space infrastructure and industry things become pretty post scarcity for one. You can also expect that a large portion of the population will live in satellites in orbit around a populated planet or on cyclers between planets. This is because the resource abundance and slightly better automation means anyone may well be able to afford to buy/build a rotating O'Neil cylinder with many square miles of living space to live like a king.

This seems like an absolutely nonsensical claim and wildly reduces my interest in these videos, sorry. All snark aside, the massively higher engineering difficulties of doing anything in space rather than on Earth (air! water! food! redundancy! transportation! community!) strongly suggest to me otherwise.

(Also my interest in watching videos on basically any subject approaches zero. I'll happily read articles, or at least start reading them until they start saying obviously crazy things, but no videos, nope.)
