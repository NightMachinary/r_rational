  Even if I were to grant "simple self replicating machines", which is a morass I don't want to wade into
#+end_quote

There's an important distinction between this types of self replicating machine and self replicating nanobots (beyond size). As these are vastly less complex and don't need to be anywhere close to AGI to perform the mining and manufacturing that proposals like the one for mining Mercury I linked call for. Importantly a lot of these proposed methods of doing simple automated mining/refining are fairly inefficient and rely on massive amounts of energy/heat, but the many statites/satellites being pumped out can provide those in abundance.

  the notion that most people will be living in space just seems ludicrous to me.
#+end_quote

There's a reason I said a /major portion/ not a majority. Some people will live in space because they work in space industry (for instance many valuable materials can only be manufactured in 0 G), or because they /want/ to be isolated from their former civilization. Most of those in space though, will probably just live there because space on earth is finite: Inevitably if land in cylinder habitats keep getting cheaper and that on the earth keeps getting costlier then a lot of people will start wanting to live in orbit for more than just the novelty.

  We can't even do bubbles on Earth; the reliability problems and the issues of community remain staggeringly harder than merely manufacturing a cylinder.

I find it strange that you bring up these moderately difficult technical problems as though they aren't solvable with near future tech, yet you were willing to grant fusion power. As for community people in orbit can still communicate in near real time with people on the planet, so if travel on and off world was cheap and easy that's not much of a barrier.

  Soil is complicated, and neither hydroponics nor aeroponics has even a proof of concept to scale up to these scales.
#+end_quote

I'm just talking about using normal soil produced by microbes (faster than letting lichen start from scratch) and putting it in a spinning strong metal drum, though with near future tech and cheap graphene production you can make things /much/ larger. The technical problems here are with regards to problems that the current ISS deals with and an increase in size doesn't proportionally increase the difficulty involved. With developed space industry notably mass isn't expensive like it is when you have to launch it into orbit with rockets and you can afford to go overkill for the sake of shielding as well.

#+begin_quote
  so you need some additional kind of carbon-rip-and-sequester tech. But that last one I'll grant as being solvable with just pure tech.
#+end_quote

Well yeah it's possible on account of it already existing and being used by the ISS. All you need is chemicals that react to pull co2 out of the air.

  Also, software is only pure profit if it's fire-and-forget..
#+end_quote

Ok the better comparison is that both self replicating manufacturing and software have fixed initial and ongoing costs so as things scale up the effective per unit price for the producer approaches zero.
