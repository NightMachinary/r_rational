Okay, weird but I guess that'll work. One other problem: how are we calculating the energy input for reactionless delta-V? In a rocket engine, the amount of energy needed to generate a newton of thrust varies based upon the speed at which the propellant mass is being ejected, with more energy required per newton as the propellant is ejected faster. On the far end of the spectrum, with a photon rocket, the propellant mass is ejected at lightspeed, requiring three hundred megawatts per newton of thrust. If that's the case here, the reactionless drive is probably not going to be used much outside of a few niche applications.
