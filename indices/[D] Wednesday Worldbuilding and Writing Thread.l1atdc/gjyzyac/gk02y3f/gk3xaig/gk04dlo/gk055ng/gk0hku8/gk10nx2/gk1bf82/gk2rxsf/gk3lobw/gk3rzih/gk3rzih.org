That's actually a dynamic that's already in the concept! The reason why you can't use this for interstellar or extrasolar (solar in this case being the system the story is set in) is because its mechanism of operation is reliant on the gravity well. So it's almost perfectly efficient at ~Mercury's orbit and is less than 25% efficiency by the time you get to the outer planets.

Buzzing a planet for more efficient delta-V generation is extremely impolite unless you're doing business there, whether dropping off a cargo boat or picking up (cargo boats are wildly over-energy'd relative to their mass so that they can dump speed real fast or match speed real fast).
