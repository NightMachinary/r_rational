Given a SciFi setting where:

- by and large, the only technology available is relatively straightforward of our own technologies (so: fission/fusion for power, for example, and no SciFantasy shields)
- there exist extremely cheap sublight drives of alien origin that give near-perfectly-efficient conversion of power to reactionless delta-V up to .1c [edit: in the reference frame of the local star/s]
- there is no FTL and this is set in a multi-sun solar system with multiple inhabited planets at typical astronomical distances, each of which is a separate (or many separate) political polities

How does conflict actually look? MAD is obvious (any ship can set up a world-ending strike, so nobody sets up world-ending strikes), but kinetic weapons seem basically useless against any non-fixed target and you'd probably get raider ships that are low-mass super-high-energy-generation that try to close and board?
