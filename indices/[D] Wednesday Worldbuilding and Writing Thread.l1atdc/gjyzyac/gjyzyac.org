With all the different magic systems in stories which are more or less plausible, do you think it is possible to invent a realistic one?

I have only high-level knowledge about physics, but for everyone who has in depth knowledge and experience:

Is it realistic that a team of physicists can come come up with a mathematical model for a magic system that is compatible with our physical model of the world. The magical model should allow for the common things you can do with magic - conjuring, altering of matter, wielding of '/energies/' like fire, electricity - and be applicable by humans.

According to your experiences/model of how physics work, is it realistic to devise such a magical model? How many physicists would it approximately take to do it in 5, 10, 20 (take your pick) years? Are /ordinary/ physicists who are good enough to do a PhD enough or would you need at least X numbers of geniuses?

And what would the model need to entail?

​

Edit & Example/Clarification:

I am meaning an extension of the laws of nature in a ways that allows for actions where you would otherwise need technologies for that use a whole variety of physical laws and you need that technological piece (firearm, rocket, radio).

But magic would be more like another form of 'energy', lets just call it /Magic/ and some interacting force. And then you can enact this force in a certain way to transform Magic into kinetic energy to propel a projectile or transform it into an object (matter) like the aforementioned projectile, or transform the stone on the ground into the projectile...

So magic is like the simplest physical shortcut to do everything you could do with physics. And you can perform it without technology. So there should be a mechanism which can naturally evolve. I also mentioned magical technology, but that was just, if doesn't make sense to be used by lifeforms this easily. Best just forget about it. If not, it was meant to go into the directions of wands, so where Harry Potter has wands, Star Wars has Midi-chlorians. I just cut it from the original text, otherwise it leads the discussion in a totally unintended direction.

This is the very high-level version of how I imagine /real magic/ would work like.

If it uses our laws of nature it is technology/chemistry..., if it uses the shortcut /Magic/, it is magic. Maybe Magic also allows for otherwise impossible things, but that would depend on the possibilities of making it compatible with all existing laws.

​

Abstract different example: The given laws of nature are like the game mechanic in a computer game, like how you normally play the game. Magic is more like the cheat codes you could use.
