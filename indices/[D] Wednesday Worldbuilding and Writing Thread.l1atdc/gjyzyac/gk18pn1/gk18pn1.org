  Is it realistic that a team of physicists can come come up with a mathematical model for a magic system that is compatible with our physical model of the world. The magical model should allow for the common things you can do with magic - conjuring, altering of matter, wielding of 'energies' like fire, electricity - and be applicable by humans.

You run into two really big problems here.

1. Scientists have observed an awful lot of the possible physical conditions out there without finding any magic. There will always be gaps where nobody has observed this particular strange configuration of matter/energy, but they're conceptually small and we don't have any reason to expect anything but what our models predict, especially on human-scale phenomena.

2. Even if some particular strange configuration of matter/energy does something wildly unexpected and novel that breaks physics as we know it, the chances that it breaks physics in a way we'd identify as magic are tiny. Our conception of magic is human-specific or at least mind-specific (it involves intent), so for something to be magical it has to specifically interact with a specific complex phenomena in a very specific way.

Honestly I think your best bet for physicists unlocking human-applicable magic is that they find the universe's debug menu.

The best way I can think of to find a debug menu from the inside is to notice unexpected lag when you trigger whatever subroutine checks whether you're supposed to be activating the menu. So physicists find some unusual situation where there's a tiny bit of delay in a physical phenomena, they start experimenting with trying to maximize the delay, the trigger to make a bigger delay keeps being more and more specific, eventually they brute force their way to signing the admin password in cesium atoms, and it turns out that anyone who does that gets debug access.
