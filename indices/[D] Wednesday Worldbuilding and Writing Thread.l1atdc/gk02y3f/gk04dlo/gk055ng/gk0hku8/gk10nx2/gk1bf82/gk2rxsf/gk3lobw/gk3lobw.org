One possibility might be to make them some sort of anti-gravity drive instead of technically being reactionless. That is, they /somehow/ are able to push against gravitationally significant objects from extreme distances, using nothing but electricity for fuel. Total momentum is conserved since the larger body gets it, but this allows for continued thrust so long as you've got energy.

This makes thrust work best when near large bodies. Planet orbital thrusters work great, larger solar orbits are so so, and once you get interested it's mostly ineffective.

This could lead to some interesting world building where shipping routes and whatnot might deliberately do flybys of otherwise out of the way planets for a thruster boost that makes their overall trip quicker, giving predictable but changing shipping routes.
