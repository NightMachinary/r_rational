  Mostly it's a worldbuilding device to get around the weight-based diminishing returns, because those make for boring worldbuilding.

You can certainly minimize that problem with fusion rockets for manned spacecraft and ion engines for unmanned spacecraft. Look at The Expanse as an example of how fusion rockets can be used in decently hard sci-fi with a realistic and fascinating setting.

Reactionless drives may or may not allow you to hand-wave that problem away since you'd still need a reactor for operating in the most distant parts of the solar system, which puts you in the same boat as you'd be in with fusion rockets. However, reactionless drives may also make matters worse for you since they create a possibility of perpetual motion devices. For example, suppose you take two of them, put them on opposite ends of an axle, pointed in opposite directions, and then power them on to spin the axle and run a generator? If the power to run them is less than the power they produce, you now have a perpetual motion device that can be used to power your main engines! Power produced with thrust is proportional to speed, so the faster you can spin your perpetual motion drives, the more energy they will generate per unit of energy put into them. I'm getting a headache just thinking about dealing with that scenario in a setting.
