This shouldn't be that surprising of a claim when you actually take into account how massively influential the technologies in this scenario are. Starting down the path to becoming K2 represents a revolution in the size and nature of the economy, so we should expect people in such an economy to be rich by modern standards simply for the same reasons /we ourselves are rich by the standards of our ancestors/.

A lot of the problems you describe change dramatically once you have decent space infrastructure and it cannot be overstated how many other forms of scarcity (such as which mineral deposits are profitable to mine) are based on the cost of electricity. Simple self replicating machines are the key element of this scenario, because they can increase in numbers exponentially and decouple the value of minerals and energy from human labor. So if some of those machines are mass producing O'Neill cylinders their cost can be almost trivially low in principle, because like software self replicating manufacturing only requires an upfront cost after which everything is pure profit.
