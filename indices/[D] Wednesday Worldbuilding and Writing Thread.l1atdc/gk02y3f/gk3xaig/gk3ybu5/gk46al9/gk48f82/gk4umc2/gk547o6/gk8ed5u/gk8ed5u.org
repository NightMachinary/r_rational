  The ISS's solutions aren't sustainable, though. The zeolite stuff is cool (really cool!) but only just effective enough even with the use of a gel-based dessicant (which they ship from Earth).

There's better solutions available with extensions of future if energy is abundant. [[https://phys.org/news/2017-06-low-cost-carbon-dioxide.html][This tech]] has recently allowed co2 to be split far more cheaply and method for doing so have existed far longer but are energy intensive. Though this method produces carbon monoxide as a waste product which requires you have a system for dealing with it [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrochemical_reduction_of_carbon_dioxide][such as using it as the base for the production of hydrocarbons]]. Importantly though a much larger habitat with a lot of vegetation can do most of the work for you, we just don't do this on the ISS because mass is at such a premium.

  There are a huge number of problems, ones intractable with even a near-future extrapolation of today's technology, which would have to be solved in order to have anything resembling a self-sufficient habitat in space.

You are underestimating how many of the difficulties of the ISS come from mass being at a premium, which limits how much infrastructure it can have (and thus how self sufficient it can be) not from a lack of technology. If energy and mass are cheap then you can have all the infrastructure you need in space not too far away.
