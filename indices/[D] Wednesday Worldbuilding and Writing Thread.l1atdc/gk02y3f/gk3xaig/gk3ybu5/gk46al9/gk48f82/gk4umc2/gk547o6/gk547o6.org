  Well yeah it's possible on account of it already existing and being used by the ISS. All you need is chemicals that react to pull co2 out of the air.

The ISS's solutions aren't sustainable, though. The zeolite stuff is cool (really cool!) but only just effective enough even with the use of a gel-based dessicant (which they ship from Earth).

I genuinely think you are wrong about how hard this stuff is. It's one thing to have the ISS operational; it's fine that it requires constant resupply because it's a scientific research station. There are a huge number of problems, ones intractable with even a near-future extrapolation of today's technology, which would have to be solved in order to have anything resembling a self-sufficient habitat in space.
