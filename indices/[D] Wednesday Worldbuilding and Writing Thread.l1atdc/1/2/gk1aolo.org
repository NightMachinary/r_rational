I don't think MAD follows from your scenario. If the reactionless drives are cheap enough, it just takes one person with a bad idea to blow up a planet. MAD works because there are enough people in the decision chain that they're probably not all being omnicidal maniacs at the same time. It's not resistant to a weapon cheap enough for a spree murderer to get their hands on.

Ignoring that, space is an extremely forgiving environment for automated weapon systems. I'd expect combat is just firing salvos of relativistic missiles.

I'd suggest making your FTL device work in some way that's not "real" velocity so there's no kinetic energy. Like the motion equation was actually x + vt + wt all along, this device increases w, the energy transfer is one way, and gravity wells / other FTL devices cancel out your w.
