  there exist extremely cheap sublight drives of alien origin that give near-perfectly-efficient conversion of power to reactionless delta-V up to .1c

What do you mean "up to .1c"? Keep in mind that velocity is relative to a given frame of reference. You can't properly say that a ship is moving at ".1c". Instead, you'd have to say a ship is moving at .1c with respect to your own ship, or planet, or some other point of reference, which means the limit you're talking about is undefined.
