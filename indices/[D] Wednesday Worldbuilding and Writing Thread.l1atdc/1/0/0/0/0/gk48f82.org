Even if I were to grant "simple self replicating machines", which is a morass I don't want to wade into, the notion that most people will be living in space just seems ludicrous to me. We can't even do bubbles on Earth; the reliability problems and the issues of community remain staggeringly harder than merely manufacturing a cylinder. (Also harder than just manufacturing the cylinder: creating and distributing that much soil, air, and water. Soil is complicated, and neither hydroponics nor aeroponics has even a proof of concept to scale up to these scales. Also, carbon exchange is non-trivial; you can't just do it with the food you grow, because the process is net-lossy, so you need some additional kind of carbon-rip-and-sequester tech. But that last one I'll grant as being solvable with just pure tech.)

Also, software is only pure profit if it's fire-and-forget, at which point after about four years you hit the start of the aggressive "doesn't work on my machine" dropoff. Most software shops spend a huge amount of engineering time on maintenance and upkeep, and even so generally it's never enough.
