Including a reactionless drive in this scenario is unnecessary and a bad idea because it violates physics, and if you're including near future tech and assuming some level of space development /then it's %100 unnecessary/.

Most of what you want to know has been though about in great detail and talked about by futurist Isaac Arthur whose videos are great and well researched (my only quibble with him is that I think he underestimates AGI in some ways) and [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIIOUpOge0LuFZG2lvL9-zbxovZabYxcy][this playlist]] on near term human space development will be of great interest for you. [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIIOUpOge0LvpLdGIp4xCyCVZEEUQ1Udn][This playlist]] on futurist weapons is also worthwhile, particularly the videos "Space Warfare" and "Interplanetary Warfare".

Once you've got the staggering abundance of energy and resource that comes from fusion and functioning space infrastructure and industry things become pretty post scarcity for one. You can also expect that a large portion of the population will live in satellites in orbit around a populated planet or on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycler][cyclers]] between planets. This is because the resource abundance and slightly better automation means anyone may well be able to afford to buy/build a rotating O'Neil cylinder with many square miles of living space to live like a king.

You don't even need fusion in this scenario to have abundant energy and interstellar travel, because once you have dumb automated drones mining a planet like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4aXmnQzJ0o&list=PLIIOUpOge0LsIzYlIAIRdAGJTqAW6FmCE&index=11][mercury]] and manufacturing+launching satellites and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statite][statites]] you can quickly begin to benefit from exponential growth in the construction of an early crude Dyson swarm. A crude Dyson swarm is extremely versatile you can:

- Generate powerful stellasers to accelerate relativistic craft to other systems (these craft either only carry fuel to decelerate, or you can use a series of probes which each capture solar energy as it passes by very close to the star and beams it to the probe behind it, until the line of probes slows down enough to stay in the system). Either way you'd probably then have the probes begin constructing a Dyson swarm in the new system so that you can complete an interstellar laser highway between the two systems allowing cheap relativistic travel (this also has the advantage that you can concentrate resources on clearing away space debris only along a /relatively/ narrow route).

- You can also easily collect power from the thin foil statite mirrors in a number of ways, or just bounce the light from them off more distant foil satellites and onto a target (so your space stations can receive full sunlight anywhere in the system). Once you've collected power it can easily be transmitted across the system with lasers, with masers being ideal because they can penetrate the atmosphere and deliver power to simple ground-based collectors.

- Within a system the network of statites and satellite could allow cheap travel and reduce the need for rockets. However in this scenario rockets would also be much cheaper from the energy, resource abundance and more automated manufacturing.

- With such abundant energy one can deploy massive numbers of statites/satellites with powerful electromagnets around your star(s). This allows you to manipulate your stars magnetic field in control the solar wind, preventing (or causing) solar storms and letting you protect the whole system from the radiation of the solar wind. By magnetically directing all of the star's charged solar wind out of the poles you can also collect it /[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzuHxL5FD5U][for energy and resources which dwarf the systems non-star matter]]/.

Conflict under the scenario is firstly not going to be like most sci-fi, because the massive abundance created by space industry would greatly discourage warfare. As the economic cost of war with /any/ other space-developed nation would never be worth any financial upside. Resources in space are simply so abundant that fighting over any particular asteroid doesn't make sense:\\
While stealth in space is possible within very limited contexts any large military offensive would necessarily be obvious for at least hours in advance if not far longer allowing for a devastating counteroffensive. Ignoring fusion engines (because they're all too speculative to properly assess here) for spacecraft such as military craft which want to be independent of the mirror network (so they needn't be low mass with giant sails) [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvZjhWE-3zM][nuclear saltwater rockets]] are likely to be the preferred choice. As they have much higher specific impulse and delta v than chemical rockets and the radioactive plasma they produce spreads out quickly and isn't a concern in space.\\
The equivalent to MAD in this scenario is probably going to be based around lasers just because of their speed. With nations entering into a space race as result of the obvious financial and military benefits of having an exponentially growing network of space infrastructure using crude self replicating machines. Massive stellaser attacks while devastating aren't likely to be an existential threat though especially with people spread out beyond planets, so while any war would be economically catastrophic people at this point nothing is liable to prevent K2 civilization(s) from arising.
