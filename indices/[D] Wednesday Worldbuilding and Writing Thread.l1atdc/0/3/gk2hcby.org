If you're actually looking to tell a story about people applying the techniques of modern physics to investigate magic, then you have to have a pretty specific and detailed ideas of what the magic is like. After all, when we develop mathematical models, they are in fact models that attempt to describe observed phenomena and predict future ones. So the time/effort required to produce a model is gonna be shaped almost entirely by what sort of magical phenomena are being observed/explained.

This seems like a lot of legwork which may not get to the payoff you're looking for, since that level of detail isn't likely to be directly relevant or apparent in any story.

It's also true that whenever something completely novel is discovered, we rarely are so well equipped that we can jump to systematizing our understanding and testing it immediately. We're often barely equipped to begin making measurements and scrambling to build the tools to take better measurements, if we even know what we should be trying to measure.

There's often a long period of non-specialists poking and prodding it, and scientific publications of the form: "Uh, we saw this weird thing that doesn't make sense, here's all the stuff we did to try to make sure it wasn't one of these other things we already understand, here's a bunch of other stuff we tried that totally didn't work or did absolutely nothing, and here's some things we didn't have funding to try but we think it'd be a good idea." It takes a lot of this before we have enough data/equipment/institutional expertise to put together models that have predictive/explanatory power. Though, granted, we've gotten better and faster at this stage of the process, especially with the assistance of computers.

Anyway, how time/expertise/resource intensive all this is will depend on pretty fine details that are not encapsulated in "it should look like standard fantasy-novel-magic from the outside when we're done". Those details are unlikely to be front and center, so you should just try to choose and justify an answer that will serve your story.
