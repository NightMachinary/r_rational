Define realistic.

If you want genuine "this would actually work in the real world" type of 'magic', you could write a story about an ex-machine shop worker who has become a chemical engineering major with minors in electrical engineering and materials science who then gets transported to the Roman Republic circa 220 BC, before the second Punic War. This creates opportunities for a ton of practical 'magic':

- *Gunpowder firearms - 'Magic staves':* The sulfur-free gunpowder recipe would be relatively trivial to produce in large quantities using just urine and potash for a niter bed to get potassium nitrate ('saltpeter'), which would be combined with charcoal. Instead of making primers or using a matchlock and powder pan, several small nickle-iron or lead-acid batteries could be connected in sequence to a wire inlaid inside the firing chamber, with a narrow gap in the middle, creating a high voltage spark when the trigger is pulled. Paper cartridges which have been soaked in saltpeter should ignite readily, and should work well in a breach-loader or revolver-type designs. With a high caliber, this could be used to take down elephants when Hannibal shows up, or break through Roman shield walls if the protagonist works with Hannibal instead.

- *Rockets - 'Fireballs'*: Gunpowder rockets could be made which carry large steel-encased gunpowder charges as the payload; basically large pipe bombs. Bundles of these could be loaded onto a wagon and fired in series like a Katyusha rocket launcher, devastating enemy formations. Alternatively, the rockets could carry narrow-tipped bottles filled with flammable liquid like distilled alcohol, with lit fuel-soaked rags protruding from the ends. Basically, rocket-propelled Molotov cocktails which could be fired into enemy formations or lobbed over walls.

- *Radios - 'Wind whisperers'*: Simple radios could be made with copper wire as an antenna, a quartz crystal as an oscillator, a glass or ceramic vacuum tube as an amplifier, a nickle-iron or lead-acid battery as the power source, and a copper wire coil and magnetized iron as an electromagnet to create a 'click' sound when a signal is received. Morse code could be used to transmit and receive messages over distances of a mile or two. Parabolic dishes raised on towers could be used to extend the communication range, and could also be easily made into signal repeaters to allow a message to travel across the Roman empire instantaneously, day or night, using technology that enemy forces would be unable to intercept. Hot air balloons could be lofted in a battle to create mobile repeater towers with excellent range.
