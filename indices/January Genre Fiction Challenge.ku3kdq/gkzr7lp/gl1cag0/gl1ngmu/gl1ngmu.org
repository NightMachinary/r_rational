Walmart greeter. The more I thought about the logistics of a vampire working at Walmart, the less happy I became with it. So I made the vampire a phlebotomist. But blood donation clinics are only open during the day, and I also couldn't imagine a vampire hunter willingly letting a vampire stab them. By the end I wasn't very near the prompt at all.
