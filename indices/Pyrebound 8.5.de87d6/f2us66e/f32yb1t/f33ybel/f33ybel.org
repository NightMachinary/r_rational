Ensi's initial goal I think was the secretly appoint a successor while he held the pyre hostage unless he got his way and purged the corruption.

Now that his jig is up, it's time to do the same thing in a different setting. I think his goal is some shenanigans with the Enemy. The Enemy has shown itself to be thinking society based entities. We have seen what the humans can do with the Enemy's magic, now to see what the enemy can do with Pyre magic.
