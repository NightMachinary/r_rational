I finished writing up my hypothesis regarding Normal type Pokemon and thought I'd share it. It is strongly dependent on some assumptions made regarding Ki and the intricacies of mental traits in general.

  *What is "Normal"? - Strengths and Weaknesses*

  The so called Normal-type Pokemon, barring a few exceptions, seem to have baseline animal-like bodies with little inherent ability to convert energy into various specialized forms and channel it. In case they do have such abilities of channeling, it is generally not a direct part of their biology or body structure when not in use, thus not giving the related resistances and weaknesses.

  However, there are a few traits inherent to this "Normal" body structure. Namely, a weakness to "Fighting" type attacks and a complete immunity to "Ghost" type mental/empathic assaults.

  Depending on which theoretical explanation of the so called Fighting type one ascribes to, its strength towards Normal types can be explained in two ways:

  If it is just a question of instinct and skill in hand to hand combat then one could stipulate that the Normal's bio-typical body shows the expected weak points susceptible to such well placed strikes and maneuvers to a far greater extent than Pokemon with more "exotic" body structures.

  If one is to lend credibility to the Ki-theory it could be an inherent weakness to Ki-charged attacks, due to as of yet unexplored reasons. Something like an extensive but uncontrolled Ki-network that is missing or differently focused in body structures that evolved to control and convert all kinds of various energy forms maybe.

  Exploring the immunity to Ghost attacks is more tricky, due to the little knowledge we currently have regarding them and the differences between non-physical, also known as "mental", traits in general. Both traditional notions and expert testimonies consider Ghost attacks to target emotions as opposed to mental function. While the difference is not scientifically explainable as of yet I hypothesize that they both access the brain through different means and thus cause different effects on the targets perception.

  Let us hypothesize that the weakness of Normal Pokemon is purely Ki related and subsequently try to combine the two traits into one explanation. If Ki is a different form of non-physical attack delivered by physical touch (akin to Shadow Claw) then the Normal type weakness to it and immunity to Ghost attacks can be considered a mental trait. This would lead us to believe that maybe "Normal" is another purely "mental" type similar to Psychic and Dark and that, if not for the related mental traits, Normal type Pokemon could just as well be considered Untyped.

Edit: Grammar and minor stuff.

*/Footnote:/* The above purely concerns itself with Normal type /Pokemon/ and with Fighting and Ghost type /attacks/. Damaging Normal attacks can be considered almost exclusively as being in the physical realm with "special" attacks of the type being either sound related or essentially untyped energy attacks. Similar but conversely the Ghost type defensively has a large physical component even though Ghost attacks are non-physical. But Ghost Pokemon and their highly paradoxical relation to physical attacks are a subject for a different time.
