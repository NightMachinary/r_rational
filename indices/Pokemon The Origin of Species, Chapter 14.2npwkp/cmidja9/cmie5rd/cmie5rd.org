Thanks, glad you enjoyed it!

As for Red's perspective on Giovanni, there's a fine line between intelligence and rationality. Perhaps it's better to say, different people have varying skills at expressing rationality in compelling and provacative ways.

Certainly Red learned some rational thinking from his parents and the Oaks, but each in a specific sphere of influence, while Giovanni speaks of rationality as an endeavor.
