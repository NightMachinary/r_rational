Thanks, glad you liked it :) I'm using the most diverse/modern incarnation of Kanto to tell the story in, which is HeartGold/SoulSilver's, where there's some overlap between Kanto/Johto pokemon and a rare few from Hoenn and Sinnoh show up, probably due to cross-region travel.

So on [[http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Viridian_Forest][Bulbapedia's page on Viridian Forest]], the chart titled Generation IV has the list I'm basing things off of.
