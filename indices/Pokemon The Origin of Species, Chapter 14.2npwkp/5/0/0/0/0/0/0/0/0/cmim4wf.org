Hmm okay. So then do Ground Pokemon have similar tissue or do they only have their resistances if they have actual ground to bury themselves in for protection? It seems a quality of their biology to be insulated against electrical current. Though I don't know how in a realistic fight a Type can be strong against Fire without also being resistant to it.
