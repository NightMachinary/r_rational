Exactly. That's kind of Red's point in saying that the Type system is silly :) Fire pokemon /are/ incredibly diverse: most within a Type are. The only thing Fire types have in common is that they're beings that can produce or are made of or are resistant to fire (though that last one obviously is shared with other beings for different reasons).

But it's still a biological aspect of them. It's not the SAME aspect, and as a result, a slugma is going to be FAR more vulnerable to, say, rain, than an arcanine is.

So the diversity between two Fire or Bug types is constrained by some inborn traits (what it IS) versus two Flying or Fighting types' capabilities (what they DO). There's obviously some overlap, but the focus is still distinct.

From that perspective, the way Red sees it there's nothing unique to the pokemon society calls "Dragon" at all. It seems to just be a label applied to any incredibly strong and fierce pokemon, with a couple exceptions. And there's even a lot of argument about whether some pokemon like Charizard and Gyarados are dragons or not. They're certainly capable of emitting the unique energy signature identified as "dragon," which might just be a unique kind of fire or plasma, but they don't have the same weaknesses and resistances expected of those considered a "pure" dragon.

The type is one of the least understood and most contradictory. Without our world's game mechanical rules to help everything be clear cut, it's almost impossible to find any inherent similarity between them. "Weak to dragon" is the most unique, but dragons are so powerful that /everything/ non-dragon seems weak to them.
