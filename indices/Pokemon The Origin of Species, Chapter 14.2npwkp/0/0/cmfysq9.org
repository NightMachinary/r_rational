Good chapter. I quite liked the cliffhanger ending and the new pokemon Red now has. Putting up a trap for it is quite a good plan, really. I noted it wasn't a native to FRLG Kanto 'mon, though - are you going to have mons of any region living somewhere depending on whether the environment could support them, or just have this instance happen due to Kanto and Johto being next to one another?
