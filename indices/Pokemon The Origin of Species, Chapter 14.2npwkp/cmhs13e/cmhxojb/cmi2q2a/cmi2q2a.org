Well, on the one hand Dragons are rare enough that it could just be coincidence but on the other hand they seem to have a wide mastery of energy control in varying forms that could be seen as more important to their categorization than just their looks, seeing how many Pokemon look more like dragons without being called such by scholars. Compare Goodra, Altaria and Noivern on the one hand to Aerodactyl, Skarmory and Charizard on the other.

In any case, if descriptive types are a mix of impression and ability then Bug should be right along the other, no? And, according to the Normal as a mental trait hypothesis, that one should be there too. It just happens to coincide with a lot of Pokemon that have no mentionable substance type.
