Its just that if biology is the issue I can't see much in common between, say, an Arcanine or Ninetails and a Slugma or a Magmortar. This goes even more so for Poison Pokemon who seem to have almost nothing in common other than in /some/ way producing one or more substances harmful to most other living creatures. I mean they range from indigestible plants over animals with varying degrees of venom including invertebrates, reptiles and mammas to pollution given life as if extreme chemical reactions had bound endoplasm to themselves.
