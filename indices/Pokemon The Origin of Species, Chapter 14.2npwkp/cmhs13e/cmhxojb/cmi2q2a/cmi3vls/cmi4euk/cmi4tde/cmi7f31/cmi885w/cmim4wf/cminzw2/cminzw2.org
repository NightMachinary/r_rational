Yes, most Ground pokemon aren't actually immune to electricity biologically, so much as they're very capable of evading or grounding it as long as they're on earth. Though this might just be something that Red is wrong about, since some ground pokemon like Cubone are not at all Substance, while others like Golett are actually made of earth/clay.
