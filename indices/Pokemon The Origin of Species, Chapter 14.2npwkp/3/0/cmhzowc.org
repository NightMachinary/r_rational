I was going through this line by line and basically saying "bingo" and "spot on," so I decided to just scrap that and respond to the overall thing.

This is a pretty solid explanation of what I've worked out. In addition, there's some data to indicate that fighting pokemon can "see" life energy or "ki," which explains why they are especially effective against Rock and Steel pokemon that would presumably have defense to their strikes: they can detect the pokemon's weak points, and the force of their strikes at just the right place cause internal damage from the resonance, compounded more than it is with most other body types because of how hard the skin their organs are bouncing around in is.

The relationship between Ki and ghosts is also pretty important, as Ghosts are utterly immune to it. It's hypothesized to be a level beyond the simple physical/mental divide, and of course many consider it "spiritual," but there does seem to be a straightforward physical connection at times.
