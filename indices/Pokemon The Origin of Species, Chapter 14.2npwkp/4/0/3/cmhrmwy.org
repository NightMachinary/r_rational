I've got more questions. Am I right to assume that most Normal type Pokemon with several evolutions are sexually mature in all forms? If yes, how typical is it for, say, a Rattata for instance to evolve into a Ratikate and how and why does that happen? Why as in what stimuli caused it to do so, not as in why did evolution chose such weird paths. Also, am I correct to assume that Ratikates lay Rattata eggs, just like in canon?

The reason I ask is cases like Bidoof/Bibarel. Seeing how the young are less water capable and, according to [[http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Bidoof_%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29#Biology][Bulbapedia]], nest in large groups near water instead of building dams like their evolved forms, I was curious if that means they are kind of separate to their parents or if Bidoof have their own young and colonies while Bibarel lay their eggs/bring their young into said colonies.
