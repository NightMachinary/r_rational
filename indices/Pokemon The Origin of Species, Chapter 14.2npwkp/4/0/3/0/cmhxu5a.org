Good question, because that's another area I'm rewriting from the canon: the whole concept of pokemon eggs is pure game mechanic ("Where did this egg come from? It just appeared when these two pokemon made smoochy-faces at eachother! How strange!") meant to preserve the innocence of children, and perhaps help sidestep any messy biological questions the audience might have.

Since I have no intention of making, say, a wailord able to crossbreed with a skitty, I'm going to be scrapping and reconstructing the way reproduction is represented in the games and cartoon for one that more closely mirrors our world's, if not completely.

All that said, young evolutions of pokemon are not sexually mature.
