The fewest Pokemon can accurately be considered mammals for any reason other than them being similar to real world animals that don't exist in the Pokemon world. Fur=/=mammal and only a handful have even remotely visible mammaries. And even in our world there are a few egg laying mammals, so not even that is necessarily a problem.
