Most non-mammal pokemon are egg layers, as in life. I'm not sure if there are any mammals that make more sense as egg layers or not.

In general, and for pokemon that need special circumstances, that's also being rewritten a bit. For example, no pokemon need to be "traded" to evolve. Some realistic equivalent might be appropriate on a case-by-case basis, but things that are too clearly game mechanics are being scrapped.
