I actually wrote a piece that kept Pokémon reproduction more or less in line with game mechanics, that boiled down to all Pokémon being essentially clones of their mother that were spawned in the womb and were incubated in an epigentic-vomit egg from their "fathers". It was a lot more gross than just two Biberals having sex, that's for sure. I understood why the Daycare man left it vague after that.
