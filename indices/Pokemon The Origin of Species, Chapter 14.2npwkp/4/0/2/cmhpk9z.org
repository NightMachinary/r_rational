Why greatly? I get that it won't be exactly 50% as in the games but won't it be roughly around there in your story too? Especially if resistances vary from species to species I assume that Blue is not comparable to the darkest of the dark Pokemon. So if Red is not Psychic and the attack actually is that strong then he was still risking to blast his friend with a medium sized mental/emotional attack, no? And because according to Agatha the attack seems relatively Ghost-like and Red was tested negative for Psychic traits that risk isn't even so negligible.
