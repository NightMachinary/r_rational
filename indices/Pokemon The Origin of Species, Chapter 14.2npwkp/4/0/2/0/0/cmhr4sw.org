I guess I should post only here instead of simultaneously asking on FFnet. That way everyone interested can follow us and we don't have to check both all the time. Please keep my FFnet pseudonym private though.

  Anyway, what you said makes sense on some level, but not completely. Because it seems that according to your hypothesis even high functioning Pokemon like many Psychic, Fighting, Dragon and other type Pokemon don't normally feel fear or sadness without being under direct empathic attacks of the Ghost type? But all the normal mammals an birds do? As long as they aren't strongly elemental or such? Also, what about "Physical" Ghost attacks. The way you described Shadow Claw it was my understanding that it is a visible ghostly extension or apparition that directly strikes at the mind/spirit/endoplasmic empathy network/whathaveyou and causes anguish and/or pain. Is that not how it works? And if it is, are "Normal" humans immune to these attacks? How do they experience them, if at all, if that is the case?

  Regarding damaging mental attacks in general, the straight forward type at least, I thought they often cause a dimming of mental acuity or the senses in general, having a similar effect on fighting as a distracting wound and such would have. Confusion in particular then would a) slightly diminish your awareness of reality (by 50 points :p) and b) sometimes leave a lingering effect of confusion that causes you to hurt yourself for whatever reasons (mishaps, self-harm, other).
