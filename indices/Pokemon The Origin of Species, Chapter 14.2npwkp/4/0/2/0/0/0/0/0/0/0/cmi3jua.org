Sort of. Remember that there's nothing inherently "rock" about a rock-type attack. The reason rock attacks are strong against flying, bug, ice, and fire types has to do specifically with what rocks are. So insofar as a body made of rock does more damage or is harder to stop than not (fire is weak to it for example because it can't just burn away the attack like it can plant attacks or a normal type trying to body slam them), the body slam will be "rock type."
