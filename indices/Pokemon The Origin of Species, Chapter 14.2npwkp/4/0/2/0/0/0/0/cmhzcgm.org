No direct spoilers for now, but confirmation/denial would be cool. Or maybe even just confirmation/denial regarding how much sense my hypotheses make to an experienced trainer/scientist within your Pokeworld and what direct and easy rebuttals would be that don't need prior experiments on their part first.

I didn't even know that you had the whole type system already worked out in the background. Has anyone looked at it besides you? If not, you could always show me an incomplete picture containing the stuff you aren't a 100% sure on per PM or something.

But what I really look forward to is your explanation of the Bug type and weird things like the differences between a Bug attack like X-Scissor used by a non-bug and physical Normal/Flying attacks used by bugs. The fact that they interact with all mental types makes me think of Bug being another one. Or is this one of the examples of gross misinterpretation and oversimplification by oldschool trainers and the traditional Poke-academia?

Lastly, what do you think of the Normal hypothesis I posted? Is that something that would intrigue Red if he were to stumble over it?
