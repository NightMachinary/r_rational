Then many attacks, especially physical Normal attacks, essentially mirror the Type of the user instead of having their own? Bodyslam for example becomes at least partially a Rock attack when used by a Pokemon made of rock? Insects using Cut cause just as much distress to Psychics as using Bug Bite? Attackypes in general only stay the same as in the games if the attack itself has the relevant substance trait? Just making sure I understand the streamlined rules of your world.
