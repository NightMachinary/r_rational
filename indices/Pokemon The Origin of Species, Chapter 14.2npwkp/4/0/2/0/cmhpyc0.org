The answer to this requires going a bit into the mechanics of how I envision "damage" working realistically compared to the games.

So since there's obviously no "health bar" to judge all attacks by, physical, mental, emotional, etc, the damage they do is based on their effects. The reason a mental attack is an attack is because it causes mental distress: it's kind of like a status condition more than an actual attack, most of the time, with the status conditions being things like "go catatonic with fear" or "become hyper-sensitive to stimulus."

So the attack "Confusion" in the game does damage and has a chance of causing the status condition "Confused," which might give you a chance of hurting yourself further. But in the "real world," the two things are one and the same: a "Confusion" attack causes you to hurt yourself due to temporary mental impairment. Other attacks that cause confusion are similar.

Same with Ghost attacks. Most don't inflict status conditions, but the "damage" they do are the result of the effects they have. A pokemon or person can be defeated by crippling emotional anguish just as much as excessive physical trauma, and any physical damage they sustain in the meantime is secondary to that.

So all that said, a "Dark human" will experience a Ghost attack as roughly half the "effect," and thus far less permanent. Since the effects are largely emotional manipulation, an attack that might normally make its victim filled with mindless terror would just make a Dark pokemon or human scared for awhile. The trauma associated would be negligible, since people feel normal levels of fear all the time without it being scarring.

Does that make sense?
