Whoops. I missed that your two replies were slightly different. On FFnet you wrote

  So all that said, a "Normal human" will experience a Ghost attack as basically harmless. Since the effects are largely emotional manipulation, a Ghost attack might still make them very afraid or depressed, but the trauma associated would be negligible, since people feel normal levels of fear and sadness all the time without it being scarring.

while on here you wrote

  So all that said, a "Dark human" will experience a Ghost attack as roughly half the "effect," and thus far less permanent. Since the effects are largely emotional manipulation, an attack that might normally make its victim filled with mindless terror would just make a Dark pokemon or human scared for awhile. The trauma associated would be negligible, since people feel normal levels of fear all the time without it being scarring.

This makes me wonder why Dark humans are more affected by Ghost attacks than baseline humans. Especially if it has to do with the supposedly normal levels of fear humans (and Normal Pokemon?) experience all the time. It also makes it weird that Psychic humans, who I assume are not exceptionally more fearless and happy, are so much more susceptible to Psychic attacks.
