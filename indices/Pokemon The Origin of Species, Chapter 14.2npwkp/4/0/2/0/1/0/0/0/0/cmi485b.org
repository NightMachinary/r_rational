It seems to me that in your world the difference between resistance and outright immunity is rather muddled. Are Pokemon of some types actually /immune/ to anything or is it just varying degrees of resistance?

Regarding the substance based Pokemon, maybe it interferes with whatever weird mechanism that allows them to mentally manipulate their substance in the first place. Clearly most of those Pokemon can use attacks that use more energy than can possibly be stored by purely biological means. Fire Pokemon often have non-stop open flames that can be expanded to whole firestorms, Water displays forms of Hydrokinesis that seems to go beyond just high pressure water expulsion from an orifice, Grass can accelerate the growth of its symbiotic plant parts fast enough to be methods of attack, not to mention some of the nutrient draining techniques and other special category attacks, Electric can store vast amounts of power and direct the flow of electricity, Ice can inexplicably lower temperatures in the environment and expel and control frozen water and Dragons seem to be able to learn most of the above to varying degrees.

The odd ones are the physical types that don't have to resort to "supernatural" control of laws of nature. Those being Flying (though mostly either immune or coupled to another type), Poison, Ground, Bug and Steel.

The rest are types with a known (or in case of Normal hypothesized by me) mental component.
