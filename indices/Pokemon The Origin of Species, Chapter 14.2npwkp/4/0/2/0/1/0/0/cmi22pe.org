That of course calls into question both why Normal/X Pokemon or even just Normal Pokemon that have learned untyped energy attacks like Hyberbeam aren't affected and why non-energy-converting Pokemon like most Rock, many Ground, mundane Bug and maybe even some Grass and Water Pokemon are affected just as much as all the high energy Pokemon, including being more affected than Dark types (though those may just have inherent resistances that on the one hand are more spread out than the Normal immunity and on the other hand are just as susceptible to Ki).
