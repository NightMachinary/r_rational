Hyperbeam isn't actually an energy-beam in my world: it follows most other "special" Normal attacks in being a concentrated sound wave.

As for why the substance-based types are affected, that's a bit harder to pin down. The thing I keep circling back to in my head is to stop thinking of it as "damage" and more as an "effect." So the types are classified because of observations of effects, not because anyone can actually quantify how affected non-Normal types are compared to Normal types: they just note that Dark and Normal types seem /less hampered/ and /less hurt/ by ghost attacks than other types. And since there are no "bug people" or "rock people," there's no one they can ask "What does a ghost attack feel like to you?" to see why they're affected more than "normal" people.
