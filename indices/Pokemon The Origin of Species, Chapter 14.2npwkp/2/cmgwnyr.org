Red's looking very eleven here. Entitled, self-centered, a bit unempathetic, that's a kid alright. Reminds me of why I hate children, which is arguably a good thing. He should be careful about thinking things like "I'd never do something like that." He's tempting the universe to dump him into a situation that forces the issue. It's easy for the utilitarian calculation to be one-sided...

I like that the Dark thing is throwing Red for a loop. The universe is not giving up its secrets as easily as I initially feared, and Red will likely see all sorts of edge cases that just don't make sense. Have fun with that, professor. Now, how large a pot do you need to cook a three foot lobster built like a tree stump?

With no mention of thunder, it seems the lightning is at least four kilometers away. Far enough away that our heroes are not in immediate danger, but close enough that they could be dealing with some minor threat one minute, and be at the heart of it all the next. Zapdos garners much respect, and I'm excited to see what it actually /does/.
