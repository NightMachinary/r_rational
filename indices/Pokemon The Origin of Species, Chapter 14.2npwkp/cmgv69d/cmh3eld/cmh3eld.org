Right, he won't test it on his Rattata for the same reason he won't test it on, say, Leaf: if it IS a psychic attack, then it's an enormously strong one, relative to its species: strong enough to give him a bit of mental scarring. So he doesn't want to do it to Leaf or his rattata and risk harming them.

If it's a Ghost one though, then it MIGHT be enormously strong too, but Blue's Darkness will greatly weaken it. Alternatively, it's NOT enormously strong, and the only reason Red had such a strong reaction was that he is latently psychic.

Does that make sense?
