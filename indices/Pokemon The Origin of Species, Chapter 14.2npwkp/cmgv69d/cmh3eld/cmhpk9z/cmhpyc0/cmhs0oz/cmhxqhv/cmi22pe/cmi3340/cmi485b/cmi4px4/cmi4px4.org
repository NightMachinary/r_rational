Very muddled indeed: I imagine that if the game didn't try to oversimplify things so much, it would be the same there. Should BOTH rock AND steel take exactly 2x damage from fighting? Are Ground pokemon really as untouched by a lightning bolt as flying are to an earthquake? Immunities exist where they make sense as emergent properties (which really, in this case is just the flying/ground thing and maybe steel/poison): everything else is varying resistance.

Right, I strongly considered having the ghosts just mess with their biology in a way that made their powers unstable and hurt themselves, but as you say the substance ones mess it up. It would be easier if we just imagine that Rock and Steel types can actually control gravity and magnetism or something similar, but bug and ground are still a problem, and those solutions set off a whole new set of issues.
