Ghost doesn't need to make the powers themselves unstable. That wouldn't really fit with the flavor anyway. Instead it uses the control and source of those excessive energy reserves as a catalyst to get to the targets mind or emotions or what have you. Which works because, seeing how little sense it makes when you consider conventional physics, these mechanisms probably presides in the same category of physical phenomena as the so known "mental" attacks.

I even had a second hypothesis in mind regarding this that doesn't perfectly align with my "Normal is a mental trait" hypothesis.

To make it short, what if most of the Pokemon superpowers come from the manipulation of an as of yet non-detectable substance. Something that is often called/mistaken as a spirit energy, but that I'll just call endoplasm. So this endoplasm is what either gets drawn from (or allows the user to draw from some larger source) whenever Pokemon seemingly defy conservation of energy. Endoplasm interacts directly with the mind in a subconscious way that is closely tied to emotions. One could even consider that endoplasm partially holds the mind itself, thus giving credibility to those that believe in souls and such.

Then we have ectoplasm. Either it is a form of entoplasm that for inexplicable reasons is visible and slightly interacts with the physical world (though it is still mostly intangible to touch) /and/ doesn't require a body as a vessel or it is just another unexplored substance. In any case it is mostly dark purple of color and can have strong interactions with other creatures endoplasm, creating pain, emotional anguish and some times a loss of control of related control of the manipulation of "conventional" laws of physics.

"Psychic" powers are carried by a different medium that move in the mental realm but to a different effect. They are however closely tied to endoplasm, which is the go to mediator between biological entities and this unexplored dimension. Therefore Psychic types are especially susceptible to Ghost attacks, just like Ghost type Pokemon who are essentially made almost entirely of ectoplasm.

Dark types emit a "Dark" field that strongly disrupts Psychic effects and to a lesser extent prevents ecto on endo interactions.

The Bug type also plays into this in a very complicated fashion I as of yet don't know how exactly to integrate. They probably have their own medium similar but distinct from endoplasm. Maybe an older evolutionary path that allows more minor mental effects and abilities but has a distinct interaction to the other established mental Types.

And yes, this hypothesis argues that Normal Pokemon and humans essentially don't have souls.
