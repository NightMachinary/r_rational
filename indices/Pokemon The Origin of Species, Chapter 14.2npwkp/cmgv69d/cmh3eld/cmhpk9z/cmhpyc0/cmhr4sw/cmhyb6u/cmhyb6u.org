For the first part, see the other answer about how ghosts use a being's power against them first. After that:

  Also, what about "Physical" Ghost attacks. The way you described Shadow Claw it was my understanding that it is a visible ghostly extension or apparition that directly strikes at the mind/spirit/endoplasmic empathy network/whathaveyou and causes anguish and/or pain. Is that not how it works? And if it is, are "Normal" humans immune to these attacks? How do they experience them, if at all, if that is the case?

This is something that's going to require major spoilers to explain about the nature of the pokemon world. It's not an exaggeration to say that my entire concept for this story and how to rationally explain how pokemon work came from asking myself these exact questions about how ghost/psychic/dark types, more than any of the others, interact, and how that might make sense.

If you're okay with spoilers, I'd be happy to check through the logic with you. If you'd rather wait to have it explained, or want me to just confirm/deny whether what you say coincides with what I thought of, that works too :)

  Regarding damaging mental attacks in general, the straight forward type at least, I thought they often cause a dimming of mental acuity or the senses in general, having a similar effect on fighting as a distracting wound and such would have. Confusion in particular then would a) slightly diminish your awareness of reality (by 50 points :p) and b) sometimes leave a lingering effect of confusion that causes you to hurt yourself for whatever reasons (mishaps, self-harm, other).

This is pretty accurate, yeah, though psychic attacks could do things that normal "distractions" of physical wounds wouldn't.
