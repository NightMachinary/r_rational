Responded to the Normal hypothesis :) I have a lot of the details for the interactions mapped out, but there is room for shifting as various things don't all fit together exactly right, and I'd be happy to run those things by you.

The *physical* bug attacks like X-Scissor being used by non-bugs is pretty much a game mechanic. Even if a TM could alter the molecular composition of a non-bug's claws to be buglike, there's nothing inherently offensive about bug-claws to plants and psychics and whatnot, and everything that resists Normal attacks for physical reasons resists Bug attacks too, which leads researchers to pin the distinction on the organisms themselves.
