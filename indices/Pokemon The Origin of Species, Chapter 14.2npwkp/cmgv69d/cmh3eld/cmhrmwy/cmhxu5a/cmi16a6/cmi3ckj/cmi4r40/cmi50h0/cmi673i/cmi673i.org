Damn you're right. Though I don't even know where Ghosts come from at all in your version. Neither do I want it spoiled out of story as that discovery will probably be an interesting event for Red. But I did just write another hypothesis that heavily focuses on Ghost Pokemon and what they are, physically speaking.
