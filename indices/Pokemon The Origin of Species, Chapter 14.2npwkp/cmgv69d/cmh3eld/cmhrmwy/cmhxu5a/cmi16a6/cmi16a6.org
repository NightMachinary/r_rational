Are you rewriting only the illogical crossover part or also the egg laying part? Because I always saw Pokemon as egg layers. And I always thought they would copulate on the farm while you were elsewhere.

Regarding maturity, is that just in general or all across the board? Pokemon that need special circumstances to evolve, Pokemon that represent a different type of animal than their pre-evolution and Pokemon that drastically change type during evolution come to mind. Also, this would require extensive rewrites of canon biology in some cases. See Bidoof/Bibarel. Or, more extreme, Magikarp/Gyarados/whatever Mega Gyarados is supposed to be.
