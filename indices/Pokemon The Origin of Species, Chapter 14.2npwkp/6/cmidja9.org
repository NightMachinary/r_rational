Another great chapter. I love your protagonists and their dynamics. Liked the new things we learned about Leaf in this chapter. Really enjoyed the last scene, liked the use of the webs to capture pokemon (and its nice to see Red, Blue and Leaf getting along again after the fight as a result of their shared enthusiasm for capturing pokemon).

Red's thought about Giovanni's "unique way of rationally looking at the world" struck me as a little strange, as he seems to have grown up surrounded by so many competent and highly intelligent people (Oak, his dad, with whom he had that interesting conversation about risks, his mom, Daisy).
