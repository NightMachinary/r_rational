This is a romance story about a WW2 deserter and a high-status vampire; there's (hopefully) very thorough and detailed worldbuilding in this story, and don't worry, there's not a quivering member to be seen.

--------------

This chapter has a lot of plot advancement on both the "vampires are weird" front and the "romance" front, which is part of the reason it took so much longer to edit.

The next interlude will be published in a week, and we hope to keep to the release schedule with the next chapter as I don't think it will need as much revision as this one did (due to the content of this chapter, we really wanted to do our best to make it perfect).

Thanks to ElizabethRobinThales's advice, the grammar in the quotation marks should all be correct now!

And a bit of background to one of the scenes in case anyone is curious, the small Australian town that they talk about is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalgoorlie][Kalgoorlie]], which had recently undergone population growth due to a gold rush.
