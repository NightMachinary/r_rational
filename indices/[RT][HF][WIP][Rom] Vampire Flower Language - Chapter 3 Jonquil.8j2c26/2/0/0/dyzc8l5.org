Regarding the consent stuff, it is kind of weird that an ancient vampire is more progressive on this count than pretty much all of humanity of that age. And that despite there being the additional factor of vampires not valuing human lives all that much, let alone their opinions. Is William already falling for Red that hard or is he just exceptionally and excentricly scrupulous when it comes to his personal love life? I guess no strings attached equality is so rare among vampires that the honesty and fairness may well be the appeal, what with Red seeing William as "merely" a rich new employer as opposed to an Australian vampire king.
