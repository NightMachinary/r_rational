  This was perhaps the best written chapter yet.

Thank you so much! It's really improved our writing to post on here and get feedback, so I am glad it's shining through.

  Red is slowly peering behind the masquerade.. everything leading upto the moment of unveiling.

  I also liked how you guys addressed the power dynamics of the relationship. I was a little worried about that in the beginning of the story, but it looks like this has been anticipated.

It was a really hard line to walk because on one hand we wanted to do the trope of having "boss/employee" romance because, well, it's a trope for a reason; but on the other hand we didn't want the relationship to be creepy and exploitative even though as a "rich vampire" and "poor human" it kind of is, by definition; and on the gripping hand we didn't want it to devolve into a seminar where the characters talk to the camera about the Importance of Enthusiastic Consent.

We're indebted to [[/u/mistyfoot]] who responded to a request I made about a year ago on another subreddit for someone to proofread excerpts to help flag where the consent problems are, and her feedback turned the story into more of the "seminar" category, and then some more edits over the past few months chiselled away the less realistic parts and smoothed it out to something that hopefully balances on that fulcrum.

  The romance was spot on too.

Thanks! That means a lot.

  I'd love to see Red gradually in a position of power and see how he progresses with the society.

We have a three novel arc planned that, at this rate, will probably take about 10 years to write, but that sort of thing is on the radar.
