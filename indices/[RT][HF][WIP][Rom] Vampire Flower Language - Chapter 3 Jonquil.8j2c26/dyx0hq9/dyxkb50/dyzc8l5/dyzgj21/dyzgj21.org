  it is kind of weird that an ancient vampire is more progressive on this count than pretty much all of humanity of that age

This is something we wanted to keep in mind too, so the logic behind that is twofold:

- The main reason (William thinks) having a human lover will be impressive / trendy is how hard it is to woo a human: they need /so much/ of your time. At least if you're going to do it without using your mind control powers. And it's not impressive to have a human who is in love with you because you mind controlled them into it, not like it is to have had the time, energy, patience etc for the wooing process. Especially a vampire like William, who is not known for his patience with humans, having a human lover could signal a lot. Before the opera, though, having a human lover signalled that you have your priorities wrong (think of it like having a max level WoW character or something). William's hoping that the opera will change that and he can be at the forefront of the new trend.

- William hasn't been entirely golden here. He made an advance on Red, told him to go away and think about it but didn't give him any of the "you don't need to work for me" speech until after Red had already decided to continue the relationship. The whole "unbecoming of a gentleman" routine on the second night could be construed as manipulative or sincere depending on your preference.

- Also, William is somewhat predisposed to be progressive in general, due to a combination of past experiences and caring about gentlemanly conduct.

Hope that helps clarify it, from a Watsonian perspective. From a Doylist perspective, yeah, we wanted to keep it as consensual and progressive as we could because we're writing this in 2018, and I think we balanced it with the "this is set in 1944, and women have only been able to vote in the USA since the year Red was born" aspect as best we could.

EDIT: Also, don't forget that what William is doing right now is, to him, about as much commitment as when you go to the pound and sit there for about half an hour and see which dog comes up to you wagging its tail. He doesn't want to adopt a puppy that's cowering in the corner; he wants to adopt one that's excited to see him.
