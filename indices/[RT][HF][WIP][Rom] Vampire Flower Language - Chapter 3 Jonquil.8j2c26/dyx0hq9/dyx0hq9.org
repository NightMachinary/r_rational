This was perhaps the best written chapter yet. Red is slowly peering behind the masquerade.. everything leading upto the moment of unveiling. I loved the little glimpses of the vampire society like that vampire watching him eat like that.

I also liked how you guys addressed the power dynamics of the relationship. I was a little worried about that in the beginning of the story, but it looks like this has been anticipated. The romance was spot on too.

I'd love to see Red gradually in a position of power and see how he progresses with the society. Looking forward to the chapters.
