You did catch the scene where William purchased Red from that other vampire in between all the kissing, right? ;)

As I said in last month's thread, this is a romance story but the background vampire politics and magical rules have been thought about carefully.

This chapter is probably as "kissy-ey" as it gets for the most part, so if what you are trying to say is that you are worried about this being "a kissing book", you're through the "worst" of it. Though there's still going to be a lot of focus on how they relate to each other, since that is what this is about.
