|We have a Chee doing violence to the Howlers

My reading of the last interlude was that there is some sort of refresh cycle among the Chee every ~0.7 seconds, whose function includes deleting Chee-minds as a last resort against protocol violations, including "thought-crime". This happened to Erek and the other Chee. But if the actions take less than 0.7 seconds, you just might be able to do the job.

|"something to do with why they never use Rachel's name"

Also, I remember something in the first interlude about how the Ellimist and Crayak had incomplete models of reality where surprises still happened, and Rachel was one such surprise. So far we have zero evidence that the Ellimist communicates his plans to the Chee, but it is still possible that these are related.
