This may be my favorite chapter so far. The entire scene with everyone getting into everyone else's head was brilliant, beautiful, disturbing, and poignant. Somehow, it gave me the same emotions I felt reading the original series when I was a kid, when I was invested enough into the characters that they felt like friends.

The part where Rachel is talking to the morph of Marco - it was very indirect, and I'm still not /quite/ sure what it was about, but does Marco have a crush on Jake? I couldn't see another way to read that.
