Less so with Garrett and Tobias---remember we've seen hints that Tobias researched stimming and taught Garrett about it (e.g. with the shoe tying). I'm very much thinking of Tobias and Garrett as extremely close brothers rather than anything that would stretch into romance, and the specialized hug-ritual was a thing that emerged from that.

That being said, as Aretii points out, I can't control what people will and won't do with their own interpretations. =P
