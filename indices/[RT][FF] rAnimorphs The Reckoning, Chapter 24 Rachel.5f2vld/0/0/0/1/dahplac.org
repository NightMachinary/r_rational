  Poor, poor Marco. It's rather more than just a crush.

Yes, "crush" was a bit of an understatement. I thought the passage in the chapter was a spot-on description of what it's like to be /desperately in love/ with your straight friend. I've been there before.

  There's Marco's distress when Jake goes comatose
#+end_quote

Well, I didn't quite take it that way. That seems like a normal reaction when your best friend goes comatose.

Aretii is right, I totally ship Jake and Marco. But that doesn't seem likely to happen. At the very least, I just want Jake to sit down with Marco in the next chapter and tell him that everything is OK, and that he loves Marco, even if it's not the same way.

I'm also getting that vibe from Garrett and Tobias. Especially in this chapter, when Tobias is hugging Garrett and "the fingers of his remaining hand [are] dancing in a complex pattern across Garrett's back."
