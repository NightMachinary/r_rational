I should clarify: I didn't pick up on Marco's feelings for Jake until this chapter (although on rereading a few things they do make more sense now). I don't recall if Jake/Cassie had been spelled out in this or I just remember it from canon.

I meant that "Rachel doesn't have romantic feelings for Cassie, only Jake does" was clear to me from this chapter.
