So first and foremost, holy crap this chapter was amazing.

Marco's crush was subtle but made a lot of sense when revealed. I didn't catch that being his reason for morphing Jake initially, to see if he felt the same.

I also really like Rachel's kinship to Tom in this. Tom feels like a great character to explore who didn't get much exploration in canon. Tom was someone that Jake looked up to. And he's Rachel's cousin. And considering how Rachel and Tom's relationship in canon played out, I'm really excited to see them work and fight together as opposed to against one another.

Also, this hasn't been brought up yet, but I'm fairly certain David is David from canon. David's father in canon was NSA, which fits with his father being DHS this time around. Especially with the Animorphs moving towards recruitment at the same time as recovering the Blue Box, it seems all too likely. Granted, this David is a bit younger, but the prospect of a rational David rogue stress testing the Animorphs recruitment methods with all of the changes from canon is terrifying. I think one of David's biggest strengths as a character from canon was having a truly unrestrained/ possibly sociopathic approach to the morphing power. And gives yet another, "The world isn't split into Good people and Death Eaters" slant to this.

And since I know feedback is welcome, I got a little lost when Rachel went from remembering Marco's memories to opening Jake's memories. All of the other morphs had enough distinction that I knew there was a transition going on in my opinion. I don't know if this was just my reading comprehension, since I was able to see the distinction more clearly when I re read that part, but figured I'd put it out there.

I am, as always, blown away. Not only do you write multiple voices well, you also write a single voice experiences multiple voices well!
