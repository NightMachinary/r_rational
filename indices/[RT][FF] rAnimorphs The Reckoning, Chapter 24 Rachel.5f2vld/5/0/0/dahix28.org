Yes, and this Rachel's ability to view the battle and beyond it, the war, and in so doing recognize the flaw in carrying out missions for missions' sake (that would have strongly contributed to the gradual PTSD buildup /in/ canon) felt like a deliberate dig at canon. This Rachel is able to anticipate the path her canon predecessor may have gone down.

I think the author does a good job of showing that's due to a large amount of strong trauma hitting her earlier than her canon counterpart, though, and her core principle being her ability to bear and work through difficulties and trials, exactly the skills needed to get through that, rather than this Rachel being a Mary Sue like figure.
