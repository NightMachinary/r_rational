Really good chapter. Additionally, it is /so refreshing/ to see an author willing to a) sympathize with, even to an extent and b) give competence to Rachel. Even canon started to twist her character unrealistically away from her original guiding principles. This, of course, with everyone having an intelligence (or rationality) upgrade is slightly different, but the character holds true to what drives and steers her, only changing as she comes across more - or different - information, which she does not dismiss offhand. I always thought Rachel, canonical or otherwise, was a character with a lot of potential beyond being used as a tool or a weapon and it's nice to see someone sharing that view.

That's quite the cliffhanger to leave it on, also!
