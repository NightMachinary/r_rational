  ---impatience---

  ---frustration---

  ---bitterness---

  Not my fault you were hoping for a rubber stamp, I thought, even as a more honest part of me noted that I wasn't being fair, that I was jumping to conclusions---that once again, I was looking for reasons to be angry---

I love this. It's exactly how it feels to be genre-savvy enough to know you have an unmet emotional need, while still not being emotionally/logistically prepared to deal with it. Most of the /words/ in my head are usually kind, equinamitous, reasonable, and present healthy emotional policies - insofar as I fall short of enacting them, it's because of my feelings leaning out and casting judgement on those words.
