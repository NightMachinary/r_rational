Some amazing character development for Rachel. It's been discussed previously that the Chee never refer to Rachel by name, so what's really going on here? This is like she's got a TARDIS perception filter or something? Does it work only on the Chee?

When they morphed Ax, did they end up morphing Temrash too?
