Yeah. From the authorial perspective, this is probably a significant chunk of why I've struggled with the last few chapters. There are things in the offing that will shake up the plot, but in the meantime we're definitely in a dip. Partly it's been fun to explore /that/---to show the characters lost and confused and uncertain---but after a chapter or two that gets old.

My hope is that this will be the low point of the action, and that things will ramp up and accelerate as dominoes start to fall. In part, I expect the story to become more zombie-apocalypse-like, in the sense that we follow a small group through a large, complex world, and start to lose track of everything that's happening in that larger world as the small group struggles to survive and have an impact.

Also, I didn't mean to come across as ungrateful. I just apparently have a CouteauBleu addiction that's almost as bad as some people's r!Animorphs addiction. =) Hearts, stars, and horseshoes.
