- I have noticed that Marco is gay.

- I have noticed that Rachel is interesting and developed.

- I have noticed that the Chee love dogs, just as they did in canon.

- Also, something about Rachel being some weird cosmic blind spot?

Edit - There, I COMMENTED ON THINGS! WHICH IS GREAT! AND I AM DOING SO OF MY OWN FREE WILL. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO MOUNT A RESCUE MISSION AT THE FOLLOWING COORDINATES...

Seriously though, the mind-merge thing and its implications were nice. I think the problem the story is running into is that as the Animorphs get more breathing room and people involved, their most rational decisions also become the most boring ones. It's like how Superman stories never feature him constantly moving satellites into space and donating the money to charities: Superman's psychology aside, no one is interested about Superman having a boring but efficient job.

So as the military gets involved, the story moves from "we must blow up the yeerk pool as soon as possible or the aliens will win!" to "maybe we should give all our resources to the military and let them handle the invasion; it's not like they've never been involved in guerilla warfare before". So I'd expect the protagonists to either ignore or delay that option like they have so far (because they don't trust the military, because they don't want all hope for survival to be concentrated in one institution, etc), or to be cut off from help (because the government is compromised, or has incompatible goals, etc).

Otherwise, the story could move from them towards alien warlords, gods and presidents; or become about the Animorphs creating and maintaining a broader resistance, and struggling with the problems that come when you give superpowers to a large number of individual with their own goals and agendas.
