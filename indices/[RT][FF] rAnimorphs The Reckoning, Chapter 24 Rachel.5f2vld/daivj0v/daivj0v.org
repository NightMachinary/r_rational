I found the mind-melding scene incredibly moving.

This chapter really helped flesh out my perception of the character of Rachel. I love how you're taking each of the Animorphs and have found an interesting reinterpretation of their character which is loyal to their canon traits, but is giving an example of competence and intelligence in different, flawed but complementary, ways.
