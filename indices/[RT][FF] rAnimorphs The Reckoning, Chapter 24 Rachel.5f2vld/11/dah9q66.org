I feel like the stay comment about the few remaining Pemalites, one of whom being still conscious, did more to 'humanize' them for me than the books ever did - I think the closest look we got at the Pemalites directly in canon was via their sunken spaceship in the book where the Chee all freeze and Rachel and Tobias catch a squid to fix things, and that was pretty much played for laughs until Drode showed up. And the Chee still feel like they're holding back as they describe that, even disregarding the stinger at the end of the chapter. Good going, dudes.

Dang it's tough knowing other people. I'm not sure I'm comfortable talking very much about the morphing each other/Cassie being dead thing but it feels real to me.
