I wonder how much of the "took to be used" characterization comes from the end of the series when the kids are all battle hardened by PTSD and have nothing left to lose. The starfish book reveals a Rachel who is desperately afraid of her ability to sink into battle; her character arc in canon is one of the most tragic IMO. Not that I don't love this characterization, but r!Rachel is on a very different path.
