True! To be honest, even canon Rachel was a really refreshing character. For the blonde, gymnastic all-american girl to also be the heavy firepower, the warrior, /and/ the ruthless one was I think for the time a huge subversion of what that character would normally be and do. I liked that Applegate throughout kept all of those aspects of her character and let her be all those things at once, while keeping it logically consistent with her desire to succeed and do what needed to be done in order to achieve that success, rather than seeing those characteristics as naturally disparate and Rachel as having to transition from one set to the other.

I feel a lot of fanfiction authors, at least for Animorphs, lose that nuance when writing her.
