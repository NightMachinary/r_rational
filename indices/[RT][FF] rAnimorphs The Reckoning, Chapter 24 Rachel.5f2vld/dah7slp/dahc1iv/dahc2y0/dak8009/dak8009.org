It was too subtle for me. I actually didn't even notice it this chapter at first, since it is not mentioned directly and I was tearing through the words. I just assumed I'd missed a paragraph somewhere at first.

Most of the things you're mentioning are hard to see as hints because "Marco is in love with Jake" offered little to no explanatory power over "Marco cares about Jake as a friend".
