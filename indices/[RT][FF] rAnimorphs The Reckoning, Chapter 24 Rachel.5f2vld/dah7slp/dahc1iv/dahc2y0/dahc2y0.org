No, Rachel /thought/ she had one on Cassie, while she was mixed up in Jake's head, but she got squared away in the end. It's just Marco.

Poor, poor Marco. It's rather more than just a crush.

Edit: depending on how you view such things, I've either been /dropping hints/ or /laying the groundwork/ for a long time, now. There's Marco's distress when Jake goes comatose; Marco's reaction when Jake wakes up; his snide dig at Cassie when both of them waited to be the last one to talk to him, privately, by the fire; his previous intention (seen by Rachel) to morph Jake's body (that's why she already knows); etc. etc.

My hope is that this will feel sort of natural and obvious in retrospect, but also not have been big in everybody's faces up until this point (and not really after, either, as Jake doesn't return the favor and Marco's determined that it NOT MATTER).
