Typo: "We had left the green-brown hills of southern California the following morning and headed west", pretty sure that should be east.

I tore up a few times during the mind meld, notably when Jake hugs Marco.

We have a Chee doing violence to the Howlers, and we have the Chee returning weapons to Rachel. Two proposed explanations for the latter are morphs counting as different identities, and "something to do with why they never use Rachel's name". I like these, but I think the Howlers are important, and I would guess that the two events have related explanations.

I'm also not sure of the morph explanation, because that also needs to suppose that they want the Animorphs to have the weapons (or they wouldn't have returned them) but can't tell them how to bypass the protocols, not even by describing them in sufficient detail that the flaw becomes clear. It's possible, but epicycles.
