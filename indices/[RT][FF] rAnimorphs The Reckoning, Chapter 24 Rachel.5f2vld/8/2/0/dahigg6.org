They can detect that a person is morphed, and who the original is, based on their telepathic communication. Look at [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/22/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning][Interlude 4]], which includes a Chee perspective right after the Ellimist/Crayak teleport from Ventura:

#+begin_quote
  [We have the situation under control. Peter Levy and Tom Berenson will not injure Ax. Based on the interlink signals, these others with me are Jake Berenson, Marco Levy, Garrett Steinberg, and the female.]

  We do not understand. Where are their construct bodies?

  [They do not have any.]

  This is not a meaning.

  [They are emerging directly from the gate, with no construct to disassemble.]

  This is not a meaning.

  [There is no evidence of footsteps or other disturbances to the area around us. Whatever process brought us here likely also brought Peter Levy and Tom Berenson and Ax and the gates of Jake Berenson, Marco Levy, Garrett Steinberg, and the female.]

The "gate" is probably the link to Z-space for the morphers, and this is referring to the fact that they were teleported from Ventura in-morph but arrived out of morph.

Incidentally, this is why the teleport was so efficient for the Ellimist/Crayak: the gates themselves are many orders of magnitude lighter than the people.
