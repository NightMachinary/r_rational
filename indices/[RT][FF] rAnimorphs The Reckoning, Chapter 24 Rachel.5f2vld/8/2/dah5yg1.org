Hmm. I forget, can the Chee detect that a person is morphed? Maybe the plausible deniability of Rachel possibly being someone else (whom they have not seen commit violence, since they don't know who they are) is enough ambiguity to satisfy their nonviolence protocols.

Thus, they couldn't give it to Tobias, because they were certain that he was really Tobias.

It certainly seems like said protocols are /not/ the same thing as their core values, since they frequently and knowingly work around them.
