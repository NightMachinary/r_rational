It is possible that they were lying to Tobias. The rest of the group had come to a decision that was more in line with what the Chee wanted and Tobias hadn't yet learned all the details of this. It's possible also that they wanted him to take part in the sharing of minds*--especially because a yeerk participated.

As to why they would lie...I have no idea. Maybe it was necessary for him to back off. Or maybe it wasn't this at all, but instead the consequence of a move made in the game between Crayak and the Ellimist. Or perhaps instead, it might be related to Rachel's...unplannedness in that game.

* This was very well-written and moving in a way that you find so rarely. And then, I don't know what to think after reading

If not as intense as it is portrayed with Garrett.

I only wish the sharing of minds went on longer.
