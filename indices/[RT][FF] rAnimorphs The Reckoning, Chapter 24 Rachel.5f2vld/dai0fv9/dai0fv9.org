There may be something very significant going on regarding Rachel and how the gods and Chee behave with her. I list all my observations that may be relevant, and basic assumptions and questions about those observations. Others can theorize from these.

Observation 1:

Rachel was specifically mentioned as a surprise to Ellimist's/Crayak's/The Arbiter's (ECA's) model.

Observation 2:

The prophecy failed to mention Rachel being present for Elfangor's landing, but she was present. Assumption 2.1: The prophecy occurred after her birth.

Observation 3:

The Ellimist/Crayak was able to teleport Rachel, but did not mention her being one of the Four.

Observation 4:

The Ellimist/Crayak said that Visser Three would send the asteroid because of yeerk starvation. Observation 4.1: He teleported two yeerks who knew otherwise. Assumption 4.2: The oatmeal experiments would not be hard for him to see. Observation 4.3: Visser Three knew explicitly that starvation was not the true reason for the asteroid.

Observation 5:

The Chee never mention Rachel by name. Assumption 5.1: The Chee are not sexist with humans.

Observation 6:

The Chee gave Rachel a cube and a shredder, when they have told Tobias that humans observed to be violent cannot be given weapons. Observation 6.1: The Chee have lied before. Observation 6.2: The Chee are acting as if they want the Animorphs to trust them now. Assumption 6.2.1: This would be an easy lie to catch quickly, and the Chee know it.

Observation 7:

In an interlude, Visser Three was given knowledge of a z-space hole, and Alloran was simultaneously silenced. Assumption 7.1: Esplin will act differently if Alloran is conspicuously silent, so this would make for an inaccurate simulation. Unknown 7.1.1: Was this a simulation by ECA? Unknown 7.1.2: If so, have these last few chapters also been part of that simulation? Observation 7.2: During this possible simulation, Esplin specifically noted that the oatmeal was not the real reason for the asteroid. Assumption 7.2.1: This fact must have been apparent to the simulator.

tl;dr We have a blip in ECA's model about Rachel, a possible blip in the Chee's thoughts about Rachel, an inconsistency in Ellimist's/Crayak's story about the asteroid, and an unexplained silencing of Alloran in what may or may not be a simulation.
