I think this is a reference to a few other points in the story where Rachel has been shown as something of a blind spot.

I seem to recall that the prophecy the Andalites received didn't mention Rachel at all. Can't remember which chapter it was in, maybe one of Ax's.

Look at [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/15/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning][Interlude 2]]:

#+begin_quote
  On Earth, a girl is born. Her name is Rachel, and she is not supposed to be there.
#+end_quote

And in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/29/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning][Interlude 7]], a direct Chee perspective:

#+begin_quote
  Besides, Garrett Steinberg and Aximili-Esgarrouth-Isthill and the female returned from their foraging excursion
#+end_quote

The Chee seem to be incapable of storing information about Rachel, referring to her as "the female", even though she's been part of the group for longer than Ax and has a much shorter name.

Being really good at following through is one thing, but she noted in this chapter that Garrett and Tom had the same grit. Rachel's true preternatural ability is that she is an anomaly, and plans seem to unexpectedly fail to account for her.

*EDIT:* And [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/22/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning][Interlude 4]], an earlier Chee PoV:

  Based on the interlink signals, these others with me are Jake Berenson, Marco Levy, Garrett Steinberg, and the female.

I also forgot to mention that the Chee know the name of every dog in their care. This is not unsurprising, given their dog fixation, but it does make it more obvious that Rachel is different. Knowing the name of every human and dog /except/ Rachel makes it apparent.
