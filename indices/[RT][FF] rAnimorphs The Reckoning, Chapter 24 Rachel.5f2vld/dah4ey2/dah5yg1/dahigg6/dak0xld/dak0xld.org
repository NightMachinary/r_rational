Heh, the end of C/E Munchkinining sequence at the beginning of that interlude has Jake interrupt Cassie as she's deciding to stay behind, contrary to what actually happened, and similar to Jake's musing about how he could have saved her in the previous chapter.

Edit: And at the end the Chee save some random human kid! It can't be the one Cassie tried to save... Who is it?
