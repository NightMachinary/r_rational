Something about all this reminds me of a different fic, where Buffy was immune to precognition, because according to Fate, she was "Dead in the Master's cave." It's not quite the same, clearly, but Rachel having been the one who died in the canon timeline is sort of ... twinging it.

So it's my suspicion that the canon timeline, specifically her death within it, has something to do with Rachel's Stranger ability. I can't fully make a diagram going from point A to point Z, or even the outline of one, but I just have the feeling that something's there.
