Okay, here's a crackpot off-the-wall theory. The Rachel that we're seeing, that's been accompanying the others since Crayak or Ellimist teleported them away from the impact crater, isn't Rachel. It's a Chee wearing a hologram. It can take the shredder and cube because it is /not human/, and is in fact entirely incapable of violence.

The real Rachel is trapped in a virtual environment that exactly matches what the Chee wearing her shape is seeing, and that Chee is exactly matching her movements. So, she thinks she's there, but she's acting at a remove, through a proxy. The others managed to obtain her shape (and memories) (and her theirs) by means of Chee technology being able to hack the morph technology (or perhaps Crayak/Ellimist magic). (Or possibly Ellimist/Crayak morphed Rachel into a Yeerk who's inside the Chee's head, being carefully fed information by Chee technology).

The illusion will hold until such time as Rachel tries to do something violent and the Chee repeating her actions is not able to miss without her noticing, or as soon as Rachel tries to give the shredder or cube to one of the actual humans.
