I don't think it can be the first one, because Tobias was saying how he begged them and they wouldn't give it to him, and surely they'd know that the humans would think it was weird they wouldn't give it to Tobias because it could cause harm but they /would/ give it to Rachel, and there was no reason not to give it to Tobias if it wasn't actually able to cause harm.

I'm completely perplexed about the whole thing, to be honest. What the hell are the Chee playing at?? It /makes no sense/, and my best guess at the moment is "Rachel is weird to the Chee, so they don't have to play by the rules when it comes to her", which still isn't very satisfying.
