So. The cube and the shredder. Given to Rachel.

The Chee said they could give them to a human but not one that they'd seen commit violence with them, not one they thought would commit violence with them.

This seems a reasonable statement, in light of their anti-violence safeguards.

Yet they gave both to Rachel.

Options:

- It is no longer possible to commit violence with that cube, that shredder. Important components have been removed or altered in a way that is not possible for Earth-level technology to fix or diagnose without months or years of research and re-tooling.

- The Chee are not associating Rachel with the same person as killed Visser Three back at the school. This implies some level of deliberate - and extremely careful - violation of their own safeguards. (Alternatively, perhaps they are deliberately not recognising Rachel as a sapient lifeform /so that/ they can ignore their safeguards when it comes to her - in the same way that they are not required to stop a wolf from killing a bunny, or a dog from hunting a squirrel). Or perhaps, between morphs and all, they are (deliberately) recognising that there is a non-zero chance that Rachel (in morph) is really Jake (in morph) or someone else that they haven't seen commit violence - and using that uncertainty over her identity to work around their own safeguards.

- Invisible Chee are following that cube and shredder /everywhere/, with the intent of making very sure that neither are /ever/ going to be used for violence in any way, shape or form.

- The Chee were lying about their safeguards. (Why would they do that?)
