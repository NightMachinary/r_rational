I'm not great at keeping track of details. My guess is that the morphing messed with the Chee. They knew what was actually going on, but it was enough to trick the overrides. Rachel was morphed when she killed Visser Three, so technically Erek didn't see /her/. Was Tobias morphed? Or maybe they had contact with Tobias the whole time, and knew it was really him, but for all they knew that could have been someone else morphed as Rachel they were talking to.
