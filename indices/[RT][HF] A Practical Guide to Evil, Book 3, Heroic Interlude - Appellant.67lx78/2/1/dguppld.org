  “I do not judge,” the White Knight said.

  The silver coin appeared in his open palm, as it always did. As a child, Hanno had seen the laws of men fail. He'd believed in the citizenship tiers, before he'd seen what they did to his mother. And yet Ashur was on the side of Good, was it not? So many places across Calernia were, and yet injustice was rampant. The thought had tormented him, as a child. How could one tell which laws were just and which were not? Picking and choosing was... imperfect. One's discernment could never be flawless. It was constrained by the events of one's life, the limits of one's intellect. Hanno could have, he supposed, destroyed the laws he'd seen destroy his mother. But what would he have replaced them with? His own beliefs, as fallible as those of the men and women who'd crafted the laws he railed against? That was not rectifying an evil. It was replacing it with a different shade of the same. But he'd found an answer, hadn't he? He flipped the coin, watched it spin in the air. It landed on his palm. The crossed silver swords, not the laurels. The Seraphim had rendered their judgement.

  “Kairos Theodosian, Tyrant of Helike,” the White Knight said, tone eerily calm. “The Choir of Judgement has looked upon the sum of your existence, and found you wanting.”

  Heat flooded his veins, lighting up his senses. For once, everything felt right.
