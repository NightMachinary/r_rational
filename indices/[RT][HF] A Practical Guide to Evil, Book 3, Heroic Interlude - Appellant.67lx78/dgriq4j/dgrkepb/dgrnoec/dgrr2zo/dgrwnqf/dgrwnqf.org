  He create a situation in which he has as much advantage as he could conceivably have, yet the moment it seems the story might strike back he gives it up.

Yes! And the point where he gives up makes me wonder how he managed to kill the other heroes.

I also wonder what Black figured was the trigger point in the original plan. Would he have continued if, e.g. the Hedge Wizard had fallen for the trap? Or if the Tyrant had continued attacking, or attempted a backstab? Is Black trying to set up a pattern of three (the heroes win the first one etc)? Are the Calamities going to give Hanno the seven days and seven nights before he awakens? So many questions and what ifs.
