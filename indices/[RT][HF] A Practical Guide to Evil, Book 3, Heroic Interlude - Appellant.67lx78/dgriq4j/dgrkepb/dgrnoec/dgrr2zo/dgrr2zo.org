It also show a difference in how Cat and Black interact with the "Story". For the most part, Cat has taken advantage of the story when she could, and forced her way through when it's taken advantage of her (fight in Arcadia, final fight with Lone Swordsman, etc.)

Black however, show much more respect for the story, if less accommodation for it, and not just in the constant subversion of the Bard. He create a situation in which he has as much advantage as he could conceivably have, yet the moment it seems the story might strike back he gives it up. Gives up the opportunity to strike the heroes down, gives up the intelligence the heroes gain from surviving them and risks them becoming significant BECAUSE they survived an attack of the Calamities. Because you do not mess with the Story unless it's already dead.
