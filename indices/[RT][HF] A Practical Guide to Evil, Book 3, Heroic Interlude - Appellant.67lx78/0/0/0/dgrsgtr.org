The Black Knight has a lot more to lose than the heroes do. He has no interest in a fight to the bloody bitter end. I think the Tyrant retreating twigged his weird-sense, he checked if any of the heroes were on the ropes, and when they weren't he went with plan B (assassin).

The Tyrant is the interesting part. It seems pretty obvious that he'd like plucky heroes more than the Calamities. The heroes are like a favorite toy that he can keep throwing more and more fireworks at just to see what happens. The Calamities, on the other hand, are like the stick-up-the-butt preppy kids who keep trying to give him sweet lifehacks for better flossing.
