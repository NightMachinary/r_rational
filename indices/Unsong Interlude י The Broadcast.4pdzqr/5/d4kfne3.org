The worldbuilding of Unsong ... is starting to get to me.

TV broadcasting stops working sometime in the mid-80s, televisions and VCRs fall out of favor and eventually become relics. San Francisco gets flooded with LSD and blocked off from civilized society. The United States no longer appears to be a functional government, at least in the heartland, following some apparently quite violent war between the Comet King and the Other King. Russia has been overrun by demons.

And yet, Kim Jong-Un is apparently still the leader of North Korea, there are Apple MacBooks, the Internet is still functional, almost all the major companies are still around (per Erica's pitch), BART is still functional, Silicon Valley is still a tech mecha, etc.

Unsong does not aspire to rationality, I get that, but ... is there some explanation that will help me here? In Spite of a Nail is not normally a trope that bothers me, but the worldbuilding seems to go off in absolutely wild directions and then end up right back where it is in the real world. Is the answer just "don't think about it too hard" or "Uriel did it for reasons"? I'm otherwise enjoying the story, but hearing that /broadcast television/ is no longer a thing might be the thing that permanently breaks my suspension of disbelief, simply because of how radically different the world should be.
