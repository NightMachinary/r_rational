Those things are fated to happen. That's literally it, as far as I can tell. If you take a biblical view of reality, san-fransisco isn't a tech-mecca because of the economics, or anything so mundane. It's because it has the right resonance, and it's fated to be.

That's the big difference between a world that runs on math and a world that runs on the kabbalah.
