I know that's what Aaron calls it, but in-universe is that it's name, or is it still officially the United States?

Same with Erica name-checking Gogmagog, which /probably/ isn't the proper name of a company unless they had some reason to invoke [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gog_and_Magog][bad associations]]. I cannot imagine what sort of brand meeting would have to go down for a company to name itself Gogmagog in the real world, let alone in a world where the Bible is true and Hell has been broadcast on all the major channels.
