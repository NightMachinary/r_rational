Let me provide slightly more context on the quote from chapter 14 in particular:

#+begin_quote
  “Mr. Smith-Teller,” [Director-General Malia Ngo] said. “I'm sorry you're in this situation, but as you can tell from my presence here we do have to take this very seriously, and I have to ask you a few questions. The Keller-Stern Act of 1988 states that anyone who discovers a Divine Name of potential military value is legally obligated to turn it over to the Untied States government in exchange for fair monetary compensation. Most people aren't aware of the Act, and we have no interest in punishing them for refusing to follow a law they never heard of. But now you know. So, Mr. Teller-Smith, and please tell me the truth, do you know any Names that might be covered under the law?”

It's not just Aaron who calls it that.
