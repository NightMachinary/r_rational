As someone who was waiting for this chapter (or one similar to it), I absolutely agree with everything you said, and don't particularly mourn the fun-and-pun adventure romp the first few chapters indicated Unsong would be, as great as a whole story of that would have been.

If anything, it's a testament to how well you can marry the two types of stories that so many people (far more than I predicted) seem to be so upset with the dark turn in the narrative. In any other moderately dark fiction this kind of chapter is actually fairly tame (we don't know any of the people in Hell, we don't care about them, they're just names and abstract horror made a statistic by the absurd numbers involved both in population and duration of torture). Things like this actually happen to characters we know and love in other stories, and that's when the real tears and gnashing of teeth tends to occur in the majority of the audience. I'll be interested to see if Ana or Erica or Aaron (probably not Aaron what with the POV narration, but who knows) end up dying and going to hell.

In any case, thanks so far for the wonderful story!
