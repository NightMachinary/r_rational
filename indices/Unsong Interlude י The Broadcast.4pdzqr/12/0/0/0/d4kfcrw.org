I'm going to take this question seriously. It was written so that this /matters/.

This is going to be a book about good and evil. How do people react to evil? How do they understand it? Do they tolerate it? Compromise with it? Try to fight it? Curse God for creating it? What if twenty years ago the Messiah called for the greatest crusade in all of history in order to conquer Hell itself, failed, died, and now the world is just sort of limping through the aftermath of that without really ever having processed it? Nobody's noticed it yet, but underneath the facade of puns and stuff this book is /really dark/, and it's going to get way darker.

I don't think I can do any of this without having first established evil as a concrete and horrible presence in this world. It's like Ana said. Without the Broadcast, we'd be tempted to view evil as just a funny divine quirk, like creating the platypus. It's not until evil gets flung at you in the most graphic way possible that you actually start thinking about it in Near Mode. This is why she made Aaron watch the Broadcast, and it's why I'm making you read about the Broadcast, and when I start telling you the story of the Comet King I hope that you remember that everything he does, he does because he lives in /this/ universe and not in the Care Bears universe or something.

But actually, another part of why I wrote this was the opposite of that. I hope that people who think "How can someone possibly live in this universe without freaking out?" has the sense to notice that our own universe has a lot of suffering, and to wonder how anyone can live in /our/ universe without freaking out.

Well, here's your extreme case. Let's see what happens with it.
