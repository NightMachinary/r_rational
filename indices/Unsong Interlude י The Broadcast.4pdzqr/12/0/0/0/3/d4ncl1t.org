Evil brought into being by a supervillain who specifically set out to do it for its own sake is something very different from evil that arises as a by-product of thoughtlessness, perverse incentives and impersonal natural laws that are orthogonal to (or at least linearly independent from) any morality. By focusing so much on capital-E Evil, you might have destroyed the applicability of any conclusions drawn about it to the real world.

The suffering of souls in Unsong's Hell seems strikingly /gratuitous/ and /avoidable/ compared to any suffering in the real world. Thamiel doesn't seem to gain anything by it; he already seems to be an incredibly powerful being. Stopping him looks completely hopeless, given that even archangels cannot get rid of him (though Uriel nearly succeeded once by turning him into metaphor; so perhaps part of the solution is "in order to conquer evil, you need to stop personifying it"?). Contrast that with the real world, where evil often cannot be avoided completely; where a person who commits evil acts can be often brought under society's control to an extent, and commits them in order to satisfy some desire; where collective evil arises for example from performing en masse actions that would be otherwise individually justifiable. And where we might think how to redesign society so that perverse incentives don't arise, or so that people's desires can be denied or satisfied in a way that avoids suffering. Meditating on Evil Deeds done by Bad Guys doesn't seem to help much with that.

(For the same reason I don't like superhero stories, save for Watchmen.)
