  underneath the facade of puns and stuff this book is really dark, and it's going to get way darker.

Of course the book is extremely dark, and it amazes me continually that people call it "light hearted" that after reading about:

- an eagle gouging out one of the Pope's eyes
- babies being born with extra eyes
- fetuses forming unspeakable and blood-curdling messages in Morse code
- a copyright enforcement agency that is said to kill people for copyright infringement
- Uriel killing the firstborns in Egypt (and all the other plagues) so they would stop building pyramids
- people's skeletal diseases being randomly reassigned
- great massacres in Siberia
- deadly revolutions in China
- major territories in the South China Sea disappearing
- the collapse of the US into a bunch of states ruled by warlords who crucify their enemies
- an Archangel who is bullied by his brothers and chooses suicide (and the death of all Angels) as a way of stopping Thamiel's victory

This book is very dark pitch black comedy at best, and I wonder why people needed the broadcast chapter to start complaining about darkness. I guess the items above might be seen as distant (far-mode?), while the Broadcast rubs people's suffering in your face (near-mode?), but I'm really really surprised by peoples reactions...
