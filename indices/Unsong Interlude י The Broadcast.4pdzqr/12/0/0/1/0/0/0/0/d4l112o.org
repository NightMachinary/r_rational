I completely understand where you're coming from, but weirdly I didn't feel the same about the chapter. I feel like that tone of usual silliness where you laugh at the jokes and get familiar with characters punctuated by very serious and sad moments is a trope that's having a lot of success these days (thinking Rick & Morty and Bojack Horseman as the pinnacle of the genre, but I see gritty movie reboots of superhero stories as similar) and I love it most of the time.

Your post got me thinking so after 5 minutes of introspection I came to that : there's an element of realism to it because nobody's just happy or sad all the time, so I can relate to that, but it's also a fantasy in that it's almost always completely carefree or unabashedly wallowing in misery, and I enjoy both.
