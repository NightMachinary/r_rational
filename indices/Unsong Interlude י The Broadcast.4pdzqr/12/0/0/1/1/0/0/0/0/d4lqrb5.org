It's got potential as a thought exercise, but wouldn't you expect an omniscient, omnipotent being with an entirely different frame of reference to have a utility function that's nigh-inscrutable to humans? It seems like an "out of context" problem to me.

That having been said, what always confused me was what business such a god would have in creating a universe in the first place- assuming omniscience, you can essentially simulate anything and get the same experience as if you'd actually created it. So what's the value in creating the universe?

Edit: As stated above, I think a possible solution is that god wouldn't actually be omniscient/omnipotent, the above question relies on the standard Christian view.
