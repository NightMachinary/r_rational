Yeah, I feel like the unrealism and the exaggerated descriptions mercifully created some distance. It didn't have the impact of something like the Red Wedding, which had characters I already cared about getting murdered due to simple real-world human evil rather than ontological Evil perpetrated by an Evil Maximizer.

That said... /shudder/.

Edit: Actually, "Evil Maximizer" made me realize that Thamiel seems less like a capricious evil entity than an optimizer whose objective is to maximize suffering in the universe. Thamiel does not hate you, nor does he love you, but you contain a soul that he can use to generate more suffering.

Okay, /now/ I'm shuddering.
