Yes? I mean, you get a duration bonus due to the whole "eternal torment" thing, but the Babyeaters are an interstellar empire. And human population only really exploded recently, so Unsong Hell hasn't really had a chance to come into its own yet. (And probably won't have, if it gets abolished somehow in the end, which I can only assume will happen. Which would probably leave the Babyeaters as the greater sum-evil.)

Time-limited O(n) can easily outstrip time-limited O(nÂ²) with sufficiently big multiplicative factors.
