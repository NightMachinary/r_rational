Okay, so let's look at the Babyeaters.

They're an interstellar civilization. Since we only have one case I'm gonna assume that they have a population of about seven billion per planet, like us. They're r-type...

  "I know," said the Lord Pilot. "A lot of Babyeaters will die at first, but they're killing ten times more children than their whole adult population, every year -"

So if we're looking at a, say, twenty-planets interstellar empire, and a month of digestion, and a five-hundred-year history, even ignoring historic deaths, that that gives you 7 billion (babyeaters/planet)*(10 children/babyeater year)*20 planets*500 years*(1/12 years of suffering) = 58,333,333,333,333 babyeater children years of hell-equivalent.

Also you sort of added an additional 1000 to the number of humans ever, it's only 100,000,000,000 according to [[http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2002/HowManyPeopleHaveEverLivedonEarth.aspx][here]], which gives you about 100,000,000,000,000 person-years of hell which is only a factor of two off with the Babyeater number. Assume that half of humanity goes to hell, and it matches perfectly.
