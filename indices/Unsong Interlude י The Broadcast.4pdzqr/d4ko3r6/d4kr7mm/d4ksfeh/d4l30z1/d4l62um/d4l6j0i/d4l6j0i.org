Edited for the correct number. Yeah, you're right, I screwed up the number of zeroes.

But each person in Hell suffers for an /eternity/, not just a really really long time. There really does seem to be a time dilation effect. Quote:

  "Or maybe we'll take him up on it, let him torture his mother for two millennia, and then not give him anything in return, just to see his face when he realizes it was all for nothing. Or maybe we'll take him up on it and give him a couple hours reprieve from his tortures -- because why not -- and then back here for another millennium.‚Äù

They talk about millennia as though they're meaningless, just another featureless stretch of time in the eternity to be suffered. For that matter, the person Thamiel is describing was speaking modern English. Given that the apocalypse seems to be more-or-less imminent, it kinda takes the kick out of it if they run out of time midway through the first decade.
