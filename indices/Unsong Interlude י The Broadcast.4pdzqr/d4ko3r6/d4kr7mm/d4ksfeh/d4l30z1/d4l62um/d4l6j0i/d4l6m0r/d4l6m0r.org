I think that's just their plan. I don't think it's good evidence for a time dilation effect. Thamiel doesn't seem like the sort of person who would worry overmuch about humans interfering with his work.

I don't think Thamiel, as part-of-the-system-that-the-accident-created, is really viscerally anticipating the apocalypse. I think on some level he believes he will just keep going like this, forever.
