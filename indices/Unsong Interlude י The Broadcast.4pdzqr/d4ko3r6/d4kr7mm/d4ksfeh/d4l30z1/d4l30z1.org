Well, I mean, we could do the math on it, but I'm pretty sure that the recent human population explosion doesn't matter much. There've been something like 100,000,000,000 humans since the species first began, and even if you cut that down to conform to a history that begins in 4000 BC you're still looking at billions of people being tortured for thousands of years. Plus, I sort of get the impression that time runs faster in Hell, since they're talking about doing things for millennia at a time as though it ain't no big thing, when the apocalypse seems to be right around the corner.
