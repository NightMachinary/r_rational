  Compromise is good. Humans are all about compromise. Not compromising increases, not reduces, evil.

I think this is a critical point. The divine is harmful to humans in both its "pure" form and "evil" form. Being turned into an empty minded shell repeating praises over and over is no more inline with actual human values than being turned into a empty shell of pain and torture. I think Uriel had the right idea in the first place, render the whole mess nonexistent via mathematics. So yeah, forcing the absolutely pure divineity to compromise with absolute evil is the only way to make something habitable to humans

I am worried that we will get to see heaven in an interlude and that it is going to be worse than San Francisco.
