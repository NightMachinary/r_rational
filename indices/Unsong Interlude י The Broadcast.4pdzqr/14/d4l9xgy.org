So, this chapter was gut-wrenching and also amazing.

The most disturbing and interesting part is the children. Children in hell for eternity. Are there any Judeo-Christian sects that allow this other than traditional/fundamentalist Catholicism? And does this mean anything significant for the rules of the universe, other than "Hell is really really really really really really really really really bad"?
