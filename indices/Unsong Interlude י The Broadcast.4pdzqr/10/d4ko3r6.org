I don't understand how this solves the question of the Cainites.

If anything, having a shitty GM /justifies/ munchkinry.

I don't agree with the Cainites but doesn't the existence of hell make their project more, not less, important? We're given a yardstick for the amount of evil that is already instantiated in the world; frankly, don't their minor human sins pale in comparison?

Omelas looks a lot better if the rest of the world is W40k.

Shit, is that the "compromise with sin"? I mean, I've never understood that quote. Compromise is good. Humans are all about compromise. Not compromising increases, not reduces, evil. And frankly, this hell is not hugely worse than the Babyeaters were. The "sin" metric is similar to, but does not match human evil.

There's opportunities for trade here, is what I'm saying.
