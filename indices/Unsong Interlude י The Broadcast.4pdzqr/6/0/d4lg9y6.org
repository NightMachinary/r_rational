When I was a believer (Southern Baptist, a fundamentalist, evangelical, the-biblical-is-inerrant, young-earth-creationist denomination) I got annoyed at fellow believers who would treat semantic games about good and evil as a knock-down argument against the problem of evil.

Their favorite analogy was that cold was merely the absence of heat, and evil merely the absence of God (not a typo, they viewed God and good as perfectly equivalent). But seeing your comment and recalling that analogy... "evil" has a much larger solution space than "good". Evil would be the more energetic particles whizzing about, while "good" is a single stable state.

Of course, Thamiel has taken it one step further and actualized the literal opposite of people's values, so I think the reversed analogy falls apart.
