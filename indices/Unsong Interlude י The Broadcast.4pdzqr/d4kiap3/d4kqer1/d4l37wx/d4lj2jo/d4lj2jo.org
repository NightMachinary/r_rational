Of course, lacking utterly a real frame of reference for "a thousand years of being pressed against thousand degree metal bars, stuffed in a cage with the people I'd dislike most out of all bad humans who have ever died", I think that even if I unleashed by brain entirely that I'd fail to terrify myself properly. Yay for scope insensitivity?
