  you can essentially simulate anything and get the same experience as if you'd actually created it. So what's the value in creating the universe?

Simulating a universe may be equivalent to creating it.

Also, as a kid, before I had quite heard of simulationist views of reality, I wondered if God's omniscience and omnipotence worked by viewing all the possible futures and then picking the one he wanted... and then it occurred to me to wonder if suffering existed and the rapture hadn't happened yet and miracles were uncommon was because this world was one of the futures he wasn't going to pick as real but he wanted to/need to know what happened in it anyway.

I didn't think of it quite that coherently but remembering it with my current reductionist mindset, that is about what I meant.
