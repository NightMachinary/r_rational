Would you be interested in chatting about the systems you thought about? I thought that God valued, for lack of a better word, complexity; that a universe with 10 hedons and 0 dolors was inferior to a universe with 10 hedons and 10 dolors, and the only tricky thing about dolors was that you didn't want to distribute so many to someone that they permanently destroyed some of that person's capacity to produce or experience further complexity (and obviously, in the eternal perspective, there's very little that does so*).

. * In Mormonism, the only people who really go to Hell are the ones who, essentially, /refuse/ to enter Heaven because they just won't admit that they did anything wrong. Other people may suffer for a time, but eventually almost everyone goes to one level of Heaven or another, and even the version of Heaven that /Hitler/ will go to is so good that, according to the religion's founder, if you saw it then you would kill yourself just to get there faster.
