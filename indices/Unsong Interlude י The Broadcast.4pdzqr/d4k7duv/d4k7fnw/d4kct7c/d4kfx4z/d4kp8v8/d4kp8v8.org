  You can't just dismiss Theodicy within Unsong as being simple or trivial -- that should be clear just from the way it's mentioned as a field of study, but that point is made more visibly here.

I still can actually. God is not good, or if he is "good" in some fundamental semantic kind of way, then he is not "good" in anykind of way corresponding to the human meaning of "good". Theodicy solved.

Funny story, in the process of losing my fundamentalist beliefs, I went through a several months period where I still believed God existed but that the concept of good as defined by God's existence was completely beyond human meanings of "good" or "evil", and that much of God's actions could be described as evil. I think I can understand how the characters in this story just adjust and keep on living their lives.

Also I think I empathize with Ana less in this chapter... sometimes the most logical conclusion is that your premise is wrong. In the case of theodicy, clearly God is not all good, all powerful, or all knowing, or some combination of these three. Since kabbalistic magic has words for the last two, I think the all good is the odd one out. Also, if Thamiel's plan was to manipulate Nixon into distributing the videos, or distribute them himself slowly (and Nixon accidentally messed that up) why does Ana think sharing the video around is a remotely good idea?

  Personally, I feel that when it comes to concepts like "horrific eternal torture", the imagination fails.

Totally agree with you here though. So many fundamentalists fail to actually seriously grok the idea of God torturing people forever. Those that do tend to either leave or make excuse about how hell is really just the absence of God. The few that both internalize the idea and keep believing it... well it puts a lot of fundamentalist actions and words into context, doesn't it?
