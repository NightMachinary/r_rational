We'd already gotten that section where Sohu is briefly tormented and then threatened by Thamiel -- which to me was where it was made clear that this isn't a cutesy story where evil is to shoved under a rug.

As such this interlude felt to me perfectly in tone with /that/, and if this interlude (or something like it) was missing, then that Sohu/Thamiel portion we'd already seen would have been the one strangely out of place...
