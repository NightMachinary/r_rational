This is a matter of aesthetic preference. Thamiel didn't do anything worse than a Disney villain - came in, made some threats, overwhelming despair, etc. That was my initial impression, and on reread it didn't really change. (It probably doesn't help that the preceding battle is pun-based, which for me sapped the entire confrontation of its seriousness - but I'd thought that was just Unsong being intentionally silly rather than a failure in tone shift.)

For me, the problem is the tonal dissonance, not necessarily the setting of expectations. Unsong wants to have Hell be a big, serious thing that the reader viscerally feels, but it also wants to have a chapter about the kabbalistic implications of "There's a Hole in my Bucket" and make a bunch of whale puns. If I come into future chapters with the mindset of "Hell is literal here" then I'm going to be less inclined to laugh at the jokes, and if I come in looking for jokes, I'm apparently going to get stuff about eternal rape and torture.

Part of my problem might be that I /already/ took Hell seriously in the real world. For quite a long time, I was one of those angry atheist keyboard warriors, and it was always the problem of evil and the existence of Hell that got my blood boiling. There are people who believed in Hell who just ... talked about it casually, like it was this natural thing. There were people who believed that God was going torture people for eternity and /those colossal assholes still fucking worshiped him/. I never believed in Hell, but the fact that other people did and did virtually nothing about it fueled a lot of my anger. Unsong is doing its best to dredge up those feelings, or create them in readers who didn't already have them, while still wanting to spend most of its time being a silly story.
