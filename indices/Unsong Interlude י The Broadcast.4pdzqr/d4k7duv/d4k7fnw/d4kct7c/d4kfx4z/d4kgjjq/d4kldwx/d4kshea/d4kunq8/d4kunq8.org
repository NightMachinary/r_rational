Thank you for putting in to words exactly my issues with this chapter. Yes, I understood what the author was doing and why he was doing it. But it didn't feel like it /fit/ with the rest of the story.

It's as if I were reading discworld and then Death has to go collect the souls of some dead children killed by their parents. Sure, it's something that might happen in universe, but it clashes with the tone of the story. Anything lighthearted afterwards will just feel hollow.
