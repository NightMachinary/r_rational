Given the rest of the worldbuilding, it makes perfect sense that Hell (which is already confirmed to exist) works like that, and in fact it would be strange if this wasn't the case. Given that it exists, it is hugely important to the characters (and their motivations) and should probably come up at some point. It would be especially important to Ana, who has a PHD in Theodicy.

  “You tried to dismiss the problem of evil!” she said. “You tried to just say ‘God does lots of weird stuff', as if this -- ” she gestured at the screen, “was of the same magnitude as the platypus. You want to see why theodicy is a hard problem? Watch!”

That isn't just being said by Ana to Aaron, it's also a message from Scott to the readers. You can't just dismiss Theodicy within Unsong as being simple or trivial -- that should be clear just from the way it's mentioned as a field of study, but that point is made more visibly here. If you, or anyone in your life, thinks that Hell is real? /You have to engage with the implications of that belief./ And they include Theodicy getting a lot more difficult. (I mean, you should do that for everything you believe, but beliefs involving the eternal torture of yourself and everyone you care about should probably be a priority.)

As to why it had to be so graphic and detailed?

Personally, I feel that when it comes to concepts like "horrific eternal torture", the imagination fails. (Other concepts that are difficult to imagine include anything with infinity or very /very/ big numbers, something you should all be familiar with.) It's too easy to gloss over. Those three words don't /hit you/ like that 1/3rd of a chapter did. But when it's /horrific eternal torture/, it /should/ hit you. It /should/ have an emotional impact. The idea that Aaron and Ana live in the same universe as /Hell itself/ -- if you care for the characters at all, then becoming a bit (or more than a bit) upset is reasonable. But it's far to easy to overlook over the words, when there's no fuel for your imagination provided with them. It's too easy to miss the implications, to refuse to emotionally engage with it. Well, you don't get that option here. Scott demands that you look, at least at this tiny fragment of it.

People have said (over in the comments on the Unsong page more than here, tbh) that it's sick and wrong and makes them feel ill, etc, but here's the thing: this was /totally predictable/. This is perfectly in line for everything else you've been shown in Unsong! Thamiel has shown up several times, been mentioned even more, the thing about unsong!Singer and his views on Hell was a while back in another interlude. Given all those.... did you realise what that /meant/? Did you figure out that Unsong contained this? If you did, would you have felt ill, been horrified, etc? Because if the detail makes you sick when the idea containing that detail didn't, then that's a kind of bias. By including the detail, Scott got people past that bias and into realising just how horrific Hell truly is.

  ... The only reason anyone can deal with it at all is because they never really think about it, they keep it off in their peripheral vision where it never really shows up clearly. It's like how everybody knew Hell existed, but nobody freaked out until they saw the Broadcast.”

Again, parallels between the general public in-world and the readers. Everyone reading should have known hell existed, but they weren't overly bothered until this chapter, "The Broadcast".

Plus, I think Scott just liked the idea of a National Geographic Special about Hell.

EDIT: well, the author himself answered it, which makes anything I say pretty irrelevant. I'll leave this comment up anyway, just so you can see what I thought of it at the time.
