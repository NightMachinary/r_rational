So I've started reading this and am very ambivalent.

For one, it feels very preachy, and not necessarily in a good way, but it also feels like the intended target of that preaching is someone other than me, as well. It agonist seems like it's trying to be something akin to a 4chan Bible.

Additionally, the pacing feels someone similar to TV procedurals, where there's an overarching storyline that I'm actually interested in, but which is being developed nearly exclusively in the last 2-3 paragraphs of each chapter.

I'm up to chapter 1.6, and still can't decide if I'm waiting for the story to grab me more, or if this just isn't for me.

[Edit]

So I finished chapter 1.6 - I didn't realize that was the last chapter of the book. The last chapter read a lot better to me, and is likely enough to propel me into reading the next book, for anyone who may be feeling similar to me.
