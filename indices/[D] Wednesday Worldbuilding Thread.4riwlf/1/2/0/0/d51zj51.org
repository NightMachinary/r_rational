There really isn't one. People, technologies and institutions are getting better at collecting and analyzing data year after year, and people are getting increasingly connected.

It mostly depends on the magic system and the masquerade scale (hiding a town of faeries basically just requires hypnotizing all outsiders into ignoring everything, controlling communications with the exterior, and a lot of accounting), and the effects of the masquerade. If it's "some people are somewhat stronger, faster and more attractive than average because they descend from Apollo", it's easy to hide because the most visible effects will be something like most Olympic medalists having Greek lineage. If the masquerade is about vampires going around killing people, keeping it secret is a lot harder because the existence of a cast of superhuman killers will leave traces, patterns in the murders, physical evidence, recordings, etc.

It might be possible to hide it for some time, especially with mind control, memory altering and financial or administrative power. But there's not system that will give high odds of keeping the masquerade secret in a modern world for more than a few years.
