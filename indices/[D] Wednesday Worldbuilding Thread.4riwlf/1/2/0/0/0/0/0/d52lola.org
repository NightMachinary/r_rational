Of course, the really /brutal/ way to enforce a Masquerade is to have a setting wherein, if the Masquerade gets broken, then /bad stuff happens/.

One such setting is El Goonish Shive, where there exists a masquerade to hide the existence of magic - and, more importantly, to hide /how incredibly EASY it is to get magic/ once you know it exists.

And the reason for the Masquerade is that people who get magic wind up with spells that fit their personality. As one character puts it; who do you think will end up getting the /really/ violent and destructive spells?

When the people maintaining the Masquerade can point at Pompeii and say "That's what happened the last time the mask slipped", then almost everyone has /really/ good reason to work hard at keeping the secret.
