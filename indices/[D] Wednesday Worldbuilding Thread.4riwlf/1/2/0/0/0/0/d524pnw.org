Sure. Personally, I've never liked masquerades, because they're always more of a writer's trick to say "Look, this takes place in reality, except you never realized it because it was kept secret!", than actually thought-out worldbuilding.

Like, there's nothing unrealistic about keeping a secret. It happens all the time. But keeping a secret shared by thousands/millions of people, who might live among those they're supposed to hide from, for hundreds/thousands of years? It's hard, it's expensive, it's probably not going to work, and it'll create loads of problems when the bubble inevitably pops. It's almost never worth the handwavy benefits it's stated to have. And the way the masquerade forms is never clearly explained, and usually boils down to "And then people stopped believing in fairies even though the number of fairies remained exactly constant." A reductionist approach to "what would we do if we were people with these magical powers" gives something very different from "let's spend the next centuries in hiding!"
