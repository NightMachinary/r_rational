So something I've been thinking about recently is how you could plausibly keep something like the Harry Potter verse hidden. I don't think the Obliviators portrayed in the books be nearly enough. That kind of localized mind magic would always have problems with missed people convincing a large number of others.

On the other hand, this is clearly a universe with anti-memes in the style of SCP (forgive me I forget exactly what they called those things). Many charms work on this principle most notably the Fidelius Charm ignoring for the moment that it isn't used nearly as often as it ought to be given it's properties.

There's also the other side of things which is the massive lack of culture flow form the muggle world to wizards. Yea I get that they're separated but there ought to be more flow. Somebody who's studying them should have a basic understanding at least. The only way you end up with something like we see in the books is with spell work. Something's prevent the worlds mixing. If I were to guess something related to the Fidelius Charm preventing muggles from learning of the existence of wizards and preventing wizards learning much about muggles and also possibly giving them a level of protection. The amount of crime aimed at muggles given wizards can wipe memories again seems unreasonably low.
