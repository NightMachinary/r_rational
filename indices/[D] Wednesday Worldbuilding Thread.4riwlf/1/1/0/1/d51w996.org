A good example I've seen is the movie Oculus. The mirror can control people's perceptions and actions, so everyone thinks the victims are insane and they often agree. The entire film is about an attempt to prove the mirror is haunted, but it's intelligent enough to fight back. I don't normally like horror movies, but this one was terrifying and surprisingly rational.

In Genius the reason mad science can't be proven is because the effects can't be replicated, showing them off to people turns them in to mad scientists or Igor-like creatures, and when the gadgets are examined they tend to explode. The central personal conflict of the setting, besides dealing with psychosis, is being torn between science and pseudoscience that works.
