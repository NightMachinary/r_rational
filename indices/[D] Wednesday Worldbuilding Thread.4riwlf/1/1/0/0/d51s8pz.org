  How can you do that? If you put the supernatural in the story, then it affects the story's world.

I think he answered it.

  throw out the idea of objective reality in your setting.

If you really throw out objective reality, then it could be that there isn't a single unified true state of the world, and there isn't a single true history and there isn't anything making one future more probable than another in an objective sense, and there definitely isn't a single unified model that can explain reality at all phenomenological levels. Everyone's subjective probabilities are different. The mundane reality is an island of stability, or rather meta-stability, it asserts itself because [insert whatever general metaphysical rule comes close to being true in the setting: mundane reality is mathematically simpler, mundane reality is commonly agreed upon, mundane reality is enforced by powerful supernatural entities, etc.]. For the average person, any evidence of the supernatural they could try to find will have more parsimonious mundane explanations because the very metaphysics of reality is enforcing such an apparent explanation. Mages/wizard/witches/mad scientists are the few humans able to overcome this mechanic [depending on the setting by force of belief/will, contact with a higher power, ability to outsmart reality itself, etc.]
