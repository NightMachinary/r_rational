I'll point you to the Long Earth series by Terry Pratchett and Steven Baxter, and the Merchant Princes series by Charles Stross.

In Long Earth, the dimensional travel device is cheap and commonplace. The worlds it can access are arranged in a line, and you can make one "step" East or West every 15 minutes or so (it causes nausea). You don't move through space - all the parallel worlds are Earth, with the same geography. It's a plot point that a few universes don't have Earths - those effectively prevent unprotected people from travelling past that point. Eventually, the Gaps are used for cheap space travel, and they incidentally violate conservation of energy.

In Merchant Princes, there's only a handful of worlds that are accessible (two or three so far, but I've only read the first couple of books). Only the protagonist's extended family can world-walk, but their carrying capacity is enough to bring one other person along. Again, all the worlds are geographically Earth and you don't move through space, and there's a cooldown between successive travels. There's the interesting idea of "doppelg√§ngering" a space - securing an area against transdimensional invaders by buying the corresponding space in adjacent universes and securing that. Or just by keeping your secure things on the second floor, when the corresponding space has nothing built on it. It's generally a very deconstructionist take on the whole idea, and I recommend it to people who like the sound of a rational protagonist discovering she's the lost princess of a magical kingdom.
