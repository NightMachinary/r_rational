The price and size points are easy - this is a fictional machine, you are free to say "It takes a machine this big to open a wormhole and we haven't figured out how to miniaturize it," or "A dimensional drive is powered by pure Unobtanium and it costs a million dollars to get enough for each."

If the story is long enough that someone /will/ figure out how to miniaturize it, you can make it impossible by fiat: "Whatchamacallit's Constant says that you need a wormhole generator at least 100 times as big as the wormhole you want to open," or similar.

The easiest way to prevent the "poor man's teleporter" is to require that you arrive in the other dimension at the same place you left - if you teleport from New York, you always wind up in Alternate New York and not Alternate San Francisco, so the trip doesn't get any shorter.

This can limit your story somewhat, if you want to be able to leave Earth and end up on another planet, so another option is to limit the places you can teleport from. Perhaps you can only jump through "jump nodes" that always lead to a fixed destination. Or perhaps the wormhole generators only go one way and don't come with you, so if you want to create a teleporter shortcut you'd have to move an entire ship-sized machine over to the other dimension to make the return trip, for a single destination.

To prevent trans-dimensional invasions, you have a couple of options. You could do what Schlock Mercenary does and make machines that block teleportation around them. Call them "dimensional shields" or something. You could do what Mass Effect does and make it so that the more mass you jump, the more inaccurate your jump becomes, which limits how much an invasion can send at once. You could make the wormhole take a long time to open (possibly scaling with mass), so that the defenders have plenty of time to set up an ambush if you try to teleport on top of them.
