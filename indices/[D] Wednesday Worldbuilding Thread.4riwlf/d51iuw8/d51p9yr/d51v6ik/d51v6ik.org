My personal experience with slacktivism is that while it isn't very effective, it's the best I can do. I don't have the money, energy, or ability to change things so I throw what little weight I can behind causes I want to see succeed. I admit I'm lazy, but even if I wasn't I wouldn't have any opportunities to help that I couldn't capitalize on that I don't already.

The problem with an individual trying to change the world is that, as far as I know, they can't. The world changes as people do and no one can force that change. We do what we believe is right when we can bring ourselves to do it and hope what we did helped. I don't know if there's another way to live and stories of heroism remind us to keep fighting.
