There are different ways to write rational fiction.

You can take a reconstructionist approach, where you see this trope (or genre) that people like and try to have it make sense somehow -- that's completely valid. But you can also take the deconstructionist approach and tear down a trope (or genre) to expose its weak points.

I think superheroes-fighting-petty-crime is generally a bad trope. It gives people warm fuzzies, sure, and /maybe/ inspires them toward being good (more likely, it short-circuits the altruistic reward pathways in the brain), but it's ultimately a model of charity that exaggerates all of the worst aspects of charity-as-warm-fuzzies or charity-as-signaling. It's ineffective altruism. One of the things that people like about rational fiction is that it's willing to examine things like that. There's a connection between Superman pulling a kitten down from a tree and slacktivist culture that you don't often see pointed out; to my mind that's one of the reasons that rational fiction exists. (And yes, you still need to make a satisfying story, but you can do that without doing a reconstruction.)
