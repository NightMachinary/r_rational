/You can take a reconstructionist approach, where you see this trope (or genre) that people like and try to have it make sense somehow -- that's completely valid. But you can also take the deconstructionist approach and tear down a trope (or genre) to expose its weak points./

I never have those as a goal of writing fanfic or stories, unless I am trying to stay faithful to the story details by trying to justify some tropes.

Otherwise, with original fic, I try to write a story about what would actually happen as a result of X, usually by what I think would happen.

I totally ignore any tropes at that point. Trope that arises will be a total accidental concern. I think it causes story to go in entirely different directions, which is rather novel.
