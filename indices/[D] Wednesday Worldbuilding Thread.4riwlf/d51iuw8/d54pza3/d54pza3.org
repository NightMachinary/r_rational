  The superhero genre is about as irrational as they come.

I would disagree with this, at least in part. Marvel / DC superhero stories are irrational, yes, but I think it's perfectly possible to do a rational superhero story. I worked pretty hard to come up with one when I was writing The Change Storms series, and I think I succeeded. ([[http://patreon.com/davidstorrs][Free download]] of The Change Storms: Induction if you want to check my work.) The elements of superhero storms that I had to work around, and the solutions I found, included:

- Where do superpowers come from?\\

Most comic book universes have a giant buffet of how to get powers -- mutant genes, alien birth, lightning, chemicals, radiation, etc. 'Alien birth' is dodgy at best and none of these others work at all -- in reality, if you get hit by lightning you just die, you don't suddenly have the ability to run at the speed of light.

There's two solutions that I see: don't explain it at all, or come up with a paranormal answer and just implicitly admit that it's a story premise and therefore not necessarily realistic.

My answer was "probability storms" -- in their area of effect they render nigh-impossible things (e.g. photons condensing out of the quantum foam in a collimated beam) certain. If you're caught in a storm a piece of it can get stuck inside you, which is what gives you your superpowers. There's a lot of handwavium here, and a lot of the powers don't hold up under an "could this happen under real physics given infinite luck?" exam. I'm fine with that. Any story should be allowed its premise, as long as it remains consistent and rational within that.

- Why do superheroes and -villains wear spandex?

Marvel and DC said "because it makes drawing the human body easier."

Strong Female Protagonist said "at first they did this because it was a cached thought about how superpowered people behave, but now they're moving away from it."

I said "they don't wear spandex."

- Why do superheroes and -villains fight / commit crime?

Supervillains committing crime is easy -- they have power and they are inclined to be criminals. Motivations are as easy to find as a police blotter.

Superheros fighting crime is harder. There are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-life_superhero][real-life superheroes]], so clearly it's a thing that some people are motivated to do. The vast majority would more likely go into law-enforcement, fire/rescue, the military, or some other community-service-oriented career.

Then there's the question of regulation. Marvel and DC have done a lot with this. The basic superhero concept is of a vigilante, someone who is breaking the law in order to preserve it. People might look aside as long as the hero is doing no harm, but eventually there's going to be calls for registration, and those calls are eventually going to be backed up with force of arms.

Because of my initial premise (p-storms change you, you get powers when a storm fragment gets caught inside you), I had to acknowledge that being around an empowered individual would eventually cause other people to get superpowers. I wanted powers to be rare, so I decided that p-storms are most likely to just kill you but, if they don't, they will probably change you into a bodyhorror form at the same time as they give you powers. Anyone with superpowers (bodyhorrored or not) is a walking p-storm, so being near them is going to Change you as well. Given this, there was zero chance that powers wouldn't be regulated. Therefore, all powered individuals in the Change Storms universe are either criminals, in an internment camp, or in a government paramilitary group intended to deal with natural disasters, supervillains, etc.

- What is the motivation of the (presumably superpowered) antagonist? Why aren't they using their powers to make a fortune in industry instead of robbing banks?

My villains weren't bank robbers, they were (depending on who's telling it) terrorists or freedom fighters. They had broken out of the "Relocation Facilities" (aka internment camps) where Changed people had been put to keep them away from normals and were now trying to bring about a societal shift so that the Changed could have a better life.

Again, you can [[http://patreon.com/davidstorrs][read the book]] to see if I succeeded, but I would contend that it's very possible to write a rational superhero story.
