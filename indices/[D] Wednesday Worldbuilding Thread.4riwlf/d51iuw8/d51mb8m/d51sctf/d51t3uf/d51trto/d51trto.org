That sets up an interesting choice... working for the government or using a power for maximum efficiency resulting in a loss of power would be a important conflict. Once the government starts to catch on to how templates work, it would be a trade-off between PR to the general public, having efficient heroes, having powerful heroes and dealing with all the general government stuff like bureaucracy, tax dollars, and corruption.
