I mean, those two examples arose entirely independent of the superhero genre, and even in the real world there are lot of various religious or semi-religious practices intended to imitate mythic characters and thus replicate their feats, so I hardly think the idea comes out of left-field.

A way to make it feel less excuse-y, I guess, would be have there be more than just 'hero' and 'villain' templates, and to remember that, besides people who are possibly insane, a character is different from the ideal they're replicating. Which conveniently also sets up some conflict over choosing to sacrifice the power or to make compromise.
