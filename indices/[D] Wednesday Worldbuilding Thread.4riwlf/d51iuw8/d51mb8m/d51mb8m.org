An interesting proposal I've heard for the strange behavior of super-heroes is that it is driven by a system similar to Mantling from TES, or Archetypes from Unknown Armies. Essentially, there are timeless prototypes that exist in the universe, which allow for an actor with the right qualities, following the right script, to do things that are otherwise impossible (with escalating levels of impossibility for a more complete replication of the prototype).
