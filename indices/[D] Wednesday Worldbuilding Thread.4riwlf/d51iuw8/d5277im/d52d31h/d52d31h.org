I used to feel the same way about Superman since I didn't really like superheroes as a kid while I found economics facinating. It wasn't until I discovered the appeal of superhero stories that I understood why the examples in that article never happen. Because then it wouldn't be a story about a man who uses his abilities to be a good samaritan, it would be about a man who uses his abilities for a career.
