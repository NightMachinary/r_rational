It still doesn't make a lot of sense. Even if you find super-good rationalizations for your "Keep all the plot-relevant things secret from the entire world" bottom line, they're usually shaky.

For instance, you could easily argue that a masquerade make people with magic powers more dangerous and harmful, since it's harder to make organized institutions to track the renegades and fix their damage, and they have an easier time hiding.
