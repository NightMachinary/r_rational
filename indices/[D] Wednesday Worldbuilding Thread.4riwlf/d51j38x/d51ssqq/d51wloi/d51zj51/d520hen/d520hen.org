My basic contention is that it requires large scale mind control. You can't get by on a case by case basis, you need something that completely eliminates certain knowledge. You want a situation where certain thoughts can't be had or at a minimum certain things can't be remembered.

Alternatively you can get by with a god like entity working on a case by case basis.

Keep in mind the goal isn't to prevent all knowledge of something, just prevent the knowledge from becoming commonly known.
