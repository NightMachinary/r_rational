I feel like "I must have seen something else" or "nobody will believe me" would be pretty ineffective at maintaining a masquerade. For one, as xkcd pointed out, almost everyone is carrying a camera everywhere at all times now, so material (fakeable, but attention-worthy) proof is becoming easy to produce on demand.

But most importantly, the reason people are quick to dismiss crazy alien sightings and other extraordinary things they/other people saw as not being surnatural is that the things in question /are actually obviously not surnatural/. Like, if you have a farmer who says he saw a dark shape going from tree to tree at night, while he was drunk, shot it and heard a metal sound, and says he's seen an alien robot... then your first reaction is to think "No, this doesn't sound anything like an alien encounter and a lot like you shooting at an owl, missing, and hitting a bucket instead". You can confirm it by looking for bullet holes in metal things near the alleged sighting.

On the other hand, if someone says he's seen a knight on a unicorn cut someone in two with a sword in broad daylight... well, it's really hard to mistake a guy on a horse with a baseball bat for a knight with a sword, especially once you've seen it go through someone. Sure, the guy could be intoxicated or lying for attention, and in some cases /will/ shut up by fear of social stigma. But if they're socially comfortable, or don't care about the backslash, or have a reputation for honesty and sobriety, or other material proof to back it up (like the person they've seen killed is reported missing, or portal-shaped scorch marks around the portal the knight disappeared in), they will talk, because seeing a knight with a sword on a unicorn is /not/ something you just forget overnight.
