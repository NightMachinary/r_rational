You don't have to worry about missing people you should have mindwiped so long as no one will believe them. There are people who say they've seen ghosts or angels, and I dismiss them pretty much on reflex. A fair number of those you missed will chalk what they saw up to being a fever dream or hallucination.

Edit: I've actually got a story I'm (idly) working on where this is the case:

  On the whole, the masquerade was surprisingly easy to maintain. The mind was a wonderful, complex thing, and one of the things that it was very good at was matching patterns. If something deviated from the pattern, the mind simply glossed over it. A gleaming sword became an aluminum bat. A unicorn became a horse. People would dismiss what they saw as a hallucination, a trick of the light, or a practical joke. Even if they had some hidden suspicions of the truth, and never fully fell for the pattern matches the brain offered up, the average brain was also very good at conformity. You didn't mention the man with the wand, because you didn't want the social stigma that came with that. There was nothing magical about any of this; that was simply how people were.

  Sometimes, in exceptional cases, the twin friends of pattern matching and conformity simply weren't up to the job. And that was where the Department of Memory Management and Modification came in.
