Agreed, the setting doesn't make much sense when you look at it too hard. The only justification I can come up with is that the whole series is told from Harry's perspective, and he isn't exactly the brightest kid. We're just hearing what he's learned from personal experience since he never bothered to study the wizarding world.

The Masquerade is such a common trope, however, that I'd love to find a way of having it make sense. How can you possibly keep an entire world a secret right under the public's nose, let alone keep it up forever? The SCP Foundation uses the trope as Fridge Horror when we discover reality is a lie created by , but that isn't applicable to every story.

The only solution I have for when you don't want to fall back on conspiracy, is to throw out the idea of objective reality in your setting. Make the supernatural real, but impossible to objectively prove. Mental effects are the easiest to do with this, but Genius: The Transgression does a remarkable job of making the unscientific true.
