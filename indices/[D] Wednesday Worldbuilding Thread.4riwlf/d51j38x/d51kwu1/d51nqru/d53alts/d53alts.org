Just make the people / forces hiding it powerful enough.

For an example look at Nobilis 2ed. Your notes and memories will change on you. History it self will conspire to hide it's nature from you. Your sensory impressions will seem like madness to society. The Ombsmen will silence you.

And if all that doesn't work, you will be eaten by an ogre.

And that is all and only issues that are well below PC power levels.
