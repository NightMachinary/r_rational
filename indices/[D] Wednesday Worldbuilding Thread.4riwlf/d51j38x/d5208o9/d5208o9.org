A Masquerade is comparatively natural when the magic world is physically separate from the real one. Perhaps like a parallel universe. And magic people don't commonly come and go between worlds, so their presence is fairly easy to hide, particularly if they need some sort of travel visa so the magic government knows what they need to cover up.

I thought Harry Potter was going in this direction at first, with places like Platform 9 3/4 and Diagon Alley and Hogwarts being completely inaccessible to Muggles, but it eventually gave up on that.
