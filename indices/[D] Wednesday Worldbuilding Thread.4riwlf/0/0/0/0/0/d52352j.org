The fact that heroes aren't well organized brings me back to the idea of institutionalizing heroism. Most superheroes don't make a career out of saving people because they just help in their spare time, which authors put in to make their situation more relatable to our own. Don't get me wrong, there have been plenty of times where it's stupid and should be done better, but that's why it persists.

When you read a story about people doing their job, even if it's about helping others, then you don't see them as good samaritans. I love the show Sirens, those people are fantastic paramedics, but they don't inspire me to help people in my life because their situation is not applicable to mine. It's their job, and it is a very good job I will always thank them for doing, but it's not my job and never will be.

The lesson every superhero teaches people is to do what's right when you can. We don't love them just because they give us ideals to aspire too, but because we see ourselves in them. Police come fight crime for us, but superheroes are us. They aren't out there helping people all the time, but neither are we for the same reasons they are, and that makes it all the more important that we help when we can.
