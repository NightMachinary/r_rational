Arguably, the effective altruism movement is a response to that. Nobody's asking you to personally save the world; giving money is more than enough, if you give it to a charity that's efficient and doing something that will help.

Which brings us back to superheroes. Superheroes always have to personally save the world. Which make sense when they're the only person remotely qualified to do so, but in most superhero shared-universes that's not the case. Batman could enlist Superman's help in fighting the Joker (most of the time). Even when there's organisations of established for the specific purpose of handling supervillain threats, calling them in is a rare dramatic twist to heighten tension rather than the superheroic equivalent of calling 911. "Superhero teams" have more in common with D&D adventuring parties than any peacekeeping group. And all this has good narrative reasons behind it, but it's not how actual people work.

I don't care what your powers are, if a spandex-clad minotaur is robbing a bank you don't handle him yourself. You call the police, and /then/ if they need your help you can offer it. You don't have to solve all the world's problems by yourself; there's almost always someone else working on that problem who could use your help.
