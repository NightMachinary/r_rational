I was under the assumption that the setting treated superheroes as a transitional state. There was a need for heroes and people answered the call, but the state of affairs changed so they didn't need to rely on good samaritans anymore. What I know for sure is the characters acknowledge that putting on masks to fight crime was a good idea at the time, it just wasn't the fix-all solution that they thought it would be.
