So, I am thinking about trans-dimensional travel mechanics. Specifically, I am looking for general inexploitability.

It has to be something that is: difficult to build; not so easy that eventually a car factory can't simply build and mass produce, yet built by shipyards. It also should not be easy to mount an invasion or use it as a poor's man teleporter, and so on.

One thing I did think of is to have the trans-dimensional machine's navigational capability tied to the main protagonist as a unique ability. Only individuals like him can travel to anywhere in the multiverse at any distance in any dimension or use it as a poor's man teleporter.

To some extent, he could show others how to travel the multiverse, even building technological devices to allow navigation, but it's either impossible or required a really long time to unlock all of his secrets as a person with trans-dimensional travel.

The other approach I have is that the TD drive only cross the dimension next to it. If it open a gate on Earth to another universe like our, it's going to open up where Earth would be. Though I supposed you could open up to a universe where there is no Earth. I wonder what effects it would be? I suspect it will be exploited for all its worth.

Then there's the 'cost' of building a TDM. I don't want it to be too casual to the point that people can just buy a car off a parking lot and use it to travel to other realities like nobody's business. It should cost about ten million dollars, the price of a container ship or is at least as expensive as an Abram tank(4.3 million dollars per unit). There may be other methods of trans-dimensional travel that isn't so expensive, but at no point that people should be able to casually explore new universes. This also make it easy for me to write stories since I don't have to worry about contacting new civilization all the time.

Limitations is also a good way to add complexity and plot tension. Maybe there should be chokepoints that allow easy point of entrance for trans-dimensional travelers, but it's otherwise difficult to travel there otherwise?
