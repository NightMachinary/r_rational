/In Long Earth, the dimensional travel device is cheap and commonplace. The worlds it can access are arranged in a line, and you can make one "step" East or West every 15 minutes or so (it causes nausea). You don't move through space - all the parallel worlds are Earth, with the same geography. It's a plot point that a few universes don't have Earths - those effectively prevent unprotected people from travelling past that point. Eventually, the Gaps are used for cheap space travel, and they incidentally violate conservation of energy./

While interesting, it's not something I will use in my story, since I intended for trans-dimensional travel to be hard, and will be exploring only a few worlds for the sake of managing complexity.

/In Merchant Princes, there's only a handful of worlds that are accessible (two or three so far, but I've only read the first couple of books)./

While the conceit is roughly the same, I also do not intend to write about a lost princess of a magical kingdom.
