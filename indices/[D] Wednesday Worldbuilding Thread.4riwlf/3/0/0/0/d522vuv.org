  I will be exploring only a few worlds for the sake of managing complexity.

Good call :)

Who's your protagonist? If travel between worlds isn't for everyone, he or she will need to be someone involved in it at the start of the story.

Is "trans-dimensional travel" a misleading name? A dimension isn't a universe, it's an axis along which universes are measured. You're not travelling across dimensions. And coming up with your own name for the process is an opportunity to do some worldbuilding.
