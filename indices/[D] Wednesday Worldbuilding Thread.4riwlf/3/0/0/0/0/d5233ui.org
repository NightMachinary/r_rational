/Who's your protagonist? If travel between worlds isn't for everyone, he or she will need to be someone involved in it at the start of the story./

My protagonist is a well off multi-millionaire engineer that I developed as an OC in a badly written fanfic. But there will be more characterization.

/Is "trans-dimensional travel" a misleading name? A dimension isn't a universe, it's an axis along which universes are measured. You're not travelling across dimensions. And coming up with your own name for the process is an opportunity to do some worldbuilding./

Everyone knows what trans-dimensional travel is supposed to be about, and I am sticking to it.
