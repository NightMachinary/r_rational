There are a few ways to go about this.

- location restriction (leaving from) -- you can only leave from a specific (inconvenient) place(s)
- location restriction (going to) -- you can only go to a specific (inconvenient) place(s)
- personal restriction (user) -- only certain people can cross dimensions
- personal restriction (sender) -- only certain people can sent people across
- equipment necessity -- (self explanatory)
- energy necessity -- (self explanatory)
- cooperation (inter-world) necessity -- requiring people on both sides to initiate travel

Of those, the most interesting (in my opinion) are location restrictions and cooperation necessity.

With location restrictions, control of specific areas matters, leading to conflict (and the possibility of restricting effective transport.) For a portal fantasy, these are useful because they can explain why more people haven't discovered the trans-dimensional travel (it's in a hard to reach place) or provide conflict for the hero (the places you get transported into are completely distinct from the places you can get transported out of.)

Cooperation necessity can be used in a variety of different ways. Perhaps a ritual has to be performed at the same place on both worlds, so while cults might try to do it on either world every few years, decades, or centuries, it's very rare that both sides do so at the same time. From a plot conflict standpoint, then, all that needs to happen is one side being prevented from completing the ritual. Or alternatively, if it's something that's only discovered recently, perhaps it requires advanced technology on one or both sides of the portal. (for example, particle colliders count as artificial signals for interdimensional travel spells.)

I'm pretty biased towards portal fantasies here, but that's because I spent a lot of time thinking of how best to make one when I still cared about the mlp fandom.
