  I'm very curious about what their 'modern' programming languages look like.

I'm kinda leaving it deliberately underspecified because I don't feel competent to predict the evolution of programming languages accurately beyond the very near term. Roughly the idea in my head (which should be considered more "author headcanon" than canon) is that rather than having a small set of languages, they have a whole "tree" of languages which start from simple cores and compile down to the next level, with an awful lot of formal verification and analysis happening at each translation level, and an awful lot of focus on interoperability standards.

It would be absolutely maddening to work with unassisted, but fortunately they don't ever work with it unassisted.

  But it really seems like 90% of their job is just thinking, which seems to be a pretty sweet deal if you can get it.

This too can be yours for the low low price of 10,000 years of toolchain development. ;-)
