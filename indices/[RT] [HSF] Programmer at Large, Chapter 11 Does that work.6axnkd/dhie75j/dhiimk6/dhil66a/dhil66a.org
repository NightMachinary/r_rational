My guess is this is it, since learning that PTY stands for "pseudoteletype" begs the question "what is a teletype" and you pretty much inevitably wind up learning the history of early time-sharing systems, the rise of glass TTYs, the history of terminal emulation and the properties of PTY devices as they are exposed through and used by POSIX-compliant systems ("What's POSIX?" asks Arthur and the can of worms goes on.) It's all interesting history and useful for modern programmers using POSIX systems, but would probably eat up the rest of Arthur's afternoon without getting them closer to solving their problem.
