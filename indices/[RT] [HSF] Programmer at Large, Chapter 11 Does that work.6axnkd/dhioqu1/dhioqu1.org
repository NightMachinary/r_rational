I'm very curious about what their 'modern' programming languages look like.

Obviously, they've grown and changed as time went on, and they have techniques (and artificial aides) we don't have presently.

But it really seems like 90% of their job is just thinking, which seems to be a pretty sweet deal if you can get it.
