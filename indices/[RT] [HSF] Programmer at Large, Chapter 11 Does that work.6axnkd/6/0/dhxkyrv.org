eeh. In a contemporary software /development/ shop, yes, absolutely. The protag is not,primarily, a software developer, though; they are more of a software maintenance engineer.

Even in contemporary reality, programmers who maintain legacy enterprise software systems, systems that major corporations depend on, this "if it ain't broke don't fix it, in fact, don't even look at it funny" rule is often effectively law. And that's just when large amounts of money are at stake - when people's lives are at stake, you don't go tearing down essential bits of code that've worked reliably for decades just because they're ugly.
