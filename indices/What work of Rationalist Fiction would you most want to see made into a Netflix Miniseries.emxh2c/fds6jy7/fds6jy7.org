Worth The Candle.

It would be really hard to do, but it has so much Hollywood loves to do. A zombie fighting opening as a "hook" for non-genre fans. Those flashbacks that have been all the rage since "Lost". An excuse to use attractive twenty-something actors playing High School kids. Some parts of it could come off really spooky if well done in a visual medium. I could see it as a David Lynch project.\\
And that whole "what is real?" thing that annoys me in written mediums seems to bother me less in movies.

I want to say "Mother of Learning" but that could come off very generic, and I'm not sure how redoing the same day shot in different ways would work on TV.
