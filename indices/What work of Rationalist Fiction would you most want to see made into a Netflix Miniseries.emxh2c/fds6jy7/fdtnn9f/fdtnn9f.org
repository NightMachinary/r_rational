Worth The Candle has a really solid “mystery box” (the nature of Aerb and the DM), that presumably has a good answer (I assume alexanderwales has worked out something interesting). A lot of mystery boxes ruin shows when the writers can't think of something worthwhile to put in them... (I think lost is an example of a letdown mystery box, although I haven't seen it myself. For a more recent example, the new Star Wars trilogy suffers for not having an answer to Rey's backstory planned out and foreshadowed ahead of time.)

Worth the Candle also seems to be fairly extensible in its middle sections if the show runners want to pad out a season. For instance a side quest or two could be added before the Name of the Beast plot gets kicked off while they are relaxing. Or another side quest or two right before Raven shows up for the first time. Or have the Dragon ask for an additional side quest in the most recent arc.
