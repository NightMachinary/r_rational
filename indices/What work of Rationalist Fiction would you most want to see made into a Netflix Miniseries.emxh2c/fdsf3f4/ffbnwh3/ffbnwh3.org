Hmm That might be one story that has fixed the problem of having everything in the main characters head because Harry says what he's thinking a lot. Mainly bouncing ideas and arguments off of other people.

If you could get an animator I'd love to work on that as a project. Could film it actually. Although spells and stuff would be hard. Sounds fun. I'm up for it.
