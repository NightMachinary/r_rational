I /do/ agree that a Worm series could become the next Big Thing, but not before Wildbow manages to get Worm traditionally published -- which, by the way, anyone's got any idea of how's that coming along? -- Unless some big executive is secretly a fan I don't think it will be given that much of a chance by studios if it remains only a webnovel. Both because of how big in lengh and production it would have to be and also because a webnovel is more likely to be dismissed than a traditionally published one.
