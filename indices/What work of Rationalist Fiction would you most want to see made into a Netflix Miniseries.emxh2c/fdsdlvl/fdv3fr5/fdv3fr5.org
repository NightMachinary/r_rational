I could actually see stuff like that really happening. Mother of Learning too. I mean, in Japan many web novels have gotten turned into light novels and then anime in the space of a few years. It's not without precedent, they're original works, acquiring the rights would probably be pretty cheap, and both superheroes and fantasy are hot genres right now in TV and movies.
