  Do you have any recommendations for stuff like worth the candle?
#+end_quote

There is nothing like /Worth The Candle./ It combines several elements that don't go together. Wrestling with grief, hard magic systems, existential dread, discussion of Campbell's philosophy. I can think of stories that do any one of them. Which part appealed to you? It would make it easier to come up with suggestions.
