You need to keep up the spirit, but a lot of MoL feels like... the literary equivalent of grind, I guess. I get why it makes sense but you could try to cut it to the essential stuff that better translates to the screen, for example

obviously Zorian's mind mage training is essential and you need to get a feel for how it works, and that's also easily a fun thing to show thanks to him having entertaining teachers like Enthusiastic Seeker of Novelty and Xvim. However I think the stuff that would be really interesting to convey and wouldn't feel boring even to a more general public IMHO are the high concepts about slowing down time, the loop and its meaning and purpose, the dilemma of Zorian killing his old self by inhabiting his body, all that stuff. And of course his personal progress as a functioning human, his fucked up family life, and so on. There's plenty to keep from the novel while adapting it so that it isn't for 90% mages sitting around in a lab talking magic.
