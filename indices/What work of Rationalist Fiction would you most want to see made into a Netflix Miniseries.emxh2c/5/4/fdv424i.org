  I want to say "Mother of Learning" but that could come off very generic, and I'm not sure how redoing the same day shot in different ways would work on TV.

IMHO MoL would work, with some heavy reworking. It definitely should be cut down in size, removing a lot of the details of the training and magic. But a TV show about a time-looping wizard fighting a vaster conspiracy? I think that stuff would work. You just pick and choose the scenes to adapt and suddenly it becomes a lot denser and thrilling, with a cliffhanger almost every episode. Sure, the setting may appear a bit generic, but more to experienced fantasy purveyors than the general TV audience, and anyway that'd just be a way to get you quickly into the setting so you can focus on the story itself.
