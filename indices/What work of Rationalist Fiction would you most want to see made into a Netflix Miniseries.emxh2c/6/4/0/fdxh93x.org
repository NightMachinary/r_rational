  I might be probably am in the minority, but I really wouldn't mind watching a film or series that was heavy on the thought-process voiceovers.

"Show don't tell" is how the really good writers do it...but I've seen so many mediocre writers try it and fail, leaving us with no idea what is going on. I'm willing to put up with infodumps and voiceovers if it is the price for an original setting. Voiceovers worked fine with Dexter and The Wonder Years.
