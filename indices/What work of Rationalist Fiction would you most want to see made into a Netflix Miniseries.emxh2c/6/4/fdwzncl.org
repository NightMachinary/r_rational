I +might be+ probably am in the minority, but I really wouldn't mind watching a film or series that was heavy on the thought-process voiceovers.

A lot of thought can be presented visually, anyway, e.g. the character is thinking "if I do X then I would fail because Y" the film could show us that scene as the character imagines it--it doesn't just have to just show us the character sitting in a chair the whole time.
