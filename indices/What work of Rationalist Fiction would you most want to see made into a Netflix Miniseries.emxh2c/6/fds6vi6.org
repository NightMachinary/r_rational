I'm really not sure how to do that stuff well on TV. A /big/ draw of rationalist stuff for me is seeing the main character lay out their thought process, how they arrive at their conclusions and decisions. On TV, that'd have to be done by voiceover, and to such an extent it'd get obnoxious.

But then again I'm a grouch who barely watches any movies, so maybe that's different for most people.
