  On TV, that'd have to be done by voiceover, and to such an extent it'd get obnoxious.

Ah. Here we get to one of the issues about what you want out of rationalist fiction. Do you want a character quietly being reasonable, the absence of moments when you want to throw stuff at the TV? Or do you want a character loudly being logical and rational? I tend to go for the former myself. I've encountered to many characters talking a good game and then acting like idiots.
