  I read through this entire thread, but simultaneously cringe, because I

  know that whichever series gets picked won't be adapted well, and an increased fandom size would ruin the great discussion we have going.

Well, good news! I have zero pull with Netflix. :-)

It used to be all adaptations were terrible. Lately things have changed...streaming services and HBO will occasionally do an adaptation that is actually good for "street cred". A Geek Street Cred project is the only way a good adaption of these things could happen.

As far as the community getting too big..., yes, at some point a community gets too big. We are a long way from that. Do we really think a Metropolitan Man TV series on Netflix would draw in enough people to make this group too big?
