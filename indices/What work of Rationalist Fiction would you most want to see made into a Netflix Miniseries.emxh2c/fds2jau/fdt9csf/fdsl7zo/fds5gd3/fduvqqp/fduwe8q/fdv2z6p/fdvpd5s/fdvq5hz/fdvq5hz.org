Do you know who voices Goten in that small gag they made with him in the Android 13 movie?

Anyway, this also reminds me that in the original Japanese Goku, Gohan and Goten are all voiced by Masako Nozawa, who definitely deserves kudos because if there's an image funnier than a voice actor screaming their lungs out in the recording room every time one of those three powers up, it's knowing that voice actor to be the most nice looking Japanese old lady ever.
