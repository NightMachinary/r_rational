I read through this entire thread, but simultaneously cringe, because I /know/ that whichever series gets picked won't be adapted well, and an increased fandom size would ruin the great discussion we have going.

If we could avoid that mess, I'd pick everything here to be animated or done in live action (depending on the story).
