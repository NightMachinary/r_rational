I think "show, don't tell" definitely should always be the way to go, and if anything, all adaptations from page to visual media tend to ditch a lot of internal monologue and replace it with subtler cues. If it's really necessary, you can always make it so the protagonist has someone else to bounce their ideas off, so their thinking process doesn't seem completely obscure. That's what adaptations do.
