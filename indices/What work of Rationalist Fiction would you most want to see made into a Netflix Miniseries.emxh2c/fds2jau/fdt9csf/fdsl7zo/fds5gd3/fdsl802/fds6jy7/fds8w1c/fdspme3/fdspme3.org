Yeah, I love MoL a lot but generally those types of sequences are taken care of in a montage, really quickly, because the repetition does make them boring. While reading we don't really "see" the scenery being the same every time in the book but I'd bet we'd get tired of it in the show. Also, the ticking clock aspect would be difficult to pull off. It didn't matter so much in the book but having the characters tell us where all the time skips were would get pretty (show don't tellish) old fast.

The most successful (i.e. only) movie or show I've seen with this premise is groundhog day and that's because it used comedy to make the repetition itself funny.

I didn't really like worth the candle because I got sick of the stat based litrpgs pretty quick. My housemate can't get enough of them though.
