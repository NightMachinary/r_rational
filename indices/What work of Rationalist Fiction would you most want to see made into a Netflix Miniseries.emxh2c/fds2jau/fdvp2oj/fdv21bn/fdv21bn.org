Yeah, my thoughts too. It'd be perfect. It's rationalist but it's not in an /intrusive/ way, if you know what I mean - it just works as a great alternate viewpoint Superman story, which also happens to have rationalist themes, and a general ethical discussion about the implications of the sheer existence of overwhelming power, whoever wields it, that I think many people could find very relevant. On one hand, Luthor has a point, on the other, ironically, he doesn't realise how much he himself is causing harm with /his/ equally disproportionate power to save the world from Superman's.
