As if series don't sometimes do stuff like break the fourth wall and talk their thoughts to the viewers. Like Daybreak for a recent example. The MC just starts talking to the camera.

There is no problem with just talking the thoughts as long as it's clear that it's internal. Or voiceover the thoughts while the character looks like she is thinking.
