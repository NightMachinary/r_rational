To be honest, I dont think it would work outside of fanfiction. Like, its definitely a great fanfic, but one of the most significants part of the fic is the thoughts of the characters, which cant even be replaced with dialogue because of how the characters had to adapt to Superman's super hearing.

Dialogue is also another problem for the same reason considering how at one point the majority of it is replaced by talking in foreing languages, using signals with their hands and writing things down.

Together these would result in the series being both voice over heavy and with a lot of subtitles, neither of which is very popular.

Some things like what happened to the Governors Children or Superman's murder of Falcone could also be received very badly, because it's not the kind of thing people easily accepts as being part of a Superman story.
