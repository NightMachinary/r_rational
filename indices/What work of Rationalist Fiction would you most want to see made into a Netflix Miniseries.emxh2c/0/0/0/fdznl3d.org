You should probably add in some spoiler tags.

There would be a number of changes that you would probably want to make in the course of adaptation, some of which were considered during the course of writing /Metropolitan Man/.

If there are rights issues, you can always go for an obvious Superman expy, a la /The Boys/ or /Brightburn/ -- there are so many Superman stand-ins that it's almost standard practice. When I was originally writing it, way back in the very first draft, it was an unoriginal Superman copy for a few chapters, but I figure if you're going to be writing a story that's talking about Superman, better to just talk about Superman unless someone is stopping you. (And you're right that Superman is a divisive figure in part because people have their own interpretations of the character, which makes a movie/show with a decidedly non-standard Superman a risk. Especially in the post-Snyder era.)

As far as other potential edits, there are changes that you could make that would appease some people but (IMO) blunt the story somewhat. I tried drafts where Superman doesn't kill Falcone but instead stands by while the governor publicly murders him or essentially oversees Falcone get hanged by a lynch mob. I think those are both much weaker, and you'd probably have to weaken the rest of the plot as a consequence, but they're more in keeping with Superman's traditional character.

There are also edits that you would /likely/ have to do for content, but that's easy, because you can say everything with implication, having the actual reality of it off-screen or only communicated to the audience in how the characters react.

--------------

In terms of showing thought, I actually think that's easier to do than a lot of people give credit for. Breaking Bad did it really well, with a general formula of silently showing setup, planning, and preparation that's divorced from the desired end result, leaving the end of the scene as the culmination of the plan which reveals what all the planning/thinking was about. This /generally/ works, so long as the thoughts are resulting in an actionable plan, and I don't actually think that /Metropolitan Man/ has that many moments of thinking that /don't/ result in some plan or contingency going into action. Almost all of Lex discovering that lead blocks Superman's x-ray vision can be done without Luthor speaking or writing, as an example.

I think more of the problem is with Lois, actually, since /her/ thoughts don't often result in action. Lois being scared of being flown, or not wanting to hurt Superman's feelings, would have to be communicated almost entirely through acting, which is a hard thing to do while also being plausibly non-obvious to Superman himself.
