I just got back from seeing the movie.

If you read /The Economist/, you won't learn anything from the movie, but it still manages to be entertaining and suspenseful.

The one thing I didn't like were the celebrity interludes. The first one is literally just some woman in a bubble bath talking about mortgages for a while. Those bits are probably aimed at a different audience than me.
