Yep, same person.

IMHO, Posner suffers from a sort of contrarian-disease common to many academics. In academia, sometimes you get more brownie points for being /clever/ than for being /correct/.

A defense of free speech along the standard lines will bring out a big yawn. An attack on free speech that lands more punches than you'd expect will get you an article in Slate. See also [[http://ericposner.com/more-on-anti-propaganda-laws/][Posner's response]] to the critics on free speech, which is also more persuasive than I would guessed it could be. I wonder if he plans to turn these arguments into an article for a law review.

I find him to be a valuable person to read provided one filters for the above bias. As far as The Big Short, for example, I think he has some good criticisms.
