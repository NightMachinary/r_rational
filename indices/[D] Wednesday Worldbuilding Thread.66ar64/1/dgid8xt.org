I'm sort of tinkering with an urban fantasy story along the much loved trope of monster hunters and an atypical (and rational) vampire. My worldbuilding issue right now is the monster hunter organization.

In today's world of CCTVs, mobile phones, NSA surveilance and the internet, maintaining secret headquarters for monster hunting seems difficult if not impossible. Even more so when the monsters may have additional resources.

How would you maintain a secret organization of monster hunters in a world much like today, where monsters such as vampires and demons exist, hidden from most. And how would you do to have the solution maintain an air of ancient heritage from a branch of the original Knights Templar or similar?

Next question is, how does the /monsters/ remain hidden? If the world, or even just a nation state goes to war against a small number of monsters, there can only be one result (why else would the monsters hide instead of rule?). And with the above mentioned information tools, especially the ever present cell phone vidoe cameras, how could they stay hidden?

My current line of thought is World of Darkness inspired, in that vampires have infiltrated or influences key positions in leadership and media (including YouTube) to keep the lid on, and most monster factions actively self-police to stay hidden. Does that sound feasible?

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!
