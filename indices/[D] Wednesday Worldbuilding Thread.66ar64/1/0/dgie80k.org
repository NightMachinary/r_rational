- The organisation has armour and weapons that are in some way extra-potent against monsters (blessed weapons?) but would have fitted right in with ancient European knights, so think swords and so forth

- In the modern day, members of the organisation claim to be LARPers and insist (should anyone ask) that their weapons are 'merely props'. They tend to avoid going armed into any place where carrying a sword will lead to trouble (e.g. airports).

- /Some/ anti-monster weapons (e.g. silver crucifixes - good against vampires /and/ werewolves) are not considered 'weapons' by most security personnel, and can thus be carried into airports or banks should such be necessary

- Why do the monster /hunters/ need to be secret, anyway?
