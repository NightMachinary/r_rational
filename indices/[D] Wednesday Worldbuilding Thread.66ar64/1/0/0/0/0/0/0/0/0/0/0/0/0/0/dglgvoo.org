  I think a mix is best, we humans sometimes just break. When demons put pressure on us, we sometimes break in similar ways (mental fault lines).

[[/twibeam][]] That works, too!

  I am not going with "tempt into sin" demons, more like entities that interact with humans for their own personal gain.

[[/nightmaregrin][]] And sometimes, 'own personal gain' means 'I want you to kill that guy'.

  Well, they always had this nature/wild vibe for me, and I don't see why nature loving creatures would hang out where there's mostly asphalt, concrete, plastics, processed food, car fumes, noise etc.

[[/twipride][]] Ah, so they exist, they're just not found in the same inner-city environment as your heroes. (Maybe they tend to be park rangers at wilderness preserves and so on - which means you /don't/ want to poach rhino horn in this world). Fair enough.

  Maybe there could be a singular werewolf as a unique character that for some reason has chosen to live in the city (perhaps guiding new werewolves out of the city, or some personal ageda).

[[/sunsetsneaky][]] What about working as a police dog? (Just 'cos you're a monster doesn't mean you don't enjoy a good hunt, and if the person you're hunting is a thief or murderer or similar, then you're still a good guy, right? Even if you tend to mutilate your targets?)
