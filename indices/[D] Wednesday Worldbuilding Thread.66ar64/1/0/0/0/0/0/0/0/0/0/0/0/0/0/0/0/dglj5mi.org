  So werewolves are more out of scope than non-existing.

Okay, that's fair.

  Knee-jerk reaction is too much comic relief.

Eh, doesn't /have/ to be comic relief. He can easily be a tragic figure.

...but if the idea doesn't look good to you, then it's probably better left aside.

  Which brings me back to the original question: how does vampire/demon/misc-hunters organize and operate safely with the authorities being in the pocket of the bad guys and with all the technology and surveillance of today?
#+end_quote

There's one more question that needs to be answered first. What's their motivation for monster-hunting?

Are they in this to:

- Protect innocents?
- Eliminate monsters?
- Prove the superiority of the human genome?
- They're psychopathic murderers and want to go after things that don't leave unsightly corpses?
- Xenophobia?
- Someone's offering a bounty per Monster killed?

This is certainly going to make a difference to what they do and how they operate.

  I would really like to have the trope-ish "library of ancient books" and "strange artifacts in glass boxes" because I love that stuff. But if it isn't plausible then it has to go.
#+end_quote

Easiest way to do /this/ is to have one guy who's rich. Really rich. Bruce Wayne I-have-a-private-mansion rich. And he keeps both the library and the strange artifacts in his private mansion. (But be careful - "strange artifacts" is very close to "proof-positive paranormal")

Another option is to have the ancient books and strange artifacts be in a hidden room - say, the basement of the local museum - which technically anyone can go to, except the janitor (who's one of the monster hunters) is the only one with the key and he usually locks the door.
