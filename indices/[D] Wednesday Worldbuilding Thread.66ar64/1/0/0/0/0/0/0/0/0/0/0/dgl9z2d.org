The ash idea is good! (or melt into a pool of blood wich would fit with some other ideas I have) And demons look like mental illness. Not sure I'm going to have shapeshifters but they could revert to human form when they die.

Combine that with your previous idea about monsters pulling strings from the shadows to make police and letter agencies inefficient when it comes to investigating the supernatural, and making the media extremely sceptical. They might even have "troll squads" that output a lot of conspiracies, photshops, etc just to cement the idea of supernatural = tinfoil loonies.

Oh, and if the agencies and police are compromised, going to them with "evidence" just gets you disappeared. There might even be a "anti-terror" squad specifically tasked with finding people who match the "delusional vigilante" profile. Oh man I get tons of ideas now.

We are getting somewhere! Thanks!
