The mobile library is a nice idea, a bit like the trailer The Accountant uses. Or maybe a standard-sized shipping container that fits on a truck.

Still, to access it there needs to be contact between a potentially compromised (under surveillance) hunter and the library. And then the adversary can follow the vehicle or at least flag the make and model as one to look for.

The self disguising room is not really a solution, if enough hunters go in and out of a building, I'd bomb it or at least pump it full with knockout gas and tear it down brick by brick.

Hmmm.... maybe the supernatural is the answer, like you suggest.

Some kind of "the coast is clear" magic would be enough. Or a magic that hides them, but that would be too easy if they could be invisible from monsters. So maybe they can't hide from monsters, only humans and technology. But they can also /detect/ monsters, so if a monster decides to do the surveillance themselves, it will announce their presence to the hunters... but that sort of makes any ambush by monsters impossible, which is also kind of bad for the story...
