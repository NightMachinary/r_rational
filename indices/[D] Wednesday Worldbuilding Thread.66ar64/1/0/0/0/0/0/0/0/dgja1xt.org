  I was more thinking if the hunters reveal themselves, its not just the end of that singular hunter, but it becomes Humans vs Hunters as governments scramble to "eliminate the supernatural threat to national security" (and possibly start the supernatural cold war arms race). And /then/ the monsters win, with no hunters to threaten them.

Oh, but every hunter is willing to give them /so much information/ about these /other/ types of supernatural creature! Who wouldn't want a sample or two?

  I think of complete victory as open, brazen rule by monsters with a subjugated humanity reduced to slaves, pets, entertainment and food.

Okay, yeah, open, brazen rule won't work.

But it doesn't need to be brazen. Maybe the monsters, having control of everything, just leave their human puppets to take care of the paperwork.

Or maybe there's one kind of monster that feeds on emotions, and can't survive on existential despair... so the other monsters leave humanity in a state where this kind can feed.

Or maybe there's a third faction - a faction with the ability to see the future, and they've foreseen that either side being revealed to the world leads to Bad Stuff that Destroys Everything (or at least destroys something important to them). They're mostly neutral, but they can see in advance what action or actions will reveal monsters to the world - and will step in at the perfect moment to prevent the reveal with minimal effort. Sometimes - even often - this will involve setting up what looks like a coincidence (e.g. placing a heavy book where it will later fall off and crush the evidence), which means that for most of the story, their presence is unknown to either Monster or Hunter. And even when discovered, all they do that's remotely useful for either side is make cryptic 'prophecies' that just guide everyone into acting the way this third side wants them to act...
