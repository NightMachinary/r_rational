Hmmmm. And if Monsters are really severely outnumbered by humans, then they have plenty of reasons to stay hidden. But the /Hunters/ still don't.

Hmmm... here's an idea. What if the Hunters keep trying to find credible evidence - but there simply is not (or not for most of the story) any credible evidence to be had? Photographs meet cries of "Photoshop!", vampires turn to ash when killed (as do bits cut off the vampire), even video recordings only attract compliments about the brilliance of their special effects. Sure, vampires are inhumanly strong - but how do you find good scientific evidence of that when the vampire is intelligent, mildly paranoid, and doesn't cooperate?
