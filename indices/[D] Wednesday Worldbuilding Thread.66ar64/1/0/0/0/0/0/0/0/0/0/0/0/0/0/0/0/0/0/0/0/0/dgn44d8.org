  Hmmmmm. Kind of tricky if the building is in the middle of town - the neighbours might notice something, there's an automatic alarm system - but destruction is perhaps the most possible here.

The neighbours will be told to "stay inside and away from windows citizen, police are conducting an anti-terrorism raid" or some other excuse the government can use to do whatever they want with a building.

The hidden room has a similar problem. If an FBI agent, gps tracker, mobile phone tracker or surveillance camera tracks multiple suspected hunters visiting the building repeatedly, the government can lock it down in all manner of ways. Even if they don't get into the room they can deny it to hunters by cordoning off the building or rigging it with hidden cameras and explosives for the next time the hunters visit.

I would also like to (but may have to abandon) books that are special (think of the Necronomicon, it's just not the same to have a digital copy). Same with ancient daggers and such that have attributes that can not be duplicated in a modern steel K-Bar. Again, I may have to abandon such items because it's just too impractical.
