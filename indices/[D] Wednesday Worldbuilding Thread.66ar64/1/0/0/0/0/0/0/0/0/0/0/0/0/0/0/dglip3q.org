  And sometimes, 'own personal gain' means 'I want you to kill that guy'.

Definitely.

  Ah, so they exist, they're just not found in the same inner-city environment as your heroes. (Maybe they tend to be park rangers at wilderness preserves and so on - which means you don't want to poach rhino horn in this world). Fair enough.

Yeah, I was unclear. The story is going to be very city focused as it is now. So werewolves are more out of scope than non-existing.

  What about working as a police dog?

Knee-jerk reaction is too much comic relief. Character themes/feels are more of the "agent/private eye/serial killer/assassin/crime syndicate" flavor.

Which brings me back to the original question: how does vampire/demon/misc-hunters organize and operate safely with the authorities being in the pocket of the bad guys and with all the technology and surveillance of today? Especially if they want to maintain some form of permanent headquarters? Perhaps temporary safe houses and op centers are more realistic?

I would really like to have the trope-ish "library of ancient books" and "strange artifacts in glass boxes" because I love that stuff. But if it isn't plausible then it has to go.
