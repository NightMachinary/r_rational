Take [[/u/CCC_037][u/CCC_037]]'s idea a step further, and make the entrance abstract. The library could be accessed from any place, if you have a suitable door and know /how/ to open it (with such-and-such speed, uttering a certain phrase, using the right key), with the caveat that you would be able to leave it only through the door you entered through. (You can enter through the door from your bedroom, but you will leave only /into/ your bedroom.) If the door you used is destroyed, you're trapped there forever.

The library itself is located in a bunker far beneath the Earth, or in a pocket dimension.

Naturally, being invited into such a place would be a sign of great trust, nevermind giving the means of free access.
