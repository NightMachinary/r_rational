  If having the monsters revealed to the world will result in them being hunted down and killed, then the Hunters should be deliberately trying to reveal the monsters to the world; because successfully revealing the monsters to the world means that they win.

Huh. Well don't I feel stupid now? Thanks :)

What if hunters are /also/ supernatural (in some yet to be determined way), and will be dragged away to secret blacksite labs just as quickly as the monsters? Would that put hunters and monsters on some kind of equal "lets keep this quiet" footing?

Or maybe the Hunters /have/ been trying for a long time to convince authorities, but are seen as crackpots and conspiracy theorists (but why? a few samples to some labs around the world should be enough...).

Re: Option 1: plausible but would have to be framed right to convince the reader. The cost of losing a potential future confrontation when the monsters are ready for it would have to be mild enough to not be worth eliminating the threat once and for all, at all costs, as soon as possible. I would prefer a less challenging (to me) solution.

Re: Option 2: this is in line with the direction I was leaning towards, except I was thinking complete victory is not possible, and vampires have settled for a puppet master type of control to hide their existence. Vampires are so few in number that if the general public were aware of them and took action then the vampires would lose; numbers, need for blood, operate in daylight and all that.

This is tricky stuff, thanks a lot for helping out!
