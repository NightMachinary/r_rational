  The transportation magic would taint the magical field of the breeding colony.

Use non-magical, tech-based spaceships. Keep your breeding colony unconscious during transport, so they have no memory of it.

  If for some reason that didn't apply then you would still have to wait for ages for the new collective magical field to build up and find a stable pattern.
#+end_quote

Well, yeah. Naturally. But you'd have to wait a good deal less time than it would take for a new intelligent species to develop entirely on its own.

And it does sound like we're talking about some /extremely/ patient aliens here, in any case.

#+begin_quote
  If for some reason you waited that long then you would find that the new magical system is not significantly different from and is in fact practically interchangeable with other human magical systems.

Oooooh... this would be the bit that makes it impractical. (Though, I'd been considering the possibility that separate human colonies that had already found their individual magics might be the origins of things like vampires...)
