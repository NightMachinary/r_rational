Here is an idea

- Earth is a very minor unimportant place in the grand scheme of things and like a primitive hunter-gatherer tribe are ignorant of the much larger polities and civilizations around them.

- A strong relatively nearby major power or coalition has a prime directive of sorts. (This could be for ethical, religious or pragmatic reasons, though it might be better off to leave them relatively unknown.) that gets them to counter and punish obvious attempts at reveals.

- The nearby major power serves as the patron as the monster hunter organization and supplies the magic or technology needed to equip them, manipulate governments and keep things hidden.

There are various ideas you could have for the prime directive. It could be philosophical, religious or pragmatic. For WoD I would expect something like

- Every species develops it's own unique magic system if they are allowed to develop it naturally

- If a species achieves widespread exposure to another species magic system then they adopt it and lose their ability to develop one naturally.

- Local major power became a major power because their magic system enables them to steal magic from other places and they are just waiting for Earth to develop magic before one comes to consume us all.

As to why the local major power contracts out to humans instead of using normal humans.

- It could because their citizens can't navigate an earth-like environment (e.g size of small city, used to different magical field, or are used to strange geometries)

- Individuals are all powerful and high quality but they only have a small population and Earth is not worth having a dedicated individual managing it.

- They have passive magical effects which would effect our environment

- Earth is one of many backwood planets and they are too busy using resources for their own entertainment or a major war to commit more than a token amount of resources.
