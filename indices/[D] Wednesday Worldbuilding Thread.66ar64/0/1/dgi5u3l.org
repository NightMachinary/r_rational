  Problem: Brains Don't Work That Way. The brain is made by having a lot of connections grow during infancy and then die until only "good" connections are left.

Yet infant brains can and do show certain instinctive behaviours. Horses can stand up within an hour of birth, and gallop by the end of the first day. Human babies will [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmar_grasp_reflex][grab anything placed in their hand]] (and there are a number of other [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_reflexes][primitive reflexes]], many of which will also affect a new-born human infant as well).

So, alright, #2 is never going to be able to make complicated plans, but I don't see why it can't display a few primitive instinctive behaviours. Not to the point of being able to sneak up on someone, perhaps, but certainly to the point of "if you put your arm in his hand he'll grab it and suck out the blood". (One of those could even be the instinctive reflex to will the brain to grow, I guess). Or do I just not know enough about how brains work? (That's quite possible, I'm not a biologist).
