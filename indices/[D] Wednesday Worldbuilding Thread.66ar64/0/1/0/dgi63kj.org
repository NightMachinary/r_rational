Yeah, but horses aren't humans. Horse brains are designed very carefully to allow them to gallop at hours old because otherwise they'd die. Human brains are designed to have protective parents.

Added to that, brain #2 is not really a proper infant brain, since I believe there are actual physical differences between adult and infant brains, and a vampire doesn't grow a baby arm when they regenerate their arms, so why would they grow a baby brain? So the brain itself wouldn't be an infant brain, it'd be an adult brain (i.e. pruned I guess?) but without having had careful connections made.

I think getting zombies to happen is going to take way too much handwaving. I think I'm beginning to make peace with #1, it's just as interesting but in a whole other way. But how the brain structure and thus memories are "snapshotted" is an issue, because DNA is easy for the vampire to have a record of, the brain structure not so much...
