  Yeah, but horses aren't humans.

Neither are vampires. (Come to think of it, is there any reason - besides that the human vampires think it's squicky - why one can't have vampire horses?)

Here's another thought for the vampire brain structure (#3, perhaps) - it's the same for all vampires. If Tom the Vampire and James the Vampire both get their heads cut off, the regrown heads have different faces but share the exact same brain... which is already templated in the magic, and doesn't /need/ to be snapshotted.
