  If anyone can handle the cutthroat world of over 40 marathoning, Fiona sure can!

Eh, it's not really cut-throat. It's more a matter of putting in a ridiculous amount of work to cut five minutes off your marathon time so that you can beat /that guy/ this time round.

  I wasn't aware that people who do just "okay" in world-class marathons are tested.

Oh, she'd be tested well before she even /got/ to the world-class marathon. Even small, local marathons might have some sort of anti-doping policy. (Mind you, it doesn't /have/ to be a blood test. Sometimes they ask for a urine sample instead.) And some over-the-counter cold medications contain banned substances and well set off the drug test.

  Here's some of Fiona and her robotic pupil, Rose.

Practising her social skills. That's a nice little scene.

I like the touch of the dry shower. But why is the robot filling her fridge with easily perishable foods? (What does she do with the food, anyway?) Less perishable foods can sit in the fridge longer, saving on restocking and disposal.

How does the Slayer know how old the handprint on the rock is? I mean, the age of the rock can be calculated by a geologist, but a hobbyist can recreate the ancient inks and do a small art project today that will take serious effort to date once the paint has finished drying.
