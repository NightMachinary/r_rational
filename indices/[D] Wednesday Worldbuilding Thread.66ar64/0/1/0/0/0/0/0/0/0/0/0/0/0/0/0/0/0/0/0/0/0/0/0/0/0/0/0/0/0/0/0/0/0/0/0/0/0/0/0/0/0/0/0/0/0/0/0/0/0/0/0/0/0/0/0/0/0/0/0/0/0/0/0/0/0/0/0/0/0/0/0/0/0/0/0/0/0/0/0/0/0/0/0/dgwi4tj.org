    That's going to be tricky as his current territory is bigger than France, Spain and Germany put together. (Note: His territory is actually bigger than the state pictured in the diagram).
  #+end_quote

  That's a pretty big chunk of land, in terms of square metres. But what is it in terms of population?
#+end_quote

Less than 3 million: so smaller than Paris. William's all about those large tracts of land. (If I lived in the middle of Europe instead of in Western Australia, who /knows/ what he'd be into. But if the huge, mostly desolate expanse of land fits...)

#+begin_quote
  Oooooh..... this is a dangerous slope to start walking down, because then you'd need to show his thoughts being somehow actually deeper than an average human's. And that is... very, /very/ difficult to get right in fiction.
#+end_quote

It is very hard! One of the reasons I'm hoping that a couple of other people on here who expressed interest in being beta readers will do me the honour. There's one scene in particular where I tried to describe William's thought process a bit more thoroughly; fortunately my style is third-person and kind of overly flowery so I get to take liberties. But it was /hard/. I'm pretty proud of it but I'm sure I don't do the concept of an immortal genius justice. I'll chuck a section of it on the end of this post so you can see what I mean.

    Basically, if you accept the following three tenets, it follows that it's better not to eat meat (whether you do or not is another question; cognitive dissonance is real)
  #+end_quote

  Hmmmm.

  As to Tenet 1, I do believe that meat can be produced without causing undue harm to animals.
#+end_quote

Yeah, but Tenet 1 doesn't mean "producing meat necessarily harms animals", it's closer to "the way meat is produced today harms animals". Animals live a fraction of their potential lifespan, the harm done to dairy cattle when their calves get taken away is real, one-day-old male chicks get put into giant grinders when they're fully conscious because they won't lay eggs.

The hypothetical idyllic world where eating meat doesn't harm animals isn't the world we live in. So the hypothetical existence of such a world doesn't mean that eating a chicken burger is exactly as harmful as eating a veggie burger.

#+begin_quote
  (I also understand that there is some progress towards lab-grown meat, but that's new enough that it hardly applies).
#+end_quote

Progress is going pretty well, actually. I think a lab grown burger is now only a few thousand dollars instead of a few /hundred thousand/. The [[http://www.gfi.org/][good food institute]] is a charity that is doing work in getting this to become viable, since it will be better for animals, peoples' health, and the environment.

#+begin_quote
  As to Tenet 2, I will agree that it is avoidable, but I understand that one has to be very careful of one's diet or certain proteins are particularly difficult to obtain.
#+end_quote

The protein thing is a complete and utter myth, garbage, honestly. I can go into detail if you like (I'm a nutrition student). The only issue with a completely plant-based diet is B12, which is available as a cheap supplement and is added to practically everything as a fortification. (Also, much like iron in menstruating women, B12 deficiencies are common in the general population regardless of diet)

To wit, if you are eating enough calories, you are eating enough protein. Complete proteins are virtually meaningless. As long as you are not literally eating only one food, you're fine.

In terms of certain proteins: if you are eating a low calorie diet, then you need to ensure you include rich sources of lysine in your diet. Which is basically /every single legume/.

#+begin_quote
  I would save one human's life even if it means the death of a hundred baby bunnies.
#+end_quote

I don't know if there are many humans who would disagree with that.

#+begin_quote
  not be worth the effort of attempting to figure out the complete intricacies of a meat-free diet.
#+end_quote

Effectively no effort is required: if one eats a completely plant based diet, one only needs to ensure they're getting a B12 supplement. If they have a low calorie diet, it is important to incorporate legumes.

    The regrowth is pretty slow, I don't think it'd be visible "in real time". An arm takes a whole (week did I say?) to grow back.
  #+end_quote

  Incidentally, on this topic, have you ever heard of the MRL Mouse?
#+end_quote

Nooo but I googled it and now I want one.

--------------

It was February. Prey was becoming more plentiful as the weather improved. A package arrived, forwarded to Bremen by way of an ally of William's in Rome. There was no mistaking it: it lacked the meticulous construction of a vampire, the packaging and the handwriting both produced by careful but irredeemably human hands. William could not believe the excitement he felt when Duke Alfons' thrall had delivered it to him. He thanked the human - another one of the strange habits he picked up from his time with Red - and closed the door. He could not help but wonder how Red had felt it appropriate to respond to his gift. He had such an astonishing instinct for these things. William could not help but think that the young man would make a fine vampire someday. He frowned and shook his head as he walked to his dark, wooden table. It was a silly notion.

He placed the box on the table, and ripped the wooden top off of it. The movement stirred up the air inside, and the hints of Red's smell that emerged from the box awakened a feeling in the back of his mind. He felt the desire to cry, but chose not to act on it.

Nestled amongst pages of crumpled newspaper were three pieces of a kerosene lamp: a round glass shade patterned with dogwood flowers, trimmed in pale pink; a round lamp base with the same dogwood pattern, with a brass font for the wick on top; and a simple glass tube that functioned as the lamp's chimney. It was at least sixty years old, and in fine condition.

William ran his fingers along the dogwood flowers; it couldn't be, could it? Dogwood meant regret for a decision made in haste. A kerosene lamp with a wick: travel, long journeys over the sea; the shade of pale pink: courtesy and respect; and brass: something that appeared hurtful but was not.

If Red had been a vampire, William would have thought the message from this gift was obvious: he regretted his decision to leave, that Red still loved him, but would accept if he was not loved back any more. The fact it was a lamp, symbolising a journey, and that it was sent to William, would suggest that Red wanted William to travel to Columbus to see him.

William put the lamp down and ran his fingers through his curly blonde hair: his mind, usually distributed on many lines of thought, was stuck on this, speeding along the same path with the force of a locomotive, the substrate of his psyche worn away under the strength of it: the thought that Red still loved him, that Red wanted him back was intoxicating as it broke its way through the machinery of his mind.

He willed it to stop. This was not what Red meant. Even a young vampire, inexperienced in the language of gifts, even they would not know enough to be able to send something such as this. And yet... Red had a talent. Did he know what he was doing when he sent the lamp? Did Red know what it would mean to any vampire old enough to appreciate it? He couldn't have. And yet... he had sent it.

William shook his head, placing the components of the lamp together to stare at it.

The accompanying letter did not indicate any desire to reunite; it just spoke of his family and sent Chestnut and Julias his regards. The gift's meaning had certainly not been intended. But the locomotive's well-worn path in his brain made William's desire to visit loom large in his mind. Red wouldn't need to know; William could have letters sent via his proxy in Europe - such favours came cheap. The thought of seeing Red again, with his own eyes, of getting an opportunity to witness the happiness reported in his letters... William could not resist the allure. He had never seen the New World, either. A former lover of his was now the Queen of Atlanta; she would no doubt accept an official visit from him, and that would improve his reputation. Moreover, it would be nice to speak with an equal after all the time he had been spending grovelling before dukes. He decided to send Duke Erlis a letter and announce his intention to visit.

--------------

Also, a little excerpt from a conversation earlier in the story, where a fellow thrall is warning Red of what he's getting into:

--------------

“... They aren't normal. And I don't think you understand exactly what that means.”

“I know about the... you know.” He put one hand up to his mouth, doing a small V gesture evocative of having fangs; he got the feeling that this strange, new version of Lucia would flinch if he said the ‘v' word.

“Do you really? I bet you don't know the half of it.”

“I don't doubt that.” Red agreed. “Did something happen? You seem... different.”

“They hear everything we say, even if they are talking in another room. Did you know that?”

“Wait, what? I knew the hearing was good, but I didn't...”

“They pay attention to it, too. I once saw Elodia follow three separate conversations.”

“That's... unsettling.” He studied her for a moment. “Were you worried about being heard yesterday? Is that why you're talking about this now?”

“Yes. I don't know what William is like,” She said, again not using his title. “But I've seen a lot of young people like you... that don't understand what they're dealing with.”

“What do you mean?”

Lucia frowned. “They think they are going on some grand adventure, trying a wonderful drug, perhaps escaping a terrible family. But... I have seen many get killed.”

“I thought that might be the case.” He admitted.

“So I try to make sure that people like you... know. That they can always, always hear you. That they can give you commands that you are powerless to resist, just by making eye contact. And that once you outlive your usefulness, they will kill you and not think twice about it.”
