  Of course, you have to be close enough to take advantage but not so close that the vampire can hear your heartbeat.
#+end_quote

Or just hope that the vampire feeds somewhere there are people around: if it's a back alley behind a nightclub, then you can probably sit in the nightclub, watch through a hidden camera of some sort, and then make your entrance when your target is doubled over in pain.

#+begin_quote
  Bad idea. Gold nanoparticles aren't going to be lethal to vampires, and once one has been affected once, he's going to be a little more cautious in the future, and nibble testingly at his victims' blood before drinking down a good mouthful.
#+end_quote

Oh yeah. And they'll have a second janissary with them during feeds, who has instructions for how to deal with the damage (probably along the lines of pick them up, put them in the back of a waiting car, and drive them into a light-proof garage...)

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, but then they need someone around to bite - and /not/ the one they just bit are you /crazy/ - and there's going to be a hesitation to bite /anyone/ given what just happened. Can the vampire force the gold out through his fangs without biting someone? What if he bites (say) a chair leg? Or cuts off his own arm and then bites that?
#+end_quote

I don't know. I pictured the waste product thing being a subconscious thing like when mosquitos bite you it automatically releases various things into your blood to help them drink your blood better, and those products have nootropic effects. I /like/ the idea of a vampire being dependent on feeding from humans specifically, so that way /True Blood/ is impossible, and stealing from blood banks will cause you to fall ill over the course of a few days/weeks/months as the waste products build up in your system.

Then /again/, vampires have conscious control over most involuntary body systems (so they can appear to breathe). So it would make sense that they can choose to excrete even with nothing to excrete into.

Then /again/, maybe they have conscious control over /human/ involuntary body systems, and the /vampire/ body systems are not so easily controlled?

#+begin_quote
  Or cuts off his own arm and then bites that?
#+end_quote

This would work the best; I'd imagine that some gold could be excreted for the same duration that the vampire is able to drink blood out of his own arm. Once he drinks his arm dry (and his arm probably has gold in it, too! He might even get back the gold he excretes...), he won't be able to excrete more gold.

Definitely the sort of thing I could see a vampire who drank from someone who e.g. put a false skin pocket in their neck that was full of concentrated colloidal gold and so is in /untold pain/ trying to desperately do to escape from it.

#+begin_quote
  I was thinking that, given their broad immunities, their bodies might not actually have /any/ way to handle poisons. Sure, you wouldn't design vampires to get gold in their goo, but if they had no internal mechanism to handle gold it might get there anyhow.
#+end_quote

True: but probably isn't going to be where gold concentrates, but it's another way the goo can get out...

#+begin_quote
  No, one can work with that. Cut off hand, lose some gold. Wait for hand to regrow. Cut off hand, lose some more gold... it'll be painful and unpleasant, but sooner or later you'll get most of it out. (Quicker if one, say, cuts off both legs)
#+end_quote

It'll take forever. Would the the plan where assuming gold just be affected by gravity and eat through your body if you stay on your stomach for a few hours/days? It'll be quicker than dismembering yourself repeatedly, and leave you less vulnerable. And, like you said, hungry for revenge...

    Well, William's willingness to negotiate is borne out of two things
  #+end_quote

  Killing Jack now deals with (1) better than leaving her alive. (2) seems a bit tenuous when it comes to leaving alive a determined threat (i.e. Jack), even if he's more inclined to leave average people alive now.
#+end_quote

Good point. I suppose he doesn't think Jack is actually a threat to him, he knows she has power in the anti-vampire community (her best friend Gwyn is a mage, who is constantly developing her powers: /she/ could be a threat, but she defers to Jack, who is harmless...), and William knows she's got subconscious sympathy to him what with having been a janissary.

It is /very hard/ to have the Bad Guy leave The Hero alive though. Because William should really just go kill Gwyn given everything I've just laid out, hey?

    Q&A WITH MW'S DOCTOR FRIEND

    my conclusion: you cannot permenantly inoculate yourself by the looks of it.
  #+end_quote

  You can't permanently have gold running around in your /blood/. What happens to a vampire who touches gold-impregnated tissue?
#+end_quote

Probably nothing unless there's gold atoms at the top layer of tissue (unlikely since the staining is likely permenant, so it doesn't leave the skin). After all, vampires can presumably touch golden items if they're wearing gloves, so direct contact would be necessary. It might sting a little bit if a couple of atoms are up there, but that's probably as bad as it gets.

#+begin_quote
  if that gets it into the blood as well, one can perhaps avoid having to inject it directly.
#+end_quote

I suppose it depends how it would all get absorbed. I think there's a decent risk of a bunch of the gold ending up in the poop, and clean needles are really cheap, and junkies are a vampire's favourite place to go looking for janissaries so they'd even know how to use them.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    So................ looks like my vampires absorb blood THROUGH THEIR LUNGS. I am so psyched abou tthis!!!
  #+end_quote

  Their digestive systems have been coopted for reproduction; their respiratory systems for digestion. I find myself wondering if any other internals have changed function...
#+end_quote

Their reproductive systems are the obvious case because we don't want them to have babies because vampires getting pregnant is weird. That said, if I'm writing supernatural romance, we still want them to be fun to use. (I guess, /twilight-style/, we could say that females are infertile and males aren't, but I think vampires having children would separate them a lot from the "dead" category they're meant to be in).

Not sure what you can do with a reproductive system though, especially because the sexes differ in some obvious ways. I suppose you could say it's joined to the vampire-goo-factory in some way, and not really specify how. But the ovary/fallopian tube is a very different structure from the testes/epididymis, even if they are homologous, so there's probably important ways that male and female vampires differ because of this.
