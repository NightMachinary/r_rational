  Ooo, that would be good. "She could be one of half a dozen people... I thought Genevive was dead, but who knows. And Octavia was so very offended by the cake I presented her with, so if it's her I'd better crawl... I'll have to send an 'I'm sorry for sending the wrong cake' gift post-haste"

[[/twibeam][]] Sounds good!

  That's so metal! I love it. I'm trying to work out how well-known the vampire weakness to gold is. Things are all happening out of order so when we do more prologue it will be fun to see how long the vampire hunters take to figure out that gold is a point of weakness.

Probably virtually unknown.

Incidentally, from the [[http://www.eviloverlord.com/lists/dungeon_a.html][Evil Overlord List]], number 220:

  Whatever my one vulnerability is, I will fake a different one. For example, ordering all mirrors removed from the palace, screaming and flinching whenever someone accidentally holds up a mirror, etc. In the climax when the hero whips out a mirror and thrusts it at my face, my reaction will be "Hmm...I think I need a shave."

Clearly, some vampires have read this list. And they quickly kill any Hunters that work it out, and burn down all their papers.

But Rose doesn't need to know about the gold weakness until one of the vampires literally steps in it (though the reader should know well before that).

  That said, there's a scene in the novella where William gives Red a silver dagger, and tells him that it really hurts vampires, so the vampires are obviously perpetrating the silver myth come hell or high water.

Yep. Makes good sense. Better yet, anyone who tries it and fails, doesn't live to report back.

  /“And when [humans] have bombs that make sunlight? When they can make gold from lead? Do you want to be on their bad side when that happens?”/

That /is/ an amusing exchange.

#+begin_quote
  Yep. Wouldn't really be good for vampire on vampire combat, but I suspect most fights a vampire gets into are with non-vampires.
#+end_quote

Yeah, but against non-vampires you don't need armour because they are just so /slooooow/ that it's not like they can stake an alert and awake vampire anyway.

  Anything's worth a try. If we revisit the robot thing (which I guess we'll have to do if I ever get to writing volume 3), we'll have to sort it out. I'm not having the third volume of a Rational Supernatural Romance Novel being irrational like that. I'd sooner go it alone!

Now I'm imagining Grandma continually sending the Grandkids headwear with cartoonishly large radio antennae on it, just so she can get updated brain scans (and the parents quietly hiding them out back because they look heavy enough to put serious strain on the kids' necks).
