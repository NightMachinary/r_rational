  Clearly, some vampires have read this list. And they quickly kill any Hunters that work it out, and burn down all their papers.

Yeah. The vampires are glad they still have one thing. The vampire weakness to silver is a relatively new invention in folklore, so probably some people got wise to electrum and the vampires decided to name the Beast of Gevaudan as a vampire, since that's where the folklore for silver comes from. (The Beast of Gevaudan is certainly not a werewolf, so could well have been a vampire, and the silver bullet is just random folklore)

  That /is/ an amusing exchange.

Lead to gold is such a cliche but a real concern for vampires... :D

Speaking of, the story is now basically as finished as it's going to be so I'm more than ready for readers if you were still wanting to be so kind. Otherwise once my coauthor finishes massaging it I'll put it on this subreddit one chapter at a time, but because of how well you have come to know the setting and how valuable your contributions are I'd very much appreciate your expert eye.

But, on the other hand, it's some 50,000 words long (TWO THIRDS THE LENGTH OF THE FIRST HARRY POTTER BOOK), so it's not exactly something you can knock out in half an hour. I appreciate that it's a lot to ask of someone, so you're more than welcome to decline.

I do want to thank you again for all your help and encouragement. If it weren't for that long conversation in that worldbuilding thread in like August, I wouldn't have written a 50,000 word novella this year, and this is something that me and my coauthor have /literally been talking about doing for 10+ years/. So it's an amazing personal achievement you started me on the journey towards. So thank you, again!

Anyway. Vampires. Yep! Let's go.

    Yep. Wouldn't really be good for vampire on vampire combat, but I suspect most fights a vampire gets into are with non-vampires.
  #+end_quote

  Yeah, but against non-vampires you don't need armour because they are just so /slooooow/ that it's not like they can stake an alert and awake vampire anyway.
#+end_quote

Hm. You're right. Reflexes make a fight between human and vampire completely unfair. That's... a lot to think about. Like, Jack has a crossbow and she at some point even has the tip gold-plated. Does she just /think/ it's gonna be useful and will get rudely awakened if William actually wants to kill her?

  Now I'm imagining Grandma continually sending the Grandkids headwear with cartoonishly large radio antennae on it, just so she can get updated brain scans (and the parents quietly hiding them out back because they look heavy enough to put serious strain on the kids' necks).

This would be followed by a series of posts to [[/r/JUSTNOMIL]] along the lines of

  "We have been NC with MIL for the past 6 years, but every year for christmas she sends our kids weird hats. They always have these strange antenna things, I th ink she doesn't understand what kids find cool these days"

  "OMG I found out from one of the MIL's neighbours that she's gone to one of those realdoll type companies and made dolls of our kids. It's so fucked up. WHAT THE HELL."

  "So, uh, it turns out the MIL actually made robot doubles of our kids and uploaded brain scans into them and everything. Long story short one of them malfunctioned and let her drown in the bathtub. She left everything to the robots in her will. Does anyone know a good lawyer?"
