  Yeah, but I'm not sure how a modern mad scientist makes a sentient robot since it's out there, and like, should AI takeoff be a concern of ours?

Hmmm. Simple, straightforward solution - she never solved the problem of AI, she simply found a non-destructive means of brain uploading. Rose's 'brain' started out as a direct copy of the brain of the woman she's a copy of, taken at age 16 ("here, dear, wear this helmet for a minute, would you?") - perhaps not a perfect copy, but good enough to start out with the same memories and sense of identity. She doesn't have software access to her own code, and can't easily self-modify. And even if she could gain access, she doesn't understand her own brain any more than the average human does.

  Rose (that's the robot: did I give her name before?)

You did.

  William gave her a pile of gifts, and she decided it was only polite to send them back. Of course, the gifts she sent back were deeply offensive.

I see. I can't imagine William was very happy.
