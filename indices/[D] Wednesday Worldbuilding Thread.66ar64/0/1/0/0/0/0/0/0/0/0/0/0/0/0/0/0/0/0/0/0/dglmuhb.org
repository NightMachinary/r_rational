  Oh yeah... I didn't mean literal fingernails; I more meant, his gelatinous blob "blood factory" "rest of the iceberg" probably has the equivilent of long hair/nails: might just be a series of orgasn that hold a bunch of different elements in reserve, like bones do for calcium.

Whatever it is, it's got to do so without limiting his combat capability in any way.

  Long ago I conceived of him having a "heart stone" that was a big red gem in the centre of his body, and if it's destroyed he dies.
#+end_quote

Okay, this is reasonable. He must have some vulnerability. (If nothing else, if the bit he does his thinking with is destroyed, then he's not able to do anything even if his body pieces itself back together).

But this heart stone - it doesn't /have/ to be part of his 3D human body. (It might very well only be part of his 3D /gargoyle/ body, which means that a prospective assassin has to get him to go into full battle-mode - perhaps by destroying his human-shaped "disguise" body - and /then/ break through all his outer skin and armour and /then/ destroy this tough-as-nails Heartstone. A tall order.)

  It is an interesting idea if we do allow him to survive being bisected. I'd probably rule that he'd end up like a starfish if we did allow that. So now he's pissed off and there's two of him - though the far-from-the-gargoyle-side half is going to die of starvation very quickly with no ability to photosynthesise (probably in a day or two). And all the flesh on the near-the-gargoyle-side is going to die and rot away with no new blood source. It would be pretty cool though.
#+end_quote

Hmmmm. But only one side - presumable the gargoyle side - still has a brain. So the gargoyle side prompty shifts to full battle-mode and Deals With whatever just tried to kill him - while the non-gargoyle side regenerates a human body but otherwise kind of just lies there, having no brain to think with (bit of a distraction but not much else). And, once he's safe again, he's lost a massive pile of mass, but hey, there's this big fleshy lump just hanging out into 4D space, ready to be eaten... the whole thing will be pretty gross, but he can get most of his mass back.

[[/twiwink][]] But now /I/ don't know whether you meant to type '10%' or '10kg' - both have an equal error distance.

  I think by the time computer chips are a thing, Red is well and truly used to the craziness of the supernatural world and would just completely accept it.

Fair enough. But just crunching through an aluminium pot could have happened a long time before computer chips. I don't actually know when aluminium refining started being a thing that could be done...
