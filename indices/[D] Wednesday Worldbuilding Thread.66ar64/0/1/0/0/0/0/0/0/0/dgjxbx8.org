RE: Horses: So we'll give a dedicated vampire his vampiric menagerie... they'd be valuable gifts, I suppose???

RE: Consequences of heart-spur plan: Those are all excellent observations. Thanks for that! We'll say that the two hearts are joined, maybe that the heart is the only 4D object. I think that doesn't have any odd consequences - though the 4D thing is so far in the background I don't know if it matters whether it's specific.

  another 4D native could still find traces of those clothes

True. I guess Julias is not concerned about this, or more likely the 4D world is inhospitable enough to normal matter that simply being in it would destroy the clothing (I'm imagining a 1 atom thick sheet of metal would be destroyed in a slight breeze). Not that the 4D world /has/ a breeze...

Now i'm imagining the BBEG getting his own gargoyle detective on the case, and the gargoyle detective coming across the ruined remains of William's clothes. Then again - that'd make Julias not be very good at his job.

I think I'm going to settle on the 4D world being inhospitable to non-4D objects as the easiest way to have the cool little detail and also have Julias be doing the right thing.
