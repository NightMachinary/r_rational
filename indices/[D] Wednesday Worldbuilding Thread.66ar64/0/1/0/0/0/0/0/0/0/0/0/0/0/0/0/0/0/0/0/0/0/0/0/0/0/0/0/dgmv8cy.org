  If he doesn't serve some narrative purpose, then it might be better to leave him out.

Nothing in anything we write has a narrative purpose; it all just /is/, because we like it. Malik is /meant/ to have a brother, and that's purpose enough. Whether any of our limited time available for writing and plotting is devoted to that is another question: with no purpose it's not there. But just as Malik serves no purpose in the novella I recently "finished" (still needs editing), he is mentioned because he exists in the greater fabric of the world and not mentioning him would be an oversight (okay, and Red finding out that Julias has a son and thus seems to have "free will" rather than being a golem adds to his horror, I suppose: everything serves a purpose if you squint hard enough).

It's the literary equivalent of junk food for us. And hey, who doesn't love a packet of chips now and then?

  Or possibly Julius and his wife have simply discussed this and come to some agreement that they can both live with... a century or so before the story begins, i.e. entirely off-stage.

This is probably a good choice. After all, we need not know the details.

This was the original canon though is not a necessity; the idea of Kamal being half-siren half-human as opposed to half-human half-gargoyle (edit: /half siren half gargoyle/, rather!) would be interesting development of Malik's -character, as Malik places a lot of self worth (or rather, lack of it) on the fact that he's not a full-blooded demon as he is treated badly in his society because of it. Kamal would make a good foil if he was even less full-blooded (i.e. basically a full human) and had made peace with it through fasting and prayer. (And Kamal prays to a god who he /has never seen/, much less made regular ritual offerings of cake to!)

  genetic matter includes the necessary data for building his stone half, and his 4D body structure, along with the idea that it's at all in any way compatible with the sirens
#+end_quote

Malik doesn't have any 4D structure or transformation ability. Not sure if that's just a consequence of him being of impure blood or if it says something about the way reproduction works, though.
