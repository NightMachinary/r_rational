  That's straightforward.
#+end_quote

Or maybe it was a hyena from some vampire's menagerie. You never know ;)

  [golden blood] might work once - especially if the Hunter has practiced stabbing the vampire as soon as he's incapacitated long enough that he does so automatically without needing to actually decide
#+end_quote

Really you should inoculate a decoy person with golden blood (bonus points: kidnap a janissary, put them under, insert gold into their blood, then leave them in an alley somewhere). Watch them until they go to feed the vampire, when the vampire gets affected by the gold, come in from the shadows and cut his head off.

Extension: If you are a secret government organisation, inject gold into a portion of the population under the guise of a vaccine programme. Vampires are now unable to reliably choose targets.

Inspiration: This happened on Stargate atlantis (they have a sort of space vampire called the Wraith). The Wraith ended up just killing /everyone/ who was on planets that had tainted people on them because they were no longer useful as a food source so why keep them around (normally they'd kill a few dozen people every now and again, so this scorched earth really sucked).

QUESTION: are vampires harmed by gold compounds, or elemental gold only? You've probably heard of colloidal silver, which is an alt-medicine thing that probably cures cancer or something. It's just silver suspended in water.

Looks like [[https://www.purestcolloids.com/mesogold.php][colloidal gold]] exists as well and is sold with similarly dodgy health claims. So that would be a source for our intrepid vampire hunters. There's also ionic gold available (which the linked page decries as being inferior in whatever magical properties gold is meant to have), so depending on what about gold harms vampires, either one could work.

I assume colloidal gold is probably better to inject. I know a doctor, I wonder if he'd entertain my questions. Who knows. I've just IMed him and asked him. And while I've been finishing writing this he's giving me his thoughts.

#+begin_quote
  Well, the thing is, because the gold is /inside/ the vampire, he can't just drop it and let go. And burning through the vampire does not actually consume the gold, so it's going to keep going as long as it's in there.
#+end_quote

Yeah, I was thinking through this. What does gold ACTUALLY do? Is it just painful? Or does it actually burn through them like acid would? I suppose it would actually burn through them.

On the subject of removing gold from the body:

- Their waste products are excreted into their janissaries when they feed, which is how I'd envision their bodies preferring to get rid of the gold - this is not very good for time-sensitive things, though.

- I don't think new-vampire-goo would be a good route for it. Not sure of a good way that that goo gets made, but I'm guessing the "making new soldiers" function of the body would not be able to take on "deadly poisons". That way if one of your vampire soldiers dies, you can cut his belly open and make a replacement.

- Cutting off body parts that are affected by gold: I'd imagine the gold would disperse pretty quickly throughout the entire body, so you're kind of stuffed. Then again, I also imagine that vampires are able to will their hair to grow, so why wouldn't they be able to will the blood they just drank to settle in, say, their left hand and then cut the left hand off. THEN AGAIN, blood would spread through arteries, which do not have valves, only veins do. So the blood would spread through the body pretty much straight away. (Then again: do vampires have a heartbeat? If not, their blood doesn't move. I guess they do have a heartbeat for that reason, also because Red would have noticed that someone he was snuggling for two weeks didn't have a heartbeat)

- Gold eating through you: this seems likely if we're going "gold bores through you like acid". Then again, these gold particles are nano-size. They might have a hard time boring through you from the inside out? (gonna ask doctor friend)

- Gold eating through you #2: Actually, if it did eat through you, it would be pretty slow, so the vampire might lie down for an hour or two and wait for the gold to come out of his body, then get his janissaries to do a very thorough job of sweeping the floor. This is probably a good way to do it.

#+begin_quote
  But he'd need to know about the gold weakness before [jack putting gold into her bloodstream] happens. I'm not quite sure when he finds out about that.
#+end_quote

Yeah, I'm thinking it makes sense for her to find out about the gold thing during the robot thing.

#+begin_quote
  does look like William is offering more than he's receiving, though; despite his words, it seems that he's not sure he'd survive if Jack were really to seriously attempt to kill him.
#+end_quote

Well, William's willingness to negotiate is borne out of two things:

1) They still have the masquerade going on, and Jack could threaten that

2) He actually has genuinely changed as a person in his attitude towards humans, and feels like negotiating with them is a good idea for the sake of future relations.

* Q&A WITH MW'S DOCTOR FRIEND

  1) When you drink too much colloidal silver, it makes your skin turn grey. When this happens does the silver get into your blood in any appreciable quantities or is it mostly in tissues?
#+end_quote

1) the silver would have to spend some time in your blood to get from your GI tract to the skin and other tissues. My understanding is that the staining is usually permanent, which suggests it doesn't re-enter the bloodstream after it's deposited. So I'd guess it would only be in the blood for a short time, at most a day, after drinking a dose, then it would just be in tissue

my conclusion: you cannot permenantly inoculate yourself by the looks of it.

#+begin_quote
  2) Colloidal gold is also a thing. It's gold nanoparticles in distilled water. If you put it in a syringe and injected it, would you have gold nanoparticles in your blood? How long for? Would the kidneys filter them or would they be in your blood forever? Would it be toxic?
#+end_quote

2) gold nano particles injected into the blood probably wouldn't be toxic, because they wouldn't react with anything. The only risk would be if they somehow aggregated together and blocked an artery, a gold embolus. I'm not sure how good the kidney would be at removing the particles, probably not very but they should pass through eventually. I doubt anyone knows this one, so you could spin it either way depending on plot requirements.

my conclusion: colloidal gold is a great idea!

#+begin_quote
  3) Same as above but instead of gold nanoparticles it's gold ions
#+end_quote

3) gold ions are toxic to the liver and kidneys

my conclusion: ionic gold is a Bad Idea

#+begin_quote
  colloidal gold is 40-400nm, is that too small for the blood vessels?
#+end_quote

A: Should be fine, lots of proteins and ions stay in the blood vessels after all. Stuff only really transfers into tissue in capillaries, and even then I doubt many gold particles would go through the membrane. If they did though, you've got the same problem as colloidal silver: once in the tissue, it probably wouldn't leave. People may change colour, and they'd need repeat dosing to stay vampire proof

my conclusion: The vaccine plan wouldn't work unless you want to prepare an entire city for e.g. a vampire convocation. Or you could perhaps routinely spike gold into all the e.g. insulin, testosterone, estrogen, heroin, depovera, etc, anything that anyone injects themselves with. Though you'd end up with people changing colour which would be hard to do in a stealthy manner.

EDIT: So, vampires might be able to use the smooth muscle in their arteries to direct blood:

MW: so if a vampire fed on someone golden, they could direct all that blood into say their left hand, and then cut their left hand off as a way to avoid t he damage? (their hands grow back)

Doctor Friend: I guess so? It would be a long way around though, if their vessels still rely on the heart for pressure to move things around. Anything consumed, assuming it gets absorbed in the guts like normal, would have to pass through the hepatic portal vein, the liver, the inferior vena cava, the right side of the heart, the lungs and the left side of the heart before entering the arterial circulation to be sent where they want

MW: I don't think it gets absorbed in the guts. That would be too far around: the guts are co-opted to make Magic Vampire Goo that makes the next generation of vampires. That said, it could perhaps go through the esophagus into the lungs? That would make a weird type of sense, wouldn't it? Actually the alveoli probably wouldn't be able to absorb blood because it's not air? like if you'd asked me 5 minutes ago I'd say it goes right into the jugular, but going via the lungs like oxygen does makes a weird type of sense, since vampires don't need to breathe, it would be something for the lungs to do

DF: There's no reason the process of becoming a vampire couldn't alter the membranes in the alveoli, giving them a new function

MW: true. So. that's badass. They drink blood and it goes down the oesophagus, BUT INTO THE LUNGS haha i am so excited. i love it when you think about things like this and then you have a really cool and bizarre thing seem logical

DF: Well, would be more direct if they technically breath blood into the trachea! Like drowning, but intentionally and with blood

So................ looks like my vampires absorb blood THROUGH THEIR LUNGS. I am so psyched abou tthis!!!
