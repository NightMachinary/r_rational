  and then freaked out when Rose came in and didn't need an invitation
#+end_quote

And he /knows/ she's not human, because she had no trouble breathing in at atmosphere filled with lethal amounts of something nastily poisonous or similar, I imagine...

#+begin_quote
  (Aside: I always wondered why vampires don't wear better armour. If they're super strong, they should have no problem being able to wear full plate or riot gear/etc and still be agile. Great way to protect yourself from a staking from a human, if nothing else. Is there something I'm missing?)
#+end_quote

Ego and a conviction that it won't happen to them. Do /you/ wear armour to protect yourself from beestings? Even if you're allergic to bees to a lethal degree?

#+begin_quote
  Oh, of course. So Rose is essentially an uploaded version of Tara (her 16 year old "template") that has some nifty features that Tara doesn't (on-board memory, ability to read .txt documents, probably some things like an internet connection?)
#+end_quote

Yeah, that sounds good to me. (Nifty features that she had to learn how to use on her own, of course).

#+begin_quote
  I don't think Rose is particularly intelligent though. Perhaps she's got a pretty slow processor and it's hard to upgrade.
#+end_quote

Speed of thought has less to do with intelligence than people think. Sure, it has an effect on intelligence... but it's hardly all of it.

#+begin_quote
  But Rose's boyfriend is a computer programmer, so I'm guessing he'd open her up and try and upgrade her (with her consent, naturally).
#+end_quote

Is he a neuroscientist? If not, then he /really/ shouldn't touch her uploaded-brain function. Mind you, he /can/ upgrade her by giving her new hardware or extra 'features' (like installing a calculator program to make her better at maths) but it's hard to imagine her on a takeoff trajectory until her neural network can be understood and upgraded.

#+begin_quote
  Rose has a robo-brother too, who was a less successful robot. I think he lacked real human empathy, though he sort of learns it. Maybe a more autism style inability to get any sort of subtexts.
#+end_quote

Yeah... either copied from his original's mind or introduced due to a flaw in the copy process.

#+begin_quote
  Really should discuss this with the coauthor and work out the details so I can post them on worldbuilding sometime and see people who are practically MIRI employees rip it all apart.
#+end_quote

It's probably for the best, yes.
