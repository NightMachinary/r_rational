  I can't imagine William was very happy.

He was inconsolable for days and jumpy AF. He wore full plate armour whenever he answered the door for a while, and then freaked out when Rose came in and didn't need an invitation (having a human thrall comes in handy for protecting you from other vampires).

(Aside: I always wondered why vampires don't wear better armour. If they're super strong, they should have no problem being able to wear full plate or riot gear/etc and still be agile. Great way to protect yourself from a staking from a human, if nothing else. Is there something I'm missing?)

  she simply found a non-destructive means of brain uploading.

Oh, of course. So Rose is essentially an uploaded version of Tara (her 16 year old "template") that has some nifty features that Tara doesn't (on-board memory, ability to read .txt documents, probably some things like an internet connection?)

I don't think Rose is particularly intelligent though. Perhaps she's got a pretty slow processor and it's hard to upgrade.

But Rose's boyfriend is a computer programmer, so I'm guessing he'd open her up and try and upgrade her (with her consent, naturally). That could be interesting. She'd perhaps start going on a takeoff trajectory and he'd have to pull the plug and be unable to. Eventually, being an uploaded human so having decently aligned values, she might... go for a life of aestheticism on a mountain somewhere? ¯\/(ツ)//¯

Rose has a robo-brother too, who was a less successful robot. I think he lacked real human empathy, though he sort of learns it. Maybe a more autism style inability to get any sort of subtexts.

Really should discuss this with the coauthor and work out the details so I can post them on worldbuilding sometime and see people who are practically MIRI employees rip it all apart.
