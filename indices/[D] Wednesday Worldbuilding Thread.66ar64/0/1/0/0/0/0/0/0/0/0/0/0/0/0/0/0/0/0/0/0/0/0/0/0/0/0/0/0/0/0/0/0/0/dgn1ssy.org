    I'm debating whether to link to it here under this reddit account (since I probably have a modicum of name recognition on this subreddit after my incessant posts about vampires?) or whether to create an account for "Angela Carson".

  [[/hmmm][]] (For one thing, if you write multiple books, and your official authorship account only submits the links to them, then the "Angela Carson" user page doubles as a handy index to your works).

Which would be a problem - such behaviour comes afoul of reddit's anti-spam rules (that are unofficial, but I believe there's also some variant of them codified on [[/r/rational]]: something along the lines of "you may only post your own content once a week" or similar).

I might make a subreddit - in fact, I'll go do that now. Can't hurt, can it? [[/r/AngelaCarson]] is born!

  ...it's actually really fascinating, how well we communicate despite how bad our languages are at it. And it's also fascinating how much of almost any intended communication we get wrong and never realise.

Yeah. I had my husband scared I was going to drink bleach because I was texting him that I was sad and took a photo of where I was (supermarket, bleach aisle). I didn't realise I'd made him worried I was planning on drinking bleach: to me I'd just shown him where I was (i.e. the supermarket) - didn't even notice that there was bleach in the frame (my intention: "I am in the cleaning products aisle").

    I always conceived of some species being single-sex: sirens make sense as female-only, but then again, why wouldn't there be boy sirens who tempted female sailors? Probably makes sense.

  Well, Malik's a male half-Siren. If he marries a (female) Siren he can presumably have male three-quarter-Siren sons. After a few careful generations of breeding, you could presumably have male 99%-sirens... whether or not the original Siren genome was intended to handle it or not.
#+end_quote

Hmmm, you're right. That said, I think if Malik married a female siren, the child wouldn't be 3/4 siren, it would be half half-siren, half siren, if you get my drift: Malik has lost too much siren for him to be able to father anything that is close enough to a siren. Of course his contribution to the gene pool could still be attenuated enough that it wouldn't matter.

Maybe it would be best to be able to cross half-breeds back into pure-breeds to get something purer. Either way.

    Yeah. I am bad at communicating. In an earlier post I referred to Malik as being half-human half-gargoyle instead of half-siren half-gargoyle.

  [[/flutterwhoa][]] ...I completely missed that one.

I saw it after you'd replied to the post in question and was like "ohhhh dear. have I confused him?". But nope: the paris in the the springtime effect strikes again!
