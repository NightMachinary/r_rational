DNA / vampire transmission would probably be in the "could I breed with this person" level of similarity required. So, ten million years from now a modern vampire probably couldn't turn the neo-humans into vampires, even if we assume they look pretty much the same.

Vampire horse: I'd imagine each intermediate form would require an advanced enough brain to will the "transformation goo" to be made. I had in my head that it takes a few dozen/hundred years for a vampire to have enough transformation goo in the tank, or that the goo increases in potency over time, etc. And then the goo has to be deliberately vomited up. So it would have to be able to will the goo-vomiting (gross).

I want making a new vampire to be an "expensive" process in that it can't be continuously done to raise an army, "difficult" so you can't have your childe create a childe who creates a childe and thus have an army like that, and "risky" so you are not guaranteed to be successful.

But yes, if a vampire was willing to genetically engineer intelligent human-horse hybrids and continuously have them make slightly more horsey vampires, waiting the requisite time/taking the requisite risks of failure to produce them, you probably could. And then you'd have to keep a stable of horses for your vampire horse to feed from.

  It gets worse than that. Why would cutting through the vampire's neck remove his head in the first place?

Below is my earlier response to the same sort of question in this thread:

That said, given vampires, werewolves aren't born in 4D, it's pretty easy to conceive that they have a very odd shape. Perhaps a tiny "spur" from their heart from which a whole second body comes, so they would perhaps flicker a tiny bit as they left their first body and their second (identical) body appeared, and then got smaller and turned into a bat. Could mean earth!body is vulnerable to beheading.

Vampires can't control their transformation, just will it to start (since they're not 4D natives: werewolves don't even get to will it to start). So there's no chance of a vampire wearing "morph armour" by having their transformation stop at the full-size double body.

  Or maybe the neck - and head - doesn't extend four-dimensionally and only the torso does (so you can cut off the head but not cut off, say, the kidney).

Yeah I think I'm going to say there's a ~1 atom thick spur coming out of the heart, which perhaps directly joins to the bat form, with no intermediate shapes visible to onlookers during transformation (except for perhaps "disappearing" altogether). With vampires not having control over the transformation process it's easy to conceive of it as "/poof/ all of a sudden I'm a bat" and no need for more fine-grained control.

My gargoyle does have fine grained control of his transformations though! Made me realise he'd have an interesting way to carry out one of his orders:

  There was a knock at the door. Red grinned, placing the heavy book down to go answer it. William stood there, his clothing looking ever so slightly dishevelled; his shirt seemed to have hints of light grey powder on it, and his trousers were wrinkled. His tie was loose around his neck. A faint smell of smoke followed him inside. He did not smile; for the first time, Red thought he looked tired.

  “Come in, please. Are you okay?” Red asked, concerned. William entered and began stripping as soon as Red closed the door behind him.

  “I am fine.”

  “Do you have... a bag?” Red murmured, not quite sure what William - who was now naked as the day he was born - was playing at.

  “Why would I have a bag?” William asked, and then called out. “Julias!”

  “For the... thing you had to get for Elodia.”

  “Oh, that has already been delivered.” William said calmly. Julias appeared in the doorway, apparently unconcerned by his master's state of undress.

  “How may I be of assistance, your majesty?”

  “Take this clothing and destroy it.” He handed Julias his clothes, scrunched into a small bundle.

  “Of course, your majesty.” Julias replied, and his skin started rippling in that strange, hard to focus on way that it did whenever he transformed. The bundle of clothing disappeared instantly. Red squinted. He'd never seen Julias do that before. It seemed William hadn't, either. He raised his eyebrows and gave a small, impressed smile, the same way he had when Red had found everything on that shopping list of his all those months ago.

  “I take it that you have destroyed it as directed, rather than transporting it somewhere else?” William asked, apparently a bit uneasy.

  “In a manner of speaking, your majesty.” Julias shrugged. “My magic is complicated. Rest assured that no trace of it will be found, your majesty”

  “Very well. You are excused.”
