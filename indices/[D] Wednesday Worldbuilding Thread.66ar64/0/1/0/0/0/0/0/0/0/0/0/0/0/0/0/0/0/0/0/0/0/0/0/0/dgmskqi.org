  Maybe more of a brainstone, then? That sounds dumb... a /mind/stone. Less dumb. It'll do.

[[/ponibotsbinquiry][]] Heart drive.

  True, but there's nerves, which is the same sort of dealy.
#+end_quote

Yeah, his flesh body would have to have nerves. But they grow back really easily with regeneration.

#+begin_quote
  At which point he'd go into battle form and rip the net apart.
#+end_quote

...good point. The hypothetical assassin would need to ensure that he spends more energy that he can get every day for /months/ on end.

  lock him in a small room? He can go human, stick his butt against the door, transform into a gargoyle and then his tail is making a hole in the door which he can probably leverage to break through.
#+end_quote

Or, instead of breaking the door, he can just stick his tail tip into 3-space on the other side and do stuff there. Like undo bolts or remove bars.

#+begin_quote
  Again not sure if that would be possible - how much regeneration can he do? Can he regenerate all his fleshy organs with just the stone side (like a starfish), or does he need the organs that grow flesh in order to regenerate his flesh?
#+end_quote

If he can regrow everything from his heart drive/mindstone, then he has to be able to do this. If he can't, then - well, then the limits of his regeneration are entirely up to you. But it would make sense for a regenerating fighter to be able to do this.

  Here's a family picture I drew in 2005: [[http://i.imgur.com/W0jTe6E.png]] - needless to say the mythology has changed over the past 12 years, but the broad strokes are there...
#+end_quote

Ooooh, the gargoyle's tail has a spiky ball at the end? I'd been imagining it just kind of tapering off at the tip.

#+begin_quote
  Half gargoyle, half siren - genetically both and is able to breed with supernatural creatures and with humans.
#+end_quote

Either certain supernatural beasties are /ridiculously/ compatible (in terms of breeding with each other), or Malik was an extremely remote lucky chance, or magic must have somehow been used in his conception (perhaps the parents hired the extremely expensive services of a witch).
