  Or just hope that the vampire feeds somewhere there are people around: if it's a back alley behind a nightclub, then you can probably sit in the nightclub, watch through a hidden camera of some sort, and then make your entrance when your target is doubled over in pain.
#+end_quote

That's true. If the vampire expects a lot of people there, he's less likely to notice another one.

Not going to work if the vampire tends to feed within the comfort of his own home, though.

#+begin_quote
  Oh yeah. And they'll have a second janissary with them during feeds, who has instructions for how to deal with the damage (probably along the lines of pick them up, put them in the back of a waiting car, and drive them into a light-proof garage...)
#+end_quote

...and shoot anyone who turns up with a cocky grin, a wooden stake, and a large mallet.

#+begin_quote
  I don't know. I pictured the waste product thing being a subconscious thing like when mosquitos bite you it automatically releases various things into your blood to help them drink your blood better, and those products have nootropic effects. I /like/ the idea of a vampire being dependent on feeding from humans specifically, so that way /True Blood/ is impossible, and stealing from blood banks will cause you to fall ill over the course of a few days/weeks/months as the waste products build up in your system.
#+end_quote

Hmmm... fair enough. But he's not trying to go after blood here, he's trying to expel waste; can he not do this by biting on a blanket and sucking, in an attempt to fool his body's automatic responses?

#+begin_quote
  This would work the best; I'd imagine that some gold could be excreted for the same duration that the vampire is able to drink blood out of his own arm. Once he drinks his arm dry (and his arm probably has gold in it, too! He might even get back the gold he excretes...), he won't be able to excrete more gold.
#+end_quote

Hmmmmm... that seems reasonable. (He's got one arm and two legs that he can cut off, shove gold into, and dump if he needs to...)

#+begin_quote
  Definitely the sort of thing I could see a vampire who drank from someone who e.g. put a false skin pocket in their neck that was full of concentrated colloidal gold and so is in untold pain trying to desperately do to escape from it.
#+end_quote

Can humans (except the grandmother who made Rose) really make false skin good enough to fool a vampire at close range? And correctly predict where he intends to bite?

#+begin_quote
  Good point. I suppose he doesn't think Jack is actually a threat to him, he knows she has power in the anti-vampire community (her best friend Gwyn is a mage, who is constantly developing her powers: she could be a threat, but she defers to Jack, who is harmless...), and William knows she's got subconscious sympathy to him what with having been a janissary.
#+end_quote

Ah... maybe he's not worried about Jack, but he /is/ worried about what Gwyn will do if Jack turns out dead? Especially since Gwyn is not currently right in front of him and thus easily and quickly killable?

Leaving Jack alive as a means of subtly controlling Gwyn seems a good enough reason. In fact, he can start using Jack to provide Gwyn with a few interesting books and notes on types of magic that he wants Gwyn to be able to cast...

#+begin_quote
  It is /very hard/ to have the Bad Guy leave The Hero alive though.
#+end_quote

There are a few ways to do it; though most don't work for a Bad Guy who's already an unapologetic murderer. But "you're worth more to me alive than dead" is generally a good way, and a mage who is on William's side may just be enough of an asset to make it worth the risk. (Sure, their treaty doesn't put Gwyn on William's side just /yet/, but it gives him a chance to get close enough to do the necessary Diplomacy rolls...)

    What happens to a vampire who touches gold-impregnated tissue?
  #+end_quote

  Probably nothing unless there's gold atoms at the top layer of tissue (unlikely since the staining is likely permenant, so it doesn't leave the skin). After all, vampires can presumably touch golden items if they're wearing gloves, so direct contact would be necessary. It might sting a little bit if a couple of atoms are up there, but that's probably as bad as it gets.
#+end_quote

Okay, fair enough - and that stinging will warn a cautious vampire not to drink this person's blood.

--------------

Talking of vampire internals, let's think about the bat-form for a minute. Blood pumps around a human body in a fairly complicated way, but the vampire body is further complicated by having a bat-body joined at the heart. Does the blood do some fancy four-dimensional looping to flow through both bodies in some way? If so, does this mean the bat-form can also drain blood?
