  Oh yeah - I wonder what that is? I never really considered that. Maybe the heartstone /is/ the brain?
#+end_quote

When you mentioned the Heartstone, I assumed that was it - a silicon-based hypercomputer 'brain' would be somewhat stonelike.

Of course, he might use something as advanced beyond silicon as silicon is beyond abacuses; but silicon doesn't seem to cause any trouble.

#+begin_quote
  And that's why it's present in all slices, so that they can all be controlled
#+end_quote

Doesn't need to be in a slice to control it. Neither your brain nor your spinal cord are in your feet, but you can still wriggle your toes.

#+begin_quote
  where would they be?
#+end_quote

Centre of mass. Most space for heavy armour around it.

#+begin_quote
  So it'd make most sense for his "brain" heartstone to be in his /stone form/, not his battle form.
#+end_quote

Ooooh, yeah, that makes sense. So you'd have to utterly destroy his human form, /and/ his battle form, /and then/ break through his stone form...

...or, more likely, just wait for him to start recharging, put up some shadenet, leave him without sunlight for a few days, and then come back with heavy mining equipment.

#+begin_quote
  Maybe the spinal cord stone will heal given time, though?
#+end_quote

He's a good deal more terrifying as a fighter if the whole of him can (eventually) heal from just the Heartstone and a suitable supply of matter (anyone got a spare planet?)

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, unless we go for him having a distributed brainy-heart-stone-thingy, so he'd be able to control every part of it. I kind of like the possibility of existential angst as he gets severed and the human side realises that he's doomed.
#+end_quote

Hmmm. That's more a case of two hims than one that controls everything, but yes, I can see that working.

Even more existential angst when the gargoyle side tells the human side that he has to eat him to have enough matter to regenerate his /own/ fleshy side.

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, but with the flesh iceberg severed, unless he can find a 4D surgeon, the fleshy parts of his gargoyle body are going to die.
#+end_quote

I was assuming that, as long as he had the mass available, his gargoyle side could regrow the fleshy side.

#+begin_quote
  a pretty ordinary-looking stone gargoyle body that would allow him to live a more or less normal life
#+end_quote

More-or-less normal in the same sense that a man with only one leg can - sure, he can do most things, but he would far rather not have lost that bit.

#+begin_quote
  so he might be eating 100% if he was in a long-term relationship - or even more as no doubt his son would bring him tasty rocks from time to time.
#+end_quote

[[/twistare][]] Wait - is his son part-gargoyle? Genetically, I mean? Or is he biologically pure human?

[[/sp][]]

#+begin_quote
  Not sure if Julias would eat garbage in front of his masters though; he'd know from experience that many find it disturbing and would not want to weird them out, after all...
#+end_quote

Well, not /deliberately/. But it's the sort of thing that Red could stumble across while going downstairs unexpectedly for a midnight snack.
