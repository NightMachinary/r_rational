  Sounds logical. He wouldn't even need to attach it to his 3D-visible forms. His lovecraftian horror "iceberg of flesh" would have somewhere to attach such a thing.
#+end_quote

[[/twibeam][]] That can work!

  (actually, he's probably got the lovecraftian equivalent of extremely long hair or fingernails in 4D space, since 4D objects are so /heavy/)
#+end_quote

[[/louder][]] Hold it! Long hair and fingernails get in the way in a fight. Whatever else he is, Julius is a /bodyguard/ - which means a fighter. He's got to keep himself in shape (cut his hair, trim his nails, do regular exercise) - so that he can be ready to protect the Master at any moment against even /difficult/ dangers.

  over the centuries he's probably got such an unimaginable excess of matter that it would take one of those "if he was reduced to an atom in size once an hour for ten thousand years, he'd use 1% of his mass" type of koans.
#+end_quote

An atom? His 3D body could be /entirely disintegrated/ and he'd merely shift over one slice and he's back and now he's /angry/ and he's grabbing that disintegration cannon and did you update your last will before you fired it? No? Too late now, then. (Of course, that does effectively cut him in twain - the part /above/ the 3D universe is cut away from the part /below/, so it could still be a severe injury, depending on exactly how his body is arranged - just not a mortal one)

  The average human eats ~1000kg per year. He's probably eating about 1% of that, or 100kg.
#+end_quote

[[/flutterkay][]] 1% of 1000kg is 10kg.

#+begin_quote
  I mean, if he had a master who liked using him for target practise he probably wouild need to eat more.
#+end_quote

Well, naturally. And if he /did/ get disintegrated, he'd probably want a few big meals afterwards.

#+begin_quote
  I looked into what sort of elements are in food as opposed to sandstone and they were surprisingly similar.
#+end_quote

Not /really/ surprising, considering that plants get a lot of their matter from sand which is just ground-up rocks. (Maybe Julius occasionally crunches his way through an aluminium pot or a handful of computer chips in order to maintain a balanced diet... /that/ will probably lead to questions if Red stumbles across him doing so).

#+begin_quote
  (Nah, he'd store the carbon to regenerate the organic portions of his body).
#+end_quote

The organic portions of his body are probably the easiest to injure, so over time they'll take the most damage. He'll need that excess (eventually).
