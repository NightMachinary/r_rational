    If anyone can handle the cutthroat world of over 40 marathoning, Fiona sure can!
  #+end_quote

  Eh, it's not really cut-throat. It's more a matter of putting in a ridiculous amount of work to cut five minutes off your marathon time so that you can beat /that guy/ this time round.
#+end_quote

Ah, so basically like Ingress. She's also competitive, so she'd be in for it.

#+begin_quote
  Oh, she'd be tested well before she even /got/ to the world-class marathon. Even small, local marathons might have some sort of anti-doping policy.
#+end_quote

TIL. Well, good thing werewolves have normal blood and pee.

  But why is the robot filling her fridge with easily perishable foods?
#+end_quote

People have easily perishable foods, and given her aesthetic sort of preferences, she's the sort of person who'd eat a lot of perishables. More likely, Fiona eats a lot of perishables, so she gives Rose a copy of her shopping list every week?

#+begin_quote
  (What does she do with the food, anyway?)
#+end_quote

Throws it out. Cooks some of it the house smells lived in.

#+begin_quote
  Less perishable foods can sit in the fridge longer, saving on restocking and disposal.
#+end_quote

Yeah. If I wrote it again I'd probably put a very different set of foods in the fridge.

  How does the Slayer know how old the handprint on the rock is? I mean, the age of the rock can be calculated by a geologist, but a hobbyist can recreate the ancient inks and do a small art project today that will take serious effort to date once the paint has finished drying.
#+end_quote

Confirmation bias. The Slayer thinks the robot is an unimaginably old vampire, and everything she sees confirms that.

Also, growing up in Australia you see lots of pictures of Aboriginal art, so no doubt she goes "that's aboriginal art" rather than "that's a painting done in the style of aboriginal art".

For the record, it was a legitimate artwork that William felt was an appropriate welcoming gift.
