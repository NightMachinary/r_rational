  I was thinking he would use his tail for that, being the limb that doesn't have an analogue in his 3D body.
#+end_quote

Regardless, he can use whichever limb it is to "hang" things in other parts of his 4D shape, allowing him to use hammerspace... Which is not necessarily a problem. I might have to ask on the upcoming munchkinry thread "how would you abuse hammerspace?" to see what I'm not thinking of.

#+begin_quote
  What sort of stone he's made of
#+end_quote

Sandstone, so he should be fine.

#+begin_quote
  at least as human as R. Daneel Olivaw
#+end_quote

Have not read much with him (though I have read /mirror image/ a long time ago). I take it he'd have a realistic butt going on?

#+begin_quote
  where does what he eats go?
#+end_quote

Just into 4D space. Like I said, the calculations were done previously and they indicated that 0.01% of his total mass is in any one of his cross-sections (or that his whole 4D body weighs more than the Earth). Either way, anything he eats just gets glommed into his 4D body: probably digested in some ineffable way, used for any raw material he might need for regeneration, etc.

#+begin_quote
  And, related to that, what does he breathe out?
#+end_quote

If he chooses to breathe, he's probably just breathing out the same air he breathed in. So a scientist would be able to tell something was odd about him by measuring his breath.

#+begin_quote
  Is he powering himself from the complete conversion of matter to energy
#+end_quote

Nah, sunlight. He spends the daytime in a fully stone form that does some sort of advanced photosynthesis. Because it has to feed a gigantic 4D body, it has to be /very/ advanced photosynthesis. He can forgo it for a few hours at a time, but only occasionally as he probably has very low power reserves. If he doesn't manage his energy very carefully he's probably going to die - like a hummingbird I suppose.

#+begin_quote
  in which case he might well need only a small snack every century
#+end_quote

He eats regularly, mostly for social reasons. His sense of taste is... different. (Aside: I'm actually doing an assignment on the determinants of food choice right now. Or rather, procrastinating.)
