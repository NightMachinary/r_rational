  Then again, it's probably not /unheard of/ for an old vampire to pop back up after living underground (perhaps literally) since before the catastrophe, and it's even less unheard of for an old vampire to vanish for a few decades or centuries and then come back with a new hairstyle, so William could be assuming Rose is one of those.

Hmmmm. Might even be an old vampire that William had less-than-cordial relations with at the time of vanishing. Maybe someone he needed to apologise to, only then she vanished before receiving his apology so now he's overdue...

  NINJA EDIT: No, wait. She played dead for a while, then (SPOILERS FOR VOLUME THREE OF MY BOOK???) William attacked her to save Red, he got overpowered, and then her torso got up and fought off the attacker who turned into a bat and ran away: everyone wins.

Oooooh, yeah. Here's another thought - for better conductivity, her wires are gold instead of copper. This comes into play when one of the two vampires touches her exposed wiring and it burns... so, when she gets up again, she fights off the attacker by stabbing him with her neck (and the exposed wires therein) - which means that yes, he could (say) rip off her arms, but that just gives her something more to attack him with.

(The gold wiring and the vampiric weakness to gold both, of course, need to be introduced earlier in the story for proper foreshadowing).

  Yeah, sorry, should have been more clear. Meant "why don't vampires wear ridiculous plate armour when they're expecting battle" rather than "why don't vampires look like they're at the ren faire?"
#+end_quote

Might be an agility thing. Vampires in armour will still be faster than an unarmoured human, but /not/ faster than an unarmoured vampire. (Actually, a vampire regrows arms a lot faster and more easily than a human - it might make sense for a vampire to armour /only/ their most vulnerable spots - i.e. heart and neck - and leave the rest unarmoured).

  Ah, but she's not allowed access to the grandkids anymore: on account of her being the sort of mad scientist who tries to make robot copies of family members. (Only, I guess nobody knows she can do that: but she's weird and Doesn't Seem Safe, so you know...)

She technically doesn't need access to the grandkids to take a brainscan. Just send a package containing a very large helmet as a gift for the grandkid (along with a cartoonishly large radio antenna and blinky LEDs on the front) and ask for a picture of the darling grandkid wearing the Super Brainscan Space Helmet that she made herself.

(Whether the parents will fall for that is another question entirely. But, hey, worth a try, right?)
