  Okay. Next question; when vampires exchange land, do they generally count 'equivalent' to imply equivalent /acreage/ or equivalent /population/ (thus equivalent prey)?
#+end_quote

I think it's on a case-by-case basis, and I'd imagine it's not so much done by exchange as "I want to be the King of Paris. Do you have a problem with that?" - only much like modern marriage proposals, you only ask the question if you already know the answer - so over the past few years, you've been communicating with the Queen of Paris and making it clear that she'd better have an exit strategy because you're going to be the King of Paris before too long, so she ultimately expects you to take it (and, if she has a problem with it, she'll reply back with biting commentary of her own, references to some Big Deal Guy owing her a favour, to the number of Dukes she has, etc).

So, basically, William was born in Tournai, Belgium: let's say he decides he wants to pack up and move there for a few centuries, in a fit of nostalgia. He'd communicate with the current King of the wider area that Tournai is in (let's say the King of Belgium for clarity's sake) - maybe that King is more powerful than him, so his negotiations develop and he is ultimately happy to be the Duke of Tournai: or, perhaps the title is important to him (it surely is), so the King of Belgium allows William to take control of the /Kingdom of Tournai/, which is entirely within the borders of the Kingdom of Belgium. In exchange, the King of Belgium can use the territory of New Holland (William's home) to give to an ally of /his/, perhaps someone else who likes large acerages, and perhaps resolve a centuries-old dispute.

  But the best way to reform /actual/ meat production is not to refrain from eating meat; one better way would be to get into meat production yourself, do it ethically, and /advertise/ the fact. Push the advertising to the point of getting a 'who-can-be-most-ethical' arms race going in the meat industry.
#+end_quote

Someone's trying to do that in England with milk; the problem is, it's extremely expensive so as not to be commercially viable. Like, milk is ten times the cost. Almond, soy, rice, hemp, etc milk are all about twice the price of cow's milk, so it seems like a complete waste to buy cow's milk in that case. (If one prefers the taste, surely one doesn't prefer the taste /that much/?)

Regardless, if it follows that you therefore accept 1, 2, 3, then "it is better" not to eat meat. If you want to start an ethical meat company (which I'm not convinced will be economically viable due to the space required), then "it is better" not to eat meat until the first ethically-raised animal reaches a decent chunk of its natural life span and ethically slaughtered. And once that's all set up, "it is better" to forego meat from all other sources until you are convinced there's a quality assurance process that meets ethical standards.

In my experience most people accept tenets 1, 2 and 3 and choose to eat meat anyway and this is relatively uncontroversial; it's why I was using it as an example for vampires feeding on humans. People will then try and justify meat consumption for a host of other reasons, but I think this is mostly cognitive dissonance: you just have to accept the dissonance. We all do all manner of completely selfish things in our lives the second we spend money on anything other than the basic necessities of life.

So yeah, vampires no doubt accept that killing humans in the eating process is not necessary and is bad, but it's more convenient (they can eat more rarely, no need to worry about the masquerade failing, the process of stopping one's feed is traumatic - I'll chuck William remembering his first meal at the bottom of this one for an idea)

    The protein thing is a complete and utter myth, garbage, honestly.
  #+end_quote

  Huh. Here I thought you'd have to include some percentage of some kind of soybeans.
#+end_quote

Soybeans are a "complete protein" (which is again, a myth: actually every food has complete proteins in it, just some are in far tinier quantities), and they're an excellent source of lysine. So they are really good /if you have a low calorie plant-based diet/.

  I think if you're a science lab you can order them. (Googling suggests they go for around a hundred dollars each, so I assume that means there's a fair demand). And they're pretty much ordinary mice until they get injured. But I think they can regenerate about the same speed as your vampires...
#+end_quote

I have my old rat cage somewhere. Can I be a science lab???? Hmmm.

Now I want to go through to do my phD so I can order some science mice... When I was entertaining the thought of doing postgraduate studies in nutrition I was idly imagining doing studies on how the BMR changes during HRT for gender dysphoria (since females and males have different BMRs, I'd be interested in how much effect the hormonal stuff has on it: I'd assume most of it since I think it's due to body fat percentage?). Then again I never ever bothered googling to see if it had been studied.

#+begin_quote
  ...this is not a super-genius vampire that I am seeing here. Careful, yes. Delicate and precise. Incredible memory and fact retention. Good physical self-control. Heightened senses. He'd win dozens of trivia contests on the strength of that memory alone. But I'm not seeing the analytical genius in this passage.
#+end_quote

Yeah. I'm not sure how I want to go with that. I mean, better to keep him more human so I can actually write from his point of view, right? And there's no real purpose to making him more intelligent than I show there, it only paints me in a corner.

#+begin_quote
  (It may even be that, due to the heightened memory and senses, William /thinks/ there is more of a difference between his mind now and his pre-vampire mind than there actually was - especially if the heightened memory only counts for things that happened after his vampirisation)
#+end_quote

That is almost certainly the case: cognitive dissonance, again. Better you think you are more different from humans than you /actually/ are, so you can live with the fact that you enslave and eat them.

    Also, a little excerpt from a conversation earlier in the story, where a fellow thrall is warning Red of what he's getting into:
  #+end_quote

  ...spooky. Somewhat disquieting. One certainly has a sense that Red is standing at the precipice of he-knows-not-what and it may be too late already.

[[/glimmerwink][]] Thanks! I appreciate the compliment. Not bad for a gay supernatural romance, eh?

*William feeding for the first time*

He woke up, unable to move; his arms pinned to his sides, his legs pinned together by off-white linen. He could not breathe, but realised that that did not bother him.

But the hunger, oh, the hunger. As a man he felt hunger in his stomach, or sometimes in his throat; but even on the road, when they had not found game for a week, he did not feel hunger like this. This hunger was in the centre of his chest, in his heart, and it burned, it bled into every part of him.

He struggled against the linen, wanting to be free, to find something to eat. He heard, dimly, the voices of the mourners around him, praying for his soul.

He wondered if that soul was in paradise now.

He heard some murmuring; people saw his movement, as he promised them they would.

Footsteps, and he felt a hand begin to unwrap his bandages.

Clothar, one of his trusted generals, pulled back the last layer of linen and his face filled Clovis' field of vision.

For a moment, the men smiled at each other; a soft, friendly smile that they often shared during quiet moments when they were alone. A smile that in another time and another place might have meant more than the loyalty of a general to his king.

Clovis smelled Clothar's blood; his arms were free, his fangs extended.

He leapt, with agility he did not know he had, and dug the teeth roughly into Clothar's shoulder; the smell of the blood filled him with joy. As he imbibed the liquid that flowed slowly through the shoulder as his teeth slashed on bone, he felt Clothar's spirit, his soul, his loyalty and his love for his commander all at once.

It was the most amazing thing he had ever tasted. He drank Clothar in greedily, as Clothar cried out, first in surprise but then in pleasure. Clovis grew more excited; it was a beautiful moment, and they were sharing it together, better than the victory at the Battle of Soissons where they had drunk a little too much mead and ended up sharing a horse for many miles. This was beyond that; spiritually, he felt them joining.

Then he felt the body, limp in his hands; the connection severed as the blood ran out.

Panicked, he started lapping up the blood that was spilled; the blood that pooled on Clothar's shoulder, the blood that was soaked into his tunic.

Then, he heard the screaming that filled the church....

--------------

Aside: Originally I conceived of William having been Clovis I, king of the Franks. I'm wondering if that's too wanky, even though he's a relatively obscure historical figure. So I'm contemplating just having him be a guy from that same time and place who was not the king of France. Also, standard disclaimer about it being old: I don't think vampire fangs extend during feeding anymore for example. Doesn't really make sense? Or maybe it does?

--------------

Random other aside: I was thinking about vampires eating through their lungs, and I was going, "wouldn't it make more sesne for them to eat through their stomach and vampire goo through their lungs?", but then I realised the lungs go directly to the heart and the stomach goes to the heart via the liver, so the lungs actually are the most direct route from the mouth to the heart.

[[/flutterroll][]] /The way to a man's heart is through his stomach/, indeed!
