  Less than 3 million: so smaller than Paris. William's all about those large tracts of land.
#+end_quote

Okay. Next question; when vampires exchange land, do they generally count 'equivalent' to imply equivalent /acreage/ or equivalent /population/ (thus equivalent prey)?

#+begin_quote
  I'll chuck a section of it on the end of this post so you can see what I mean.
#+end_quote

Hmmmm. Let's see.

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, but Tenet 1 doesn't mean "producing meat necessarily harms animals", it's closer to "the way meat is produced today harms animals".
#+end_quote

Okay, fair point - I don't know much about /actual/ meat production. But the best way to reform /actual/ meat production is not to refrain from eating meat; one better way would be to get into meat production yourself, do it ethically, and /advertise/ the fact. Push the advertising to the point of getting a 'who-can-be-most-ethical' arms race going in the meat industry.

  Progress is going pretty well, actually. I think a lab grown burger is now only a few thousand dollars instead of a few /hundred thousand/.
#+end_quote

That's good!

  The protein thing is a complete and utter myth, garbage, honestly.
#+end_quote

Huh. Here I thought you'd have to include some percentage of some kind of soybeans.

#+begin_quote
  Nooo but I googled it and now I want one.
#+end_quote

I think if you're a science lab you can order them. (Googling suggests they go for around a hundred dollars each, so I assume that means there's a fair demand). And they're pretty much ordinary mice until they get injured. But I think they can regenerate about the same speed as your vampires...

  *Excerpt from JaNoWriMo Novel:*
#+end_quote

...this is not a super-genius vampire that I am seeing here. Careful, yes. Delicate and precise. Incredible memory and fact retention. Good physical self-control. Heightened senses. He'd win dozens of trivia contests on the strength of that memory alone. But I'm not seeing the analytical genius in this passage.

(It may even be that, due to the heightened memory and senses, William /thinks/ there is more of a difference between his mind now and his pre-vampire mind than there actually was - especially if the heightened memory only counts for things that happened after his vampirisation)

  Also, a little excerpt from a conversation earlier in the story, where a fellow thrall is warning Red of what he's getting into:
#+end_quote

...spooky. Somewhat disquieting. One certainly has a sense that Red is standing at the precipice of he-knows-not-what and it may be too late already.
