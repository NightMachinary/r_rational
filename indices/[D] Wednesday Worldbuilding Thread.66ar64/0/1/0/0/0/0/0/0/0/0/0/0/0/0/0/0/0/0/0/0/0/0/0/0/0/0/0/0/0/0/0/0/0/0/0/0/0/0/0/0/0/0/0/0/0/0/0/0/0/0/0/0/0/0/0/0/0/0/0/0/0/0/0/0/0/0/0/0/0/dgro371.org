  Hmmmm. Might even be an old vampire that William had less-than-cordial relations with at the time of vanishing. Maybe someone he needed to apologise to, only then she vanished before receiving his apology so now he's overdue...

Ooo, that would be good. "She could be one of half a dozen people... I thought Genevive was dead, but who knows. And Octavia was so very offended by the cake I presented her with, so if it's her I'd better crawl... I'll have to send an 'I'm sorry for sending the wrong cake' gift post-haste"

  Oooooh, yeah. Here's another thought - for better conductivity, her wires are gold instead of copper. This comes into play when one of the two vampires touches her exposed wiring and it burns... so, when she gets up again, she fights off the attacker by stabbing him with her neck (and the exposed wires therein) - which means that yes, he could (say) rip off her arms, but that just gives her something more to attack him with.

That's so metal! I love it. I'm trying to work out how well-known the vampire weakness to gold is. Things are all happening out of order so when we do more prologue it will be fun to see how long the vampire hunters take to figure out that gold is a point of weakness.

That said, there's a scene in the novella where William gives Red a silver dagger, and tells him that it really hurts vampires, so the vampires are obviously perpetrating the silver myth come hell or high water.

  (The gold wiring and the vampiric weakness to gold both, of course, need to be introduced earlier in the story for proper foreshadowing).
#+end_quote

Been trying to foreshadow the gold thing a bit: William receives something made of brass, and brass is said to symbolise "something that appears hurtful but is not"; William mentions the vampire superstition against touching money; and this little exchange really amused me:

/“And when [humans] have bombs that make sunlight? When they can make gold from lead? Do you want to be on their bad side when that happens?”/

  Might be an agility thing. Vampires in armour will still be faster than an unarmoured human, but /not/ faster than an unarmoured vampire.
#+end_quote

Yep. Wouldn't really be good for vampire on vampire combat, but I suspect most fights a vampire gets into are with non-vampires.

#+begin_quote
  (Actually, a vampire regrows arms a lot faster and more easily than a human - it might make sense for a vampire to armour /only/ their most vulnerable spots - i.e. heart and neck - and leave the rest unarmoured).
#+end_quote

That too!

  She technically doesn't need access to the grandkids to take a brainscan. Just send a package containing a very large helmet as a gift for the grandkid (along with a cartoonishly large radio antenna and blinky LEDs on the front) and ask for a picture of the darling grandkid wearing the Super Brainscan Space Helmet that she made herself.

  (Whether the parents will fall for that is another question entirely. But, hey, worth a try, right?)

Anything's worth a try. If we revisit the robot thing (which I guess we'll have to do if I ever get to writing volume 3), we'll have to sort it out. I'm /not/ having the third volume of a Rational Supernatural Romance Novel being /irrational/ like that. I'd sooner go it alone!
