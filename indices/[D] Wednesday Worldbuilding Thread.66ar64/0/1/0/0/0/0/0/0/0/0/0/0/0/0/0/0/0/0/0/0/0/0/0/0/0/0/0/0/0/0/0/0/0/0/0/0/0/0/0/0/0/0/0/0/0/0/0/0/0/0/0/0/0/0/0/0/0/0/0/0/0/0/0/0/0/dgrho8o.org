    and then freaked out when Rose came in and didn't need an invitation
  #+end_quote

  And he /knows/ she's not human, because she had no trouble breathing in at atmosphere filled with lethal amounts of something nastily poisonous or similar, I imagine...

Nah, Jack told him her robot brother was a ghoul, the robot brother was doing stuff consistent with being the ghoul of a /very old/ vampire, after Jack threatened Fiona, Fiona lied and confirmed that the brother was a ghoul and Rose didn't seem to be a ghoul, maybe she was a vampire, Jack went back to William and told him that Rose was a vampire, etc. William is just perplexed by all of this until probably-Cassius comes and rips Rose's head off in a territorial dispute and there's wires and he realise what's happened.

    (Aside: I always wondered why vampires don't wear better armour. If they're super strong, they should have no problem being able to wear full plate or riot gear/etc and still be agile. Great way to protect yourself from a staking from a human, if nothing else. Is there something I'm missing?)

  Ego and a conviction that it won't happen to them. Do /you/ wear armour to protect yourself from beestings? Even if you're allergic to bees to a lethal degree?
#+end_quote

If I had an enemy who was throwing beehives through my door when I opened it, I probably would, yes. William wouldn't go around wearing armour but when he's feeling vulnerable or expecting a plucky vampire hunter at the door he might. (And Jack, the Plucky Vampire Hunter, became a janissary for a while and started getting /violent/ to make him feed from her.)

  Is he a neuroscientist? .... Mind you, he /can/ upgrade her by giving her new hardware or extra 'features'
#+end_quote

Yeah, I'd imagine the mad scientist used standard connectors so the boyfriend can swap out RAM or hard drives or whatever. He'd not want to touch the software because that's "her"

#+begin_quote
  Yeah... either copied from his original's mind or introduced due to a flaw in the copy process.
#+end_quote

That's probably what it was; the mad scientist never got the boy right, despite upgrading the hardware a lot. Probably it was a problem with the personality capturing in the brain scanner, which is why fixing the hardware never worked.
