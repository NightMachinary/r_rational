  How is it narratively different from him having a well-hidden safe in his room? ... it's not like he's going to be carrying it around everywhere with him

Well, if we imagine him having at least one 4D arm that he can use to grab the clothing and eat it, he would be able to put all the items he wants to keep in hammerspace onto his 3D cross sections and so hold /quite a lot/ of stuff. I mean, he'd have to concentrate to keep his fists closed or something, but he could even tie them to his arms if we say that any movement one of his forms makes is repeated on all of them.

That's where you're wrong! I can ask tons of embarrassing questions about gargoyle digestion. Because I seriously don't know whether he has an anus.

I mean, he's got a human-looking body, and all of his bodies can eat in that the mouth is attached to his 4D stomach. So he's got a functional mouth.

He has a son, so he can obviously make babies. So he's got some sort of penis in at least one of his forms (his son is with a siren, so, probably a human-compatible penis). He's canonically slept with men and women, so that's more evidence for a human compatible penis as well.

So he can need a penis, that's fine, since who doesn't want to reproduce, or at least, do the things that are conducive to it. (I know, I know, our ace friends don't)

But he doesn't need an anus. All his waste just gets put into his hammerspace. So, does he have one? It would make his human form more convincing if he needs it to be, so maybe his human form has one - because why have a human form if it can't pass a strip search? Actually, now I think about it, if he's a two inch thick layer of flesh over a stone core, he wouldn't pass a modern "is this prisoner smuggling drugs up his butt" type test. So he probably also has a fake colon for some appropriate length so he'd be able to pass those things??? Or perhaps he has a fleshy tube joining his mouth and anus to keep appearances of having an esophagus and colon, though he'd look very weird with an endoscopy or colonoscopy and presumably the type of epithelium would change halfway through? (Probably at the nexus where food is transferred out of his 3D form and into his 4D form)

But then, the fifteen foot tall stone gargoyle doesn't need to have an anus /at all/. So I suppose it doesn't? Or if we give him a tube, perhaps he does to maintain his topological shape? I'm going to need to ask my husband...

Anyway.... this is why we try to ignore the embarrassing mechanical questions about anatomy and digestion. There's a lot of evidence around the place but it's all rather more information than I'd really care to know. And yet you start wondering about these things and you can't stop.
