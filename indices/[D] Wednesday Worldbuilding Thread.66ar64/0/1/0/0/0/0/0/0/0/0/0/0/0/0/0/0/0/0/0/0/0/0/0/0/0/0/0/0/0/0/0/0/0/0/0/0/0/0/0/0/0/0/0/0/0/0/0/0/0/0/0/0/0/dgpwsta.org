  I'm not really familiar with the social structures around Ingress, so I'll take your word for it.

My boyfriend plays and he's going through some shit at the moment because of some drama. It's... interesting. Usually everyone's good though and there's a good-natured sort of camaraderie. Also an ingress team in another country paid AU$150 to get him onto a particular little holiday island near us (Rottnest, it's called) and I got to tag along, which was pretty nice.

  Seems a bit wasteful. Why not send regular donations to a nearby soup kitchen?

That's not going to make her look like a real human if a social worker comes by. Then again, neither is having a bunch of apparently good food in her garbage.

Knowing her, what she probably actually does is cooks big meals periodically and then gives them to homeless people or neighbours (probably in disguise so nobody catches on). She would do things like e.g. cooking a small amount of garlic or onion or something else stinky every couple of nights and then throwing it out, and maybe pouring milk down the sink to throw the cartons out so her garbage looks normal.
