  Heart drive.

/groan/ that's terrible. I love it.

  Ooooh, the gargoyle's tail has a spiky ball at the end? I'd been imagining it just kind of tapering off at the tip.

Nah, the mace was 2005!MW. 2017!MW I think settled on a dragon-spike or a more normal taper like you said.

  Either certain supernatural beasties are ridiculously compatible (in terms of breeding with each other), or Malik was an extremely remote lucky chance, or magic must have somehow been used in his conception (perhaps the parents hired the extremely expensive services of a witch).

Supernatural beasties are basically all compatible with each other and with humans (many humans have very thin supernatural blood, which gives them powers like e.g. slightly improved sense of smell). But they have a very low probability of conception. Malik's parents didn't hire the services of a witch; he was conceived naturally. His parents were married for something like 300-400 years and he's their only child, so being different demon species is about as effective contraception as having a vasectomy is. He was an "accident", I suppose, but they weren't doing anything to prevent his conception and were no doubt overjoyed to have him.

/Completely random aside:/

Malik /does/ have a brother named Kamal who isn't canon yet (he wasn't even canon in 2005, so he may never be). Given the rarity of demon pregnancies I'm not sure how to deal with him. Originally he was conceived as a twin brother (which could probably still happen - I assume sirens can give birth to twins), but I've toyed with making him a half-human half-siren person (thus Malik's half brother). In this case, I conceive of supernaturals not considering extra-marital one night stands with humans a problem, or possibly that Kamal is from before the siren met Malik's father. (I conceive of an impure demon having a lifespan of ~1000 years and Kamal having a lifespan of ~300 years, so I am not sure if this would work well in the timeline if we assume demons are monogamous.)

I imagine the mother leaving Kamal with his father, and then Kamal is taken in by a local monastery and ends up being an immortal monk and the source of many pilgrimages. Keeping a strict vegetarian diet whilst constantly craving human flesh (not being half gargoyle he has no pica to contend with, so /yay/?). But no real idea how to incorporate him into the story. I imagined him as receiving periodic secret visits from his siren mother and somehow gaining access to his culture that way, and then when she is killed he eventually leaves the monastery and looks for her? (That said I'm considering not killing her off now as I hate putting characters in the fridge: perhaps a divorce and the siren raises Kamal more conventionally???)
