  (The Beast of Gevaudan is certainly not a werewolf, so could well have been a vampire, and the silver bullet is just random folklore)

Hmmmm. But it is a wolf - or at least wolf/like/ - which should probably disqualify it from being a vampire, for the same reason as why it's a lot of work to get a vampire horse. Mind you, this doesn't prevent it from being a supernatural beastie of /some/ sort, even if it can't actually be a werewolf; and it /certainly/ doesn't prevent a few innovative vampires from spreading stories about the effectiveness of silver bullets against vampires.

  Speaking of, the story is now basically as finished as it's going to be so I'm more than ready for readers if you were still wanting to be so kind.

Eh. Worldbuilding is fun, and twiddling with all the little details that make a story work is great, but I'm not so enthusiastic about reading a romance story and even /less/ enthusiastic when the romance is between two guys. You've got a very interesting world, and I love poking at the logic behind it, but the specific story that you're putting into this world is really not my kind of thing.

So, yeah, I'm going to decline this offer. But thanks for offering.

And much congratulations on your achievement! May those who enjoy the idea of a romance between two guys find great enjoyment from your book.

  Hm. You're right. Reflexes make a fight between human and vampire completely unfair. That's... a lot to think about. Like, Jack has a crossbow and she at some point even has the tip gold-plated. Does she just /think/ it's gonna be useful and will get rudely awakened if William actually wants to kill her?
#+end_quote

A crossbow? Pretty much, yeah.

Vampire versus Hunter is going to come down to a matter of preparation and knowledge. A Hunter who really, /really/ knows what he's doing, and who has the right weapons, can probably take down a Vampire - but an important step in that process is that the Vampire must never know he's being targeted. (And a crossbow is /not/ the right weapon).

On the Hunter's side, the Vampire is going to have significant trouble entering a house uninvited (but this is hardly a problem, since he can just send in a jannissary with a gun instead). And if the Hunter is not inside a suitable dwelling, then the Vampire has every advantage.

Unless, and this is important, /unless/ the Hunter has taken the opportunity to pre-inject himself with a saline solution full of gold nanoparticles. /This/ Hunter will give the Vampire who bites him a mouthful of auric pain, which should paralyse the vampire long enough for the Hunter to provide a death blow (though it might be somewhat addictive to the Hunter).

Or a hunter could trick a vampire into catching something that [[http://sluggy.com/comics/archives/daily/20040208][blows up, throwing gold powder in his face]].

So it is /possible/ for a properly prepared Hunter to win against an alert but ill-prepared Vampire. But it's very much not the way to bet - most actual vampire deaths would have involved staking the vampire in his sleep.

"Okay, that's completely impossible. Science is nowhere /near/ that point yet."
