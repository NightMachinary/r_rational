  is a wolf - or at least wolf/like/ - which should probably disqualify it from being a vampire
#+end_quote

I haven't exactly made any sort of "official" ruling, but I'd imagine the Beast of Gevaudan was probably just an ordinary (if particularly vicious) wolf, as it no doubt was in reality.

  So, yeah, I'm going to decline this offer. But thanks for offering.
#+end_quote

No problem! Thanks for letting me know.

#+begin_quote
  And much congratulations on your achievement! May those who enjoy the idea of a romance between two guys find great enjoyment from your book.

Hopefully the intersection of such people and [[/r/rational]] will be larger than I think. Otherwise, eh, I wrote it and that makes /me/ happy, and that's all you can really ask for.

  /unless/ the Hunter has taken the opportunity to pre-inject himself with a saline solution full of gold nanoparticles. /This/ Hunter will give the Vampire who bites him a mouthful of auric pain, which should paralyse the vampire long enough for the Hunter to provide a death blow (though it might be somewhat addictive to the Hunter).
#+end_quote

Geez. That's... pretty metal. Problem with that is the feeding process is so pleasurable that the Hunter might have trouble pre-committing to killing the vampire. I mean, carnal events can make you go numb and your mind go all foggy: even if the vampire is in trouble from feeding from you, you've got to be able to make the killing blow in the no doubt short window of opportunity you have.

(Or maybe the window of opportunity is longer than you'd think: perhaps vampires are not only weak to gold, but their weakness to gold is far stronger than their weakness to silver is portrayed as in media? And eating from the gold-infused human would cause the vampire to be incapacitated for /hours/? Or in intense pain until he could find another human to feed from so he can excrete the gold out of his body? And basically he'd need a janissary or ghoul to come and help him out with that, since he might be in too much pain to do anything more than move?)

Now I'm wondering if such a technique is how Jack becomes a janissary in the first place. Originally she just gets grabbed by a Bad Guy and eaten from, and then is saved by her mage-ally Gwyn.

  most actual vampire deaths would have involved staking the vampire in his sleep.
#+end_quote

No doubt.

Aaand that is how we get CelestAI, maybe? :|

--------------

Here you go, another passage from another short thingy I wrote a while ago, where Jack is telling William that she's not going to be feeding him anymore. It features the crossbow /and/ a vampire wearing a chestplate. This is just after Red gets turned into a vampire and is /really, really impolite/ and it's giving William the shits.

It's me trying to work out how Jack and William would come to a truce. I was going to paste it in here, but it's actually 8,000 characters on its own, and Reddit's limit is 10,000, so it's too long. Ah well. I shouldn't put such long stuff in posts anyway. Here's a couple of tiny bits from it.

  William nodded. “You are aware, I take it, that you are threatening me in my lair, whilst I am in armour that would render your bow useless, gold or no?”

  “I've seen your kind get hit by gold. It ain't pretty.” She said, grabbing at the handle again. She felt she could see the vampire tense up minutely at this.

  “That may be so, but one bolt would do little to slow me, at least not until after I had dispatched you. You are, after all, aware that the human body is a fragile thing.”

  “I have subordinates in most towns, and I correspond with them regularly. It is my function to ensure there is a peace, that hunting grounds are appropriately distributed, that janissaries are not taken suspiciously and deaths are kept at sustainable levels.”

  “Whatever.” Jack said. “If we kill you, they'll just have to deal.”

  “That is precisely the problem. They are all rather young; the eldest, who makes her home in Darwin, is only two hundred years of age. There will be competition for my lands; in a few short years several upstarts may migrate here, all with voracious appetites. Whoever ends up as king after I am gone may well not be as willing to negotiate as I.”

  “Well, we'll kill him too!”

  “And the next one? And the next? Sooner or later, your luck will run out.”

  “They'll find someone else to do it. I'll find someone else. There's always more of us.”

  “So you will not consider an alternative to all this death and destruction?”

  “Like what?”

  “As you are well aware, despite my janissaries, I often find myself feeding on local stock. Several times a year I do not bother preserving their lives.”

  “Yeah, and that's why we have a problem.”

  “With that in mind, I am proposing an armistice of sorts.”

  “I'm listening.”

  “I will no longer allow humans to be killed during the feeding process. Where possible, I will use janissaries, but where that is not possible I will ensure I keep my consumption to within tolerable limits for the human.”

  “Just you?”

  “No. It will be myself as well as all of my subjects. However, the strength of my control wanes with distance. I suspect, for example, that the duchess of Darwin may move her lands into someone else's kingdom. She is fond of the hunt.”

  “So, yeah, how do you enforce that? If she can just piss off?”

  “She will not just piss off, as you put it. She will merely defect her lands to another kingdom. This is not uncommon at the edges of territory, and I suspect I may even gain some central territory as there are many in the desert who would prefer a more sustainable arrangement.”

  “So, your guys, how do you stop them from killing people?”

  “They are expected to do what I request of them, though there are of course never any guarantees. If they do not behave appropriately, I can banish them, taking their lands, or even destroy them directly.”

  “So, that all sounds... okay, I guess. What do you want in exchange?”

  “You and your associates will no longer attack me, my issue, or any other vampires in my kingdom.”

  “What if we catch ‘em killing people? Can we kill them then?”

  “No. Provide me with details and I shall take care of them.”

  Jack paused, considering this. “So, what do we do if you back out or the whole peace treaty isn't working?”

  “Well, considering your initial offer was for us to go back to trying to kill each other, I suspect that we would return to that status quo.”

  She nodded slowly. “Okay. We'll give it a try.”
