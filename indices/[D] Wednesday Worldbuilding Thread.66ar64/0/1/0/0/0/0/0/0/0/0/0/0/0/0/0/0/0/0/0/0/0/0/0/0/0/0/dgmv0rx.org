  Nah, the mace was 2005!MW. 2017!MW I think settled on a dragon-spike or a more normal taper like you said.

Okie dokie.

  Supernatural beasties are basically all compatible with each other and with humans (many humans have very thin supernatural blood, which gives them powers like e.g. slightly improved sense of smell). But they have a very low probability of conception.

Extremely remote lucky chance. Fair enough.

The idea that Julius', um, genetic matter includes the necessary data for building his stone half, and his 4D body structure, along with the idea that it's at all in any way compatible with the sirens, raises all /sorts/ of questions about what was considered a legal requirement for building a bodyguard or other servant-beastie in Atlantis. One almost wonders whether the ability to /technically/ breed with humans gave creatures some sort of legal advantage (such as, for example, not counting as pets and thus being legally permitted to enter no-pets-allowed buildings).

  Given the rarity of demon pregnancies I'm not sure how to deal with him. Originally he was conceived as a twin brother
#+end_quote

Twin brother works. Then you've only got one ridiculously-rare conception event happening. (Well - I think that might require identical twins?)

#+begin_quote
  I've toyed with making him a half-human half-siren person (thus Malik's half brother).
#+end_quote

This works too, assuming half-human hybrids are less rare.

#+begin_quote
  In this case, I conceive of supernaturals not considering extra-marital one night stands with humans a problem, or possibly that Kamal is from before the siren met Malik's father.
#+end_quote

Or possibly Julius and his wife have simply discussed this and come to some agreement that they can both live with... a century or so before the story begins, i.e. entirely off-stage. The hatchet's been buried, and so has the human (he died of old age, not of being killed by angry gargoyle).

#+begin_quote
  But no real idea how to incorporate him into the story.
#+end_quote

If he doesn't serve some narrative purpose, then it might be better to leave him out. If he /does/ serve some narrative purpose, then his actions and backstory should serve to enhance that purpose.
