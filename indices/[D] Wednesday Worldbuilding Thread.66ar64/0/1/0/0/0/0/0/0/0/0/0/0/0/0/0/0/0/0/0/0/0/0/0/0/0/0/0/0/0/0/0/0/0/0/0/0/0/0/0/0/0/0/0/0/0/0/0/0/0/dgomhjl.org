Not being a marathoner myself, I'm not really au fait with all of that. If anyone can handle the cutthroat world of over 40 marathoning, Fiona sure can! I wasn't aware that people who do just "okay" in world-class marathons are tested. I didn't even think there was a prize or anything?

Here's some of Fiona and her robotic pupil, Rose. This is /even more rough/ than my rough drabble, so bear that in mind:

  “Thankyou, Rose.” Fiona smiles appreciatively and begins drinking the tea, as is their usual routine. “How have you been this week?”

  “Yes, it's been good, I think.” She pours herself tea, more out of a desire to appear normal than anything else.

  “Handling Mr Richmond's departure okay?” She asks.

  “It was fine. The police were very nice about it.” She offers the plate of scones to Fiona first, ever the polite host. “I said everything you told me to say, how you told me to say it. Your advice was very helpful.”

  She nibbles on a scone, appreciating the talent that this robot has at baking. She wouldn't admit it, but these little tea sessions were always her favourite part of the week. “It was my pleasure.” She pauses. “Did you make the changes in your house that I suggested?”

  She sips her tea. There was no milk in it - the milk tended to be hard on her incredibly limited digestive system. “I purchased toothpaste, a toothbrush, tampons, and skin cream.” She sips more tea, allowing for a polite gap in conversation. All part of her programming. The perfect old fashioned girl.

(I hope you don't mind me pasting all these things in, they seem relevant and I thought you might be interested. Here's Jack, the quintessential vampire slayer - if a quintessential vampire slayer can be a polyamorous lesbian police officer - breaking into the robot's house. The robot has been given a bunch of gifts from William, which have been strewn around the house randomly, as well as is trying to look human)

  After a few moments, she realised that the door wasn't going to be answered. She took her lock pick out of her tool belt and with practised expertise unlocked the apartment. She looked around; it smelled like onion, garlic and tomatoes, but not in a ratio that reminded her of anything she'd ever eaten. There was a large, leopard-spotted cat that sat on one of the almost brand-new couches, looking at the Slayer with only mild interest.

  Jack searched the house, finding a bathroom that had a half-finished box of tampons on the little shelf that was covered with a fine layer of dust, and a surprisingly grungy bar of soap with strawberry blonde hairs caked into it was in the shower, though the shower itself was perfectly dry. It looked for all the world like a human lived there, but at the same time, it didn't. An aura of sterile cleanliness punctuated by odd, careless messes that might have been put there carefully, deliberately. A vampire that was trying to appear human to its visitors? Or was it a vampire who was so old that she was starting to become human, sweating, eating, maybe even menstruating?

  There was no sign of any blood in the house; no small animals that a vampire might feed on. The fridge was precisely stocked,neither overful nor empty, with fresh fruits and vegetables, butter and cheeses, a few fish fillets and chicken breasts. No read meat. Overcompensating?

  A half-finished pint of cookies and cream ice cream was in the freezer. Jack almost considered it.

  She walked into the bedroom, finding a bed that was perfectly made, covered in an expensive-looking silk sheet. It was bordered by a quaint little set of bedside tables with mismatched lamps that must have been purchased from an op shop. One of them had a well-thumbed copy of Wuthering Heights on it, the tasseled end of a bookmark poking out of it.

  At the foot of the bed was a large, dark brown chest that smelled a little bit like one of the essential oils that Gwyn would insist on rubbing into her chest when she got sick. She opened it, only to find it empty, except for an old birdcage.

  A necklace on the dressing table caught her eye; it shone a silver colour, and she wondered why a vampire would own such a thing. Could she be immune to silver, too? She picked it up and examined it. It was light and shiny and seemed very well made; it had what looked like rubies and emeralds studded into it. But it was so light it could not possibly be silver. Part of the facade?

  Still not quite sure what to make of all she had seen, she decided not to press her luck, and headed out.

  On the way out, a piece of flat stone poised on the mantelpiece caught her eye; it had some faint, black figures drawn on it. Beside the figures there was a handprint, a silhouette surrounded by a spray of paint that the artist had blown onto the stone, tens of thousands of years earlier. With a start, she realised that the handprint was about the same size as the vampire's.

  Exactly how old is this fucking thing?

(Rereading the robot document has made me realise how un-Rational a lot of it is. Angela might have to remake it from the ground up to be more appropriate...)
