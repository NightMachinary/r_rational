    (actually, he's probably got the lovecraftian equivalent of extremely long hair or fingernails in 4D space, since 4D objects are so /heavy/)
  #+end_quote

  [[/louder][]] Hold it! Long hair and fingernails get in the way in a fight. Whatever else he is, Julius is a /bodyguard/ - which means a fighter. He's got to keep himself in shape (cut his hair, trim his nails, do regular exercise) - so that he can be ready to protect the Master at any moment against even /difficult/ dangers.

[[/sp][]] Oh yeah... I didn't mean literal fingernails; I more meant, his gelatinous blob "blood factory" "rest of the iceberg" probably has the equivilent of long hair/nails: might just be a series of orgasn that hold a bunch of different elements in reserve, like bones do for calcium.

  An atom? His 3D body could be /entirely disintegrated/ and he'd merely shift over one slice
#+end_quote

Nah, I don't think I like that. Long ago I conceived of him having a "heart stone" that was a big red gem in the centre of his body, and if it's destroyed he dies. I assume it's some vital 4D organ that holds him together. But that's an awful lot similar to vampires. Then again, assuming supernatural creatures have some sort of common origin, it's probably actually pretty good that "destroying the heart" works on two different beings.

It is an interesting idea if we do allow him to survive being bisected. I'd probably rule that he'd end up like a starfish if we did allow that. So now he's pissed off and there's /two/ of him - though the far-from-the-gargoyle-side half is going to die of starvation /very/ quickly with no ability to photosynthesise (probably in a day or two). And all the flesh on the near-the-gargoyle-side is going to die and rot away with no new blood source. It would be pretty cool though.

    The average human eats ~1000kg per year. He's probably eating about 1% of that, or 100kg.
  #+end_quote

  [[/flutterkay][]] 1% of 1000kg is 10kg.

[[/twiembarrassed][]] I knew that....

  Not /really/ surprising, considering that plants get a lot of their matter from sand which is just ground-up rocks. (Maybe Julius occasionally crunches his way through an aluminium pot or a handful of computer chips in order to maintain a balanced diet... /that/ will probably lead to questions if Red stumbles across him doing so).
#+end_quote

I think by the time computer chips are a thing, Red is well and truly used to the craziness of the supernatural world and would just completely accept it.
