  Nothing in anything we write has a narrative purpose;
#+end_quote

Um, I think that we have vastly different ideas of what is meant by 'narrative purpose'.

#+begin_quote
  (okay, and Red finding out that Julias has a son and thus seems to have "free will" rather than being a golem adds to his horror, I suppose)
#+end_quote

This, right here, /is/ a narrative purpose. Malik existing as a character - and the sort of character that Malik is - says something about the character of Julius, and that something is more than sufficient narrative purpose for Malik's existence. I mean, it doesn't /have/ to be some super-deep meaning or anything.

So, saying "Kamal has no narrative purpose" would be equivalent to saying "Kamal never appears on-stage, and no-one ever has any particular reason to mention him or call attention to his existence while on-stage". And if that's true, then he shouldn't be mentioned - even if he exists in the world, he's not part of the story. On the other hand, if there ever /is/ a reason to call attention to his existence, then his story should be tailored to making that reason plausible and reasonable.

#+begin_quote
  the idea of Kamal being half-siren half-human as opposed to half-human half-gargoyle would be interesting development of Malik's character
#+end_quote

And /this/ is a suitable narrative purpose for Kamal's existence. A foil needs no metafictional reason to be there beyond that he is a foil, he justifies his on existence.

#+begin_quote
  Kamal would make a good foil if he was even less full-blooded (i.e. basically a full human) and had made peace with it through fasting and prayer.
#+end_quote

And this is how the narrative purpose defines what Kamal's backstory should be. As long as he's a foil to Malik, he should be a /good/ foil - whatever that entails.

#+begin_quote
  Malik doesn't have any 4D structure or transformation ability. Not sure if that's just a consequence of him being of impure blood or if it says something about the way reproduction works, though.
#+end_quote

I think that says a /lot/ about demon reproduction. It sounds like the DNA Julius passed on is a lot closer to human-normal than Julius himself is. It suggests that there's a spectrum of DNA human-ness that Julius can pass on - mating with another gargoyle, he can have fully 4D gargoyle children at any time, but mating with another demon species, nothing happens unless his DNA contribution is pretty much as close to base-human as it gets - so you end up with mixed-species children sharing some qualities with their parents, but being closer to their parents' human side (because they were both designed to work with pure-human DNA, not exactly with each other's DNA).
