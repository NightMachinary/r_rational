  Having them as a race suffering from androgen insensitivity syndrome makes a whole lot more sense to me. (Which probably means Malik and Kalam have the mild version thereof, at least).
#+end_quote

Yeah, I imagine Malik and Kamal as having "different" phenotypes than one might expect. But I haven't taken too much care in that: I mean after all, it requires me to think way more than I'd like to about genitals, and there's really no way for it to come up in the story (at least, not until Malik proudly tells his boyfriend that he's pregnant... now THAT could be funny)

  Hot chocolate is expensive where you're from.
#+end_quote

Sure is; we've got a high cost of living. A cheap hot chocolate is AU$4. I get almond milk which they charge an extra 50c for. So I've definitely paid $5.50 for a standard cafe hot chocolate, you know, the 450 ml / 16 oz sort of size ("large" here).

Minimum wage for an adult is ~$20 so we've probably got a better purchasing power than the USA. Not sure how it compares with South Africa though.

Just did a cost of living comparison and it looks like [[https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=Australia&country2=South+Africa&city1=Perth&city2=Johannesburg][we have everything more expensive]]. Lists the price of our coffee as $4.50 (45 R) and your coffee as $2.30 (23 R). So yeah, we do have expensive coffees over here! (Though our average net salary is double Johannesburg's, so go figure).

  the Whiptail Lizard might actually work for another all-female race.
#+end_quote

That would probably get very male gaze, very fast (I kid, I kid: but seriously, an all-female race that has to have girl-on-girl action in order to do parthenogenesis? Someone would have a lot of fun with that)

#+begin_quote
  An interesting question, then, is what they call themselves.
#+end_quote

They have all their own languages, so probably some made-up word in their language. Plus, I think demons would not have a word for "non-human sentient beings". They'd have a word for "non-centaur sentient beings" in centaur language or whathaveyou. Probably. They all do live in an integrated society so maybe they'd be more inclusive of other species (or maybe not: perhaps the big demon city we see is a cosmopolitan city like New York, and most people live in more homogenous places). Probably that New York thing.
