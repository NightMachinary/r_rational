  I assume secession is rare, though it must happen. William took New Holland when europeans were living there only a few decades: I imagine he got permission from whoever was in charge of the east at the time, though.
#+end_quote

I wold have thought any vampire would secede if they thought they could get away with it.

  Hmmm, I wonder if a vampire deigns to own Antarctica? Basically the entire crew of the research station would have to be in on it...
#+end_quote

Almost certainly. Six months of the year, you can do whatever you like and not even need to /bother/ about sunlight. Also, there's a few dozen mostly isolated research stations full of food hanging around, and every now and then some researcher just vanishes (sometimes found at the bottom of an unexpected canyon, sometimes never found at all)...

Might be a particularly powerful vampire's holiday home.

#+begin_quote
  In short, such laws are hard to enforce
#+end_quote

That's a point - someone kicking a chicken is hard to catch, but it'll at least catch /systematic/ abuses (like dumping live chickens into a meat grinder). And sure, you won't have lethal injection - but decapitation with a very sharp blade seems reasonable (I don't know if that's actually what's done, though).

#+begin_quote
  the bigger issue is the actual farming practises - the animal's in the slaughterhouse for, say, a week at most whereas the farm is where they spend most of their lives. They're not pretty.
#+end_quote

The exact same animal cruelty law - from the 1960s - covers the farm. Legal penalties are allowed to go as far as either a fine, or imprisonment, or "up to six lashes with a whip". I have no idea what the enforcement is like, though.

#+begin_quote
  And "slaughterhouses /aren't that bad/, here's a law from the 1960s" is not really much of a defense of point 1 ;)
#+end_quote

True... that law would have been made during the Apartheid years, which were known for worse policies than animal cruelty.

#+begin_quote
  I started drinking unsweetened almond milk over cow's milk because it had 1/3 the calories and one's always looking for easy ways to reduce one's caloric intake. I kept with it because it tastes /so much better/. I've occasionally had hot chocolates and stuff with cow's milk and cow's milk has a weird, musty, tangy taste that just doesn't sit right with me anymore.
#+end_quote

...hmmmmm. Well, I do quite like almonds.

  (can you HAVE a headcanon for your own universe?)
#+end_quote

[[/flutterkay][]] Until it's actually down in print, yes, you can.

#+begin_quote
  I also had a headcanon (can you HAVE a headcanon for your own universe?) that vampires could be much, much more effective but they spend so much of their mental real estate on status (their dunbar's number is through the roof!) and remembering all the social rules that they don't have room to do much thinking.
#+end_quote

That works. This can be shown by - if you have a scene from William's point of view where there's another vampire present - having, every time some object is noted in the narration or either vampire takes some action, either a footnote or a parenthesis denoting how it affects their relative status.

#+begin_quote
  Eating for the first time, Clothar struggling at first: I can see it.
#+end_quote

I think there needs to be more mention of Clothar's futile struggling, then - just a sentence about the futility thereof, perhaps.

#+begin_quote
  Maybe "blood soaked into his tunic" was a bit much, though.
#+end_quote

"blood splashed on his tunic", perhaps?

#+begin_quote
  (After googling an image: vampire bat bites look like mini hollywood vampire bites. Ugh.)
#+end_quote

Presumably that's where Hollywood got the idea from.

#+begin_quote
  I mean, vampires could rip the flesh open, but even if we assume that there's a healing factor in there, ripping a big bite out of one's flesh is going to not really work.
#+end_quote

Yeah, it would mean the vampire would be wasting food.

#+begin_quote
  Perhaps vampire incisors are just especially pointy, like a little knife? But it would mean that if you were to bite someone in a non-feeding way (/wink wink/), you'd probably draw blood.
#+end_quote

Is this necessarily a problem? Vampire bites are /supposed/ to draw blood.

#+begin_quote
  Maybe have them just be ever so slightly longer than human canines, and very much sharper.
#+end_quote

This seems reasonable to me.
