  [hunter hiding around humans plan isn't] going to work if the vampire tends to feed within the comfort of his own home, though.
#+end_quote

Unless the hunter decides to get a rent-a-crowd to do something nearby, that the hunter can join in: throw a street party, have a barbecue, stage a street fight with spectators, etc.

  Hmmm... fair enough. But he's not trying to go after blood here, he's trying to expel waste; can he not do this by biting on a blanket and sucking, in an attempt to fool his body's automatic responses?
#+end_quote

Maybe, and it might even work to an extent. But biting into a clean, fresh human would be instant relief.

#+begin_quote
  Can humans (except the grandmother who made Rose) really make false skin good enough to fool a vampire at close range? And correctly predict where he intends to bite?
#+end_quote

I very much doubt it, it was more trying to figure out how you could get a maximum dose of gold into a vampire (probably better option: use a tranquiliser dart at range). I assume a co-operative janissary would tell you the vampire's preferred eating places though.

    Good point. I suppose he doesn't think Jack is actually a threat to him, he knows she has power in the anti-vampire community (her best friend Gwyn is a mage, who is constantly developing her powers: she could be a threat, but she defers to Jack, who is harmless...), and William knows she's got subconscious sympathy to him what with having been a janissary.
  #+end_quote

  Ah... maybe he's not worried about Jack, but he /is/ worried about what Gwyn will do if Jack turns out dead? Especially since Gwyn is not currently right in front of him and thus easily and quickly killable?
#+end_quote

Yeah, and Gwyn lives in a house that not only is impassible without an invitation, but has lots of gnarly wards on it.

#+begin_quote
  In fact, he can start using Jack to provide Gwyn with a few interesting books and notes on types of magic that he wants Gwyn to be able to cast...
#+end_quote

True. He could provide spells that are useful against /other/ things that might bother them as well as spells that are useful /for/ him. I wonder what sorts?

    It is /very hard/ to have the Bad Guy leave The Hero alive though.
  #+end_quote

  There are a few ways to do it; though most don't work for a Bad Guy who's already an unapologetic murderer.
#+end_quote

Yeah, but William is kind of self-hating about the whole thing: he believes by now that humans are sentient, but it's just /so convenient/ to kill them and has no consequences. Basically, the reason that most people today eat meat: they know on some level it'd be better if they didn't, but it's convenient and hedonic to do so, so they do.

#+begin_quote
  But "you're worth more to me alive than dead" is generally a good way, and a mage who is on William's side may just be enough of an asset to make it worth the risk. (Sure, their treaty doesn't put Gwyn on William's side just /yet/, but it gives him a chance to get close enough to do the necessary Diplomacy rolls...)
#+end_quote

And Gwyn really trusts Jack, so it'll be pretty easy to get her, even if Jack is no longer janissary-level charmed...

  Talking of vampire internals, let's think about the bat-form for a minute. Blood pumps around a human body in a fairly complicated way,
#+end_quote

It's not really that complicated; heart provides pressure, and it goes through various arteries until it reaches capillaries where it's disseminated into tissues, and then back into veins and into the heart again. It's just a closed loop. I mean, it's neat, and evolution is amazing to come up with it, but it's not what I'd call "complicated"

#+begin_quote
  but the vampire body is further complicated by having a bat-body joined at the heart. Does the blood do some fancy four-dimensional looping to flow through both bodies in some way?
#+end_quote

I'd assume not, in a vampire: if there's a one atom spur, blood can't go through that. Each would have its own blood supply, though no idea how the bat is able to be able to fly without eating. So, it probably makes sense for the blood to do some 4D looping.

#+begin_quote
  If so, does this mean the bat-form can also drain blood?
#+end_quote

It would do. It could likely bleed more than its weight in blood, ironically enough.
