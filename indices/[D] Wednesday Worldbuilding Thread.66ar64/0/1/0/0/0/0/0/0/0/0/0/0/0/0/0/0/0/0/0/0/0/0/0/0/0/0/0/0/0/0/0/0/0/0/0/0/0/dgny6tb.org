  I think they pretty much have to code for it in the same way as humans do.

Even if we keep it /that/ restricted, humans have all sorts of weird stuff. There's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_insensitivity_syndrome][androgen insensitivity syndrome]] - perhaps sirens have a form of that? AIS essentially means that the body doesn't respond to testosterone, so people with Y chromosomes who have it develop in a typically XX way - and they often look /extremely/ feminine because they don't respond to testosterone. So if we assume X and Y sex chromosomes, an XY siren would develop with female hormones and is likely to even have a female gender identity. XY!Siren would not be able to carry children, but may be able to father children. It would actually... explain a lot about sirens, since they're meant to be supernaturally beautiful and all. (Then again: there are less dramatic examples of AIS where the person develops in a normal masculine way but just has a low sperm count or something).

Then /again/, a siren's bottom half is bird, so if we assume there's bird DNA in there they'd have a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZW_sex-determination_system][ZW sex determinant system]] which is a whole different kettle of fish. In that case, males are homozygous (ZZ) and females are heterozygous (ZW). And the bird half would have the baby-making parts: but if we assume that beasts are just augmented humans, the feathers are probably purely cosmetic.

Oh, and monotremes have a 10 chromosome system just in case you wanted something even more complicated.

So, uh, this is all pretty far above my pay grade. But let me reiterate: weird.

    Here's some interesting examples from nature, though it's more for "relationship styles" than sex/gender type things: [[http://humoncomics.com/archive/animal-lives]]

  [[/fsfascinating][]] Nature is so fascinating...

  I mean, a lot of those are just /weird/, but still. I honestly did not know that about anglerfish. And those whiptail lizards are just /bizarre/.

Yeah, I think I'm going to have to buy the ebook and read the rest. I love those little cartoons and I pay about that much for hot chocolate sometimes.

I personally love the rock-paper-scissors lizards. (Try saying that real quick!). And the hyenas are wicked (I already knew about the hyenas and anglerfish, but I find weird animal reproduction interesting in general).

I might incorporate something from one of those into the reproductive strategy of one of our critters. Will need to discuss that with my coauthor and see what we come up with. Might be a good way to incorporate a new character / creature.

--------------

So, all this talk about supernatural creatures, beasts, critters: should there be a word for them? Angela calls them demons (trying out using the name Angela to refer to me and my coauthor in the third person: not sure how I like it), but that has a particular connotation of malevolence when most of them are neutral on the subject of humans.

Some alternatives, maybe:

- Demons
- Beasts
- Creatures
- Monsters
- Fiends
- Behemoths
- Shedim (hebrew for demons/spirits)
- Jinn (from islamic texts: just generally means spirit/demon rather than genies specifically)
- Asura (Hinduism?)
- Yokai (japanese) / Yoagui (chinese)

Other options suggested by thesaurus.com include things like imp, goblin, titan and the like but those are too "specific" rather than just calling to mind the general idea of beasts.

Fiends is probably the best, but I like Shedim - hebrew has a certain charm to use for such animals, after all...
