Heh. Do you know any serious over-40 runners? I've met a few and, well... let's just say that the top ones can be pretty competitive within their agegroup. (Especially since they're generally each running against the same two or three other people all the time).

  but when she goes to big events, she's just in the pack. (If you'll excuse the pun).

She's qualifying for and competing in international events. This brings her into blood-testing territory (even if she just gets 'okay' results there).

  Not at all. When they're in wolf form it's ordinary wolf blood (I think the wolves are slightly bigger than a normal wolf though, so genetic analysis of a sample of wolf blood could be telling).

"Just download file V-H-Disguise-1.txt, it contains a list of rules to follow. If you want to pretend to be a werewolf acting as a human, then you'll need file W-H-Disguise-1.txt... of course, you'll need to parse the rules into a form that you can attach to your personality subroutines and use quickly, it's not usually a good idea to spend ten minutes thinking about it before you act. What format is your decision tree in? I have a few pre-parsed versions in different common formats, if that would be easier for you to integrate..."
