  My boyfriend plays and he's going through some shit at the moment because of some drama. It's... interesting. Usually everyone's good though and there's a good-natured sort of camaraderie. Also an ingress team in another country paid AU$150 to get him onto a particular little holiday island near us (Rottnest, it's called) and I got to tag along, which was pretty nice.

Sounds like they take it pretty seriously, then.

  That's not going to make her look like a real human if a social worker comes by. Then again, neither is having a bunch of apparently good food in her garbage.

Hmmm, fair enough. Simple solution, then; buy around /ten times/ as much food as a human would normally eat, sourced from several different shops, and split the donations between three or four soup kitchens plus giving big meals to nearby homeless people, in wildly inconsistent ratios (so one week Soup Kitchen A gets three times as much as Soup Kitchen B, while the next week B gets one-and-a-half times as much as A, and so on). Anyone trying to investigate food going in minus food going out is going to either miss something or /assume/ that they must have missed something (after all, she appears healthy, so one has to assume she /is/ eating).

And then you don't have good food going into the garbage.

  and maybe pouring milk down the sink to throw the cartons out so her garbage looks normal.

Yeah, that's also sensible.
