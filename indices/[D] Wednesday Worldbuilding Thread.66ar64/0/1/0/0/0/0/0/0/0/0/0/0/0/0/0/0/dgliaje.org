  Regardless, he can use whichever limb it is to "hang" things in other parts of his 4D shape, allowing him to use hammerspace...
#+end_quote

Hmmm. Here's a another thought - 4D backpack. Just holding things with his tail is going to get in the way when he needs to /use/ his tail - a backpack will have more space and be easier to carry. (And the 3D cross-section of the straps will probably just look like a pair of fabric loops around his shoulders - he might be able to get away with calling it a fashion statement).

  Have not read much with him (though I have read mirror image a long time ago). I take it he'd have a realistic butt going on?
#+end_quote

Oh, yeah. Olivaw was designed in order to be able to walk amid humans, observing them and gathering sociological data, without anyone being able to (immediately) tell they have a robot amongst them. This includes the ability to look convincingly human in a public shower or nudist colony. (Mind you, he doesn't excrete through it - if he eats anything, it goes into a bag in his chest - chewed but undigested - and he has to open his chest to empty the bag later).

Unlike Julius, Olivaw can't actually have children.

#+begin_quote
  Either way, anything he eats just gets glommed into his 4D body: probably digested in some ineffable way, used for any raw material he might need for regeneration, etc.
#+end_quote

A reserve of raw material for regeneration makes a lot of sense. Then, no matter how old he gets, he's never going to completely fill up that reserve - even if he eats his way through a few entire planets over the centuries.

#+begin_quote
  If he chooses to breathe, he's probably just breathing out the same air he breathed in. So a scientist would be able to tell something was odd about him by measuring his breath.
#+end_quote

Fair enough. This makes sense.

#+begin_quote
  Nah, sunlight. He spends the daytime in a fully stone form that does some sort of advanced photosynthesis.
#+end_quote

[[/flutterkay][]] ...right. I remember that, now.

[[/sp][]]

#+begin_quote
  He eats regularly, mostly for social reasons.
#+end_quote

[[/twibeam][]] Also means he has a good buffer built up, for regeneration in case of injury!

[[/sp][]]

[[/twiponder][]] ...if he gets really badly injured, he might have to eat some sandstone afterwards - not so much to regenerate from as to rebuild his buffer of raw matter before the /next/ time he gets injured.
