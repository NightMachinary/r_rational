  I think it's on a case-by-case basis, and I'd imagine it's not so much done by exchange as "I want to be the King of Paris. Do you have a problem with that?"
#+end_quote

Yeah, but you still need some rough measure of comparative worth, so that the more powerful vampire can lord his strength over the less powerful one by forcing him into a poor exchange. (In your example, one could tell whether the King of Belgium or William was more powerful by looking at how valuable Tournai is in comparison to New Holland, for example).

And then, if we work in terms of population, one can also get to the concept of a vampire landscape improver, who takes over a large, mostly empty area of land, spends a century or two persuading more people to move in, and then trades up to a larger, emptier piece of land and so on.

#+begin_quote
  Regardless, if it follows that you therefore accept 1, 2, 3, then "it is better" not to eat meat. If you want to start an ethical meat company (which I'm not convinced will be economically viable due to the space required), then "it is better" not to eat meat until the first ethically-raised animal reaches a decent chunk of its natural life span and ethically slaughtered. And once that's all set up, "it is better" to forego meat from all other sources until you are convinced there's a quality assurance process that meets ethical standards.
#+end_quote

That's reasonable. Incidentally, I've now gone and looked up South African food safety laws; it turns out that any meat offered for sale must come from a licensed abattoir, which requires a whole list of rules (mostly around ensuring that the meat is safe for human consumption) including that it must be "handled humanely" in accordance with the Animals Protection Act, 1962; and /that/ in turn includes (amongst other rules) a catch-all rule against causing or omitting any act that results in "any unnecessary suffering" on the part of the animal.

I guess one could raise a quibble over what counts as /necessary/ suffering, but I think that legal framework handles the most egregious problems at least.

(There's another route one can try - pestering the local politician to pass laws legislating against the worst abuses).

Also, having tasted soy milk, I'll admit that I'd rather go without milk than taste it again. (Dunno about the others).

#+begin_quote
  In my experience most people accept tenets 1, 2 and 3 and choose to eat meat anyway and this is relatively uncontroversial; it's why I was using it as an example for vampires feeding on humans. People will then try and justify meat consumption for a host of other reasons, but I think this is mostly cognitive dissonance: you just have to accept the dissonance.
#+end_quote

...yeah, okay, I can see where viewpoint that comes from.

#+begin_quote
  Soybeans are a "complete protein" (which is again, a myth: actually every food has complete proteins in it, just some are in far tinier quantities), and they're an excellent source of lysine. So they are really good /if you have a low calorie plant-based diet./
#+end_quote

I can see how that, plus a bit of broken telephone, led to the impression I had.

#+begin_quote
  I have my old rat cage somewhere. Can I be a science lab???? Hmmm.
#+end_quote

I don't think the page I saw actually bothers to check anything except whether the payment goes through. It's kind of expensive for non-research use, though, and I have no idea whether or not they ship to Australia.

#+begin_quote
  That is almost certainly the case: cognitive dissonance, again. Better you think you are more different from humans than you /actually/ are, so you can live with the fact that you enslave and eat them.
#+end_quote

Yep. Makes sense. Of course, that means that he's getting surprised every generation or so when somehuman manages to outwit him - and, in modern times, with such ready access to information to counter his improved memory, it'll happen more and more often.

#+begin_quote
  *William feeding for the first time*
#+end_quote

Why was there blood soaked into his tunic? I would have thought the vampire bite would have reasonably little spillage (merely on the grounds of minimal wastage) - though I guess it's always possible that William's just a really messy eater.

#+begin_quote
  Aside: Originally I conceived of William having been Clovis I, king of the Franks. I'm wondering if that's too wanky, even though he's a relatively obscure historical figure. So I'm contemplating just having him be a guy from that same time and place who was not the king of France.
#+end_quote

There's enough ancient kings that surely at least /some/ of them are vampires.

#+begin_quote
  Also, standard disclaimer about it being old: I don't think vampire fangs extend during feeding anymore for example. Doesn't really make sense? Or maybe it does?
#+end_quote

You'd have to have some kind of internal mechanism that pushes them down and pulls them up - a bunch of new muscles just under the nose. It would make and vampire's face look rather funny, I think - making them easy to spot for those in the know.
