  Especially since an ancient but powerful vampire /should/ be someone that William has at least /heard/ about over the last few centuries or so...
#+end_quote

Yeah. I've made an unspecified vampire catastrophe canon which is why the vampire population is stratified (between waaaay older than 500 years and younger than 500 years). So I'd imagine the <1000 (maybe even <200) vampires who survived the Catastrophe would be well known to each other, if not people-who-were-allies-in-1600.

Then again, it's probably not /unheard of/ for an old vampire to pop back up after living underground (perhaps literally) since before the catastrophe, and it's even less unheard of for an old vampire to vanish for a few decades or centuries and then come back with a new hairstyle, so William could be assuming Rose is one of those.

  ...she can be repaired, right? In fact, if her inventor is sensible, her 'brain' should be well-protected in her torso, right next to her battery. (And if /she/ is sensible, this is the perfect opportunity to play dead)
#+end_quote

Yep, that's pretty much what happened.

NINJA EDIT: No, wait. She played dead for a while, then (SPOILERS FOR VOLUME THREE OF MY BOOK???) William attacked her to save Red, he got overpowered, and then her torso got up and fought off the attacker who turned into a bat and ran away: everyone wins.

  That's only sensible, yes. Your normal human, in day-to-day life, doesn't generally expect that, though.
#+end_quote

Yeah, sorry, should have been more clear. Meant "why don't vampires wear ridiculous plate armour when they're expecting battle" rather than "why don't vampires look like they're at the ren faire?"

  She /could/ always try taking a new scan, but that leads to the thorny ethical question of what to do with the first scan.
#+end_quote

Ah, but she's not allowed access to the grandkids anymore: on account of her being the sort of mad scientist who tries to make robot copies of family members. (Only, I guess nobody knows she can do that: but she's weird and Doesn't Seem Safe, so you know...)
