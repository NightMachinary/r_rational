  4D backpack.

Sounds logical. He wouldn't even need to attach it to his 3D-visible forms. His lovecraftian horror "iceberg of flesh" would have somewhere to attach such a thing.

#+begin_quote
  A reserve of raw material for regeneration makes a lot of sense. Then, no matter how old he gets, he's never going to completely fill up that reserve - even if he eats his way through a few entire planets over the centuries.
#+end_quote

Yeah. I imagine the physics of the 4D shapes is loose enough that the extra mass isn't an issue (actually, he's probably got the lovecraftian equivalent of extremely long hair or fingernails in 4D space, since 4D objects are /so heavy/)

    Nah, sunlight. He spends the daytime in a fully stone form that does some sort of advanced photosynthesis.

  [[/flutterkay][]] ...right. I remember that, now.

    He eats regularly, mostly for social reasons.
  #+end_quote

  [[/twibeam][]] Also means he has a good buffer built up, for regeneration in case of injury!

  [[/sp][]]

  [[/twiponder][]] ...if he gets really badly injured, he might have to eat some sandstone afterwards - not so much to regenerate from as to rebuild his buffer of raw matter before the /next/ time he gets injured.

This is probably true, and though I'd imagine given he lives a pretty safe life, over the centuries he's probably got such an unimaginable excess of matter that it would take one of those [[https://what-if.xkcd.com/34/]["if he was reduced to an atom in size once an hour for ten thousand years, he'd use 1% of his mass"]] type of koans.

Just going to do order of magnitude on the amount he eats: The average human eats ~1000kg per year. He's probably eating about 1% of that, or 100kg. His human form weighs something like 250kg, so he can regenerate that with 2.5 years of food. I think his gargoyle form weighs 2.5 tons so he'd need 25 years of food to regenerate the whole thing. He doesn't live nearly that dangerously I don't think. I mean, if he had a master who liked using him for target practise he probably wouild need to eat more.

I looked into what sort of elements are in food as opposed to sandstone and they were surprisingly similar. Aluminium and Silicon would be the main differences. There's lots of potassium, sodium and oxygen. He'd have a /ton/ of carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen excess if he ate a lot of food as opposed to rocks, though. Heck, maybe he poops diamonds? (Nah, he'd store the carbon to regenerate the organic portions of his body).
