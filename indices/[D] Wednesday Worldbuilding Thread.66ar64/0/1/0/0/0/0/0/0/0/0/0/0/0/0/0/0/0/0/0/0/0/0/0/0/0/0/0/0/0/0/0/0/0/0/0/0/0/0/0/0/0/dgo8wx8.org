  Huh, that really puts our internet costs in perspective.
#+end_quote

Yeah. Our internet is famously slow though. Wikipedia lists Australia as having an average speed of 7.8 Mb/s and South Africa as.... 3.7 Mb/s. Oh dear. I thought /we/ had it tough.

  But yeah, double cost and double salary pretty much cancel each other out, until someone goes on holiday and has to pay the other country's prices for a while.
#+end_quote

It's making me want to go to South Africa though! Look how cheap everything is!!!

  you provide a good reason for why it might be part of Siren culture in the backstory. This also means that the other Sirens might think Julius' wife is just a little bit /odd/, leading to a slight degree of social ostracisation...
#+end_quote

Yeah, I can see that - Mrs Julias (she has a name, I just can't be bothered looking it up) was probably an odd duck getting married and all that. Damnit, now I'm going to have to write a short story about their life, love, and courtship. I'm already beginning to conceive of how her society was growing up.

    Plus, I think demons would not have a word for "non-human sentient beings". They'd have a word for "non-centaur sentient beings" in centaur language or whathaveyou. Probably.
  #+end_quote

  Hmmmm. Maybe their collective noun for all their species is their word for "The Beings" (a category that technically includes humans, but humans seem to keep assuming that they're somehow better than everyone else).
#+end_quote

Ha, I like that.

Really though I think the only human in my setting who really has cause to get into the details is Fiona, because she's a lawyer who specialises in getting supernatural creatures through the Earth legal system in advantageous ways. So she'd interact with quite a few of them. She'd call them "non-human creatures" or something similarly bland.

I'm wondering how and when the penny drops for Red that it's not just vampires and gargoyles but dozens and dozens of things besides. Probably almost immediately.

Then again, Vampires don't go to the Demon Metropolis. I think I'm settling on a reason for that: there's some sort of vampire god who is unimaginably older than all the others, and he lives in the metropolis, and if a vampire dares set foot there they're /dead/. Possibly the same vampire who was responsible for the population bottleneck that happened c. 1600 and reduced the vampires to a population of ~500-1000.
