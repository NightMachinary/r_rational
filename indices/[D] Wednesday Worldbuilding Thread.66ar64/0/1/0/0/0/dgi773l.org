  is there any reason - besides that the human vampires think it's squicky - why one can't have vampire horses?

If I cling to DNA, perhaps it's a DNA thing: you'd need a vampire with horse DNA to seed it. Vampire transmission is what the previously human digestive tract is co-opted for: to make a new vampire, you vomit up Special Vampire Goo^{TM} into the new vampire's heart. That goo somehow is the seed material to create the new vampire. So you could say that that goo is for humans only, and you'd need to start a line of horse vampires with the appropriate magic skills to have something that makes sense.

  the regrown heads have different faces but share the exact same brain... which is already templated in the magic, and doesn't need to be snapshotted

This was something else that came up - because vampires are 4D, perhaps the "vampire brain" is in the forth dimension and that has all the "RAWR KILL" stuff going on and ends up fully in control. The problem with THAT is that if you do that, it gets complicated because would cutting the human head off really work that way if they're 4D, you know? Like, 99.99% of the mass of that brain is in the 4th dimension, so losing the tiny slice on /this/ dimension should be meaningless.
