This came up in earlier discussions with MagicWeasel - it's how they turn into bats. One end of the four-dimensional vampire is human-shaped, the other end is bat-shaped; sliding back and forth along an axis at right angles to reality allows them to appear to suddenly shrink down to bat size or grow to human size without actually creating/destroying matter.
