It's how transformation works; lets you change in mass quite easily.

So vampires are essentially a "cone" that has a vampire on one end, and a bat on the other.

Unfortunately, my husband (who is a mathematician with a special interest in higher dimensional shapes) did the maths and even if the 4th dimension is only 1mm thick, their total form weighs as much as the earth or something.

That said, given vampires, werewolves aren't born in 4D, it's pretty easy to conceive that they have a very odd shape. Perhaps a tiny "spur" from their heart from which a whole second body comes, so they would perhaps flicker a tiny bit as they left their first body and their second (identical) body appeared, and then got smaller and turned into a bat. Could mean earth!body is vulnerable to beheading.

Vampires can't control their transformation, just will it to start (since they're not 4D natives: werewolves don't even get to will it to start). So there's no chance of a vampire wearing "morph armour" by having their transformation stop at the full-size double body.
