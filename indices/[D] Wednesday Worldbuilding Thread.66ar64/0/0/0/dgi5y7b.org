  Where does the structure and layout of cells in a dismembered arm get backed up?
#+end_quote

I had that based on DNA. The question that naturally arises is that how does the heart know what DNA to use - after all, different cells in the body have different DNA, what if the heart's magic happens to lock onto a tumor cell, etc.

Way around that: turning someone into a vampire often fails, so the vampires who "rise" are the ones where the DNA "snapshot" was taken of a cell with appropriate DNA features.

Using DNA as the explanation for regeneration does mean that #1 is harder to justify as saving the memories would require a snapshot of the actual physical brain structure at time of death rather than just DNA.
