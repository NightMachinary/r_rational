  where does the brain get "backed up"?
#+end_quote

Where does the structure and layout of cells in a dismembered arm get backed up?

Here's an idea for vampiric regeneration which should work for allowing zombies.

- The vampiric regeneration works at different speeds depending on how damaged the vampire is. The more damaged the vampire the faster it works.

- The vampiric regeneration only works on one part of the body at a time.

- The vampiric regeneration automatically prioritizes where to apply regen on the body based on the type,severity and area of the injury. Brain damage has extremely low priority.

The above means that you can easily have vampires with partially assembled brains walking around as zombies. They could heal eventually but it will take time, particularly if they keep getting minor injuries that stop their brain from healing.
