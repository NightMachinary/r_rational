  What if hunters are also supernatural (in some yet to be determined way), and will be dragged away to secret blacksite labs just as quickly as the monsters? Would that put hunters and monsters on some kind of equal "lets keep this quiet" footing?
#+end_quote

You just need one noble, self-sacrificing thou-shalt-not-pass type Hunter to go strolling into a suitable black-site lab and say "Hey, guys, the supernatural exists. Want proof? Watch this!"

Monsters get wiped out. Sure, so does the self-sacrificing Hunter, but if you're willing to pay that price, then...

  Or maybe the Hunters /have/ been trying for a long time to convince authorities, but are seen as crackpots and conspiracy theorists (but why? a few samples to some labs around the world should be enough...).

Now, this could work. All the Monsters need to do is keep an eye on the labs, so they know who to hypnotise/memory-wipe/kill and have a shapeshifter impersonate. Or maybe /some/ labs are being run by Vampires or Werewolves and the characters just don't know /which/ labs are safe.

  Re: Option 2: this is in line with the direction I was leaning towards, except I was thinking complete victory is not possible, and vampires have settled for a puppet master type of control to hide their existence. Vampires are so few in number that if the general public were aware of them and took action then the vampires would lose; numbers, need for blood, operate in daylight and all that.

Why would complete victory not be possible? Let's really stack the deck against your heroes; they are /not/ on an equal footing, they /are/ the underdog, maybe even their mentor (and the guy in whose mansion they can safely meet) is really one of the Monsters looking to arm a few humans just so he can have a bit of a thrill hunting them down (gotta do /something/ for a bit of excitement once your side has won, and boy is that adrenalin rush addictive).

  This is tricky stuff, thanks a lot for helping out!

No problem! Glad to help.
