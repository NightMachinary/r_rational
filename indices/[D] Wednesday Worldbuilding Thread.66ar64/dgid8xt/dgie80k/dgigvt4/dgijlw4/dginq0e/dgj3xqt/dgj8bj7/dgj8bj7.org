Great feedback, this type of brainstorming is a great way to shake loose ideas and get fresh viewpoints!

  You just need one noble, self-sacrificing thou-shalt-not-pass type Hunter to go strolling into a suitable black-site lab and say "Hey, guys, the supernatural exists. Want proof? Watch this!"

  Monsters get wiped out. Sure, so does the self-sacrificing Hunter, but if you're willing to pay that price, then...

I was more thinking if the hunters reveal themselves, its not just the end of that singular hunter, but it becomes Humans vs Hunters as governments scramble to "eliminate the supernatural threat to national security" (and possibly start the supernatural cold war arms race). And /then/ the monsters win, with no hunters to threaten them.

  Why would complete victory not be possible? Let's really stack the deck against your heroes; they are not on an equal footing, they are the underdog, maybe even their mentor (and the guy in whose mansion they can safely meet) is really one of the Monsters looking to arm a few humans just so he can have a bit of a thrill hunting them down (gotta do something for a bit of excitement once your side has won, and boy is that adrenalin rush addictive).

I think of complete victory as open, brazen rule by monsters with a subjugated humanity reduced to slaves, pets, entertainment and food.

I still need/want them to wish to maintain secrecy. I do not aim for a "everyone knows magic is real" type of urban fantasy, more the World of Darkness/Constantine/Supernatural type where there is a secret war going on that most people don't know about or notice most of the time.

So I need all parties to sort of want to keep the general public out of the loop, either by controlling/squashing information through control of government and media, by making it look like mundane events/deaths or by simply not making any big waves (or a combination).

A bonus of having factions policing their own is that I can include (for example) vampiric tribunals and other political shenanigans.

The trick is to make it plausible.
