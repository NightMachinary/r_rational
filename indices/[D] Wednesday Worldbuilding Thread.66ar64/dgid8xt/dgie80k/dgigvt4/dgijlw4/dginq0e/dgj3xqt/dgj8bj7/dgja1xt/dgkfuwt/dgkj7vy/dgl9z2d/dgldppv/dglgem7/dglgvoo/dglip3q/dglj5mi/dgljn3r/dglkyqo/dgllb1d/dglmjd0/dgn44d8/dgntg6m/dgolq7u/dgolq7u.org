That would be quite neat. And then, also inside the library, could be the Librarian - a senior former Hunter whose door was destroyed and, since he can now never leave, he maintains the place instead. (Other hunters have to bring him food). Can point characters to specific books and/or offer advice based on his extensive experience as needed (and/or destroy any Monsters who find their way into the Library).
