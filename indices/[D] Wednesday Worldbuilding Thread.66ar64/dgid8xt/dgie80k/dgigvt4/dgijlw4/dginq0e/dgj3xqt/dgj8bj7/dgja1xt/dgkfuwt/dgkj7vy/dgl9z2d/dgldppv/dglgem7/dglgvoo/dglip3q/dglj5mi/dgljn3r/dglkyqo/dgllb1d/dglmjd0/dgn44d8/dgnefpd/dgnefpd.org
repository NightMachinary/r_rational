  The neighbours will be told to "stay inside and away from windows citizen, police are conducting an anti-terrorism raid" or some other excuse the government can use to do whatever they want with a building.

Thus warning the neighbour in advance, and risking that the neighbours might warn the Hunters in any of a variety of ways. (The presence of neighbours doesn't prevent them from flattening the building. It merely restricts how this can be done).

  The hidden room has a similar problem. If an FBI agent, gps tracker, mobile phone tracker or surveillance camera tracks multiple suspected hunters visiting the building repeatedly, the government can lock it down in all manner of ways. Even if they don't get into the room they can deny it to hunters by cordoning off the building or rigging it with hidden cameras and explosives for the next time the hunters visit.

Hmmm... to counter this, what if there were /multiple/ hidden rooms, and more could be constructed (at an extremely large cost in both time and materials, basically needing to be built into the house at the time of construction) at any point. And each hidden room contains a means of magical teleportation, which can /only/ work between hidden rooms; so, if building A is cordoned off, the Hunters can go to the hidden room in building B, and then from there teleport to the Building A room. (And, if they really want, they can then step out of that room and stroll around in Building A inside the cordon, though for obvious reasons this is probably a very bad idea).

  I would also like to (but may have to abandon) books that are special (think of the Necronomicon, it's just not the same to have a digital copy).

If this were to exist, then junior or possibly-compromised Hunters wouldn't get close to it. Only senior Hunters would know of it, and of those, only two or three at a time would know the location of any particular volume - and they certainly wouldn't be kept in the same place as each other (it's a lot easier to hide one book than to hide a library). Ancient daggers would probably each be carried on the person of a senior Hunter, who would thus avoid metal detectors if he could ("but officer, it's just a letter opener!") This would imply that magic-weapon-carrying Hunters wouldn't use commercial aeroplanes (though some might have small private planes and their own licenses)
