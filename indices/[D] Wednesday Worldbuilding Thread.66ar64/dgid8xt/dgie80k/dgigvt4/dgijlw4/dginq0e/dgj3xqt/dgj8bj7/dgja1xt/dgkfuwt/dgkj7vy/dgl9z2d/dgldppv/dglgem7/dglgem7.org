Good points all around. This has been very helpful!

  You could even take this a step further, if you want, and suggest that all mental illness is demonic in origin - that the entire phrase "mental illness" is really their cover story.

I like the idea, but in the kind of story I'm thinking of it would make it too common if all mental illnesses were demonic in nature. I prefer it to be fewer but more intense happenings (like full blown possessions). Also, the best lies have a grain of truth in them. Hmm... Perhaps some mental illnesses could be related to above normal /perception/ of the demonic/supernatural rather than direct interaction.

Definitely can see things like paranoia, hearing voices, etc falling into this category. But how to explain eating disorders, self-harm, narcissism, etc? I think a mix is best, we humans sometimes just break. When demons put pressure on us, we sometimes break in similar ways (mental fault lines). I am not going with "tempt into sin" demons, more like entities that interact with humans for their own personal gain.

  What, no werewolves?

Well, they always had this nature/wild vibe for me, and I don't see why nature loving creatures would hang out where there's mostly asphalt, concrete, plastics, processed food, car fumes, noise etc.

I'm thinking vampires are the most common with a good margin, demons and skilled humans second and then a small number of rare/unique individuals like mages, seers, immortals and so on. Maybe there could be a singular werewolf as a unique character that for some reason has chosen to live in the city (perhaps guiding new werewolves out of the city, or some personal ageda).

And definitely no faeries. Not my cup of tea.
