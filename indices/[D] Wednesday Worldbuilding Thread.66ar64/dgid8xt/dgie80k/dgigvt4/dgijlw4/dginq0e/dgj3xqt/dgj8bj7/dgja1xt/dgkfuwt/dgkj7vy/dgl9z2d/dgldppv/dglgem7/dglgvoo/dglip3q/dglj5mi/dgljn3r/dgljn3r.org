  There's one more question that needs to be answered first. What's their motivation for monster-hunting?
#+end_quote

A mix of the points you bring up. The main organization of the story are in it to protect innocents by eliminating monsters. It is quite xenophobic in that (being of religious origin) all monsters are bad, period.

Individuals in the organization have their own personal level of xenophobia, and differ in which means justify the ends. One part of the story will be how it and its members react to a non-typical vampire.

There are other monster hunters, and monster hunter groups, that for some reason or other does not fit in with the organization.

  Easiest way to do this is to have one guy who's rich. [...] Another option is to have the ancient books and strange artifacts be in a hidden room - say, the basement of the local museum.

My problem with this and similar fixed locations is that it seems so very likely that the hunters movements are tracked to this location at some point (cell phones, sattellite imagery, camera drones, manual surveillance, "enhanced" interrogation, etc) and then the collection of knowledge and resources is just a SWAT team away from being lost.

I would love to have an old building with a secret basement, like the museum you suggest or any old stone building really. I just can't get past the flaws. If I put myself in the mind of the bad guys there are too many ways to find and destroy it.

I need something that is safe against a rational and intelligent opponent with plenty of resources.

I keep coming up with boring solutions like decentralized and compartmentalized monster hunting cells using dark-net chat rooms and monster-hunting wikis. I want a little more focus on "fantasy" in urban fantasy, but it has to be plausible.
