Hmmmm.

As far as protecting innocents goes, let's say John Smith is a vampire. The Monster Hunter's cover story (so far as surveillance organisations are concerned) might be that John Smith is a serial killer, and /these/ disappeared people are among his victims, and no, Officer, I don't know why their bodies turned up without so much as a drop of blood, and yes, maybe I /should/ have gone to the police but he'd kidnapped me and - well, I guess I got lucky... no, I /don't/ know where he vanished to...

But it's not just the cover story after the fact that's important. It's also all about what happens /before/ the fact - how they track down and attack Monsters without attracting attention. And the thing is... decentralised hunting cells with dark-net chat rooms are a good idea for that. Because they /work/. The library of ancient tomes, the room of curious devices... those are impressive. They look good. But they have flaws - like existing in a single location - that an intelligent opponent can use, as you point out.

But they /are/ impressive. So how about this idea - most of the actual monster hunting is done electronically (specialised cellphone app using PGP-encrypted data for communication?) But one of the guys in the local group has the ancient tomes, he has the curiosities in plexiglass cases, and (very importantly) everything he has is /mobile/. So, when there's a newbie that he wants to impress, he puts it all in his van, drives to a handy building with a basement, bring the newbie in to look around, then packs it up afterwards and leaves - by the time the SWAT team arrives, there's just an empty basement and no proof of anything (same thing if the protagonist tries to sneak into the library on his own)

--------------

Alternatively, the monster-hunters have a /little/ bit of magic of their own. Not much, just a bit of space-twisting that allows two rooms to occupy the same physical space - turn the doorknob to the /right/, you have the boring, mundane room, but if you turn the knob to the /left/, you have the Ancient Library. So, anyone who visits without knowing the secret never finds anything incriminating (though, if Tom the Hunter is in the library and foolishly carrying his cell phone, they might have a bit of fun trying to track its signal and never, ever quite finding the thing even when their equipment says the signal's coming from /right in front of you/).
