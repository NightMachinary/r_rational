  Still, to access it there needs to be contact between a potentially compromised (under surveillance) hunter and the library. And then the adversary can follow the vehicle or at least flag the make and model as one to look for.

Yeah, and that is a problem. But... as soon as it drives off, the potentially compromised Hunter is no longer arranged. They just have to lose any followers, either change the plates or move the Container onto a new truck...

It's a fair bit of work, but it's not /impossible/ to hide, at least temporarily. And, sure, every now and then a vampire will be able to track down the truck. In which case, well, did you know what a mist of vaporised garlic does to a vampire? (Neither do I.) And if even /that/ fails to work...

...well, you didn't think there was only /one/ copy of those books, did you?

  The self disguising room is not really a solution, if enough hunters go in and out of a building, I'd bomb it or at least pump it full with knockout gas and tear it down brick by brick.
#+end_quote

Hmmmmm. Kind of tricky if the building is in the middle of town - the neighbours might notice something, there's an automatic alarm system - but destruction is perhaps the most possible here. Again, it would need to be filled only with books of which they have other copies.

  Or a magic that hides them, but that would be too easy if they could be invisible from monsters.
#+end_quote

I think the best option here is magic that hides a (carefully prepared) /room/. Any Monsters in the room can see any Hunters in the room just fine - the trick is that they can't see the room if they don't know the secret. And the secret is something trivial - like lighting a specific candle before entering the room, or pushing on a certain brick, or just turning the doorknob the wrong way - that can be easily replicated if a Hunter is silly enough to let himself be observed opening the door (so the Monsters can still pull off their ambush if they put in the prep work).
