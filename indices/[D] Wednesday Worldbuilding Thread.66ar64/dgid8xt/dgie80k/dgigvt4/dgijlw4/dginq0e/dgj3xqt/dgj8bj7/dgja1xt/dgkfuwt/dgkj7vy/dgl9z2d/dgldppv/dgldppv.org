Pool of blood is good. Then your Hunters have to be careful to avoid being pulled in for murder ("we didn't find a body, Your Honour, but no-one can lose /that/ much blood and live, and the accused were the last to see him alive").

  And demons look like mental illness.

You could even take this a step further, if you want, and suggest that all mental illness is demonic in origin - that the entire phrase "mental illness" is really their cover story. (Maybe even that this used to be generally known...)

  Not sure I'm going to have shapeshifters but they could revert to human form when they die.

  They might even have "troll squads" that output a lot of conspiracies, photshops, etc just to cement the idea of supernatural = tinfoil loonies.
#+end_quote

That's only sensible. If there's some monster that can control people (vampire hypnosis or similar) they might even go so far as to find some poor schmuck, mind-control him into providing a suitable conspiracy, and then mind-control him into turning into a murderous lunatic - just to reinforce the whole "supernatural = /dangerous/ lunatic" idea.

Go to the labs, and any decent lab with proof will write a paper and publish it in some relevant journal. But half the relevant journals are owned by Monsters, so the paper never sees the light of day and the lab has an 'accident'...
