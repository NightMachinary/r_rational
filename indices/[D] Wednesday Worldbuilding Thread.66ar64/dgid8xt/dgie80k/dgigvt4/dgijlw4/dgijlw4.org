  Hunters need to be secret because monster are.

This is a horrible in-story reason.

If having the monsters revealed to the world will result in them being hunted down and killed, then the Hunters should be deliberately /trying/ to reveal the monsters to the world; because successfully revealing the monsters to the world means that they win.

Plus, then the monster hunters can walk around with weaponry without too much trouble from the acronym agencies (in fact, said acronym agencies would be helping them to find and track monsters).

--------------

Alright, so here's a few options to consider that look more sensible to me:

Option 1: Revealing the existence of monsters won't result in the monsters being wiped out. In fact, no-one's even sure whether or not it will result in the monsters losing the resulting war. What is known is that the resulting war will most likely lead to the deaths of a substantial (80%+) portion of humanity (so the Hunters don't want to trigger it) and /might/ lead to the Monsters being wiped out but will certainly lead to them being put to significant trouble (so the Monsters have reason to remain hidden).

Option 2: The Monsters have already won. They control, directly or indirectly (vampires can hypnotise, right?) every major state and government body. This includes /all/ the Acronym Agencies. The only reason humanity is still around is because we're useful to them - the vampires, for example, prefer the taste of human blood. The werewolves might prefer to be able to hunt prey that is intelligent enough to make the hunt /interesting/. (In fact, some werewolves might even deliberately set out to /start/ monster-hunting agencies and hire and even arm humans, just so they have reasonably challenging prey).

Another thought which can combine with either of the above: A lot of monsters are only harmed by special weapons or materials, most of which do not look like weapons (e.g. silver for werewolves - throw a handful of silver coins at a werewolf and you'll do more damage than a hundred iron swords). Since the anti-monster weapons are not the sort of weapons that the anti-terrorism agencies are looking for, they tend not to bother... too much.
