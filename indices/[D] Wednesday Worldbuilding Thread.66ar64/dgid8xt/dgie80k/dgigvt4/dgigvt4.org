Thanks!

Hunters need to be secret because monster are.

Also, having large numbers of weapons (modern and medieval, apologies if I made it seem like they were restricted to ancient stuff) and walking around with it raises all kinds of flags, especially in today's age of shootings and terror attacks.

I want the kind of secret war often portrayed in urban fantasy novels, but with a bit more plausibility. I keep thinking, "the acronym agencies would be /all over/ that".

If they can ferret out terrorist cells, how does a group of people that are heavily armed in their day to day work stay secret?
