  (Though, I'd been considering the possibility that separate human colonies that had already found their individual magics might be the origins of things like vampires...) You don't need human colonies for that because magic is infectious.

Humans and others without a magical system have raw chaotic magical fields that are constantly interfering with each other as well as any other magic in the area. Systematic magic is magic that has found a stable self-reinforcing configuration. It passively shapes other magic to be more like itself. This doesn't really work on already stable magic. It does work on raw magic but only if there is a lot of exposure (As in the magic was actively used on them or they are surrounded by people with the same system) or if the magic system is particularly suited to the species to question. (In which case the magic system spreads extremely rapidly from passive interactions betweeen magic fields and works much better for that species than others)

I would say the vampire aliens have a magic system that allows them to control the people they bite and draw power from their vampiric descendants. They go to a backwater world, bite someone, force their magical system on them and then get them to keep biting others.
