Thanks! Some wild ideas here, made me really think.

Like I said to [[/u/CCC_037]] I'd like to stay closer to the noir aspects of urban fantasy, with the primary adversaries being "human". So no confirmed gods, no secret dimensions, no big reveals like Cthulhu was behind it all or it's all VR etc. Monsters are individuals with their own individual agendas.
