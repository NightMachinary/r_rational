So, I had this idea (actually I think it was [[/u/ccc_037]] who had it, so credit where credit's due...) that vampires can become zombies in the right conditions. But after finding out more about brains it's probably not possible. I wonder if it can be rescued?

My vampires are powered by the brain (mind) and heart (magic). They can regrow limbs and whatnot. All good. This is powered by the heart's magic.

Then we realised that there's no reason why a whole head can't grow back if the heart is damaged. So, immediate thought: it's a "blank" brain and it has only the basic vampire instincts (avoid light, seek blood). Basically, a fast zombie! Cool, huh?

Problem: Brains Don't Work That Way. The brain is made by having a lot of connections grow during infancy and then die until only "good" connections are left.

So you've got basically got two choices for the new brain:

1. Copy of the vampire's original brain (say at the time of turning), which would naturally include memories and personalities - bad because then you have young memories with old bodies, and old vampire bodies are very powerful. Bad because death is not necessarily permanent. Bad because where does the brain get "backed up"? Good because you can play with "what is the self" type things. Good because it's interesting and different to stuff I've seen before. Good because the new vampire is still dangerous. Good because the new vampire is probably scared and alone in this new world and might be easily manipulated, which can make for a good story. Good because you can see powerful vampires beheading their subordinates to "reboot" them if they know too much or get too plucky.

2. Infant brain, which cannot even control the muscles in the vampire's body. So you end up with a vampire who can't move, maybe some odd twitching, definitely can't talk. No threat to anyone. Brain can't grow as, while vampires can will their bodies to do things like heat up, grow hair, etc, if the brain doesn't work it can't will itself to grow. Good because it's kind of creepy and you can see a BBEG keeping a "zoo" of his enemies' infantile forms for intimidation (but BBEG can do the exact same thing by staking the vampires from #1). Bad because it's not dangerous at all. Good because the vampire personality is definitely dead.

I really wish there's a way I can make a zombie-like vampire work (just any sort of bloodthirsty monster really). Anyone have any ideas?

Originally I was leaning towards #2 but after writing out #1 it's probably a lot more interesting. I can also see a #1 who is staked for a few centuries slowly going insane from sensory deprivation and maybe acting like a zombie. At one point in the past, it was trendy for vampires to make "doubles" of themselves by cutting out pieces of their own hearts and letting them grow into full human size. So my main vampire has one of these things staked in a coffin in his giant storage room. But if they were #1 I think my main vampire would kill it upon realising it was him, but as he was before, because it would be horrifying to be faced by someone saying to you in the language you spoke as a child "did it work? Am I immortal?" and realising what you've done...
