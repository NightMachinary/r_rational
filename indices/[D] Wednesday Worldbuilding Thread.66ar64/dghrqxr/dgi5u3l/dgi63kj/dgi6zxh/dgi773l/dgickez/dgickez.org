  If I cling to DNA, perhaps it's a DNA thing: you'd need a vampire with horse DNA to seed it.

Okay, so the victim needs to have what the spell classes as 'human DNA' to be turned into a vampire. This allows for some DNA strains to be completely immune, or to have other side-effects ('all descendants of that drooling idiot will be turned into especially stupid vampires!' kind of thing - petty familial grudges lost to the modern day).

Then there's the question of what exactly is classed as 'human DNA'. Would /homo erectus/ count, if you could find one? What about a chimpanzee? You could go with /modern/ humans only, but there has to come a point where humans, through natural genetic change, become different enough to usee different DNA - beyond what the original spellcaster thought of as 'human'. Now, this is an /extremely/ slow process... but it does become important.

Because one possible definition of 'human' is 'sufficiently close to my current host's DNA'. This avoids the problem of humans slowly departing a narrow definition of 'human' to become something new, by allowing vampires to /follow/ that evolutionary change.

And that, if true, would allow a sufficiently dedicated vampire with some genetic cloning equipment and no moral or ethical qualms to create a series of bodies, working from more humanlike to more equine, change the first one, use it to change the next, and so on, and he can change his beloved steed into a vampire as well (this might be done to prevent having to keep buying and training new horses every few decades or so).

  The problem with THAT is that if you do that, it gets complicated because would cutting the human head off really work that way if they're 4D, you know? Like, 99.99% of the mass of that brain is in the 4th dimension, so losing the tiny slice on this dimension should be meaningless.

Oooooh. It gets worse than that. Why would cutting through the vampire's neck remove his head in the first place? After all, 99% of the mass of the neck isn't reachable by your normal three-dimensional weapons. So if you, say, cut off a vampire's arm (or head) then, instead of falling to the ground, it should just stay there in mid-air and re-attach itself. (And then the vampire will be cross with you, not for cutting off his arm, but for ruining the sleeve of his exquisitely tailored suit).

Now, if you have a four-dimensional sword - call it a 'magic sword' if you like - then you can go around cutting off vampire's heads, much to their shock and surprise. Or maybe if you take advantage of their weaknesses, by, say, arranging to shine sunlight on their heads. Or maybe the neck - and head - doesn't extend four-dimensionally and only the torso does (so you can cut off the head but not cut off, say, the kidney).
