  [[/flutterkay][]] /You/ were a teenage girl. I have never been, and never will be, a teenage girl. (I was once a teenager. I liked a good story then, and I still like a good story now - though I'm more interested in the worldbuilding)

[[/raritynews][]] /You/ may never have been a teenage girl, but me and my coauthor both were. She's the one who helps write the stories. She's much better at plots and characterisation than I am, as well as emotive language. I just obsess over world-building and whether things are Rational. But we both like our yaoi-adjacent romance-heavy action stories, so we make a great team if I may be so bold!

So I am not using the royal 'we', I am either using 'we' as in, me and my coauthor (stories we write together will be released under the name Angela Carson, probably - now that releasing my story on Ao3 or similar is on the horizon, I'm debating whether to link to it here under this reddit account (since I probably have a modicum of name recognition on this subreddit after my incessant posts about vampires?) or whether to create an account for "Angela Carson". I don't think my coauthor would be interested in interacting on Reddit so it'd probably be better to use this one, I guess)

And yes, sometimes I am using "we" as in, [[/u/CCC_037]] and [[/u/MagicWeasel]], but I guess you just gotta work that out?

Yep, that's pretty much what I figured. Kind of like how ligers and tigons are very different in size (look it up - I don't have time to go into it but it's very interesting)

I always conceived of some species being single-sex: sirens make sense as female-only, but then again, why wouldn't there be boy sirens who tempted female sailors? Probably makes sense.

  ...I'm assuming this 'gargoyles' was supposed to be 'sirens'?

Yeah. I am bad at communicating. In an earlier post I referred to Malik as being half-human half-gargoyle instead of half-siren half-gargoyle. FFFFFF.
