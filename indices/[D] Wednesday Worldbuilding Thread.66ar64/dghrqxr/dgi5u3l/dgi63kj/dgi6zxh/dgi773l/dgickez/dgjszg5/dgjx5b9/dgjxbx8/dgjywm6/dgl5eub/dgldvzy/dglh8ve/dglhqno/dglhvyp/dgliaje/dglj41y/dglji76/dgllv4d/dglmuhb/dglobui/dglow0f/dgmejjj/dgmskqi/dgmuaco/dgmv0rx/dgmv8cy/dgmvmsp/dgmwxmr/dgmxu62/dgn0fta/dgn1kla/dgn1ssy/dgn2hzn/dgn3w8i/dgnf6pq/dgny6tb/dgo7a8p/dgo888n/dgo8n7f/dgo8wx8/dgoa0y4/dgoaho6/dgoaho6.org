  Yeah, we pay more for slower Internet. There's a long story behind that, which basically summarises to "fixed-line monopoly = bad, bad, /bad/ idea".
#+end_quote

Yeah, our slow internet is for a variety of reasons, two main ones: #1: cables have to go under the ocean; #2: government is terrible at getting faster internet installed, controversy, drama, etc.

Hopefully the dead monopoly will result in better things in your future.

    Really though I think the only human in my setting who really has cause to get into the details is Fiona, because she's a lawyer who specialises in getting supernatural creatures through the Earth legal system in advantageous ways. So she'd interact with quite a few of them. She'd call them "non-human creatures" or something similarly bland.
  #+end_quote

  I can imagine a lawyer being rather insistent on "they're legally people" (if a corporation can be a person, then a half-bird half-human can /certainly/ be a person).
#+end_quote

Very true. She's a werewolf (actually an ex-werewolf, but that's another story), so she comes from a bit of a personal background there.

  Fiona would pretty much have to limit herself to one or two countries, though.
#+end_quote

She only practises in Australia, but she's in demand around the world as a consultant: other lawyers are often mystified why their clients insist on hiring a nameless lawyer from some backwater Australian city to consult with them, but at least she's /easy/ to talk to and direct about what their client wants and the best way to make it happen. Plus she knows enough about the law to actually be able to have an intelligent discussion about the issues.

Oh, and then she proposes these completely /mad/ ideas, and when you present them to the client they eagerly accept. Maybe it's all to do with the mafia, but whatever it is, you make a healthy margin on the amount she charges for her services.

    there's some sort of vampire god who is unimaginably older than all the others, and he lives in the metropolis, and if a vampire dares set foot there they're dead.
  #+end_quote

  That's a very good possibility. (Another possibility is that the environment there is somehow directly vampire-lethal - but the unimaginably ancient vampire is probably a better idea than that)
#+end_quote

Yeah, plus the list of things that are lethal to vampires is tiny. "A bigger, badder vampire" is definitely on that list, too.

Aside: here's a flash I wrote about "a day in the life" of Fiona. Haven is her psychic secretary.

  The photos were incriminating to say the least. The man - in his 50s - was in a rather compromising position with a large she-wolf.

  “Like I was saying, we, uh, made a little home movie.” His face was bright red and dotted with beads of sweat.

  His lawyer nodded, carefully taking notes. Haven was not around to do so; he knew the client would have requested privacy anyway, so he had taken the morning off. Fiona was glad. Her secretary's headaches had been bad lately; he needed an excuse to sleep in.

  “Yeah, so, uh, after she found out that I slept with her sister...” He trailed off nervously.

  “Please continue, Mr Callahan. I am not here to judge.”

  “Yeah, so after she saw the texts, I got home and all my stuff was in a box. That's fine. I deserved that. So I went to my brother's place, slept on the couch, and the next week I got a letter with these print outs. So I gave her what she asked for, she wanted five hundred bucks.”

  “And when was this?” Fiona looked up from her notebook.

  “Oh, um, about three months ago. So yeah, she phoned me a couple of days ago and now she wants a thousand dollars. I'm not an idiot. I know how this ends up. Is there any way to... force her to destroy the footage? I mean, I don't think my ex-wife would ever let me see the kids again if this got out.”

  “Don't worry, Mr Callahan. We should be able to get this sorted out in mediation. These photos will never see the light of day.”
