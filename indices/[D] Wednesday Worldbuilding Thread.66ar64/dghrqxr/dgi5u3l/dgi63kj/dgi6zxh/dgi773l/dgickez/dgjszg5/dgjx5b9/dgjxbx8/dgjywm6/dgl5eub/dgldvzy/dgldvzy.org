  That's something I don't want him doing, to be honest. The idea of Julias having his own hammerspace is pretty bad

How is it narratively different from him having a well-hidden safe in his room? He'd still have to be within reach of his "stash" to actually /use/ it - it's not like he's going to be carrying it around everywhere with him. (He /could/ carry a small bag with him everywhere he goes, but he can do that in 3D space as well - and what would he want to always have close, anyway? His teddybear?)

  maybe he'd /eat/ them to destroy them.

...this is a far better idea than any of the ones I came up with. Shift it, eat it, no more clothes, very impressed Master, no embarrassing questions about digestion.
