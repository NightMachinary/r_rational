  That's going to be tricky as his current territory is bigger than France, Spain and Germany put together. (Note: His territory is actually bigger than the state pictured in the diagram).
#+end_quote

That's a pretty big chunk of land, in terms of square metres. But what is it in terms of population?

#+begin_quote
  Really, what he wants most of all is to be able to taste things again. Which I suppose is something he could set his mage ally to work doing...

  And he naturally wants assured immortality.
#+end_quote

Those seem like reasonable ambitions for a near-immortal vampire.

#+begin_quote
  This is very true: if he becomes popular, people will want to emulate him, like with no-killing truces. And he really does want to be popular.
#+end_quote

Precisely. Plus, Gwyn will have reason to keep him alive as long as this state of affairs continues.

#+begin_quote
  The thing is, he's now a creature that's so far above humans, and has been such for so long, that he's grown kind of detached from them: like, sure, he /feels/ like he was sentient then, but the sentience of a human compared with the sentience of a vampire? Forget about it. They don't think nearly as fast nor as well nor as deeply.
#+end_quote

Oooooh..... this is a dangerous slope to start walking down, because then you'd need to show his thoughts being somehow actually deeper than an average human's. And that is... very, /very/ difficult to get right in fiction.

  Basically, if you accept the following three tenets, it follows that it's better not to eat meat (whether you do or not is another question; cognitive dissonance is real)
#+end_quote

Hmmmm.

As to Tenet 1, I do believe that meat can be produced without causing undue harm to animals. (Yes, the animal needs to die; however, this does not need to be painful, and the animal does not need to be aware of this; so pain need not be caused. Indeed, I do believe that it is to the benefit of all - especially abbattoirs - if the animals are not afraid or fighting and damaging things in their last minutes, so it seems reasonable to assume that reasonable steps are taken to ensure that they remain calm). (I also understand that there is some progress towards lab-grown meat, but that's new enough that it hardly applies).

As to Tenet 2, I will agree that it is avoidable, but I understand that one has to be very careful of one's diet or certain proteins are particularly difficult to obtain. So, number 2 I accept.

As to number three; I accept that all else being equal, it is better to choose a course of action that does less harm over one that does more harm (including harm to animals). However, if for some reason I ever have to face such a choice, I would save one human's life even if it means the death of a hundred baby bunnies.

So, I guess that, in essence, it boils down to that I feel the harm to the animals is slight enough as to not be worth the effort of attempting to figure out the complete intricacies of a meat-free diet. So... I guess I'm mainly objecting to (1).

  The regrowth is pretty slow, I don't think it'd be visible "in real time". An arm takes a whole (week did I say?) to grow back.

Incidentally, on this topic, have you ever heard of the MRL Mouse?
