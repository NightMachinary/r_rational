  I haven't exactly made any sort of "official" ruling, but I'd imagine the Beast of Gevaudan was probably just an ordinary (if particularly vicious) wolf, as it no doubt was in reality.
#+end_quote

That's straightforward.

  Hopefully the intersection of such people and [[/r/rational]] will be larger than I think.
#+end_quote

You never know.

#+begin_quote
  Otherwise, eh, I wrote it and that makes /me/ happy, and that's all you can really ask for.
#+end_quote

That is the most important point, yes.

#+begin_quote
  Geez. That's... pretty metal.
#+end_quote

Got to admit, I got the idea from [[http://sluggy.com/comics/archives/daily/040312][someplace else]]. And yes, it has some severe practical downsides when being fed from feels /that/ good. It might work once - especially if the Hunter has practiced stabbing the vampire as soon as he's incapacitated long enough that he does so automatically without needing to actually decide - but by the time his third or fourth vampire arrives he may well be less interested in killing it and more interested in letting it feed off him.

#+begin_quote
  Or maybe the window of opportunity is longer than you'd think: perhaps vampires are not only weak to gold, but their weakness to gold is far stronger than their weakness to silver is portrayed as in media?
#+end_quote

Well, the thing is, because the gold is /inside/ the vampire, he can't just drop it and let go. And burning through the vampire does not actually consume the gold, so it's going to keep going as long as it's in there. Mind you, there are other ways for the vampire to get rid of the gold, depending on exactly where it goes - if it goes into his new-vampire-goo, then he can get rid of it by vomiting that up (though if he was planning on making a new vampire anytime soon, he can wave those plans goodbye). If it moves through his body, then he could (for example) wait until his right arm is in a lot of pain, then cut off the arm (and, by extension, the gold inside it). If it just eats right through him, he could lie on his stomach and wait for it to eat its way right /out/ of his body, though it will hurt a lot.

So, the vampire would no doubt /survive/ the gold nanoparticles. But it would leave him more than a little distracted, and extremely cautious about feeding from Hunters in the future. (While the Hunter is more than a little distracted by the feeding process. It probably comes down to a matter of just who is /more/ distracted at the time).

  Now I'm wondering if such a technique is how Jack becomes a janissary in the first place. Originally she just gets grabbed by a Bad Guy and eaten from, and then is saved by her mage-ally Gwyn.
#+end_quote

Huh. That's certainly a possibility.

But he'd need to know about the gold weakness before that happens. I'm not quite sure when he finds out about that.

#+begin_quote
  Aaand that is how we get CelestAI, maybe? :|
#+end_quote

Possible, but doubtful - if Grandma's working off brain scans, then she hasn't really solved the problem of AI. It is, however, how we get a few immortal CEOs and rich people, and how we get robots that can balance while they walk, and robots that can look like anyone, a great boon to the spy industry. It'll take a few years for the company to get anything remotely workable from a mad scientist's notes, though.

#+begin_quote
  It's me trying to work out how Jack and William would come to a truce.
#+end_quote

Looks good to me. Jack gets a reduction in killings, William gets personally not killed. It does look like William is offering more than he's receiving, though; despite his words, it seems that he's not sure he'd survive if Jack were really to seriously attempt to kill him.
