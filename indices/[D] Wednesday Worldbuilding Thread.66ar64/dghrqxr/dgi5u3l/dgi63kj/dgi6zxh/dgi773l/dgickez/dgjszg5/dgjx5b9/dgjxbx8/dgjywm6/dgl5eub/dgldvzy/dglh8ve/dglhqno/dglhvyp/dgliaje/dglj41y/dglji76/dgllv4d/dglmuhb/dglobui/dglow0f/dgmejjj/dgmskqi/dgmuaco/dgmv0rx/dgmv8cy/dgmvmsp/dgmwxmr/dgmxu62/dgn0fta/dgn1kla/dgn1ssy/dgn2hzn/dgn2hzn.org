  Which would be a problem - such behaviour comes afoul of reddit's anti-spam rules (that are unofficial, but I believe there's also some variant of them codified on [[/r/rational]]: something along the lines of "you may only post your own content once a week" or similar).

[[/flutterkay][]] Um. I hadn't intended to imply that the official account would post /often/. Maybe one or two official posts every time a new book is released. Which, if you're prolific authors, would mean maybe three posts in any given year.

I don't think that's going to run afoul of anti-spam rules.

  I might make a subreddit - in fact, I'll go do that now. Can't hurt, can it? [[/r/AngelaCarson]] is born!

[[/twibeam][]] This may very well work better than the single official account!

  [on communication]
#+end_quote

One of the Science of the Discworld books, the authors are talking about communication. To paraphrase: "Someone says 'dog' and you imagine a large black labrador with fluffy ears (footnote: It then comes as something of a shock when the animal in question turns out to be a chihuahua)"

  Hmmm, you're right. That said, I think if Malik married a female siren, the child wouldn't be 3/4 siren, it would be half half-siren, half siren, if you get my drift: Malik has lost too much siren for him to be able to father anything that is close enough to a siren.

...that does make it tricky. Perhaps with a modern genetics lab - actually, I think you'd need a slightly-better-than-modern genetics lab (as might be owned by a scientifically inclined vampire) I guess one could take a sample of Siren's DNA and flip the 'gender' bits around and see what you get.

Or maybe a half-siren half-siren is Siren enough to get more Sireny progeny. Or maybe a half-Siren half-human (without gargoyle traits to get in the way) is the place to start...
