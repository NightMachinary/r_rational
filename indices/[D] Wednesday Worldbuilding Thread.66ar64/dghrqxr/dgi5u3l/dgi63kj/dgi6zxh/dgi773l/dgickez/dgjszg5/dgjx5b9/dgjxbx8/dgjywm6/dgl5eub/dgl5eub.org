  See, once you have one vampire horse, it's not hard to get twenty more - the difficulty lies in getting that one.

Very true... hm. There's probably a vampire out there with the patience, though like you said, probably not with the technology to see it through yet.

  Julius can't store a few personal items just outside 3D space for security
#+end_quote

That's something I don't want him doing, to be honest. The idea of Julias having his own hammerspace is pretty bad, though then again, if his masters don't know about it, it probably isn't going to come up. And if he's allowed to keep his clothes between transformations then he /has/ hammerspace whether we like it or not.

  Julius is still holding the clothes (e.g. in his tail) outside of 3D space, and is intending to quietly toss them in the next fire or furnace he finds. Or maybe he intends to make a fire, outside 3D space, burn them there, and scatter the ashes.
#+end_quote

True. Julias definitely has a whole horrific "rest of the iceberg" type form underneath everything, since I've established that his humanoid form has blood but no bones, so the blood has to get made somewhere. He probably has a horrific flesh sac type thing further "above" his human form. And that could quite easily have all manner of limbs and organs that could be used to grab that bundle of clothes. Hell, maybe he'd /eat/ them to destroy them.

#+begin_quote
  Or he deliberately threw the clothes down and 'out', such that they'll be pulled back by Earth's gravity but not otherwise interact with the 3D world until they're either deep in Earth's crust or possibly in the mantle (good luck finding it there).
#+end_quote

Also a very good idea, though I'm not sure if putting them perpendicular to the mantle probably isn't conducive to "destroying" them.

I think I like the idea of him grabbing them out of 3Dspace with his "tail", popping them into a 4D mouth of his, and then they're incorporated into his body.

Then again - canonically he can eat /rocks/, so why didn't he just eat the bundle of clothing? I suppose then he'd have to explain that he doesn't poop and William would not quite trust it, whereas if the bundle just seems to disappear it would make his master feel better about it whilst still being just as good.
