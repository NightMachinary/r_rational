  RE: Horses: So we'll give a dedicated vampire his vampiric menagerie...
#+end_quote

Well, he might not have had time since creating such DNA chimeras became possible to go through the whole centuries-long process.

  they'd be valuable gifts, I suppose???
#+end_quote

Intriguingly, they'd be valuable - but quickly become /less/ valuable if ever gifted. See, once you have /one/ vampire horse, it's not hard to get twenty more - the difficulty lies in getting that one.

But oh, if you have the /only/ one, then it is /extremely/ valuable - because, short of getting one from you, anyone else can only have one with centuries of dedicated effort.

So it might be more valuable as something that he - casually - lets the other vampires know he /has/ without ever letting anyone else get hold of one.

  RE: Consequences of heart-spur plan: Those are all excellent observations. Thanks for that! We'll say that the two hearts are joined, maybe that the heart is the only 4D object. I think that doesn't have any odd consequences - though the 4D thing is so far in the background I don't know if it matters whether it's specific.

Sounds good (but see below).

  I think I'm going to settle on the 4D world being inhospitable to non-4D objects as the easiest way to have the cool little detail and also have Julias be doing the right thing.
#+end_quote

The first trouble with this is that we've just established the vampires as being mostly 3D. There are a few other troubles as well - if Julius is wearing a 3D suit and is forced to change shape for a bit, his human form should still be wearing the suit on return; Julius can't store a few personal items just outside 3D space for security; but the idea that the vampire's human form starts degrading as soon as he is a bat is probably the biggest problem.

One could say that there are /specific/ locations in 4D space that are dangerous to 3D objects, but that just means that there are places where, if William walks past, his bat-body suddenly dies.

An alternative option is that Julius is still holding the clothes (e.g. in his tail) outside of 3D space, and is intending to quietly toss them in the next fire or furnace he finds. Or maybe he intends to make a fire, outside 3D space, burn them there, and scatter the ashes. Or he deliberately /threw/ the clothes down and 'out', such that they'll be pulled back by Earth's gravity but not otherwise interact with the 3D world until they're either deep in Earth's crust or possibly in the mantle (good luck finding it /there/).
