  very comforting to think it's not just "things happen because we want them to happen"

It's more... things that help you to tell the story you want to tell.

  hey, we're... uh, we WERE teenage girls.
#+end_quote

[[/flutterkay][]] /You/ were a teenage girl. I have never been, and never will be, a teenage girl. (I was once a teenager. I liked a good story then, and I still like a good story now - though I'm more interested in the worldbuilding)

  I guess what I'm /trying to say/ is taking into account the completely bizarre supernatural genetics, the "human genome" is the intersection of all beast genomes, and any two beasts that breed will have a child that sports features consistent with the intersection of those two beasts, which would be mostly human.

This is a very sensible rule for fictional breeding. The siren body, after all, knows how to build a child-with-wings body (and knows how to build wings-with-feathers, which for all I know might be entirely encoded from the female end - it might well be that a gargoyle mother and a siren father never produces feathers). And the gargoyle body knows how to send along "this-is-the-colour-of-the-wings" instructions. (It also keeps sending along instructions for the transformation part, which confuses the siren body no end, which is why breeding doesn't /usually/ work between the two biologies - but verrrry occasionally it turns up in a form where the siren body can just ignore that bit)

All /this/ requires is that the DNA for the different demon species speak some common, standardised language (but extend it in different ways), which seems more than plausible, especially if the bioengineers who originally created the demons all used the same basic tools to do so.

  (since gargoyles can't transform at all).

...I'm assuming this 'gargoyles' was supposed to be 'sirens'?
