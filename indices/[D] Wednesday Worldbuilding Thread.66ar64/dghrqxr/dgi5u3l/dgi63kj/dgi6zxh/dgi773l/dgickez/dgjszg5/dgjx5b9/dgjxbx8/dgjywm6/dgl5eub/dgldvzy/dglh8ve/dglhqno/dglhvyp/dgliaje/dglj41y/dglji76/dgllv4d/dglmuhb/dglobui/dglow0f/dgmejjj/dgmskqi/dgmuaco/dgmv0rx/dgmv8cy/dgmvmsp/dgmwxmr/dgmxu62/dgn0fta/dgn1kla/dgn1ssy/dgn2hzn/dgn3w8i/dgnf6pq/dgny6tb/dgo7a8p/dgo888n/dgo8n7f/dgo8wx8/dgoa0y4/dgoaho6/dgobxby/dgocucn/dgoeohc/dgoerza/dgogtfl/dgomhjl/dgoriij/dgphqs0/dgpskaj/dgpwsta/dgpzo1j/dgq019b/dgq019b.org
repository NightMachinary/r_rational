I like that: if she looks like a do-gooder, nobody is going to notice that she is giving away 70 days' worth of food instead of 63, because who looks at those things that closely anyway? All she really needs to do is start a little soup stand in the nearest place that homeless people congregate, she doesn't even need to bother with the business of donating.

After all, humans will think she's generous; vampires will think she's up to something, but not bother putting effort into figuring out exactly what; werewolves don't care about those sorts of things unless there's an immediate danger, and their pack is protected; and anyone else is rare enough that it might not matter.
