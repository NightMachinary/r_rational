  When you mentioned the Heartstone, I assumed that was it - a silicon-based hypercomputer 'brain' would be somewhat stonelike.
#+end_quote

Maybe more of a brainstone, then? That sounds dumb... a /mind/stone. Less dumb. It'll do.

    And that's why it's present in all slices, so that they can all be controlled
  #+end_quote

  Doesn't need to be in a slice to control it. Neither your brain nor your spinal cord are in your feet, but you can still wriggle your toes.
#+end_quote

True, but there's nerves, which is the same sort of dealy.

  ...or, more likely, just wait for him to start recharging, put up some shadenet,
#+end_quote

At which point he'd go into battle form and rip the net apart. You could definitely use that idea to do it, though, but he's got some pretty unique ways to deal with whatever situation he's in: lock him in a small room? He can go human, stick his butt against the door, transform into a gargoyle and then his tail is making a hole in the door which he can probably leverage to break through.

You'd be best off with some sort of gauntlet with his master at the other end, tire him out that way. Then again, he might reason that he's doomed either way and he's not going to be able to help any hypothetical future masters otherwise.

Good thought: is he devoted enough to his masters to die for them? Given Blue and Orange Morality, /probably/?

    Maybe the spinal cord stone will heal given time, though?
  #+end_quote

  He's a good deal more terrifying as a fighter if the whole of him can (eventually) heal from just the Heartstone and a suitable supply of matter (anyone got a spare planet?)
#+end_quote

... maybe his apparent size depends on his total mass. And the reason he's so giant is because he's so heavy. But if you destroy him, he'll come back together but be perhaps only a foot tall? And if he ever eats the moon or whatever, he might be 5% larger?

Probably better to have an iceberg of flesh, just because if he ever accidentally transforms into /that/ it would be gross.

#+begin_quote
  Even more existential angst when the gargoyle side tells the human side that he has to eat him to have enough matter to regenerate his /own/ fleshy side.
#+end_quote

Again not sure if that would be possible - how much regeneration can he do? Can he regenerate all his fleshy organs with just the stone side (like a starfish), or does he need the organs that grow flesh in order to regenerate his flesh? Either way, he'd be eating his other half when appropriate.

#+begin_quote
  [[/twistare][]] Wait - is his son part-gargoyle? Genetically, I mean? Or is he biologically pure human?

  [[/sp][]]
#+end_quote

Half gargoyle, half siren - genetically both and is able to breed with supernatural creatures and with humans. He's also intersex in some non-specified way so is able to both impregnate and be impregnated (though it hasn't exactly come up).

Here's a family picture I drew in 2005: [[http://i.imgur.com/W0jTe6E.png]] - needless to say the mythology has changed over the past 12 years, but the broad strokes are there...

The "father gargoyle" has been redesigned to be Julias who was originally a completely different character, and the son (Malik) has been slightly redesigned too. Malik looks mostly human, and indeed can pass for such with appropriate fashion choices.

His non human features include bat-like ears, wings with glossy brown feathers (not bat wings as in the picture), and he doesn't grow hair but down. The hair on his head are actually made of tiny long tendril-like feathers, similar to what emus have. The son eats garbage and meat (including human flesh that he buys from demon fast food restaurants regularly).

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Not sure if Julias would eat garbage in front of his masters though; he'd know from experience that many find it disturbing and would not want to weird them out, after all...
  #+end_quote

  Well, not /deliberately/. But it's the sort of thing that Red could stumble across while going downstairs unexpectedly for a midnight snack.
#+end_quote

I think it'd be hard to sneak up on a gargoyle what with their x-ray vision and all, but I get your point.
