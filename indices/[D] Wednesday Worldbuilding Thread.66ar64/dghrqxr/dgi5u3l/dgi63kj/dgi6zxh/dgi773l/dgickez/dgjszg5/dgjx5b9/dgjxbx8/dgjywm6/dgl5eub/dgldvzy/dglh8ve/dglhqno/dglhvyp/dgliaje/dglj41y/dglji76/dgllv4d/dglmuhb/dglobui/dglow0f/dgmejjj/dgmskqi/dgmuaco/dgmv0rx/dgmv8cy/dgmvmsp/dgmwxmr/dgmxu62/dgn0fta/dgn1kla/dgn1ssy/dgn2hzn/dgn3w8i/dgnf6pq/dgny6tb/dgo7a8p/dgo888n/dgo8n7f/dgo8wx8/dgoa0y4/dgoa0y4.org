  Yeah. Our internet is famously slow though. Wikipedia lists Australia as having an average speed of 7.8 Mb/s and South Africa as.... 3.7 Mb/s. Oh dear. I thought we had it tough.

Yeah, we pay more for slower Internet. There's a long story behind that, which basically summarises to "fixed-line monopoly = bad, bad, /bad/ idea". (Said fixed-line monopoly is no longer a monopoly, but it's taking a while for that to help).

It /does/ mean that we're one of the few places in the world where mobile internet can compete with fixed-line internet on price.

  It's making me want to go to South Africa though! Look how cheap everything is!!!

We have a great tourism industry! Between this and our plant/animal diversity... (I've heard the statistic that there's more different species of flowers on Table Mountain than there are in England)

  Yeah, I can see that - Mrs Julias (she has a name, I just can't be bothered looking it up) was probably an odd duck getting married and all that. Damnit, now I'm going to have to write a short story about their life, love, and courtship. I'm already beginning to conceive of how her society was growing up.

More inspiration!

  Really though I think the only human in my setting who really has cause to get into the details is Fiona, because she's a lawyer who specialises in getting supernatural creatures through the Earth legal system in advantageous ways. So she'd interact with quite a few of them. She'd call them "non-human creatures" or something similarly bland.
#+end_quote

I can imagine a lawyer being rather insistent on "they're legally people" (if a corporation can be a person, then a half-bird half-human can /certainly/ be a person).

Fiona would pretty much have to limit herself to one or two countries, though. Different countries can have /vastly/ different legal systems and keeping up-to-date on all of them would probably be somewhat impractical. (But she'd have the phone numbers of suitable lawyers in other countries).

  I'm wondering how and when the penny drops for Red that it's not just vampires and gargoyles but dozens and dozens of things besides. Probably almost immediately.
#+end_quote

Probably only after he knows that there are at least /two/ types of beasties.

  Then again, Vampires don't go to the Demon Metropolis. I think I'm settling on a reason for that: there's some sort of vampire god who is unimaginably older than all the others, and he lives in the metropolis, and if a vampire dares set foot there they're dead. Possibly the same vampire who was responsible for the population bottleneck that happened c. 1600 and reduced the vampires to a population of ~500-1000.
#+end_quote

That's a very good possibility. (Another possibility is that the environment there is somehow directly vampire-lethal - but the unimaginably ancient vampire is probably a better idea than that)
