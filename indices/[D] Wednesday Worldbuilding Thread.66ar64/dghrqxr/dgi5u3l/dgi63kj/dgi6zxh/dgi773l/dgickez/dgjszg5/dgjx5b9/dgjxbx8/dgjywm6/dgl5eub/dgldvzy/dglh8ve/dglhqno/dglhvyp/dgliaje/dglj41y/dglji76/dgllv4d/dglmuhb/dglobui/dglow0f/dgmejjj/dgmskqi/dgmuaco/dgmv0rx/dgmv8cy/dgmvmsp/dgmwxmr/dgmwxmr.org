Thanks for the stuff about narrative purpose: very comforting to think it's not just "things happen because we want them to happen", since, you know, we want them to happen because they satisfy our values (even if our values are "cute people making out" - hey, we're... uh, we WERE teenage girls. Quite a long time ago. Let's not think on that...)

Yeah, you've hit the nail on the head - when demons mix, their offspring are basically "humans with a couple of odd features", probably due to, like you are saying, there being some sort of meta-DNA, or the DNA is self-limiting in what it gets (like - bear with me here - imagine if you had a pineapple and a human breed. And you do it by getting the most pineapple-like parts of the human DNA and doing meoisis with them and joining them to the most human-like parts of the pineapple DNA. Since humans share like 50% of their DNA with fruit, this is probably not as completely off the wall as it sounds, though the resulting offspring in this case would be entirely pineapple (probably? actually the pineapple probably has extra stuff, humans are not "pineapple genome plus all the stuff to give us thumbs", so... yeah. It would be weird).

I guess what I'm /trying to say/ is taking into account the completely bizarre supernatural genetics, the "human genome" is the intersection of all beast genomes, and any two beasts that breed will have a child that sports features consistent with the intersection of those two beasts, which would be mostly human.

So Malik being Gargoyle + Siren = wings and feathers (gargoyles don't have feathers but let's not think too hard about it: chickens have the DNA for teeth in their genome after all), but lacking the bird butt that sirens have and the transformation that gargoyles have (since gargoyles can't transform at all).
