  I wold have thought any vampire would secede if they thought they could get away with it.
#+end_quote

Yeah, but the stratified nature of vampire society means that very few would be able to.

    In short, such laws are hard to enforce
  #+end_quote

  /systematic/ abuses (like dumping live chickens into a meat grinder).
#+end_quote

Um, dumping chickens live into a meat grinder is the accepted industry standard for disposing male chicks in egg-laying breeds. So, that's definitely not being prevented...

[[http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/chickens/7645698]]

[[https://www.sapoultry.co.za/pdf-docs/code-practice-chick-hatchery.pdf][South African Poultry association]] says "High speed maceration of chicks using properly designed macerators is a practical and accepted method of euthanasia."

It happens other ways, too, but it's definitely completely accepted. Maybe choose a different example of systemic abuses that would be caught? ;)

  decapitation with a very sharp blade seems reasonable (I don't know if that's actually what's done, though).
#+end_quote

In Australia they do something called "captive bolt stunning" where there's a machine that hits the animal in the side of its head to stun it, and then the throat is cut and blood drains (halal slaughter is even worse as the animal can't be stunned IIRC). Needless to say, depending on a handheld "stunning machine" when the animal is metres away from corpses does not work well in practise. You can google slaughterhouse footage if you feel up to it.

  The exact same animal cruelty law - from the 1960s - covers the farm.
#+end_quote

Yeah, and the more recent "optional higher" standards we have in Australia, that are endorsed by the /Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals/, approve ridiculously overcrowded, disease-ridden poultry barns. I would not have that much faith in that law.

  ...hmmmmm. Well, I do quite like almonds.
#+end_quote

Give it a try! I love the stuff. Yummo. Word to the wise: the more "organic and all natural" the packaging says the product is, the more likely it is to have a gritty or bitter texture. Try sweetened almond milk (which has about as much sugar as cow's milk) first if you can find it since it might be more palatable, but I personally far prefer unsweetened.

Great in cereal too, if you're like me and enjoy nutty museli type things!

#+begin_quote
  having, every time some object is noted in the narration or either vampire takes some action, either a footnote or a parenthesis denoting how it affects their relative status.
#+end_quote

oooooh I LOVE this. There's a few scenes that could qualify, and I've kind of sort of done that a little - but not to the extent you're implying. I'll chuck one of them at the bottom of this post again for you.

#+begin_quote
  I think there needs to be more mention of Clothar's futile struggling, then - just a sentence about the futility thereof, perhaps.
#+end_quote

Probably. If I ever re-use it I'll keep what you said in mind. It's old enough that I'm not fussed about it being realistic.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Maybe have them just be ever so slightly longer than human canines, and very much sharper.
  #+end_quote

  This seems reasonable to me.
#+end_quote

Easy!

*scene that touches on vampire status ?*

The ritual had been strange, as well; Erlis had not chosen one that required the serving of blood, even though that was the most appropriate both for the time of year and for subtly demonstrating superiority by showing that his attendants were superior to Red. And Erlis, of all people, must have known that William had a special attachment to Red what with his frequent requests for updates and the fact he had chosen to visit at all. Another vampire might think William was on his way to Atlanta, or going on a progress of sorts to repair his reputation, but Erlis must have known his true motivation.

And yet Erlis did not attempt to press his advantage. He had chosen for them to do the Dance of Dabbalemi. It was a complex ritual, but one William had been performing since before Erlis had been born. Erlis had clearly been taught well; his motions were fluid and pure and his steps were timed perfectly. In one of his apparently regular breaks from tradition, the music was performed in a modern style by a modern band of musicians. Although liberties were often taken with the arrangement of the traditional music for Dance of Dabbalemi, there was no doubt that the songs they performed the ritual movements to were modern inventions, especially given the inclusion of a saxophone in the band.

When the dance concluded, William sat down in the provided chair as tradition commanded, waiting for the customary goblets of water. Erlis approached the band and thanked them for their performance as he smiled and shook their hands. He handed them a white envelope from his inside jacket pocket, gave a small bow, and moved into his kitchen. The band began packing up, talking amongst themselves. William tried not to let that bother him.

Moments later, Erlis emerged from his kitchen, holding intricately carved conical horn goblets full of water that was at the appropriate temperature. William smiled: although they had not been brought by any sort of valet, the goblets were appropriately curved and the plants and animals that adorned it indicated an appropriate amount of respect. He was comforted that Erlis was able to pay attention to detail when it suited him.

William stuck his third finger into the goblet before placing it on each of his teeth in turn. Erlis also performed the ritual cleaning of each of his teeth, the order that each did so expressing subtle signals of gratitude and of friendship. William was glad to finally feel respected again; Erlis's minute gestures signalled that he thought of them as kindred spirits.

After precisely placing the goblets on the table and standing, they performed the carefully choreographed series of bows that concluded the ritual.

“Thank you.” William said, making a smile.

“I'm glad you liked it.” Erlis grinned. “I've got something for you. I wanted to give it to you during the ritual, but I realised you might not have anything with you to give in exchange.”

“Although one does not usually give and receive gifts during the Dance of Dabbalemi, I am sure I could manage it.” William said proudly.

Erlis laughed. “All the same, I didn't want to put you out. This is more of a personal gift, so I don't want anything in return. It doesn't really mean anything.” He stood up, and picked a small, modern notebook out of one of the bookcases. He handed it to William.

“Thank you.” William wasn't sure what to make of it; the light blue cover indicated sorrow over an upcoming funeral. He doubted Erlis meant it as a threat, so he had no idea what to make of it.

“I've been living here for just over a hundred years.” He explained. “I've always liked writing, so I kept a diary. I thought you might be interested to learn about the family of that Redmond gentleman you seem to have such a liking for.”

William allowed his eyes to narrow, trying to indicate his displeasure at having his weakness probed in this way.

Erlis laughed again; he seemed comfortable. “I've heard a lot about you. You know people are talking, surely. But not everyone is like Elodia. Some of us think it's a good thing.”

“Excuse me?”

“Some of us think they deserve our respect. The humans. They may not be our equals, but they deserve better.”

William frowned; this was the sort of naive attitude that came from a young vampire who still had a foot in his mother's womb.

“And, of course, they get smarter all the time. You heard about that bomb. The flying machines must astound you. You were born when ships were new, right?”

“Ships have been around for ten thousand years. None of us are that old.”

Erlis chuckled nervously. “Sorry, sorry. I didn't think - but still, it's amazing, isn't it? Can you imagine what they'll be doing in a hundred years?”

“The past few hundred have had some rather interesting progressions.” He admitted.

“And when they have bombs that make sunlight? When they can make gold from lead? Do you want to be on their bad side when that happens?”

I could definitely add in some little asides about status to the above. That's the sort of thing you were talking about, right?
