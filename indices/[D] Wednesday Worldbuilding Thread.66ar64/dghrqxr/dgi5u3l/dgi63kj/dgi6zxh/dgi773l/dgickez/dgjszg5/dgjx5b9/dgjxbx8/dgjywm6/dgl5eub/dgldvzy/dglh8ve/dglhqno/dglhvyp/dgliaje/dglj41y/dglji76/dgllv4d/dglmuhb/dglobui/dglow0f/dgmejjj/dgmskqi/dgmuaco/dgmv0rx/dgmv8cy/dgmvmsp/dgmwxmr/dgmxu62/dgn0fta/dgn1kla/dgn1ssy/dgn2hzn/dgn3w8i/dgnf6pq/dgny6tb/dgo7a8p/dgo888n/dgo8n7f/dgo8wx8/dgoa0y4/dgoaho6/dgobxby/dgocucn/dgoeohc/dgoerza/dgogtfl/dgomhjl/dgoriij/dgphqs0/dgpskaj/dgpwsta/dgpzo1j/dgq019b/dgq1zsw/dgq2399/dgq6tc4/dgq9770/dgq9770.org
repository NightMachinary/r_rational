It's about 10 years old. It, and a robot form of her brother, was made by one of the other characters' crazy grandmothers who was a mad inventor who wasn't allowed to see them or something so decided to make robot replicas.

It's all rather complicated and we need to sit down and hash it out so it'll make some modicum of sense because at the moment it's kind of out there. When that happens no doubt my Wednesday Worldbuilding posts will be all about robots, so that's something to look forward to?
