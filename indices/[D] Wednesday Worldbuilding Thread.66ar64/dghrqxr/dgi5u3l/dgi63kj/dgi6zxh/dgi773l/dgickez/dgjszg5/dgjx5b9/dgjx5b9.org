  DNA / vampire transmission would probably be in the "could I breed with this person" level of similarity required. So, ten million years from now a modern vampire probably couldn't turn the neo-humans into vampires, even if we assume they look pretty much the same.

That's reasonable. So, fair enough, a modern vampire couldn't turn neohumans, but his great-great-however-many-greats-grandchildren vampires will be neohumans and could thus turn neohumans.

On vampire horses:

  And then the goo has to be deliberately vomited up.

Why can't the vampire cut his genetic chimera's stomach open and get at the goo that way? Sure, it'll take a while - especially if it's taking decades to get enough goo - so you'd have to have a pretty dedicated vampire to even try this...

  Yeah I think I'm going to say there's a ~1 atom thick spur coming out of the heart, which perhaps directly joins to the bat form, with no intermediate shapes visible to onlookers during transformation (except for perhaps "disappearing" altogether). With vampires not having control over the transformation process it's easy to conceive of it as "/poof/ all of a sudden I'm a bat" and no need for more fine-grained control.

This works out really well. And has consequences.

- The humanoid form of the vampire is vulnerable to beheading - but the chiroptean form is not. You can cut off the vampire's bat head and he'll be no more than annoyed until it regrows.

- Having said that, the bat-form may very well still be vulnerable to a stake through the heart - especially as the two forms are probably joined /at/ the heart.

- Whether in human or bat form, the human-form brain is doing the thinking.

- The thin link between the two halves is vulnerable - to a 4D native. Breaking it doesn't kill the vampire (but probably hurts). If the bat-heart counts as part of the vampire-heart, then this might be a relatively neat way to grow a clone of the vampire - let it grow from the severed bat.

- When the vampire turns into a bat, the bat always appears where the vampire's heart was (thus always in mid-air, hope you've got those wings out)

- When the vampire turns back into a human, the heart always appears where the bat was. Thus, the bat has to be in mid-air before transforming.

(Destruction of clothes)

Neat. Though, pedantically, another 4D native could still find traces of those clothes (unless perhaps Julius just shifted the clothes enough to toss them through the wall at the fireplace in the next room).
