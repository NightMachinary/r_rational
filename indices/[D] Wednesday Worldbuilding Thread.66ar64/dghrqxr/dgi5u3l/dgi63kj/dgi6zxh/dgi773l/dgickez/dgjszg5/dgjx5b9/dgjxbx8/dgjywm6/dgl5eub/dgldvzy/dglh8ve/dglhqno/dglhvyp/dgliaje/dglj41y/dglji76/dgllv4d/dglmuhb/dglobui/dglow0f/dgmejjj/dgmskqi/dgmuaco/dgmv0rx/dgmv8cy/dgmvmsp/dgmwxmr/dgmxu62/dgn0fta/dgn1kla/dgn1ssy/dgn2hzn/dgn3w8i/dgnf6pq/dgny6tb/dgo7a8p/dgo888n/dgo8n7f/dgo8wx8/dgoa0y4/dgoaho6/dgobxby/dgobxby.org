  Yeah, our slow internet is for a variety of reasons, two main ones: #1: cables have to go under the ocean; #2: government is terrible at getting faster internet installed, controversy, drama, etc.

That sounds familiar. (Our fixed-line former monopoly is a state-owned 'business', and our international line is undersea)

  Hopefully the dead monopoly will result in better things in your future.

Hopefully!

  She only practises in Australia, but she's in demand around the world as a consultant: other lawyers are often mystified why their clients insist on hiring a nameless lawyer from some backwater Australian city to consult with them, but at least she's /easy/ to talk to and direct about what their client wants and the best way to make it happen. Plus she knows enough about the law to actually be able to have an intelligent discussion about the issues.
#+end_quote

Yeah, that's sensible. Between her understanding of the client's 'special needs' and the local lawyer's understanding of local law...

#+begin_quote
  Oh, and then she proposes these completely /mad/ ideas, and when you present them to the client they eagerly accept. Maybe it's all to do with the mafia, but whatever it is, you make a healthy margin on the amount she charges for her services.

  His lawyer nodded, carefully taking notes. Haven was not around to do so; he knew the client would have requested privacy anyway, so he had taken the morning off. Fiona was glad. Her secretary's headaches had been bad lately; he needed an excuse to sleep in.

This paragraph is maybe a teensy bit confusing; I'm not sure whether Fiona is his lawyer, or whether there are two lawyers in the room (Fiona and 'his lawyer' who is maintaining a professional and perhaps somewhat frosty silence while taking notes)
