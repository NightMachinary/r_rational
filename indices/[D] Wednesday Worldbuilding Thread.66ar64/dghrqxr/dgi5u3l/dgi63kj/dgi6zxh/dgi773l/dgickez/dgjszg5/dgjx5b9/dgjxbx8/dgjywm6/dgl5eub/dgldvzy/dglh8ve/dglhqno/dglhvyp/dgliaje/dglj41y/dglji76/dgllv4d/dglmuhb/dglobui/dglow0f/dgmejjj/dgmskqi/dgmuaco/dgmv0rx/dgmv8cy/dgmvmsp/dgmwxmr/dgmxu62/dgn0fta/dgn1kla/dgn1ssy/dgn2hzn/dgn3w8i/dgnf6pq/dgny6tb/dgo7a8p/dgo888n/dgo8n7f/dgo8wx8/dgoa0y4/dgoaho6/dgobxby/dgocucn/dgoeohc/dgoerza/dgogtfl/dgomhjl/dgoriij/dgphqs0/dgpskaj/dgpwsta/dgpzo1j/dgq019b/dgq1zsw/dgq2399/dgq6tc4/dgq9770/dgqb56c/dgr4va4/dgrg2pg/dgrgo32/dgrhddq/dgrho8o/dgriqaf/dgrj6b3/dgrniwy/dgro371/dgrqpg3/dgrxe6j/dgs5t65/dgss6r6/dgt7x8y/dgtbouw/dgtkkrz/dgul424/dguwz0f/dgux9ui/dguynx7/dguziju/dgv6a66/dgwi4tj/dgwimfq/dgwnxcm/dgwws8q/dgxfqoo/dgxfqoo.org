  (In your example, one could tell whether the King of Belgium or William was more powerful by looking at how valuable Tournai is in comparison to New Holland, for example).
#+end_quote

Exactly; and they might be able to infer that William is powerful because he was able to demand a kingdom be made for him, and/or that Tournai is important to him.

I assume secession is rare, though it must happen. William took New Holland when europeans were living there only a few decades: I imagine he got permission from whoever was in charge of the east at the time, though.

  And then, if we work in terms of population, one can also get to the concept of a vampire landscape improver, who takes over a large, mostly empty area of land, spends a century or two persuading more people to move in, and then trades up to a larger, emptier piece of land and so on.
#+end_quote

That's pretty neat: I wonder what William was doing before he came to Australia? I had him in Ireland, but I think he moved there to be with someone in particular rather than for political reasons. Perhaps that's why he went to Australia: he was like "I'm going to do something for ME. And I want a huge tract of land that /isn't/ in Russia."

Hmmm, I wonder if a vampire deigns to own Antarctica? Basically the entire crew of the research station would have to be in on it...

  "handled humanely" in accordance with the Animals Protection Act, 1962; and /that/ in turn includes (amongst other rules) a catch-all rule against causing or omitting any act that results in "any unnecessary suffering" on the part of the animal.
#+end_quote

In short, such laws are hard to enforce - undercover footage of slaughterhouses shows all sorts of horrible things - people kicking animals, not properly stunning them, etc. Being a slaughterhouse worker is a terrible job that is generally done by very vulnerable people (there's lots of evidence that it has a horrific psychological effect). I mean, I'm an engineer and I know there are plenty of people who don't do things strictly by the book around here, and there are /huge consequences/ to that in terms of it affecting thousands of people. Whereas if you kill chickens for a living and you're having a hard day and you kick one, nobody gives a shit.

But if we set /all that/ aside, and pretend that slaughterhouses have animals given a humane lethal injection while soft music is playing (the injection would make their meat inedible, btw), the bigger issue is the actual farming practises - the animal's in the slaughterhouse for, say, a week at most whereas the farm is where they spend most of their lives. They're not pretty.

And "slaughterhouses /aren't that bad/, here's a law from the 1960s" is not really much of a defense of point 1 ;)

#+begin_quote
  I guess one could raise a quibble over what counts as /necessary/ suffering, but I think that legal framework handles the most egregious problems at least.
#+end_quote

That's true; better to forgo animal products altogether and let the legal system focus on what's important. Consumer changes to plant-based foods have had a huge effect on big meat and dairy companies: they're diversifying into plant-based alternatives. Change is happening, albeit slowly.

  Also, having tasted soy milk, I'll admit that I'd rather go without milk than taste it again. (Dunno about the others).
#+end_quote

Soy milk in particular has a taste that varies wildly based on brands. There are some brands I can't stomach.

I started drinking unsweetened almond milk over cow's milk because it had 1/3 the calories and one's always looking for easy ways to reduce one's caloric intake. I kept with it because it tastes /so much better/. I've occasionally had hot chocolates and stuff with cow's milk and cow's milk has a weird, musty, tangy taste that just doesn't sit right with me anymore.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Soybeans are a "complete protein" (which is again, a myth: actually every food has complete proteins in it, just some are in far tinier quantities), and they're an excellent source of lysine. So they are really good /if you have a low calorie plant-based diet./
  #+end_quote

  I can see how that, plus a bit of broken telephone, led to the impression I had.
#+end_quote

I think complete proteins were all the rage in the 1970s or something, when it was believed that you had to eat all the proteins in one meal or you'd wither to a husk and die. Even then, a legume and a grain makes a complete protein, so it's easy.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    That is almost certainly the case: cognitive dissonance, again. Better you think you are more different from humans than you /actually/ are, so you can live with the fact that you enslave and eat them.
  #+end_quote

  Yep. Makes sense. Of course, that means that he's getting surprised every generation or so when somehuman manages to outwit him - and, in modern times, with such ready access to information to counter his improved memory, it'll happen more and more often.
#+end_quote

Yeah. We can work with this.

I also had a headcanon (can you HAVE a headcanon for your own universe?) that vampires could be much, much more effective but they spend so much of their mental real estate on status (their dunbar's number is through the roof!) and remembering all the social rules that they don't have room to do much thinking. I believe it's been theorised that primates have big brains to keep track of all their social interactions, and that's what human intelligence scaffolded onto. So it makes an odd sort of sesne.

#+begin_quote
  Why was there blood soaked into his tunic? I would have thought the vampire bite would have reasonably little spillage (merely on the grounds of minimal wastage) - though I guess it's always possible that William's just a really messy eater.
#+end_quote

Eating for the first time, Clothar struggling at first: I can see it. Maybe "blood soaked into his tunic" was a bit much, though.

    Aside: Originally I conceived of William having been Clovis I, king of the Franks. I'm wondering if that's too wanky, even though he's a relatively obscure historical figure. So I'm contemplating just having him be a guy from that same time and place who was not the king of France.
  #+end_quote

  There's enough ancient kings that surely at least /some/ of them are vampires.
#+end_quote

Yeah, true. I don't think it'll ever come up in the story, so I guess it doesn't make a difference. I believe Clovis was a common name (it was an early form of Louis), so not even his name would come into it.

And besides, if anyone is going to make it as a vampire, a general-king from the dark ages would probably fit the bill.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    Also, standard disclaimer about it being old: I don't think vampire fangs extend during feeding anymore for example. Doesn't really make sense? Or maybe it does?
  #+end_quote

  You'd have to have some kind of internal mechanism that pushes them down and pulls them up - a bunch of new muscles just under the nose. It would make and vampire's face look rather funny, I think - making them easy to spot for those in the know.
#+end_quote

Yeah, let's not go with that. Maybe they're more like vampire bats. (After googling an image: vampire bat bites look like mini hollywood vampire bites. Ugh.). I mean, vampires could rip the flesh open, but even if we assume that there's a healing factor in there, ripping a big bite out of one's flesh is going to not really work.

Looking at snake fangs, that's not a good way to model it. It seems like big muscles won't be needed but they'll be really obvious on examination.

Perhaps vampire incisors are just especially pointy, like a little knife? But it would mean that if you were to bite someone in a non-feeding way (/wink wink/), you'd probably draw blood.

Maybe have them just be ever so slightly longer than human canines, and very much sharper.

Another option: some snakes have fangs in the back of their mouth. Perhaps vampires have secret fangs there. But I'm not sure you'd be able to bite someone in the neck with those....
