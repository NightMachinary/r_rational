  Yeah, that's sensible. Between her understanding of the client's 'special needs' and the local lawyer's understanding of local law...

And her unique knowledge of the two domains (supernatural / law) allowing her to see what nobody else does. Plus she is, of course, very intelligent. Unfortunately, extremely stubborn with an addictive personality.

    His lawyer nodded, carefully taking notes. Haven was not around to do so; he knew the client would have requested privacy anyway, so he had taken the morning off. Fiona was glad. Her secretary's headaches had been bad lately; he needed an excuse to sleep in.

  This paragraph is maybe a teensy bit confusing; I'm not sure whether Fiona is his lawyer, or whether there are two lawyers in the room (Fiona and 'his lawyer' who is maintaining a professional and perhaps somewhat frosty silence while taking notes)

Yeah, the problems that come with me sharing stuff I wrote without intending to circulate; if one of the fiction contests on this sub had a prompt that was related to this, I'd probably just delete that whole paragraph since it adds nothing other than hinting at the wide world outside that meeting room. The reference to Haven being there at all was a nod to some short stuff my coauthor had written in our "drabble" document.

Some random facts about Fiona from the random facts document:

- She's the kind of hideously successful middle-aged unmarried woman that everyone assumes is either a lesbian or sleeping with a married footballer.

- She loves running, and does it almost every day. She likes doing marathons mostly because they are the most common distance event. She competes in every local marathon she can find and usually wins in her age group, and has qualified for and competed in New York, Fukuoka and London.

- Vampires tend to be the most common to seek her out internationally; probably because of how they are always communicating and have deep pockets.

- Ultimately, she never ends up paired off with anyone; her passion in life is her work and community service rather than romantic love. That said, when she is consulting in other countries, she has certain physical needs taken care of.

- One of her big areas of work is teaching local supernatural creatures how to appropriately interact with humans and pass themselves off as such.
