  You may never have been a teenage girl, but me and my coauthor both were.

[[/embarrassedflash][]] Ohhhhhh, right, misunderstood the context on that 'we'. Got it now, misunderstanding resolved.

  I'm debating whether to link to it here under this reddit account (since I probably have a modicum of name recognition on this subreddit after my incessant posts about vampires?) or whether to create an account for "Angela Carson".
#+end_quote

[[/hmmm][]] Well... apart from the question of your coauthor posting on the account, there may actually be benefits to having an 'official' author account. Even if there was only one of you, it could be worth consideration. (For one thing, if you write multiple books, and your official authorship account only submits the links to them, then the "Angela Carson" user page doubles as a handy index to your works).

  And yes, sometimes I am using "we" as in, [[/u/CCC_037]] and [[/u/MagicWeasel]], but I guess you just gotta work that out?
#+end_quote

[[/rdthis-r][]] I guess I'll just have to assign probabilities to the different possible 'we's and take my best guess, then.

...it's actually really fascinating, how well we communicate despite how bad our languages are at it. And it's also fascinating how much of almost any intended communication we get wrong and never realise.

  I always conceived of some species being single-sex: sirens make sense as female-only, but then again, why wouldn't there be boy sirens who tempted female sailors? Probably makes sense.
#+end_quote

Well, Malik's a male half-Siren. If he marries a (female) Siren he can presumably have male three-quarter-Siren sons. After a few careful generations of breeding, you could presumably have male 99%-sirens... whether or not the original Siren genome was intended to handle it or not.

I could see them as being the "tempt female sailors" type - or I could see them looking particularly feminine and being very rare. Either could work.

#+begin_quote
  Yeah. I am bad at communicating. In an earlier post I referred to Malik as being half-human half-gargoyle instead of half-siren half-gargoyle.

[[/flutterwhoa][]] ...I completely missed that one.
