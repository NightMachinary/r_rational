  Or maybe it was a hyena from some vampire's menagerie. You never know ;)
#+end_quote

The wikipedia page did suggest the possibility of a lion escaped from some menagerie.

#+begin_quote
  (bonus points: kidnap a janissary, put them under, insert gold into their blood, then leave them in an alley somewhere)
#+end_quote

Ooooh, yeah, that'll work /way/ better. The vampire won't know what hit him until he's bent over in pain, his neck open and vulnerable to attack.

Of course, you have to be close enough to take advantage but not so close that the vampire can hear your heartbeat.

#+begin_quote
  If you are a secret government organisation, inject gold into a portion of the population under the guise of a vaccine programme. Vampires are now unable to reliably choose targets.
#+end_quote

Bad idea. Gold nanoparticles aren't going to be lethal to vampires, and once one has been affected once, he's going to be a little more cautious in the future, and nibble testingly at his victims' blood before drinking down a good mouthful.

The vampires will hate this, but it won't actually serve to destroy them.

#+begin_quote
  are vampires harmed by gold compounds, or elemental gold only?
#+end_quote

Hmmmm. Well, they're harmed by gold due to alchemical connection to the Sun... you could take this either way, I think.

Elemental gold would probably be /stronger/, though, at the very least.

#+begin_quote
  You've probably heard of colloidal silver, which is an alt-medicine thing that probably cures cancer or something. It's just silver suspended in water.
#+end_quote

Hmmmm. Between wikipedia and the claims on the side of a box of plasters, it looks like silver nanoparticles actually do have genuine antibacterial properties - largely because they stick to bacteria and the bacterial cells can't handle them. I have no idea whether or not gold has similar effects (although they're in the same group on the periodic table, so it seems reasonably likely).

Incidentally, the wikipedia page on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloidal_gold][colloidal gold]] indicates that the nanoparticles /can/ be toxic if they're precisely the wrong size:

#+begin_quote
  ...size 1.4 nm were found to be toxic in human skin cancer cells...while 0.8, 1.2, and 1.8 nm sized AuNSs were less toxic by a six-fold amount and 15 nm AuNSs were nontoxic.

  On the subject of removing gold from the body:

  Their waste products are excreted into their janissaries when they feed, which is how I'd envision their bodies preferring to get rid of the gold - this is not very good for time-sensitive things, though.
#+end_quote

Yeah, but then they need someone around to bite - and /not/ the one they just bit are you /crazy/ - and there's going to be a hesitation to bite /anyone/ given what just happened. Can the vampire force the gold out through his fangs without biting someone? What if he bites (say) a chair leg? Or cuts off his own arm and then bites that?

#+begin_quote
  I don't think new-vampire-goo would be a good route for it. Not sure of a good way that that goo gets made, but I'm guessing the "making new soldiers" function of the body would not be able to take on "deadly poisons". That way if one of your vampire soldiers dies, you can cut his belly open and make a replacement.
#+end_quote

I was thinking that, given their broad immunities, their bodies might not actually have /any/ way to handle poisons. Sure, you wouldn't design vampires to get gold in their goo, but if they had no internal mechanism to handle gold it might get there anyhow.

#+begin_quote
  Cutting off body parts that are affected by gold: I'd imagine the gold would disperse pretty quickly throughout the entire body, so you're kind of stuffed.
#+end_quote

No, one can work with that. Cut off hand, lose some gold. Wait for hand to regrow. Cut off hand, lose some more gold... it'll be painful and unpleasant, but sooner or later you'll get most of it out. (Quicker if one, say, cuts off both legs)

#+begin_quote
  Gold eating through you #2: Actually, if it did eat through you, it would be pretty slow, so the vampire might lie down for an hour or two and wait for the gold to come out of his body, then get his janissaries to do a very thorough job of sweeping the floor. This is probably a good way to do it.
#+end_quote

Something like that, yes. It would be extremely unpleasant for the vampire, and then, if the vampire lives, it would be extremely unpleasant for anyone the vampire thinks might have been responsible for the entire incident.

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, I'm thinking it makes sense for her to find out about the gold thing during the robot thing.
#+end_quote

Could work out quite nicely.

#+begin_quote
  Well, William's willingness to negotiate is borne out of two things
#+end_quote

Killing Jack now deals with (1) better than leaving her alive. (2) seems a bit tenuous when it comes to leaving alive a determined threat (i.e. Jack), even if he's more inclined to leave average people alive now.

  Q&A WITH MW'S DOCTOR FRIEND

  my conclusion: you cannot permenantly inoculate yourself by the looks of it.
#+end_quote

You can't permanently have gold running around in your /blood/. What happens to a vampire who touches gold-impregnated tissue?

#+begin_quote
  my conclusion: colloidal gold is a great idea!
#+end_quote

Sounds good! (Incidentally, I notice that colloidal gold supplement was specifically for drinking - if that gets it into the blood as well, one can perhaps avoid having to inject it directly. Which also means one can simply give a jannissary a cupful, perhaps with a bit of flavouring, and call it (say) raspberry juice. No kidnapping necessary.)

#+begin_quote
  3) gold ions are toxic to the liver and kidneys
#+end_quote

This is presumably part of why the people selling colloidal gold are so against the ionic stuff.

#+begin_quote
  Though you'd end up with people changing colour which would be hard to do in a stealthy manner.
#+end_quote

And those who changed colour would have skin toxic to vampires.

Hardly /stealthy/, but vampires would be rather inconvenienced...

#+begin_quote
  So................ looks like my vampires absorb blood THROUGH THEIR LUNGS. I am so psyched abou tthis!!!
#+end_quote

Their digestive systems have been coopted for reproduction; their respiratory systems for digestion. I find myself wondering if any other internals have changed function...
