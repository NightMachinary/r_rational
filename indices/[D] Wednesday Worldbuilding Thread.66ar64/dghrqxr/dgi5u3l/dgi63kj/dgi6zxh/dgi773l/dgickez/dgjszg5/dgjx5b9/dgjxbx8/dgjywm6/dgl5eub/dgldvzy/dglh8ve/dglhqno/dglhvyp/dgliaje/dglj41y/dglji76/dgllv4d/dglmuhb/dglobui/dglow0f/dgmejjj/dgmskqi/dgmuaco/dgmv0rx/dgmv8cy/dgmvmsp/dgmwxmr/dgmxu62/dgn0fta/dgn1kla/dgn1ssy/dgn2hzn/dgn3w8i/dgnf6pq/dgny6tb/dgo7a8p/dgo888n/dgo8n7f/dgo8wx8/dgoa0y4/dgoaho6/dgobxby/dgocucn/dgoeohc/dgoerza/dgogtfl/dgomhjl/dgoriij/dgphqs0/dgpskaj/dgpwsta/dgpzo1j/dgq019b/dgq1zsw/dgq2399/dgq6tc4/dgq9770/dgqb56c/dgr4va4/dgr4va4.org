  Rather, modern-mad-scientist.

Yeah, but I'm not sure how a modern mad scientist makes a sentient robot since it's out there, and like, should AI takeoff be a concern of ours?

Maybe the mad scientist is supernatural in some way, or recovered the technology from someone who was?

  So, despite how she might look, she only has ten years' worth of experience with life.

I believe she's had uploaded memories of the woman she's a copy of, but they're only until the age of 16 or so. She definitely remembers people from "her" childhood.

  Would this not result in her being surprisingly naive in certain areas?

Yep. This is why she needs more support than her social worker can provide. Fiona helps her in that way.

Also, Rose (that's the robot: did I give her name before?) screws things up. William gave her a pile of gifts, and she decided it was only polite to send them back. Of course, the gifts she sent back were deeply offensive.
