  Depends. What does he want done?
#+end_quote

Good question. He probably doesn't want for much, to be honest: he wants to be highly respected in society, but he doesn't want to be at the precipice - too much work and stress and risk. He'd perhaps want to extend his territory: if he could have a comparably sized swath of land in Europe then that would be very appealing to him. That's going to be tricky as [[https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2014-02/enhanced/webdr04/20/22/enhanced-buzz-11530-1392955176-4.jpg?downsize=715:*&output-format=auto&output-quality=auto][his current territory is bigger than France, Spain and Germany put together]]. (Note: His territory is actually bigger than the state pictured in the diagram).

Really, what he wants most of all is to be able to taste things again. Which I suppose is something he could set his mage ally to work doing...

And he naturally wants assured immortality.

  And, one day, he will quietly point out that as long as he holds to this no-killing truce, it's to Gwyn's benefit to help him increase his influence among vampires... of course, only after he's kept to it a while so she has reason to trust that he intends to /continue/ to keep to it... or, better yet, let her think it was her idea...
#+end_quote

This is very true: if he becomes popular, people will want to emulate him, like with no-killing truces. And he really does want to be popular.

    Yeah, but William is kind of self-hating about the whole thing: he believes by now that humans are sentient, but it's just so /convenient/ to kill them and has no consequences
  #+end_quote

  Why is he self-hating about that? Sure, humans are sentient - but he used to be human, he /always/ knew that, at least on some level. (Clearly he's developed a sense of morals - I'm just wondering where that came from).
#+end_quote

The thing is, he's now a creature that's so far above humans, and has been such for so long, that he's grown kind of detached from them: like, sure, he /feels/ like he was sentient then, but the sentience of a human compared with the sentience of a vampire? Forget about it. They don't think nearly as fast nor as well nor as deeply.

    Basically, the reason that most people today eat meat: they know on some level it'd be better if they didn't, but it's convenient and hedonic to do so, so they do.
  #+end_quote

  I question your assertion, on the grounds that I'm /not/ convinced it would be better if I didn't eat meat.
#+end_quote

Depends what "it would be better" means, I guess.

Basically, if you accept the following three tenets, it follows that it's better not to eat meat (whether you do or not is another question; cognitive dissonance is real)

1. Animals are harmed in order to produce meat

2. Eating meat is avoidable

3. If it can be avoided, it is better not to harm animals

Plenty of people will argue against any one of those three, but plenty of people will also accept 1, 2, and 3 and decide they'd rather eat meat anyway.

    I'd assume not, in a vampire: if there's a one atom spur, blood can't go through that. Each would have its own blood supply, though no idea how the bat is able to be able to fly without eating. So, it probably makes sense for the blood to do some 4D looping.
  #+end_quote

  I'm thinking maybe expand that 4D spur to, say, about the diameter of a finger or so. Just enough space for some blood to pump through. (And then the vampire's blood path will be a three- or four-leaf clover instead of a figure-eight)
#+end_quote

The diameter of a finger makes a hell of an artery; probably could get away with being much smaller, but yeah, that's probably the case.

#+begin_quote

  #+begin_quote
    It would do. It could likely bleed more than its weight in blood, ironically enough.
  #+end_quote

  Huh, that's true. Though the cut-off bits regrowing would also be a hint that this is not an ordinary bat.
#+end_quote

The regrowth is pretty slow, I don't think it'd be visible "in real time". An arm takes a whole (week did I say?) to grow back.
