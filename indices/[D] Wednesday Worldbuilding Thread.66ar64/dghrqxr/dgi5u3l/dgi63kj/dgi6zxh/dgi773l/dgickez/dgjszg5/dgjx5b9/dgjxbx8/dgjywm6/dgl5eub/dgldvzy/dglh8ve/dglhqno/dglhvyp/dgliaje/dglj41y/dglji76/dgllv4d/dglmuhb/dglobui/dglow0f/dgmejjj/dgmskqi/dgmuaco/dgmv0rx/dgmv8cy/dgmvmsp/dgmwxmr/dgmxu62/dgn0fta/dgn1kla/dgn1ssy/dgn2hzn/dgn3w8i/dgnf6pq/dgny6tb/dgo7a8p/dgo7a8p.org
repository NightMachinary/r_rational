  Then /again/, a siren's bottom half is bird, so if we assume there's bird DNA in there they'd have a ZW sex determinant system which is a whole different kettle of fish.
#+end_quote

Yeah, but then (a) they wouldn't be interfertile with humans, and (b) having the male being homozygous means that an all-female race is pretty near impossible (since he only needs half the chromosomes of the female). Having them as a race suffering from androgen insensitivity syndrome makes a whole lot more sense to me. (Which probably means Malik and Kalam have the mild version thereof, at least).

  Oh, and monotremes have a 10 chromosome system just in case you wanted something even more complicated.
#+end_quote

Yeeek.

  Yeah, I think I'm going to have to buy the ebook and read the rest. I love those little cartoons and I pay about that much for hot chocolate sometimes.
#+end_quote

Hot chocolate is expensive where you're from.

  I might incorporate something from one of those into the reproductive strategy of one of our critters. Will need to discuss that with my coauthor and see what we come up with. Might be a good way to incorporate a new character / creature.
#+end_quote

Yeah... the Whiptail Lizard might actually work for another all-female race.

  So, all this talk about supernatural creatures, beasts, critters: should there be a word for them?
#+end_quote

Yes, there should be. And that word depends on your cultural background. So the Hebrew would probably call them Shedim, the Japanese call them Yokai, and so on and so forth.

An interesting question, then, is what they call themselves. And this goes to the question of how they view themselves. Most human tribes come up with a name that means (some variant on) 'The True Human Beings' - it would make sense for these critters to come up with some name for themselves that means 'The True People' in their own language. (The name might very well still /be/ Shedim, especially if they had a lot of contact with the Hebrew people way back in the past...)
