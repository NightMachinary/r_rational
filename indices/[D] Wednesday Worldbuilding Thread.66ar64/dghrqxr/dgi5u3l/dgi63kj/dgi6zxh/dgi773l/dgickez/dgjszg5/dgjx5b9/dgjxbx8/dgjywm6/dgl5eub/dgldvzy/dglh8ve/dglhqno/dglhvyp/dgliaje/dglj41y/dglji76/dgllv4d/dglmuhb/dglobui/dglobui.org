  the bit he does his thinking with
#+end_quote

Oh yeah - I wonder what that is? I never really considered that. Maybe the heartstone /is/ the brain? And that's why it's present in all slices, so that they can all be controlled (okay, probably more like a spinal cord: a small heartstone spinal cord in most cross sections with a larger heart stone "brain" in the other, "more important" cross sections - where would they be?).

His body is shaped like this:

Stone --> Battle --> Human --> Iceberg of flesh

So it'd make most sense for his "brain" heartstone to be in his /stone form/, not his battle form. So you'd have to get him virtually starving so he'd be forced to be in his regenerative stone form, and then destroy all of /that/ - which is no doubt the most protected part of him.

But if you destroy any part of his spinal cord stone, he loses control of his body /below/ that. The iceberg of flesh still keeps it all alive unless you sever everything, but he's not going to be able to use it. Maybe the spinal cord stone will heal given time, though?

  Hmmmm. But only one side - presumable the gargoyle side - still has a brain.
#+end_quote

Yeah, unless we go for him having a distributed brainy-heart-stone-thingy, so he'd be able to control every part of it. I kind of like the possibility of existential angst as he gets severed and the human side realises that he's doomed.

#+begin_quote
  the whole thing will be pretty gross, but he can get most of his mass back.
#+end_quote

Yeah, but with the flesh iceberg severed, unless he can find a 4D surgeon, the fleshy parts of his gargoyle body are going to die. Presumably he'd have a pretty ordinary-looking stone gargoyle body that would allow him to live a more or less normal life, only now hiding is completely impossible and he's not nearly so cuddly </3

  [[/twiwink][]] But now /I/ don't know whether you meant to type '10%' or '10kg' - both have an equal error distance.

1% is probably closer to the right order of magnitude; then again if he eats rocks, those are pretty dang heavy. And when he's in relationships he'd eat just to be polite, so he might be eating 100% if he was in a long-term relationship - or even more as no doubt his son would bring him tasty rocks from time to time.

    I think by the time computer chips are a thing, Red is well and truly used to the craziness of the supernatural world and would just completely accept it.
  #+end_quote

  Fair enough. But just crunching through an aluminium pot could have happened a long time before computer chips. I don't actually know when aluminium refining started being a thing that could be done...
#+end_quote

Looks like it was from the 1890s, so they probably had cheap aluminium in the 1940s onwards. Not sure if Julias would eat garbage in front of his masters though; he'd know from experience that many find it disturbing and would not want to weird them out, after all...
