  But I haven't taken too much care in that: I mean after all, it requires me to think way more than I'd like to about genitals, and there's really no way for it to come up in the story

Fair enough.

  (at least, not until Malik proudly tells his boyfriend that he's pregnant... now THAT could be funny)

It would certainly come as a surprise...

  Just did a cost of living comparison and it looks like we have everything more expensive. Lists the price of our coffee as $4.50 (45 R) and your coffee as $2.30 (23 R). So yeah, we do have expensive coffees over here! (Though our average net salary is double Johannesburg's, so go figure).
#+end_quote

Huh, that really puts our internet costs in perspective. But yeah, double cost and double salary pretty much cancel each other out, until someone goes on holiday and has to pay the other country's prices for a while.

Aren't Sirens /supposed/ to attract sailors, though? (There's no reason for anything of this sort to happen on-stage; but you provide a good reason for why it might be part of Siren culture in the backstory. This also means that the other Sirens might think Julius' wife is just a little bit /odd/, leading to a slight degree of social ostracisation...)

  Plus, I think demons would not have a word for "non-human sentient beings". They'd have a word for "non-centaur sentient beings" in centaur language or whathaveyou. Probably.

Hmmmm. Maybe their collective noun for all their species is their word for "The Beings" (a category that technically includes humans, but humans seem to keep assuming that they're somehow better than everyone else).
