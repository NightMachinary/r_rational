  Unless the hunter decides to get a rent-a-crowd to do something nearby, that the hunter can join in: throw a street party, have a barbecue, stage a street fight with spectators, etc.
#+end_quote

That depends on how big said home is. If it's a large estate, and the vampire is known to be really grumpy about trespassers...

#+begin_quote
  Maybe, and it might even work to an extent. But biting into a clean, fresh human would be instant relief.
#+end_quote

Oh, yeah. But sometimes, you don't have a clean, fresh human on hand. (Except this guy who's approaching with a mallet and wooden stake. He looks clean...)

#+begin_quote
  (probably better option: use a tranquiliser dart at range)
#+end_quote

Ooooh, that /is/ a good idea. Probably won't get as big a dose, but it can be more concentrated...

#+begin_quote
  I assume a co-operative janissary would tell you the vampire's preferred eating places though.
#+end_quote

Or you just keep him unconscious and check for puncture wounds.

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, and Gwyn lives in a house that not only is impassible without an invitation, but has lots of gnarly wards on it.
#+end_quote

Ooooh, yeah. Noooot someone you really want working on a mail-delivered sunlight spell.

#+begin_quote
  True. He could provide spells that are useful against /other/ things that might bother them as well as spells that are useful /for/ him. I wonder what sorts?
#+end_quote

Depends. What does he want done?

I imagine some of it would go towards spells that make intricate artworks that are not quite possible without magic, because those would make good gifts for other vampires. And, one day, he will quietly point out that as long as he holds to this no-killing truce, it's to Gwyn's benefit to help him increase his influence among vampires... of course, only after he's kept to it a while so she has reason to trust that he intends to /continue/ to keep to it... or, better yet, let her think it was her idea...

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, but William is kind of self-hating about the whole thing: he believes by now that humans are sentient, but it's just so /convenient/ to kill them and has no consequences
#+end_quote

Why is he self-hating about that? Sure, humans are sentient - but he used to be human, he /always/ knew that, at least on some level. (Clearly he's developed a sense of morals - I'm just wondering where that came from).

#+begin_quote
  Basically, the reason that most people today eat meat: they know on some level it'd be better if they didn't, but it's convenient and hedonic to do so, so they do.
#+end_quote

I question your assertion, on the grounds that I'm /not/ convinced it would be better if I didn't eat meat.

#+begin_quote
  And Gwyn really trusts Jack, so it'll be pretty easy to get her, even if Jack is no longer janissary-level charmed...
#+end_quote

Exactly.

#+begin_quote
  It's not really that complicated; heart provides pressure, and it goes through various arteries until it reaches capillaries where it's disseminated into tissues, and then back into veins and into the heart again. It's just a closed loop. I mean, it's neat, and evolution is amazing to come up with it, but it's not what I'd call "complicated"
#+end_quote

Well, yeah, but there's a kind of a double-loop through the heart - it goes into one side, gets pumped through the lungs, then into the other side, then gets pumped to pretty much everywhere else, then back to the heart. More like a figure-eight than a loop, with the heart at the intersection point.

#+begin_quote
  I'd assume not, in a vampire: if there's a one atom spur, blood can't go through that. Each would have its own blood supply, though no idea how the bat is able to be able to fly without eating. So, it probably makes sense for the blood to do some 4D looping.
#+end_quote

I'm thinking maybe expand that 4D spur to, say, about the diameter of a finger or so. Just enough space for some blood to pump through. (And then the vampire's blood path will be a three- or four-leaf clover instead of a figure-eight)

#+begin_quote
  It would do. It could likely bleed more than its weight in blood, ironically enough.
#+end_quote

Huh, that's true. Though the cut-off bits regrowing would also be a hint that this is not an ordinary bat.
