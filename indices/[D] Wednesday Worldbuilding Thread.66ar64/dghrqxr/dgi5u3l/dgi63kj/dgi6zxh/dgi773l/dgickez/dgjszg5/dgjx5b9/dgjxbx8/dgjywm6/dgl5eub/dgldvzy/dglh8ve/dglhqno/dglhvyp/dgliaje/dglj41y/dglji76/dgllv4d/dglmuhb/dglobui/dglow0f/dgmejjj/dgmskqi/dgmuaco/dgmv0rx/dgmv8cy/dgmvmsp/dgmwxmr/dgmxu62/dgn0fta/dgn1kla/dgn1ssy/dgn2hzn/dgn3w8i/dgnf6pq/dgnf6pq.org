  Depends how their DNA codes for sex: after all, some reptiles have their sex determined by their gestational temperature, not by their DNA at all. Best not think about things related to sex and gender too hard.

Considering that they're interfertile with humans, I think they pretty much have to code for it in the same way as humans do. Which - oh dear, I think this means the genetics lab would need to pretty much build a Siren Y-chromosome from scratch. I don't think our hypothetical vampire scientist is quite able to manage that just yet.

[[/fsfascinating][]] Nature is so fascinating...

I mean, a lot of those are just /weird/, but still. I honestly did not know that about anglerfish. And those whiptail lizards are just /bizarre/.

  I'm sure it has an official name, but this sort of optical illusion: [[https://minds.wisconsin.edu/bitstream/handle/1793/6434/1547.jpg?sequence=1]]

  Your brain just... fills in the correct phrasing (in this case, not duplicating the the).

Oh, right. Taking advantage of the the brain's forward error correction mechanisms to hide errors. I get the point.
