  Well, if we imagine him having at least one 4D arm that he can use to grab the clothing and eat it

I was thinking he would use his tail for that, being the limb that doesn't have an analogue in his 3D body.

  Because I seriously don't know whether he has an anus.

Alright, there are three points to consider here.

First of all - his human form was clearly /deliberately/ made to /look/ human. Human shapes are complicated; but most of that complexity is in things like eyes, which need to be visible. Any craftsman capable of making a suitably accurate human eye isn't going to be tripped up over something as simple as a convincingly human rear end. So, on that basis alone, I'd say he has to be at least as human as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Daneel_Olivaw][R. Daneel Olivaw]] - at a minimum, he has to be able to pass as a human when naked.

(But he might not be able to pass through a metal detector without setting it off, depending on exactly what sort of stone he's made of).

There's another question, though - where does what he eats go? Is he powering himself from the complete conversion of matter to energy (in which case he might well need only a small snack every century)?

And, related to that, what does he breathe out? (Humans tend to stick carbon onto the oxygen before we breathe it out, and that carbon comes - eventually - from the food we eat).

Once these three questions are sorted out, the remaining messy little details are easily resolved.
