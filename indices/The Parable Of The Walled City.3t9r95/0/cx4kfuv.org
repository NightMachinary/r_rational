It feels like it got cut off...nothing about the conversation changed from beginning to end, no new point was made, and neither character took any actions or was moved in their viewpoint. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to get from this -- that Mediator is hopelessly naive? That Protector is a paranoid reactionary? That we should engage with and overcome-through-politics the demons that trouble us? That we should cower in our walled city because some things really are unbeatable...except by walls?

It's a great start to a story that I'd like to read, but there's no story and no parable.
