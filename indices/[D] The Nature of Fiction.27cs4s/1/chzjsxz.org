Out of story explanations explain why the author attempted to design the story in a certain way, but they do not explain why in story events happen. This includes word of god statements. The author's perspective is "just" a (usually) very well-thought interpretation of the story. If there's a better interpretation, one that fills a plot hole and still explains the events while remaining believable, then it is superior to the author's perspective. I see no reason to read a story and think "What would (person in the real world) think about whether Lex Luthor thought of this idea?" when you can just say "Would Lex Luthor think of this idea?". I see no reason to make an exception for the author. Again, a story is "Suppose reality were like the real world except [blah]. Then [blah] might happen.". The person telling you this sentence is not a part of the story. They are just the messenger. You don't put the whole book in quotes and say "said Charles Dickens" at the end.

The main problem with this "theory of fiction" is that it doesn't allow for breaking the fourth wall. Under the theory as it is, if someone breaks the fourth wall then certain characters either randomly speak to no one or "falsely" believe that they are in a story (falsely because within the story, they are not within a story). This leads to problems for stories like Homestuck or Deadpool. Homestuck is a mess on its own and I'm not going there, but characters in that story actually don't break the fourth wall much, they just interact with a direct author avatar. I'm not an expert on Homestuck since I haven't read it in years so I'll leave it at that. Deadpool remains a problem.

As a brief side note, games are not necessarily stories. The Stanley Parable is not a story. It is an interactive experience, a fantastic interactive experience that cannot possibly be experienced in any medium but gaming. The agency of the player is an essential element. I highly recommend it. I won't talk about the details because it's really a case where the less you know about it before you play, the better.

Another aspect of story-telling is, for lack of a better term, the content vs the lens. I will explain it hoping that it will fix the fourth wall problem. The lens is the medium through which you are experiencing the story. If you're watching TV and some static comes across the screen, the static is not a part of the story. It's a part of the lens. Animated characters often live in worlds with lots of solid colors, TV shows sometimes have mysterious logos pop up that follow the camera without the characters noticing, anime characters sometimes go black and white or have a giant water drop appear next to their heads, comic book characters live in little boxes, and so on. These are a part of the presentation of the story, not the content. Sometimes it's appropriate to consider them to be "literal" aspects of the story, such as Looney Toons characters stretching, zooming, and surviving anvils dropped on their heads. In other cases, it's unreasonable to think of a water droplet appearing next to the heads of exasperated anime characters. I'm not sure how to mathematically define when it is better to consider something a part of the lens or part of the content. I'm open to suggestions. For things like censorship, it's unclear. Suppose the author leaves a story open-ended as to whether the main character kills the villain at the end, and that the story is a show for young children. It is likely that if they main character had killed the villain, it would have been censored. Based on in-story events (suppose) it's more likely the main character would kill the villain. If the censorship is part of the lens, then the main character killed the villain, but if it's part of the content, then the main character didn't kill the villain. It's unclear to me which view is "better". It's easy to get a little bogged down in specific examples so I don't want to belabor this one too much. I'd like to be able to crisply define which is better like I did with believability vs satisfyingness, but I don't know how. I'd love to get feedback on this.

Plot armor is a property of the story, not a property of the characters. Plot armor means that in story, probabilities are locally skewed such that certain characters survive in a way that does not follow in-story physics. This means that believability is going to take a significant hit every time the main characters are in danger until the believability is low enough to support an added probability warping power to the implicit premise. In terms of predicting what the author will do next, it is appropriate to consider this, but in predicting what would likely happen next after a given point, it should not be taken into account.

Part of the fundamental assumption of a story is that there is a story to tell. Certain things must happen in order for the story to be worth experiencing. These still incur a believability/satisfyingness penalty. A good author should be able to make these things happen using in-story rules.

Deadpool's power is that he is aware that he is in a story, the medium of the story, and certain real-world knowledge (along with his nonproblematic in-universe powers). This description is slightly wrong, because it requires author interaction in order for it to work. Remember that a story is "Suppose it were like the real world except [blah]. Then [blah] might happen.". This doesn't fit with Deadpool somehow knowing that we are supposing about him. Deadpool can't know that we are supposing about him, not always, because we can suppose that he didn't know. One could argue that it's like supposing that Aang couldn't waterbend, and I'm not sure if that argument holds weight or not. The point is that Deadpool's power as advertised is a property of the story AND of how the story is being told, not of the in-universe character. I think the best way to think of it along with this perspective of fiction is that Deadpool's 4th wall breaking ability is a promise of the author to tell the story in a certain way, a metarule that supersedes the in-universe laws of physics, like the Comic Code forbidding and demanding certain outcomes regardless of their in-universe probability. It's part of the lens.
