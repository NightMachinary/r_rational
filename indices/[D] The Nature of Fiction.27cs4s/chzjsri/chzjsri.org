Let's look at a few examples.

Example 1:

#+begin_quote
  Once upon a time, there was a man named Tim who had superhuman jumping. Tim had a job across a canyon from his house. As he was running to work, he realized that the bridge across the canyon had collapsed. Tim jumped across the canyon.
#+end_quote

Here, "Tim has superhuman jumping." is part of the explicit premise, so we don't have to add it to the implicit premise. The story is directly believable.

Example 2:

#+begin_quote
  Once upon a time, there was a man named Tim. Tim had a job across a canyon from his house. As he was running to work, he realized that the bridge across the canyon had collapsed. Tim jumped across the canyon.
#+end_quote

In order for Tim jumping across the canyon to be likely, we have to assume a much larger premise than what is explicitly stated. The probability of Tim successfully jumping across the canyon given only established facts of the story is extremely small, so it requires a larger assumption, a larger suspension of disbelief. If we assume that Tim is insane or on a drug trip or being deceived by Descartes' demon, then anything is believable, but this is an unsatisfying premise. Saying that it's all a dream is like saying there is absolutely no plausible explanation for what happened, so we have to assume the entire thing in order to talk about it. We can make a much smaller assumption, namely that Tim is superhuman in some way, or that the story takes place on a planet with much less gravity than Earth.

Example 3:

#+begin_quote
  Once upon a time, there was a man named Tim. Tim had a job across a canyon from his house. As he was running to work, he realized that the bridge across the canyon had collapsed. Tim jumped across the canyon. After work, he jumped back across the canyon.
#+end_quote

It has already been established in this story that Tim can jump long distances, though it hasn't been explained why. Therefore, jumping back across the canyon does not require any extension of the premise. This is about equally believable and satisfying as the previous story.

Example 4:

#+begin_quote
  Once upon a time, there was a man named Tim. Tim had a job across a canyon from his house. As he was running to work, he realized that the bridge across the canyon had collapsed. Tim jumped across the canyon. After work, he was unable to get home.
#+end_quote

This requires another extension of the premise! Tim was able to jump across the canyon to get to work, but he wasn't able to jump back. Now we have to assume that he has the power to jump long distances, but only sometimes. We have to assume a very large implicit premise. In fact, it might be better to assume that there was some other obstacle preventing him from getting home, because the canyon didn't pose a problem for him in the morning.

Example 5:

#+begin_quote
  Once upon a time, Superman was fighting a potato. They fought until there was a winner.
#+end_quote

In this case, there is a lot missing from the elaboration. It is not stated who won, or how they fought, or for how long. This does not mean that all interpretations of what happened are equally valid. We have to pick the interpretation of the story which is best with respect to believablity and satisfying-ness. It is not at all believable that Superman would lose against a potato. It is not at all satisfying to assume that there is anything extraordinary about the potato, or about the situation in which Superman fights the potato when we have the perfectly valid implicit elaboration of Superman winning, which does not require any additional implicit premise. Therefore it is better to include "Superman wins." in the (implicit) interpretation than "Superman loses.".

Example 6:

#+begin_quote
  Once upon a time, the moon was made of cheese. Maybe I ate it.
#+end_quote

In order for me eating the moon to be believable, you have to assume that I am able to eat the moon's mass in cheese, that I am able to physically get to the moon, or have it brought to me, and that I would want to eat the entire moon. This is an extremely large premise. The implicit elaboration where I ate the moon requires a dramatic extension of the premise or an utterly unbelievable extension to the elaboration. It is therefore unreasonable to interpret the story as being about me eating the moon.
