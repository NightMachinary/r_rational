If "it may not be great," then you're going to lose people who have more stories than they have time. If I want portal fantasy, then there are a lot of high-caliber portal stories for me to choose from, so there's no reason for me to pick something average.

Besides that, though, the synopsis doesn't sell it to me very well.

Stories that are more popular but lower quality may be in different genres than this one and/or have better elevator pitches.
