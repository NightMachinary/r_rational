It's somewhat similar to 2YE, but with more emphasis on /discovery/ rather than exploiting pre-existing rules, and the scientific method is made use of excellently. It also re-constructs some tropes commonly found in light novels, which is cool.

+It looks interesting just from looking at the summary, but I'm going to sit in this thread and wait for the internet to tell me what to think because I'm currently swamped with fanfiction.+
