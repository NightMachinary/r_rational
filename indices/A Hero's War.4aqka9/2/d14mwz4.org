I've read all the chapters. It's very good. Much better than I expected based on the synopsis. World building is good, nobody really holds the idiot ball, the industrial revolution is well described and the steps taken are logical.

I'm going to look forward to this as much as much as I'm looking forward to new chapters of the Tinker's Daughter, Mother of Learning and Contact 1955.

Closest to this would be Two Year Emperor (but that has more a DnD munchkining focus).
