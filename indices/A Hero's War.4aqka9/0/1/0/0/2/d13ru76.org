In Portal Fantasy specifically, books on my to-read list include:

- /The Magicians/, by Lee Grossman.

Neil Gaiman has a number of books that qualify. /Erfworld/ is... good, but I can't say whether it's better than /A Hero's War/, because it's not top-caliber. Definitely a better elevator pitch, though.

If you're okay with fanfiction, then the Discworld fic /Slipping Between Worlds/ is also on my list.

I'm not sure how many people are looking specifically for rationalist Portal Fantasy. If that's what you're meaning, then the explanation is likely that most people are just looking for high-caliber r!fic in general. In that case there's a good list at TV Tropes, but I'd suggest anything by Scott Alexander, and r!Animorphs.
