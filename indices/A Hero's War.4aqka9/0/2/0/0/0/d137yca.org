In ascending order of size...

[[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/317740/silver-glows-journal][Silver Glow's Journal]] (not started) -- One of the many "second contact" stories you seen in the MLP fandom, but it's author is Admiral Biscuit, who I really respect (wrote the "Celestia Sleeps in" series) (in progress)

[[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/284980/pirenes-well-three-nights-in-manehattan][Pirene's Well: Three Nights in Manehattan]] (barely started) -- Pirene's Well was a fantastic example of Human in Equestria done right, and this one is looking pretty good too. Noir. (complete)

[[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/92469/washed-up][Washed Up]] (barely started) Swashbucklin action with amnesiac Shining Armor. Pretty fun so far, not something for deep thinking. (in progress)

[[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/58321/exit-through-canterlot][Exit Through Canterlot]] (barely started) Rebellion against the nobility via graffiti. It's well regarded, although I'm not very far in. (complete)

[[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/48739/harmony-theory][Harmony Theory]](most of the way through) Time travel, shitloads of worldbuilding, and high stakes political wrangling. It's really good, but at about 500k words, it's also really long. (in progress)
