First of all, you don't regret anything if you're dead or your mind is altered to not feel regret.

Third, "regret" is a somewhat vague concept, and it's questionable how much it'd map onto someone's values. For example, I could see a person not regretting buying a lottery ticket, even though unbenownst to them it would've ended up giving them a million dollars. Minimizing regret minimizes sorrow, but it doesn't maximize happiness much.
