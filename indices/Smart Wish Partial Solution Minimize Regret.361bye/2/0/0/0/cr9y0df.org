Nope @ lazy - Anecdotally, the hippie manifestation experience is something like this:

The universe wants you to be happy, but you have to tell it what that looks like, and it'll go the least out of its way to make that happen.

In other words, it's a lazy genie (according to these experiences).

What this really means is: How go the different genie types deal with the unspecified details? If you wish for wealth but not happiness, the malevolent genie picks those details to screw you (whole family dies! insurance payout!), the benevolent genie picks the details to give you what you really want (the wealth is your family!), and the lazy genie alters your life-path the least (career path opportunities arise!).

Malevolent genies are the only ones that require programming, because they're the only ones you have to describe everything exactly or it fucks up. Lazy genies just maybe ask you to sacrifice things you weren't expecting; it's important to be abstract and/or vague. Benevolent genies, you want to specify the least. In the experiences of people who talk about manifestation, the universe is somewhere between a benevolent and lazy genie.
