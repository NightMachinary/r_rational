I think #2 is the sharp end - not convinced that giving a formal definition of "Things I would regret" is a different order of complexity than "Things I value". May possibly be a subset, but it doesn't reduce the task by that much and still seems prone to the same problems - there's a great many things that you might find small reasons to regret but that don't actually matter in the face of executing your wish, and you need to specify exactly the order of priorities... which somewhat just reduces back to specifying all of your values.
