Regret is indeed easier to define, but you still need to specify that you mean to minimize the regret of a counterfactual model of you as you are now, assuming that the counterfactual you is brought to full understanding of each counterfactual under consideration.

But yeah, at that point it's not that hard. The hard bit is actually writing down a specification of this that doesn't assume you have a magic counterfactual you in a box.
