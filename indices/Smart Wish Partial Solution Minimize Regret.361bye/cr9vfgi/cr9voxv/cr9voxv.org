Very interesting! I think the advantage comes in when we say that there must be absolutely no regret, not just minimizing total regret. If you take excessively cautious actions you'll end up with less expected value and regret the decision to be overly cautious.

Maybe minimize the maximum amount of regret felt across all time.
