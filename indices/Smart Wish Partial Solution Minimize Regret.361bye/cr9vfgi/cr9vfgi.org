Consider that logic applied to any decision. If your decisions are always made to minimize regret, what will they be like? I suspect they will be conservative and safety-oriented, rather than aggressive. This will minimize the chance of a negative outcome but strongly limit the positive outcomes. Of course you can factor that into the decision, and consider that you may regret having not taken any risks, but it will still color it: we are still human and not flawless engines of rationality.
