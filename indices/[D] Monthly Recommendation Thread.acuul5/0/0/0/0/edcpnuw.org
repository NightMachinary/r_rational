Honestly, not really. That's why I dropped it after 6 chapters, at least. The characters don't talk to one another which was frustrating me - I think the author was trying to preserve the mystery of their backstory (or the actual story, in this case, since it's an epilogue) but it didn't work for me. I can see why one would enjoy the story. Though. It's certainly an interesting take on things! I'd still give it a shot to see if you like it.
