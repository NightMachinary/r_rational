I gave it a try. Kind of got turned off by Jen's language issue. No way anyone forgets words like "bread" or "Wednesday" in their mother tongue of sixteen years because of not speaking the language for less than half that time. The author must neither be bilingual nor have asked friends that are bilingual for their take on this.

Other than that I agree with you on the lack of communication thing. Not to mention on how veterans in leadership positions seem to be back at handling their problems like teenagers.
