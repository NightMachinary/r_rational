Super minion is a really good easy read, thanks for the recommendation!

I'd call it a darkish superhero action story but it also had some moments that made me genuinely laugh out loud(like the mc choosing a minion name). I wouldn't say it's explicitly rational or munchkin focused but it's a very interesting world and main character. The only problems I see with it is some typos from the fast writing/lack of correction and that there isn't nearly enough of it!
