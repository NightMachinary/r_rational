I absolutely loved John Bierce's [[https://www.amazon.com/Into-Labyrinth-Mage-Errant-Book-ebook/dp/B07J675X2C][Into the Labyrinth]]. It's from the magic school genre and, like the best of Harry Potter novels, it somehow succeeds in evoking the feelings of mystery and limitless possibility that come from exploring a wondrous new world in the company of friends.

Two caveats. First, I'm not so sure it qualifies as rational. The protagonist is a lot more curious about the inner workings of magic as compared to, say, Harry Potter, and spends a lot of time trying to understand the constituent elements of spells, and how they may be put together in new ways; but his decisions are roughly what you'd expect from a boy his age. In particular, there's a scene where he convinces his friends, in equivalent HP mythology, to go out into the forbidden forest at night and see what's really there, which I expect would rub some people here the wrong way.

The second caveat is that the book takes a while to get started. The starting point is very cliche -- a seemingly talentless boy at magic school repeatedly picked on by his social betters -- and for the first 10% of the book, I felt impatient for the moment when, /of course/, the protagonist will happen upon the key to unlocking his talent.
