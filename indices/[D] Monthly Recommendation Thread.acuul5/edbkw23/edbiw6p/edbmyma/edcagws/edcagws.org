I'll add a dissent on this recommendation. Here's my review of it, copy pasted:

#+begin_quote
  I suspected I would hate this story when I read its very first sentence, where the author used the phrase "very, very good", but I decided to give it a shot anyway. "Look at all these positive reviews!" I thought. I should have listened to my first instinct.

  I feel like the thought process behind this book is very simple: the author likes Harry Potter, and he likes Mother of Learning, and he thought, why not write a book exactly like that. So you have an abused, bullied MC with a tragic past, like HP, only he's not a slacker but a nerd, and the magic he is learning in his prestigious school is of the "Hard Fantasy" kind, with strict, detailed rules on its application.

  Only unlike both of those stories there is nothing driving the plot, no tension, no conflict. He thought of a world, but not the people in it, and not why this story should be told instead of any other. So in this story, things just happens. The MC does not really have any agency, at all. He starts the book unable to do magic like other students, which is a promising direction to take the story in, but that is promptly solved by someone else, with no actual effort imparted (i.e., written about) by anyone. A teacher decides to help the MC (not because of anything the MC does, mind you) and he does just that: he tells the MC exactly what the problem is, and exactly how to solve it. And he also does it to the side characters, who are also magically challenged like the MC. He just points at them one by one, gives them a few paragraphs on why they're struggling, a few more on how he will help them, takes them to the library and tosses the relevant books at them. In the first quarter or so of the book. Throughout several pages. Poof, problem solved.

  Hmmm.

  After all their problems are solved for them, the MC and side characters unload all their backstories, their insecurities, and their motivations to each other within days of meeting each other, one after the other, in long paragraphs of dialogue. This pattern holds true for exposition about the worldbuilding, setting, or characters, where it is all explained by one character to another in the same style, in the same tone, like they're reciting a textbook perfectly from memory(or the authors worldbuilding notes, cough). Sometimes the author decides to just skip that step and simply has the MC read a textbook directly. How fun.

  *That is the author's entire approach to exposition: to jerk it off and spray the reader in the face with that tasty exposition, and to not stop jerking it even when the climax ends, refractory period be damned. Just a constant spray of masturbatory exposition in the face.*

tl;dr: Overly-detailed worldbuilding wrapped up in nothing, not even a veneer of storytelling. Nothing is fought for, nothing is earned, nothing is a unexpected. Worst book I've read in a long time.
