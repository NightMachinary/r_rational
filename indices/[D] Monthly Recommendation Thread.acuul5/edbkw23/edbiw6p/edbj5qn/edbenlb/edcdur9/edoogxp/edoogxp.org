Bit late, but I'm really enjoying Forge of Destiny over at the sufficientvelocity forums.

It's one of those things that really shouldn't work, (Wuxia / magic school / battle royale in a vote/quest format with events determined by skill checks and dice rolls), but the author is able to brilliantly weave everything together into something much greater than the sum of its parts.

The main character is kind of bland in the beginning, but the ensemble cast and their world are so interesting that it more than makes up for it.
