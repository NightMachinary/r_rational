I read a few stories on RoyalRoad the past month that very much surprised me with how good they are compared to most of the stuff on the site.

*[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21374/epilogue][Epilogue]]* by [[/u/Etzoli][u/Etzoli]] is a relatively short (about the size of a regular novel) and complete story about our heroes returning to earth after being portal fantasied away. If you have ever seen the ending of Narnia, where the protagonists who are now adults stumble back through the wardrobe and become kids in the real world again, this is a story about what happens next. What happens when you lose all of your authority, power, and most of your knowledge becomes useless. How can you go back to just being a regular kid after living through so much. This story not only explores these ideas but also has interesting characters and I would highly recommend you guys check it out.

*[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion][Super Minion]]* by GogglesBear is a newish superhero webserial that has an pretty interesting start. Without spoiling anything the story has a lot of munchkinry with our protagonist able to biologically change their body to adapt to the situation. Overall it is a decent start for a story and I'm interested to see where it goes.
