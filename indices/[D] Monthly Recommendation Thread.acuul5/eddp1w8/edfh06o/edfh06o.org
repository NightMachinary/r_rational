"Predicably Irrational" by Dan Ariely. A book I think a lot of rationalist interested people would enjoy. It's about all the various ways in aggregate you can predict how people will behave in ways that aren't logical, and the reasons why they do so. One example that stood out is that value is comparative: people trend towards options that are easier to compare to each other as opposed to unique options. It's a bit dry for my tastes and I haven't finished it, but the take aways are very interesting.

"The 48 Laws of Power" by Robert Greene. 48 basically life lessons that are supported by logic, parables, and very interesting historical examples. Good takeaways with enough variety to keep it interesting.
