protip: for ff.net, the best way to find quality fiction that's still being updated is to search

updated within six months (or less)\\
sort by follows (to get ongoinging stories instead of oneshots)

And then you can filter based on character and genre. "Adventure" is the best way to filter out fluff fics and angst fics, Romance gets you exactly what you think it'll get, the OC tag is useful if you're looking for SI fics, etc.

For AO3, the process is similar, except you'll want to use "kudos" as your quality filter. If you use the "search" bar and "edit search", you can put in, for example, ">20 kudos" to look for works above 20 kudos. The one big issue with AO3 is that you get the crazy huge omnibus fics that include dozens of fandoms and hundreds of tags, but you can mostly get rid of those with the "exclude crossovers" radio button. Aside from that, you'll want to be looking at the tags used by fics you like there, so you can click through other works using those tags.
