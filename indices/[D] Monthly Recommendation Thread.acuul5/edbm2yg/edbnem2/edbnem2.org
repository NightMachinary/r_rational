The obvious rational ones for me: Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, The Metropolitan Man (Superman), Luminosity and Radiance (Twilight), Friendship is Optimal, The Waves Arisen (Naruto), A bluer shade of white (Frozen).

Not rational but still great: Seventh Horcrux (Harry Potter), off the top of my head (sorry, I don't read many fanfictions so I can't really come up with many more names).

On this website: [[https://ficdb.com/]] there's a nascent aggregator community for fanfiction, with reviews and all. Give it a try!
