- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][/Time Braid/]] (/Naruto/): Sakura gets caught in a time loop centered on the Chuunin Exam. (My favorite story. People like to whine about its intermittent lewdness.)\\
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6207715][/In the Blood/]] (/Naruto/): Post-series, (1) a young clone of Itachi appears out of nowhere as a peasant in a random farming village, prompting fears of an Orochimaru or Kabuto backup plan, and (2) Sasuke is a bad father to the renascent Uchiha Clan. (Probably my second-favorite fanfiction story. Includes a ludicrously-extensive set of author's notes.)\\
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8440324][/Little Moments/]] (/Ben 10/): Between the original series and /Alien Force/, Ben and Gwen gradually fall in love.\\
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4307536][/Rewind/]] (/Ben 10/): Charmcaster removes her own powers and puts herself in a time loop in order to get close to the Tennysons, with the ultimate aim of murdering them.\\
- [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/3784000][/The Scarlet Pimpernel/]] (/Harry Potter/): Percy Weasley uses his position in the Voldemort-controlled Ministry of Magic to save Mudbloods and blood traitors whom Umbridge is sending to Azkaban.
