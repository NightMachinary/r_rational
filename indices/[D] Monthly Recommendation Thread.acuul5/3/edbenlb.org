*[[https://missiontozyxx.space/][Mission to Zyxx]]* is a science fiction serial podcast that consistently makes me laugh with every episode.

If you enjoy Rick and Morty, I think you will like this a lot. It's an improv comedy show that follows a Star Trek-esque formula where a multi-species crew of misfits visits a different planet each week, and after the live improv session they take the recording and create a fully-produced podcast complete with music, sound effects, and voice processing (to make the alien characters have more alien-sounding voices, and to give the robot characters more robotic-sounding voices). The sound design is really something special. The characters are lovable, the jokes are funny, the production value is astounding, and it's probably my favorite produced podcast of all time. Toward the end of season 1 they start introducing more contiguous plot elements, and it jumps from being just a funny show to being a narrative where you really feel attached to the characters and find yourself rooting for their success. I love this show to death.
