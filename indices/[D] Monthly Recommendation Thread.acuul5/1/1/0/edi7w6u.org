I'll dissent the dissent :P

I really liked how the book didn't go for the 'little kid fixes everything on their own because everyone else is incompetent' trope. Yeah, a lot of things happen to the MC rather than be done by him, but for me that's not necessarily a problem, especially when they're a kid. He also improved in that over the course of the book, being more willing to stick his neck out and take action once he grows to trust his teammates. Whose bonding didn't really strike me as badly written either; I'd say if anything the time it took Hugh to open up was a bit long! Kids are much faster at that than adults with close friends, from what I remember :P

YMMV, of course - if you only enjoy lead characters that completely dominate a setting (which is pretty common in [[/r/rational][r/rational]] recommendations), this won't be your kind of thing. And the writing does suffer at times.
