  Why do I have to search within fandoms rather than the whole site?
#+end_quote

Why would you want too though? I can see wanting to search multiple fandoms you're interested in at once, but the main problem I have with ff.net is that there's a whole bunch of crap I have to filter through. I don't see the point of adding a whole bunch of extraneous fandoms.

Unless you mean the search function specifically, of course, rather than the generic "search." In that case, I agree that their search function is terrible and poorly implemented, but luckily google searches are much better.

  Can you really not offer finer gradarions for filtering?

I do agree here.
