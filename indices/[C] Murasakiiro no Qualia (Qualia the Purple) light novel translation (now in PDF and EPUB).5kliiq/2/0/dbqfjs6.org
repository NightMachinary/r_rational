As someone who used to believe in New Age pseudoscience, this manga has nothing to do with that. It's still super weird and utilizes quantum phenomena in absurd ways, but I didn't get the impression that the story was intentionally spreading nonsense ideas that it expected to be taken seriously. I think it just uses philosophical discussions related to quantum mechanics to tell a weird sci-fi story, though I thought it started going downhill after the major character death and never finished it.
