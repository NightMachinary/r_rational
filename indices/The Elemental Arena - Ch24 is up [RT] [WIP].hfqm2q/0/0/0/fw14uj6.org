Okay, I /think/ I can see what Maya's up to. Here's a quote from the Guide early in the story (most relevant in *bold*):

#+begin_quote
  /[The main arena trials have begun. There are a total of three phases. The objective for passing phase one is for your species to defeat the third floor dungeon boss in your starter zone 14. You are limited to five day and night cycles for your species to complete the task, thus unlocking access to other zones in region 4 and beginning phase two. *All species in your starter zone who fail to meet the objective within the time limit will be terminated.*]/
#+end_quote

Maya has noted that /Group Leader I/ skill shares kill credit among all members of a group. She wants to recruit other species to form groups with humans so that all participating species get kill credit and can advance. If a multi-species group takes down the dungeon boss, the cooperative - with all participating species - can win.
