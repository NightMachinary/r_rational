These were my thoughts exactly. Nowhere in the given rules did i remember reading that only a single species was able to pass. I dont know why everybody started latching onto that so quickly; it could very easily have ended up screwing over the entire human effort to pass the trials. Weve seem that kill credit is awarded for participating in a battle. No reason all species in the zone cant accomplish that together.
