Regarding item #5: I've been wracking my brain trying to think of why Maya would think she'd have any traction at all with rival players. None of this sounds very convincing to me, but here goes:

- A ceasefire might work for a day or two if a rival species is already in active conflict with a bigger threat.

- Post-Arena concessions to a species /might/ lay groundwork for more robust cooperation. The contestants are slated to rule their species if they win.

- Pre-existing rivalries or enmities may open the door as well. If a species or two is absolutely hated, others may cooperate to make sure they don't win.

- Even if diplomacy fails, learning another species' language would allow you to read the wristband interface of captives. If you luck out and capture one with /Maps/ skill, you immediately get access to the number and disposition of that entire species. An enemy with Nathan's skills would provide /Equipment Fusion/ recipes and /Compendium/ entries. Any enemy will have their entire log stored, which would allow discovery of additional skills, especially those unlocked by player action.

This last opportunity makes a lot of tactical sense, but is difficult to write in a way that keeps a reader engaged. It'd boil down to making a player use a skill to the detriment of their team, which seems to be contrary to the spirit of gaining a skill.
