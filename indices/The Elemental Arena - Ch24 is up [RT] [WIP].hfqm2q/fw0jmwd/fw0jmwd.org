Elemental Arena thoughts! Long post incoming:

â€‹

1. So help me you mouth breathers if you don't have a leader by morning I will climb into your imaginary world and whine at you myself. You are all smart people! You have just had the delightful experience of literally trying to decide on a plan while under fire. Learn from this. Every human organization that accomplishes anything is a hierarchy. Make one. A bad plan now beats yada yada. 7 billion lives are on the line, and you are letting each person individually try and guess what the best build is? Nate has to ask around to find out what synthesis results so far are? The mind reels. Shape up!
2. The night time hours, when you are guaranteed that no monsters will attack, strike me as super precious (assuming tonight works like last night, natch). Splitting up at any other time increases the total number of monsters incoming, but as long as you don't stumble on one of their miniboss dungeons it should be possible to travel in relative safety right now. Depends on how far away they are, of course, but I think losing 1-2 hours of sleep for the gang would be worth it if in exchange you were able to link up with a larger team.
3. Once the day starts and the monster attacks begin again...it may not be optimal to keep absolutely every one together. I expect that's what's up with those 3 at the other camp. You get more exp the fewer of you that there are, so I imagine you want something like a camp with all the noncombat people and a few combat folks to manage the hourlies and make sure all the crafters get their chance to contribute. Then, separately from that, you want as many small teams of combat specs as you can get away with each getting their own spawn and hoovering up experience. Collapse as important encounters or other player signs are sighted.
4. As far as skills go...my only real thought here is that the end of day battle made it seem to me like melee combat is just about over with. They did a number on the frogs and guths alike with their bows, and if they'd had all 3 of them I think the boss fight would have been a walkover. The frogs are sentient, no chance they don't adopt missile techniques (their jumping mobility and that terrifying stealth stuff will make their archers pure hell), and I bet the guths start getting archers as well. If I were in the team's shoes I'd prioritize defense and ranged techniques, in particular the hope is to learn a technique that blocks ranged attacks, so you don't end up in the frog's shoes, like 'look an arrow just sprouted from one of our guy's eyes.'
5. As far as the Languages thing goes, I doubt we'll get much love from the captured frog. Ultimately the frogs are in our boat, right? Only humanity or their kind can persist, zero sum game. Any cooperation we managed would be in the shadow of both sides expecting the other to betray them, and thus incented to strike first. I do like the idea, however, of using the game system's language to try and speak with the Guths and other monsters who are just free roaming, not spawned to attack in the hourly rushes. They showed emotion in the battle, so they may be sentient, and they aren't trapped in the same 'one of our species will persist' bind that we and the frogs are. Even them just gossiping about the system could be crucial.

Anyway, very glad to see that this is updating again. Thanks to the author!
