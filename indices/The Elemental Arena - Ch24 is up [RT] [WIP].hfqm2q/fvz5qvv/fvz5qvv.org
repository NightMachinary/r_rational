/Synthesis/ opens up a lot of possibilities.

- I'd like to see Iliya combine /Monster Harvesting I/ and /Thrust I/ to make her an efficient harvester of bear meat. While this sounds silly, food has been enormously limiting for Team Humanity. Eliminating gathering time means more time to travel or pursue other important goals.

- Emma may gain a greatly enhanced healing skill by fusing /Advanced Healing I/ and /First Aid I/. Doing so is likely to result in a skill too costly to use, however. Another option would be to combine /Advanced Healing I/ with /Water Mastery I/ to focus the skill enhancement exclusively into a more powerful and less costly healing power. Emma is not known to have /Water Mastery I/, but she has a strong Mental stat, and is very likely to have it unlocked.

What ideas do you all have for unique skill combos? For reference, here's the [[https://elemental-arena.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Skill][Skill List]] and the [[https://elemental-arena.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Character][Character List]].
