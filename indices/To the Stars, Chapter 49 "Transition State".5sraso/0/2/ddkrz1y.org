For me, the most notable thing about TtS is that it's highly enjoyable despite having a heavy component of military SF. I was lukewarm about all the military SF I have previously read, because they were always some combination of

- Trying to reflect on contemporary war. This bores me to no ends; most things about this can be and have been said outside science fiction, better and more concisely.
- Being utterly dumb. The more honest-to-God military SF that is meant to be fun without excessive social and moral awareness tends to be just banal, having the bare minimum of trashy characterization and the kind of machismo that I don't enjoy at all. The worse kind of socially aware military SF ends up being dumb by playing straight the usual tropes about military disfunction.

In contrast, TtT was a breath of fresh air (more like a month's worth of supply of it). It features a critically important and meaningful war (against existentially threatening aliens) with a human army that is hypercompetent and also morally advanced, compared to current state of affairs. In TtS you won't find armored dudes being dropshipped to certain death, while shouting incomprehensibly to each other basically through /modern day radio/. Rather, in TtS everyone is competent enough to be at least a decent general, and there is a lot of exploration of military optimization which is inherently fun to read about. Also, the aliens won't swarm out of holes, engaging in usual zerg melee, rather they are perfectly willing and able to nuke even a group of /five/ humans when it makes sense.

As an example of TtS standards, there's at one point a very important spec ops mission, and it's planned by first simulating it hundreds of times by AI-s, then simulating it a number of times with the involvement of the operatives, then simulating it a number of times again with the involvement of the operatives, but with the operatives' memories modified so they believe it to be the real mission, but in a way so that they don't learn to doubt the mission being real when it's real. Only after that do they actually go on the mission. And the actual mission is an absolutely fantastic piece of SF action, densely packed with twists and delicious high-speed tactics.
