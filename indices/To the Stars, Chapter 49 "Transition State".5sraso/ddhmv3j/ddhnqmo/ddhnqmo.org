I've never read (watched?) PMMM, but I've been enjoying this one for about three years. So far, it has been about as satisfying as Worm, but much less interesting per word than Ra/HPMOR. If you start reading, I would recommend making a list of characters, since some characters will disappear for several chapters (and all their names are Japanese!) I stopped reading when the author went into haiatus about a year ago, and now I'm hopelessly lost.
