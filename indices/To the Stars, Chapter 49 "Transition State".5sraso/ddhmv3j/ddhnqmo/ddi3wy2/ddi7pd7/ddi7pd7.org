There is actually a [[http://tts.determinismsucks.net/wiki/Main_Page][To the Stars wiki]]! However, sorta stop being updated in the mid-30s chapters... I should probably update it myself sometime. However, if it's the early stuff you're forgetting, that's relatively well documented there.

I can't guarantee perfect accuracy there, either, not having looked through it too closely, but a fair portion was either written or checked by Hieronym, the author.

Edit: Actually yeah, I'll commit to working on this, at least on writing some sort of summary so people can catch up or remember things. Will require some time, however.

Edit: As you can see in the wiki's recent changes page, I have been working on it. Some distance to go, though.
