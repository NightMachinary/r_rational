I read it first without watching PMMM. This story is set ~400 years after the show, and mostly involves original characters, so it stands on its own.

(Some background details about existing characters are implied, rather than stated, but that actually enhances the story in some ways. PMMM ends up feeling like a really cool (and unexpected) prequel if you end up watching it.)

The "rational" elements of this story are different than many you see posted here, though. There isn't a core character or characters which are constantly thinking hard reshaping the world around them through thought and plans, like HPMOR or Metropolitan Man. It isn't "girl munchkins Madoka Magica". Rather, the entire /world/ is a cool, rational, and expansive take on what might happen in the distant future after the end of the show. (That is probably being unfair to the examples I listed, but the point is it's more about the world than specific characters driving the plot through their own unusual "rational" view. And that's not to say characters act irrationally.)

Anyway, here's the promotional blurb from the subreddit if you're interested:

  Hieronym's "To the Stars" is an expansive SciFi fanfic set in the universe of Puella Magi Madoka Magica, roughly four centuries after the ending of the show. (Rebellion was released after it began, so the movie isn't considered canon.)

  "To the Stars" emphasizes worldbuilding, giving diverse and richly detailed views into a humanity shaped by centuries' worth of magical interference and technological development. Of particular interest are the last two decades and their new alien threat, which finally forced magical girls out from the shadows. Against that backdrop it all begins when Shizuki Ryouko, a young girl living in Mitakihara City, makes a contract and finds herself thrown into a mad mix of interstellar politics, religion, conspiracy, and war...
