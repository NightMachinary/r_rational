It's like Dune in scope/setting, except with magic that follows some consistent rules so it's not stupidly OP despite the characters being rational.

I like the story mainly because of the post-scarcity society which the author imagined, where benevolent AI run the government and mental health/psychiatry is a big deal. But I'm a sucker for world building in the stories I like.

The source material is a classic and excellent anime in its own right, but aside from the (essentially immortal) characters being the same, there isn't much linking the anime to this story. You do benefit from consuming the source material though, especially in understanding how the magic system works.
