Self-hypnosis and similar techniques of auto-delusion all require you to tell yourself things that are not true. And you can't do that anymore. Trying too much of this sort of thing would just mean progressively stripping yourself of all your illusions as you invite the magic ever deeper into your psyche. I leave it to you if "Perfect self-knowledge by friday" is a sensible goal.
