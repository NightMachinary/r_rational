  It is said that if you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles; if you do not know your enemies but do know yourself, you will win one and lose one; if you do not know your enemies nor yourself, you will be imperiled in every single battle.

Looks like I'll be half way to invincibility in battle by Friday, then.

Alternatively, I could hire a hypnotist to change my mind for me. I may not be able to lie to myself, but if I simply tell myself that I chose this path, I should be able to stay on it, even if I don't know where it leads at the time.
