  You can no longer speak with deceptive intent.

In that case, use sign language or body language to deceive people.

  Nor are you compelled to talk to people -silence is always an option.

What's the reach of this effect? Can it work over the phone? Through writing? Through a video?

Don't tell anyone that you can't lie, or you will be taken advantage of. Get people you trust to lie for you. If someone asks you if you are able to lie, look really busy and preoccupied and do not answer. Most people are not going to believe that you have this weird superpower/hindrance going on unless someone asks you on public television.

People are compelled to believe you are telling the truth as best you know it. You can use this. People will be more willing to trust you if they always think you are being honest, which means you can give them advice and point out when they're doing something stupid, and they'll believe you.

This is assuming that the compulsion actually works. Can people resist the compulsion?
