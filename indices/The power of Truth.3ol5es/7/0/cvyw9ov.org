Body language deception works, but is limited - if someone bursts into a room and asks where Martha is, you can point them in the wrong direction and that will work. ASL.. counts as speaking. Saying one thing and communicating something else somatically, will just result in people believing what you said, and also consider you a weirdo. I suppose you could use this for very effective comedy if you have talents in that direction. Re: resistance. No. They are not compelled to believe you are right, but the primary effects are symmetrical - you cant be deceptive, and people consider the fact that you are being honest a self-evident truth.
