Problem is that just because they believe you doesn't mean they don't also still believe in whoever they'd have voted for instead. That and it is hard to get campaign funding when you can lie to neither your sponsors nor your constituents. All a reporter has to do to blemish you is ask you about one of all the shitty things you had to do to come to office. Your awkward silence will be damning as hell.
