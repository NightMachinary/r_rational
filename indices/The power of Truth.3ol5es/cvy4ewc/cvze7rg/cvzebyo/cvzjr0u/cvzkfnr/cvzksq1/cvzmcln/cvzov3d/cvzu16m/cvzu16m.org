.. "Quite a few". Money is much less important outside the US. Even in the US.. well, people do still sometimes get elected without selling out first. In this particular case, you have a unique resource, which should generate attention for free - How attractive it makes you to voters depends on who you are, but the average person doesn't have massive skeletons in their closet which they would absolutely need to hide to get elected. So, yhea, getting elected to some office ought to work. Being effective once there?
