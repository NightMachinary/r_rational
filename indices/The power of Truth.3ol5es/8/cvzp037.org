  You cannot, however, pretend to greater certainty than you actually possess.

So I can always determine my own level of confidence by trying to say "I am 75% confident" and seeing what actually comes out of my mouth? (Or binary searching to the number i /can/ say, if it's working on the "can't speak" model instead of the "changes your speech" model.)

I'd be perfectly calibrated on everything.
