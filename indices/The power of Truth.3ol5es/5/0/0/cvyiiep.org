It's always possible to be just a little bit more clear and honest. Add just one more disclaimer, so that you're understood by 99% of the audience instead of by 98%. Then there are other things you can do to get to 99.5%, and then to 99.7%. If you refuse to go from 99.7% to 99.9%, knowing that it is statistically likely that three people in the 1000 person audience will misunderstand you, have you "intended" that three people will misunderstand you, and does the tattoo therefore prevent you from refusing? (And if the tattoo allows this, why doesn't it allow you to refuse to go from 51% to 95%?)
