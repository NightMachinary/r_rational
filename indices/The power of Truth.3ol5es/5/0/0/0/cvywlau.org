Because it runs of your intent. Speaking in a way 49 percent of an audience will misunderstand means you don't give a shit about being understood, and will thus not fly. It doesn't require you to sit down and formally work out the optimal phrasing before letting you open your mouth, but if you try to actively game it like this, when you open your mouth you will find you are using which ever phrasing, you, in your heart of hearts, consider to be most likely to be understood and heard. This doesn't mean infinite qualifiers, because you bloody well know that will just cause most people to tune out .
