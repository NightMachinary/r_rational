In particular, I'm thinking of the ability to tell stories if they were clear they were stories. In the novel, a character tells the protagonist a story in "classic" Iregara style. Every other paragraph starts with a disclaimer. "It is said that the hunter looked like this." or "We might suppose that the man sought his wife for so many years."

I've just ordered a copy from Amazon just so I can go into more detail when I have the text in front of me. This should be a classic, it's a crime it's not available as an eBook.
