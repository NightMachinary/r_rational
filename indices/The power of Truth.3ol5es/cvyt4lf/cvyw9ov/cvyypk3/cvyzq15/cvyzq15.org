If I had to guess:

1. yes
2. no
3. yes, but the chance of tapping out something coherent is effectively zero.
4. yes
5. yes, but it would not be long before you realized that you had been deceived.
6. It would be clear to them that you are speaking honestly, but they would still not know what you are trying to convey.
