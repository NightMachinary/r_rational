Am I understanding this right?

The effect won't manifest if you use body language, in other words, but if you use a language that you know is a real language, you are obligated to speak truth as you best understand.

Is this the case for any language?

can you lie in morse code, when you attempt to communicate in it?

can you lie in morse code when you forget it exists and tap your foot nervously, even though you do know it is a language, because you don't mean to be communicating in morse code?

can you speak nonsense that conveys no useful information, as far as you are concerned, even if it isn't part of a language?

if you're taught a language wrong, does the effect bleed through, even though you aren't speaking it with the correct comprehension, i.e. if you were taught: all statements in english are false unless you add a not in certain, grammatically correct places, would that still convey honest intention?

Does the trueness still apply when you speak a language the listener cannot understand or when they listen in the wrong language?

If so, you'd make a good diplomat, especially if you trust your government to be honest.
