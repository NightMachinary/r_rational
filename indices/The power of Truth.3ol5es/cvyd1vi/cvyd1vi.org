Let's look at the evil side as well: Sell myself as the ultimate ad. Customers will have to convince me, then I can easily convince the rest of the world. I'm not especially robust against manipulation, so Coca Cola should easily be able to convince me that Pepsi is disgusting or harmful.

That makes for a paradox loop. If someone convincingly lies to me and I repeat it back to him, Will he believe his own lie?
