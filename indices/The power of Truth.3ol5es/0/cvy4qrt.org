I would become a news reporter or political commentator similar to Jon Stewart. Everything I say would be considered to be truthful, often funny/entertaining by revealing what others leave unsaid, and I'd be able to exercise an incredible amount of influence over state/national discourse.

If I could figure out a way to tattoo others and compel them to speak truths as well, I'd start a movement to have all public speakers pre-commit to receiving the tattoo before they address large crowds. Before receiving a tattoo, they'd have to take courses in logic, rationality, and they'd be tested for delusional tendencies as well as their ability to admit when they are wrong. The process for receiving a tattoo of truth will be open for revisions via a democratic forum and all of the tattooed will publically renew their vows on a yearly basis to adhere to the Principles. I think this will go far towards creating a group of reliable leaders.

Granted, someone could fake a tattoo and if everyone in the world has the tattoo... then we're in the Invention of Lying territory. Hm. I don't know how to prevent that from happening.
