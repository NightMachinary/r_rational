Your assertion that money doesn't matter and Internet is all you need runs counter to most of what I know about the election process in the USA. Could you please provide names of politicians who have gotten elected purely on the strength of YouTube and public speaking, without spending more money than a member of the 99% could afford -- let's say $10,000 to be very generous.

  Money is much less important outside the US

Oh, we're assuming this isn't a US election? You didn't say that at first. Okay, I don't know anything about non-US electioneering so I'll go with it. It still seems dubious, though.

  Even in the US.. well, people do sometimes get elected without selling out first

I'm confused. Before, you asserted that "You don't really need money to get elected", but now you seem to be implying that it's very rare. Given the prevalence of millionaires in federal office I suspect that anyone who /does/ get elected to high office without taking outside money did so because they had plenty of their own.

Are you talking about only local offices, maybe? Small town mayor, town council, that sort of thing? Because that I would definitely agree with.

Even the mayorship of New York or other major city isn't a cheap campaign.
