It gradually gets better, and yeah, those are legitimate character flaws that end up biting Milo in the butt repeatedly. This can be amusing, but I'd agree that it does require a certain familiarity with the 3.5 ruleset and common D&D playstyles to actually be entertaining.

It's not unlike OotS. Starts out more jokey, develops plot, quality upgrades throughout, and rather D&D themed.
