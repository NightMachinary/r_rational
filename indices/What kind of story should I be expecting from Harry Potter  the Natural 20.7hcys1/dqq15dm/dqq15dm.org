It's only a comedy insofar as it is funny, but that is a consequence of taking the premise seriously and playing it straight. Milo is a rational actor insofar as he is acting on is own knowledge, understanding of how the world works in his experience, and the application of his own abilities to facilitate his goals (which is to amass gear and XP to become as broken a wizard PC as possible).

He does update his expectations and behaviour as he learns more about the world he is in, but will always operate on the terms of being an RPG character. And player characters, especially minmaxing munchkins like Milo, rarely consider the words or even existence of an NPC beyond their ability to dispense quests, quest information, quest items, and quest rewards. That makes sense in his world, as will become clear, and learning that things work differently in his new location requires a significant paradigm shift, so don't expect Milo to exhibit fast or fantastic progress on that front, but do expect progress.

Remember: he is not a human because of his biology and genetics, he is a Human because that's what it says on his character sheet.

What you will see is a character solving problems and plot points in Harry Potter utilising the 3.5 Ed DnD rules, which he physically operates on every moment, and all the unique advantages and disadvantages that entails. The consequences also play out rationally, which by the third book this has resulted in some significant departures from the regular Harry Potter story line, including an excellent sideplot involving badass-normals who, like Milo, must also learn about and deal with Potterian magic, only with 1980s muggle tools instead of die rolls and prepared spells.
