It's not really a rationalist fic. Milo is rational, but his rationality is based on the world he lives in. His genre savviness applies surprisingly well to the world of Harry Potter, but it wouldn't work in real life. In his world, understanding what the DM is hinting at is the key to getting things done. And munchkinning helps a lot, so long as you don't go too overboard with it.
