Half of my Calculus II class failed our first test. The professor is unfortunately dull and error-prone, and the only students who have A's are those on their second and third attempts. There is no curve whatsoever. I don't know for certain if I can pass this one and I have to decide to drop it or not next week. I've never been in this situation before. Any advice?
