I am halfway through Elon Musk's biography, and am finding it super interesting. I love how he boiled his moral compass down to "make humanity safer and smarter" (paraphrasing). He's not just in this to make a quick buck or be famous (although he does like being those things very much), he's genuinely aiming for a net-positive impact on humanity. I'd greatly suggest it to anyone who wants to know what that crazy guy making the rockets and electric cars is really up to.
