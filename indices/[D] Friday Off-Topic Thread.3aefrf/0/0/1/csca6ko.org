Didn't Rebecca Sugar work on Adventure Time before she made Steven Universe? Steven Universe is less random than Adventure Time, but it's also more... heartfelt? Like, if the core appeal of Adventure Time is unexpected weird-but-consistent plot, the core appeal of Steven Universe is heartfelt emotional appeal.

The first few episodes of Steven Universe are pretty slow, though. I'd probably skip Gem Glow and Laser Light Cannon and start with Cheeseburger Backpack; that one's a pretty solid introduction to the core characters, and there's not a lot of backstory presented in the first two episodes that you can't get from just watching further episodes. Just my opinion.
