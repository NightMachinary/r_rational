You can break the game with it, yes. Intelligence potions make you better at crafting, which makes you better intelligence potions, and so on. Eventually you have more intelligence than you'd ever be able to get without console access, and you can make potions that do other things.

The Morrowind Singularity lets you have (nearly) infinite health regen, (nearly) infinite mana regen, makes you essentially invulnerable, and can boost your strength so high that you can kill a god with a single thrust of a rusty knife.
