There's been much speculation about a technological Singularity, the most popular form of which seems to be via strong GAI- which is something experts in the field aren't sure could be achieved in our lifetime. So I'm curious about another route that I haven't heard mentioned before which is inspired by the Morrowind Singularity ("Drink intellect enhancing potion: craft another, better, intellect enhancing potion. Repeat until incredibly intelligent") path.

Specifically, this would take the form of advanced computer techniques/infrastructure which allow us to design better drugs (this process currently relies on computers [[http://molpath.ucsd.edu/PDF/HuangLecture.pdf)][frequently]]), so-called "rational drug design". Better nootropics (drugs that increase aspects of intelligence/memory/focus, etc. but which currently are nowhere near, say, the potential seen in Limitless) in conjunction with other technologies like transcranial magnetic stimulation [[http://www.technologyreview.com/news/410389/want-to-enhance-your-brain-power][(TMS)]] will in turn allow us to develop better computer design and keep this cycle going.

Obviously this is all completely theorycrafting, but I'm just curious what this group thinks of the likelihood of this particular theory and other avenues of human progression.

TLDR- I'd love to hear anyone else's thoughts on the Singularity in general and their estimation of likely routes/probabilities in particular.
