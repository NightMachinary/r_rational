There are pretty big pros/cons and difficulties to be solved for both of these avenues (eg, AI could immediately become an existential catastrophe, no one really has any theoretical understanding of how it could be done yet, etc.). I'll admit that in their ideal form, I think uploading or GAI are far superior to biological intelligence explosion. However, as I said in my original comment, the reason I focus on that more is because I think it's far more likely in the short-term, although ideally it's just a step on the road to a digital singularity.

Edit-

The pharmaceutical industry is a massively funded sector and especially in the last decade with computer-assisted design there are a lot of promising starts out there, just like TMS has had encouraging results. So we just need to start a cycle of rational design giving us drugs to assist with hardware/software design to give us better rational design. Basically, I see that route as already in progress and fairly well understood or at least with a clear path to that understanding.

Meanwhile, there are some very intelligent people working on AGI but every paper I've read seems to imply that there's no real theoretical underpinnings that lead to AGI and my own (layman) experience with AI seems like they're accomplishing most of our very impressive modern results with training methods (deep learning, supervised learning, etc.) which don't lend themselves to anything more than specialized AI. So while I'm sure that there will be breakthroughs, it seems pretty unpredictable- most expert opinions I've read on AI say it could be decades or centuries or impossible.
