Sorry, layman. Your first sentence makes sense to me, and I looked up [[http://www.research.ibm.com/articles/brain-chip.shtml][TrueNorth]] but honestly beyond the fact that it's somehow a tremendous improvement and based on neuronal functions somehow, I'm not sure how this affects things. And this chip could run "massive parallel perception," which seems to refer to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism#Parallel_distributed_processing][parallel distributed processing]] (this time, software architecture based on neuron model)?

So I'm guessing you mean that these chips/software based on neurons somehow represent a significant increase in our ability to allow computers to "understand" complicated things? Which seems like it would be half the problem, the other part being designing the software to use that understanding for general purposes?

Edit: I'm sure that hurt to read, so again, my apologies.
