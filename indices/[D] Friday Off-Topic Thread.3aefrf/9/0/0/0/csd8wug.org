  (deep learning, supervised learning, etc.) which don't lend themselves to anything more than specialized AI.

Not so. They lend themselves to perception and classification, which can then be attached to more symbolic models of AI, if we don't figure out how to represent more computational reasoning in neural networks themselves. The TrueNorth running massively parallel perception attached to a more conventional hardware design, ARM or x86_64 or something, could be incredibly powerful. The simpler it becomes to construct perceptual and conceptual systems, the closer we get to self-directed AI.

And supervised learning isn't itself a training method, it's a class of training methods that require supervision. There is still work being done on unsupervised learning, which might lead to a more general kind of perceptual system.
