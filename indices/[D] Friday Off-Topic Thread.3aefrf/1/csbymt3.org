There's a group on Facebook (which I help moderate) called [[https://www.facebook.com/groups/rational.transhumanism/][Rational Transhumanism]]. Has weekly Off Topic Tuesdays, otherwise posts should be directly related to Transhumanism. Basically, it's a walled garden for non-troll, non-pseudoscience transhumanism stuff.

I also have a few small groups: [[https://www.facebook.com/groups/replicatingrobots/][Replicating Robots]], [[https://www.facebook.com/groups/1609409269315330/][Dyson Sphere Enthusiasts]], and [[https://www.facebook.com/groups/industrialtranshumanism/][Industrial Transhumanism]]. There is also a low-traffic subreddit at [[/r/replicatingrobots]].
