  First question: How far does this go? Is your entire belief structure ethnocentric?
#+end_quote

Probably not all of it, but I don't see a reason to believe my beliefs aren't determined by my heritage when Indo-Europeans rule much of the planet, and IE languages are used almost all of it. There are all the religious parallels, and some harder to identify but no less present cultural parallels which stand out all the more when very different cultures are still around.

  Second question: How do you determine the difference between a belief that's generally right for humanity and a belief that only seems right because you grew up a Caucasian Agnostic woman from the East Coast?
#+end_quote

Look for beliefs that everyone shares regardless of language family (as a proxy for their heritage). The only absolute constant I can see is "don't murder." I believe private property is also a common trait. Things like "how close of a cousin is too close?" have a different answer depending on who you ask. I don't believe that "first" is the right answer, but I acknowledge there are people who disagree. If possible, try to learn about older cultures or forgotten traditions: it may be useful today even if it didn't make the cut before. One such belief I'm wondering about now is monuments. I (I would say we, but I do not know your heritage) know that my ancestors, or the people who lived in that area, believed that megaliths were important because they built a lot of them. What if we had that same passion for monumental achievements?

  Third question
#+end_quote

Well, we've got many different tribes. There's probably space for all of us, but I don't see why other tribes have any inherent worth if their customs are barbaric and they aren't in a position to argue. It seems that foreigners didn't have legal rights in IE (or at least early european) law, so that's a sign that my belief is in line.
