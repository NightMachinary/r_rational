Perhaps you should interpret the similarity of the abolitionist tracts as a sign that slavery moved, as culture changed, from right to wrong. The abolitionists' position clearly didn't move. Consider you, your descendants, and your ancestors. Every pair will probably find each other abhorrent. How can you say your own beliefs are right now, if their beliefs aren't right at their times?

edit: Of course, should these two beliefs exist /at the same time/ they're not both valid at once.
