For me, it always comes back to slavery. Every time it comes up that so-and-so was a slave holder, people say, "Oh, well it was different back then". I hate that. It feels incredibly intellectually dishonest to me.

The arguments against slavery weren't any different back then. You can read anti-slavery tracts from hundreds of years ago, and they're substantially similar to what you'd read today if it weren't just common knowledge that slavery is wrong. [[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Memorial_Against_Slaveholding][My ancestors wrote this one.]] Yet there seems to be this societal impulse to simply forgive people of other cultures who are looking at the same lines of logic and rejecting them. It might be one thing if the anti-abolitionist tracts were well-reasoned and thought-provoking, but I've read them, and they're not.

I think it's the same looking to other countries as it is looking to the past. Should I look at something like genital mutilation and say, "Oh, well it's different over there"? I don't think so. I don't think the lines of logic (or the starting axioms) are defensible. This is especially true in the case where the argument is, "This is our way of life," which is often the case. Claiming that something should continue because that's just the way it's been is terrible, circular logic that somehow people keep falling for.

Your belief system is always going to be somewhat of a reflection on how you were raised, but I think if we're striving to be rational, then we should also be striving to make sure that our beliefs are as universal as possible - and I think that in general, that leads us away from ethnocentrism.

The question of /what to do about it/ is a more complicated question. The biggest issue is that the solutions are often worse than the problems, which is a sign of stupid solutions. Sending in an army is usually pretty terrible. Trying to enact stiff penalties will often result in a wildly out of control unregulated black market. Generally speaking, I think the solutions should be rooted in information and industrialization. If your logic is better than /their/ logic, then your logic is going to win out over time, especially once you've shown /them/ the right ways to think. (Where right is defined by being the ways that result in success, and which are belief-system agnostic.)
