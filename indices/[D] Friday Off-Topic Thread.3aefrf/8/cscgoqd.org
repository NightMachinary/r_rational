Based on a thread in [[/r/HPMOR]], I got curious as to how other people first got to transhumanist ideas, so if anyone's willing to share...

I'll start.

I think my first transhumanist idea was when I had to think about the future for a religion class. This happened soon after we had a debate about the afterlife (where I was pretty much the only one who believed there wasn't one), so I put something in the assignment about me becoming immortal. During the debate that followed the assignment, I noticed that not everyone seemed to think that not dying was a good idea, but they didn't seem to have good arguments to back that up (which is probably to be expected from 15-year-olds, but still).

Soon after that, I got really into vampires. Most resources I found online seemed to claim downsides to being a vampire that could be worked around and you'd still have all the cool powers and the whole not dying thing.

It was some time later that I got active in online communities and actually learned that transhumanism was a thing other people had thought of.
