If I had to pick just one, it would be floating islands.

I ran a campaign with post-Soviet Russia as the primary fantasy counterpart culture, and one of the balkanized countries consisted of a series of floating islands. The adventure hook was that these islands were very rich --- a relic of the upper levels of psuedo-Stalin's (here, a gargantuan red dragon) People's Party --- and in order to complete their quest, the players needed to steal from them. This took place at a relatively low level, which meant that the heist had some serious risks involved with it, like the fact that they didn't have access to rings of /feather fall/ in case they dropped. Of course, when they went to steal the item, they found that it was integral to making the estate-island actually float, which brought up some questions of whether it was even worth it, or if it was, how they would evacuate safely after removing the item. (Given that it was a crapsack world and they were sort of revolutionaries, they decided to crater the island, killing hundreds of people. They made their escape via Immovable Rod, which was this whole other thing.)
