Personally, I like the sorts of situations that can never, ever be replicated in other kinds of media, like solving an impossible problem with an outside-the-box trick or averting/causing a war by seducing and marrying the princess after rescuing her. I also love a good spell combo across classes -- nothing gamebreaking, just good old teamwork and synergy.
