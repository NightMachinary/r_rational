Considering my post got deleted, I suppose I'll try and restate my question here:

Ethnocentrism. Judging another culture by your culture's values. "Culture" being anything ranging from a value typical of your race, all the way down to a value typical of someone raised by Mr Dad and Ms Mom.

First question: How far does this go? Is your entire belief structure ethnocentric?

Second question: How do you determine the difference between a belief that's generally right for humanity and a belief that only seems right because you grew up a Caucasian Agnostic woman from the East Coast?

Third question: How does this affect your actions towards other nations (assuming you are in a position of power in a country that's also in a position of power) Do you leave countries to their own devices, and let nature take its course? Or, out of your value for human life, not just your own country's human life, do you seek to try and change things? And how do you determine how "bad" something has to be for it to warrant you attempting to change it? And how committed are you to dealing with problems that invariably rise?

Phew. Long post. Feel free to address one, or two, or all three. Or even none at all, and just give a general comment on ethnocentrism.

*TL;DR: How much of what you believe is ethnocentric? And when is it right for you to try and change other people's behaviors to fit your views on what's right and wrong?*
