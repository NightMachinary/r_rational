  Is your entire belief structure ethnocentric?
#+end_quote

I have no doubt that some of my beliefs and values have similarities with those of individuals of comparable cultures, and differ from those of individuals of different cultures, for certain given beliefs, values, and cultures. What I can't stand, however, is when this sort of idea is extended to attempt to reduce the standing of scientific findings (apart from scientific results that attempt to generalize from one specific population, like college freshman, to the population in general), which is why I normally can't stand postmodernism.

There are, however, values I would be willing to force on others, such as restrictions on ending life, prolonging suffering, and violating principles of informed consent, regardless of the cultural context. In this sense I am imperialist scum. Jokes aside, some of those sorts of things I believe could be viewed as objectively harmful, and would necessitate intervention by any reasonable society. Where the line is drawn, however, is the bigger problem.
