I just finished a campaign where it was floating cities above a desert. We managed to hold off an eldritch monstrosity by convincing Greta, the leader of the city, to flip the city onto the beast. We killed it, shot up five levels for taking on a boss we were severely underleveled for and spent te nex while getting her resurrected.
