I...don't know, because I haven't read/watched very much of One Piece. But One-Piece seems very character driven with a quest to act as the over arching plot-line while JJBA is very focused on character growth through adversary and makes incredibly detailed personalities come to life. I want to say yes that if you like one, then you'll like the other one, but I recommend reading a few chapters first and then deciding.
