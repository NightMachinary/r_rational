I double majored in CS and English. The English major has never materially helped me with work. I had some ideas about working in technical writing, but that never really materialized, given that I entered into the job market right as the economy was at its worst place. /However/, I think I'm a much better writer for having that English major, which is quite important to me independent of my ability to make money and my computer programming, and I consider it well worth it.
