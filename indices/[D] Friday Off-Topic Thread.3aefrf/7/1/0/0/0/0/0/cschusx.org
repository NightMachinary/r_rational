I'll second [[/u/eaturbrainz]] I went to a service academy, and due to some poor life choices I ended up getting a English degree after an initial double major in English and systems engineering,but I kept the engineering core including Ordinary Differentials, despite earning an appropriately labeled BS in English (pun/dual meaning intended) After leaving the jolly pursuit of arms I went back to school for my MS in computer science to get the degree I need for the jobs I want and my operational experience applies to. I have the math, and it makes the code easy or easier.

TAKE THE MATH

Postscript: I had a somewhat similar experience with a Statistics class I took while taking C Java and discreet that took up more time thjan the three others combined. I eeked a B+ out of it. Start a study group, schedule it for every day. The one thing I learned about math, actually back in HS that you learn math by doing problems, more problems, checking your work and then doing more problems. Math is a language: it requires practice.
