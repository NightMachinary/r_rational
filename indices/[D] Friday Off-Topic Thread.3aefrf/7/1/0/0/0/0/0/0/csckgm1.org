Extra note: the first time I took statistics and machine learning, I had never seen continuous probability, analysis, or optimization before. I failed machine learning, and just barely squeaked by with a 73% in Statistics 1.

After a year of studying up on background material, I retook machine learning and got an 86%, decently above the mean course grade. At the fucking Technion.

It is not just painful, failing a class. It feels like a blow to who you are. It's crushing. BUT YOU CAN FIGHT YOUR WAY THROUGH AND MASTER THAT MATERIAL ANYWAY.

Just who the hell do they think we are!? Are ours not the models that will reshape the heavens and break through history itself?!
