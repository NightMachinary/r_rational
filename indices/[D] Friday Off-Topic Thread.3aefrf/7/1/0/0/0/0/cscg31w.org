  Honestly I feel like I've been behind my whole life

Trust me, I know the feeling. You know what I did in undergrad? CS, theoretical track, no additional minors or double-majors. Finished with honors, tired as hell, in seven semesters, and that was an /achievement/ because of the fucking honors college sponsoring my scholarship dumping shitty extra requirements on me that just weren't suited to science majors.

Promptly began to realize that if I had wanted to work in functional programming or go to grad-school for PL theory, HOLY FUCK I NEEDED THE MATH. When I later arrived at grad school, THEY EXPECTED ME TO HAVE THE MATH. When I got into machine learning and computational cognitive science, and needed statistics for my MS thesis work, HOLY FUCK I NEEDED THE MATH.

I'm 26 and only just now learning the math I really should have bothered with as an undergrad (albeit, after finding some weird way to do without the damned honors college scholarship). Now I'm having to do extra studying outside my job to /catch the fuck up/, and am still only up to BSc+MSc Comp Sci with a minor in Statistics. In order to /actually/ do the kinds of stuff I want to do, I need to work my way up substantial parts of the Math major tower (at least: real analysis, topology, abstract algebra), learn several postgrad-level math subjects (logic, I'm slowly picking up bits of category theory, already learned type theory, domain theory), and learn a couple more postgrad-level Comp Sci and Statistics subjects (algorithmic information theory, slowly learning computational Bayesian statistics). /Then/ I can start to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGazKDWPjf8][summon awesome forces.]]

TAKE THE MATH.
