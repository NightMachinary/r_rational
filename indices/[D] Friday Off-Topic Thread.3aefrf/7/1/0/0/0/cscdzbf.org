I don't need to ace it; the grade distribution just works out that way.

I was planning on swinging by a math minor, actually. I'm not sure I could handle a double major while doing things like interning and stuff. Honestly I feel like I've been behind my whole life -- I don't think I've aced a math class /ever/ and my first real class was algebra in the eighth grade, and I basically skipped pre-algrebra.
