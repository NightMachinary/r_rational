If there are that many people failing the class and repeating, I think something might be wrong with the prof. What are you aiming to do that needs calc 2? Anyway, I'd say you should just try to get out of the class with a /decent/ mark, since Calc 2 is really more "memorize these integrals" stuck in-between "HEY THERE'S THESE DERIVATIVE AND INTEGRAL THINGS" (calc 1) and "WE CAN DO THESE IN VECTOR SPACES TOO" (calc 3) before you move on to "LOOK AT ALL THE THINGS WITH VECTOR SPACES" (linear algebra) to round out something remotely like an engineering or CS math curriculum, or possibly go on to, "For those of you who survived, we will now teach you exactly how calculus actually makes sense underneath, rigorously" (real analysis) and the rest of math-major math.
