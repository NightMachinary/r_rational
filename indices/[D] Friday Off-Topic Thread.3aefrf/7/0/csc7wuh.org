If you've been assigned an academic adviser, go talk to them. If you haven't, your college/university probably has an academics office where you can talk to someone who has probably encountered this sort of thing before, and has experience handling it.

What you should do depends on how important Calc II is for you. If it's a vital part of your major, you're going to have to take it; in that case, you might want to see whether you can take Calc II from a different professor at a different time. Some core classes like that will have professors rotate on a yearly basis. If it's /not/ part of your major(s)/minor(s), I'd suggest just dropping it and taking something better in some way. What you don't want is to fail a course, because that can leave you behind on credits and postpone graduation another half-year (and how bad that is partly depends on where in the world you are and what your finances look like).

Failing all that, you might have to put in the effort of starting a study group (ideally with some of those A students), going to get tutoring with a TA, or trying to race ahead of the actual in-class lessons by either out-pacing the syllabus or taking an online course to supplement (which isn't really ideal, because you're paying for the learning).
