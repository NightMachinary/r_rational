  I mean, if you compare our actions to that of our neolithic ancestors, most would be completely different, but some would be the same. At what point do humans and our tools become inseparable?

That's a very cool question, I agree. It's pretty common to see works where people try to "ascend" and become something else (muaha, I'm man no longer; I am a perfect machine!). I like your perspective about remaining human in spite of huge physical changes. /Humanity of the mind/, as it were, rather than of body.
