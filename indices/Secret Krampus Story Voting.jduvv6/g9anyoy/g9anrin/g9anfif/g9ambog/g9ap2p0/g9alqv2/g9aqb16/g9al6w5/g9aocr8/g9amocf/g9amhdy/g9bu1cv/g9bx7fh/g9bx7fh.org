Thanks for liking it! I was struggling to write a story, though lots of ideas and themes were floating around. Mostly "what does it mean to be human" and all that entails. I mean, if you compare our actions to that of our neolithic ancestors, most would be completely different, but some would be the same. At what point do humans and our tools become inseparable?

The drone was meant to be a sarcastic friend. "We ate them all" directly references that they are all partially human and technically descended from them (assimilated), but also joke that they are machines/robot uprising. Re:setting : humans uploaded themselves, and slowly merged with other code.

"Nothing" was meant to refer to no (evoked) emotion. The android Vic was going out to try to find their own humanity, and failed to do so. Initially was meant to be their old apartment, but that was a bit too cliche.

And even if you calculate humanity by behavior, you still need to test to see how human you remain.
