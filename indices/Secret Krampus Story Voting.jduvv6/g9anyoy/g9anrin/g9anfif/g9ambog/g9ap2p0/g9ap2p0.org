Prompt: "Once upon a time, in a land of magick and wonder, where all newborn babes are granted a unique magical gift upon birth, a child bearing an unusual gift cries for her mother's teat. She does not have the gift of mastery over fire and cold; nor does the have the power to bend light and summon darkness. She can not even bend spoons with her mind! No, her power is much more subtle than that: she can sense and craft mana at will. She's also barely a second old. Surely she'll employ her gift with the great wisdom of an infant. Surely."
