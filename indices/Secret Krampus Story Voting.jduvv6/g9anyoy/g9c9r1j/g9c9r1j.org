This is wonderful! Let me see if I got them all right:\\
- NuTrek\\
- (trashy?) romance novel\\
- SCP/men in black with just a dash of Warhammer 40k\\
- young adult adventure (or whatever you call hunger games' genre)\\
- dating sim (can I say how great it is that the alien is so alien that it is doing a different /game/ genre instead of /fiction/ genre??)

I have to say this one is my absolute favorite so far. Great prompt, greater execution!
