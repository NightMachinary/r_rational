I knew Brianna was planning something, but this became way darker than I was expecting. I'd be interested in reading this as a full fledged story. The most compelling part to me was the early stage discovery and planning. Once it all became chaotic my interest waned a bit. If it were to become a book or a serial, the end-of-loop failure states would need to have new elements to experiments being tried in order to keep them fresh. Brianna is a fascinating character, and she'd carry it well. Third person personal perspective. Thank you! [[/u/blasted0glass]]
