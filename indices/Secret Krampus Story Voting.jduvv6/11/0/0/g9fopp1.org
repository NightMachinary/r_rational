Thanks for reading, and thank you for the feedback!

Yes, he got lost in the storm and ended up landing on the other side.

>I was a bit confused at how he didn't understand the local language

On the Earth side, he'd recently moved there for work, and he hadn't yet had time to learn it. On the Luna side, people don't speak English. The former was mostly just a pretense for why he isn't surprised by his inability to understand Kauruva. I'll see what I can do make this clearer.

Hmm, they just moved them with their hands (which is why they had gloves). I didn't anticipate this being unclear. Revision forthcoming.

>as well as how he survived the landing. Is there magic involved?

Not by intention :p It was just plot armor at play there, I'm afraid. Maybe I can give him a parachute.

Is there anything else that you thought was unclear, or maybe was redundant? I'm not satisfied with the editing---I'm certain I can cut down on the wordcount more than I have. The most obvious contender is to shave off the aeroplane/flying-sequence as well as the immediate post-crash scene. Maybe I can add some words to the truck episode as well; it was supposed to show how Earthlings and Lunarians are emotionally similar and can bond, but it doesn't feel as if I actually accomplished that.

Basically, the questions I most want feedback on are:

- Where do you think I can shave off words?
- How are Kauruva's interactions with Tremain?
- Should I just cut the thylacine-fox thing? It was supposed to be a nod towards convergent evolution. Lunarians and Earthlings are genetically unrelated yet through their cooperation have converged to similar characteristics. Kind of like "A invents spear and shows to B, B tries spear and uses it to great success, B develops same motor skills as A did"---some kind of symbiosis. Thylacines and foxes are visually (and anatomically) close to identical due to similar enviromental input (primarily prey size) despite being genetically dissimilar.
- What did you think of the way the fire-plot ended? Did the fire need greater foreshadowing or greater focus?

I realize this is a lot to ask of you, so it's fine if you don't answer any of it. If you do, please be absolutely merciless---no benefit of the doubt to the author, please. Your personal impression as a reader can never be wrong.

Again, thanks for reading :)
