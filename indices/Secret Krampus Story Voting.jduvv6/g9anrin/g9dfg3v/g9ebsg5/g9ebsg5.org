Personally, the ending was telegraphed to me at "42 separate rods and pincers of varying sizes small enough to precisely operate on mini-Earth rolled along metal tracks capable of rotation through a full 360Â° in all three dimensions."

Not that that was a bad thing, as it gave the story a sense of increasing horror as it made its way to its inevitable ending.
