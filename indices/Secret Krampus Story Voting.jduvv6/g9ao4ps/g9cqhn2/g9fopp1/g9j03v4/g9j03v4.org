1) The fire felt completely out of nowhere. I still don't understand why there was a fire. It seemed to just be there to add drama and illustrate the purpose of cross-world communication.

2) I liked Kauruva's interactions with Tremain. At times you used 'said' instead of 'signed', which was confusing. Tremain having that PhD seemed to come out of nowhere a bit; he's the best pilot in the world but his PhD was in Lunar linguistics? It makes sense if he's basically an astronaut in training for first contact, but it felt off when reading.

3) The beginning felt slow to start, or at least slow to establish that there's no magic, the boys are using their arms to move the tiles, and also just what the purpose of Tremain's being there was. Was he a slavemaster? Too much of my focus was on the beginning parts, the tiles, and the boys; I guess that would imply you could shave words there. Write more about the interesting thing.

4) The thylacine-fox thing came across as 'oh, they have the same species but different names'. Yet it only added more confusion and questions for me. Just how similar are the two worlds? What is their tech level exactly? Is magic at play?

These I answered without re-reading, to convey my initial impressions as I remember them.
