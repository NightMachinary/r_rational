There's a lot of interesting worldbuilding here that's untold! If I understand correctly, the pilot made first contact by flying from one atmosphere to another? I was a bit confused at how he didn't understand the local language, and that one boy could somehow manipulate a hundred metal tiles, as well as how he survived the landing. Is there magic involved?
