Thank you! I'm glad you liked it. :) As to your question:

My prompt was about the final judgement, so I went ahead with a standard interpretation of what that would mean, aka you only receive the reward if you did good deeds.

Andrew isn't really a good person, but he's not a bad person either. He's just living a life without meaning, consuming media and games while feeling lonely and insignificant. He desperately wants something worth giving his time and energy to, something real.

Andrew passes the "test" by sacrificing his life for others, which in a way gave his life meaning. I left the reward up to the interpretation of the reader, whether he gets one or not. Personally, I think he goes to a place where he finds the truth, something beautiful, and something that was worth the sacrifice. Wherever that happens to be. :)
