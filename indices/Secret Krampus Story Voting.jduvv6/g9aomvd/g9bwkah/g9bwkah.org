Haha, I was wondering about why the President was so absorbed with his lunch and so nonchalant about the whole "cooling of the Earth" thing. I didn't catch on until he was actually addressed as Pooh! But who's the giant? And why does he produce honey in a forge? Is he supposed to be Rabbit?

I suddenly wish I'd paid more attention to the books. Anyway, I love the story, especially how expressive the dialogue was---the entire first section was just dialogue, and I think that worked very well. [[/u/TennisMaster2]]
