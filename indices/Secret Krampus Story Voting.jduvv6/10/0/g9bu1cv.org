I loved this story, particularily the part about how they calculate their human-ness as if their code was actual DNA. I suppose it sort of is, in a way. I wonder how else you could calculate one's humanity; perhaps by comparing one's actions to that of a human, see how well they match up?

I also wonder what the drone meant by "We ate them all". Does it consider itself to be a robot more than a human? Were there robots before humanity's (presumed) extinction that humanity was just integrated with (=eaten up by) or were all of the robots of the setting produced as human-robot hybrids? The drone doesn't seem to think there is a difference, judging from the reponse he gave to the flesh-and-blood sentence, but the rest of the text doesn't really give the impression that he actually considers himself human.

Anyway, I really enjoyed this one, [[/u/eniteris]]

If there is one thing I don't understand, it's this:

#+begin_quote
  They wipe the dust off the glass. Faces smile through. Nothing.
#+end_quote

What does "nothing" refer to? No emotion being invoked in our robots? No hint as to what happened to the humans? Something else. I feel like the scene is supposed to tell me something, but I have no idea what it would be. Did they come there just to see a picture of a human?
