1. we have a bit of a nazi problem (common problem for online communities nowadays, but we can't seem to properly repudiate them)
2. there is a faction of backlash against yudkowsky and the communities that have cropped up around him, in part because of 1), in part for other reasons, some good, many bad.
3. something else?? There are certainly a lot of things I like about rational fiction that I could see other people hating about it.

I could make more or more detailed guesses, but that heavily depends on the context and the type of community you encountered this backlash in, and what their prior point of contact with "rational" fiction was, all of which you have refrained from giving us.
