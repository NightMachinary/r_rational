How would having a "Nazi problem" work when the author has written Unsong? Are there any protagonists in that that aren't practicing jews? It's my understanding that Scott Alexander was jewish?

I mean I'm not saying it's impossible, but it would be weird if he had a "large nazi following" given all that...
