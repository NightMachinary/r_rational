I've been reading SSC for a long time. Never once commented. Very rarely even venture into the comments, so I can't really argue about what may or may not exist there.

But the comments sections of LOTS of websites are completely toxic. To a far far far greater extent than I'm willing to believe goes on in the SSC comments (if for no other reason than that SA /will/ ban people occasionally, which many websites don't do), and yet those sites don't get called out for "having a nazi problem" (probably because most people know better than to pay attention to the comments). And I think it's completely disingenuous to say that his actual writings or article are in ANY way pro-nazi or giving succor to nazis.

If the problem in the comments is as you describe, then a much more standard "hey if you go there, be wary of the comments section" would be a more fair warning than claiming that SSC as a whole "has a nazi problem".

Claiming that SSC iteslf, which to me, means SA and his writings, has a nazi problem is so wrong I question if you have actually read anything he has written. Like...anything. Sure, maybe the "orbiting communities" /do/, I haven't spent any time in them to know either way. But SSC itself, the blog and the author, absolutely do not.
