I don't think [[/r/rational]] was especially bad, but the Slatestarcodex culture war thread got really bad. As in people posting the 14 words paraphrased or even rarely not-so-paraphrased and getting upvoted and serious discussion. They stopped having culture wars thread so the people that liked them started themotte which is even worse.

As to why this happened... several factors

- discussion norms focused on principle of charity and steel-mannning even heinous ideas let alt-righter and crypto fascists get a foot hold. See argentstonecutters linked Twitter thread why this is a bad idea.

- Scott Alexander presents himself as left-of-center but fails at understanding and/or steel manning leftist ideas, while simultaneously doing a really strong steel-manning of far right ideas like Neoreactionary ideals and libertarian ideals even if he nominally disagrees with them. For another example his infamous “You are still crying wolf” post about Trump which explained how Trump was basically a standard Republican, not as a take down of Republicans but as a defense of Trump (even though Scott acknowledged Trump was a bad president). Because of course to Scott the real problem was that negative media about Trump made his patients feel worried as opposed to the actual bad stuff Trump was doing. Overall Scott's pattern of hot takes like this skewed the Overton Window of SSC to the right in a way that made alt-righters feel like Scott was secretly on their side.

As for spacebattles... things which are popular often develop a backlash fueled hatedom on spacebattles. For instance they had a Let's Read of Worm in which discussion of it mixed up details and mistook fanon for WoG and vice-versa and used this to justify hating on Worm more. HPMOR was immensely popular so it also got a lot of backlash hatred that failed at reading comprehension (or didn't even try the source material they hated).
