Here is what Scott directly admits to thinking about leftists, which the top post in sneerclub brings attention to

#+begin_quote
  I had always assumed most leftist groups sucked because they were primarily made of stoner college kids and homeless people, two demographics not known for their vast resources, military discipline, or top-notch management skills.

And his book reading has led him to the equally uncharitable alternative conclusion

#+begin_quote
  But S&W believe they suck because they choose to suck, for principled reasons.

Scott then goes on to acknowledge that the book fails to justify basic leftist thought since it is actually aimed at leftists, but then fails to steel man the book by considering it in the context of leftists thought.

Scott concludes with a handwavey dismissal

#+begin_quote
  I know the arguments in this space. I know people wonder “what if the benefits of utopia only go to the rich?”. Or “what if letting people have their own private visions of utopia means elites can shape the future?”. Or “when some people don't have health care, doesn't spending money on utopian visions seem irresponsible?”. Or a thousand other different things.

In which he fails to actually steel man these arguments for the purpose of reviewing the book.

From someone that is willing to steelman extremes like Neo-reactionary thought, this lack of steelmanning is a serious over sight.

And I don't think Dylan Alvarez is a leftist, I think Dylan is Scott's best take on a middle class white person becoming a radical leftist because he can't actually empathize with that line of reasoning.
