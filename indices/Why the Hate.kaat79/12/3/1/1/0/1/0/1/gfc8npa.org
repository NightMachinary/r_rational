I, too, can quote selectively.

#+begin_quote
  All of this is pretty standard commentary, both from leftists and from rightists making fun of them.

  [...]

  I have read many leftists complaining that this is what other leftists think, and relatively few leftists saying they think this -- though this could be an artifact of who I read. But S&W don't think it's straw-mannish.

And later

#+begin_quote
  There is much discussion of why work is bad, which I appreciate. I think communists are wrong about a lot of things, but when this is all over, I believe their principled insistence that work is bad and that we should not have to do it [...] will be one thing they can be really proud of.

It is no surprise that Scott does not like leftists very much, so quoting places where he expresses his negative feelings (the former) or the /authors of the reviewed book/'s feelings (the latter) are not actually demonstrating uncharitable behavior. He gives them an even-handed discussion and charitable reading /despite/ personal dislike. It wouldn't even be particularly laudable if he didn't; being charitable to things you agree with is easy.
