I never claimed my government is perfect. It too is sometimes incompetent, and sometimes makes terrible decisions. Nor is it the best in the world. It compares favourably with most nations, but there are better ran nations (Norway has probably the most competent government in the world).

But when all is said and done it's still a force of good. Life would be much worse without a strong central government. And when talking about the need for government people always talk making and enforcing laws, or about defending the nation. And those are important. But the real importance of government lies in the day-to-day bureaucracy. The making of policy on countless topics, the countless civil servants doing a thousand different things. Paying for schools, roads, parks, sewage systems, fire brigades and of course dykes.

Libertarians think you can just remove government and all of that will magically remain by the power of wishful thinking. At least that's what they say, that's their Motte. The Bailey is of course "I'm rich, screw everybody else".

  Government is by nature unintelligent and amoral. This is not a generalization from the USA, but a derivation from first principles.

That's an awfully bold statement to make with zero evidence.
