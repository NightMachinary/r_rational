You miss the point of the article, then. /Giving the government power/ is a bad idea, because the government is usually stupid and intermittently evil (or less intermittently, depending on your standards; drone strikes and CIA coups are facts of life so there's a good case).

Also, there is nothing anti-libertarian about wealth redistribution; it's anti-ancap, but libertarianism and anarchocapitalism are not synonyms. Most means of wealth redistribution have side effects which libertarianism objects to, but the core principle is compatible, hence UBI.
