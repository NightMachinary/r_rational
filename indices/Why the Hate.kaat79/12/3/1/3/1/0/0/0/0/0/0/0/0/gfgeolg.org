You did not. Of those things, only two are examples of that; decreasing tuition and paid leave. The others were all specifically structured to avoid expanding government control more than necessary. Medicare for all is in fact /less/ intrusive than Obamacare, for example. It's still not great, but the US has such a fucked-up healthcare system (created mostly by hamfisted regulation during WWII) that it's hard to change at all without large-scale action and this is better than the alternative.
