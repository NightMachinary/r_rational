  Giving the government power is a bad idea, because the government is usually stupid and intermittently evil

This is it isn't it? This is the central error of libertarianism.

Libertarianism is the bastard child of American exceptionalism. It starts with the correct observation that the US government is often incompetent and often evil. It then assumes this must be true everywhere else on earth, since after all America is the greatest nation on earth, so it's impossible for any other place to be better. And of course it can't be changed either, because America is perfect.

I come from a very different place. A place bisected by large rivers, with large swaths of land below sea level. Nearly a thousand years ago my ancestors already realized that yes, I can build a dyke along the river, but that won't be any good unless my neighbor does the same. They realized that we're all in this together and we need each other to survive.

Government can be good or evil, competent or incompetent. But it's always essential.
