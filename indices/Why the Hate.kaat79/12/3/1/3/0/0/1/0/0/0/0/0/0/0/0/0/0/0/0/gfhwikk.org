At the very least it seems dangerous to me to treat them the same way if you care about general infohazard security more than national security or the security of your organization, because then curious individuals, upon coming across information being kept secret due to being legitimately infohazardous, are more likely to assume information is restricted merely because it harms someone else's interests. One might wish that the response to that would be avoiding the information out of risk of it being an infohazard instead, but that doesn't seem very likely to me.

But in any case, even if we accept as a given that that would be the ideal course of action if possible, that doesn't seem especially relevant from the perspective of a situation in which the information is already available on the open internet, in my opinion, especially given that I (and presumably you) do not have the considerable resources a governmental organization does.

  If you're looking for a "pure" infohazard, look for the kind of info that the US classifies as soon as they can, that Russia desperately seek and then classifies, that China desperately seeks and then classifies, etc.

I'm nowhere near confident enough in my information security to risk actively searching for information powerful organizations are willing to kill to keep hidden, let alone information that itself can harm me, even if I knew where to find such information (I have a few ideas of where I'd look if I wanted to seek such documents out, but certainly no concrete sources). It's not that I'm not curious, I really am, but I know my limitations, and serious security is one of them. I'm better at the kind of thinking required than your average person, but not by nearly enough.
