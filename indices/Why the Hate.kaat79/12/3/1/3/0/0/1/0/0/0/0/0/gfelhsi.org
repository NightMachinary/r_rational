  Oh come on, that's stretching the definition of infohazard beyond all usefulness.

Not at all! If you try and think of "infohazards" by wracking your brain for things that pattern-match to creepypasta, you're probably going to draw a blank. If you instead look for places where societies take steps to control the dissemination of specific pieces of information, you can find all sorts of examples from banal spoiler warning to deadly-serious classification systems. If you only do the former and then conclude "mere information can't be /that/ dangerous" you've done yourself a disservice.

  And this pure speculation of course, but I can't really think of other explanations here.

Did you /try/?

You noticed that I linked the republished version, right? The original version used to be hosted on a site Scott directly controlled, which has since been pulled offline. Think for a moment why Scott would do that, but leave the republished version online.

"The internet never forgets" laughably overstates the case, but the blogosphere is interconnected enough that there's a good chance any given notable work is reproduced pretty thoroughly somewhere. I'll go ahead and tell you that if you really care you can still find the original out there. I nonetheless decline to link it directly. What do you think the odds are that my reason and Scott's reason are related?
