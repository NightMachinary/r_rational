  How many examples would it take?

How about a good one? Your first example that you're implying is a white supremacist is someone who is rejecting the validity of racial categories altogether, but criticizing someone else for being inconsistent in rejecting racial tribalism.

The second example is a Sneerclub link to a comment that was deleted by the moderators. I don't see the claimed line quoted in the Sneerclub thread.

The third one is a hypothetical from someone who explicitly rejects that position, which prompts discussion and counter-argument.

Honestly, if those are the best examples from the last 4 years, in a community that averages 4k comments per week, that would seem like strong evidence that the "Nazi problem" is somewhere between "wildly overblown" and "imaginary". As the saying goes, if you can hear the dog whistle, you're the dog. Would you take seriously a criticism of this community as being filled with "crypto-Stalinists" because "Trust me, you just have to decode their lingo with as little intellectual charity and as much hostility as possible"?
