  The same thing happens every few years with a different movie.

Happens to movies like the Matrix too, the prevalence of the "red-pill" meme among alt-right topics for example.

I think you are right that people don't see the work, nor analyze it critically. And that this has lead to a decline in the ability of people being able think critically (a sort of self fulfilling prophecy).

I'll reiterate my point earlier that it mostly seems like people uneducated in the topic on both sides that are shouting at each other.
