One thing I've found is that the concept of "hard men making hard choices" tends to be quite appealing to both the right wing and certain parts of the rational community; the line of thought that led to the Má»¹ Lai massacre is the same sort of thing that led to The Cold Equations or that part in HPMOR where Harry talks about using the bones of Hufflepuffs to kill people.

Often it feels like people get addicted to the concept of making hard choices, to the point where they don't realize that failure may be the best path forward.
