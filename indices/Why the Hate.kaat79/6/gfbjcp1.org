Mmm, there's a certain...arrogance that sometimes comes with "rational" fiction. Don't get me wrong, everyone has certain preferences and thinks those things are the best, but the imputations of quality to preferences can bother folks.

It certainly isn't everyone, but it's the kind of thing that can make folks touchy. LessWrong/MoR are probably responsible for a certain amount of the impression here.
