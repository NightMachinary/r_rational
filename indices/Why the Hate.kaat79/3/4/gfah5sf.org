So out in the real world I've only met three people who were aware of the /rational community, and all of them were aware of it in the context of yudkowsky's 'math pets' and that gal who killed herself after alleging abuse by a guy who was part of the bay area /rational community. Beyond that, one of those people is an up and coming engineer/project director at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and he could barely stop laughing long enough to mock Yudkowsky's ai theory institute.

I'm not sure whether my small sample size means more than lots of people on reddit, but that's my experience of people hating on the rationalist community.

As far as the actual writing goes, I think that when a story gets really pretentious and purports to do something like demonstrate methods of rationality then it has to pass a higher bar, or it is judged more harshly. Scenes like the one where quirrel reaches harry to lose, or Yudkowsky's rape play in three worlds collide, become serious black marks in those stories not because other things we read don't have those elements, but because the person writing them says they're supposed to be edifying.

Tldr: there are at least a couple reasons to dunk on [[/r/rational]]
