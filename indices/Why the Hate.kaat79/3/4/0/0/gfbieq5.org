The points you've made aren't the problematic ones. I like a lot of the ideas and methods bandied about between harry and quirrel, and remembering to lose or to appear to lose is a genuinely useful technique I've used in my own life.

But the scene itself is constructed out of painfully juvenile delusions, much like a lot of hpmor. I would relate it to an anime like Baki or a show like The Boys, where the driving force of the narrative is masculine inferiority complexes. To me, when I tried to explain that scene out of context, it quickly became apparent that the power of that scene came from exploring different facets of what it meant to feel weak as a child, and not in a healthy or constructive way. It was a weird power fantasy.

And again, it's not that there aren't other things I digest with similar constructions, but when you're as pretentious as Yudkowsky gets with HPMOR, then building your story out of weird juvenile power fantasies becomes a more glaring flaw than I view it in Supernatural or Batman.

edit: also, what you're talking about with gazing isnt what harry goes through. He's not a pledge in a frat or a new recruit with a squad, it's focused on just him. It doesn't help him integrate better with anyone, within the story it's part of quirrells plan to build him up and build him apart. The way quirrells keeps on calling him dangerous and telling everyone hjpev is the next dark lord. So there may be some value in hazing, but that is the exact opposite of what the story was doing in that scene.
