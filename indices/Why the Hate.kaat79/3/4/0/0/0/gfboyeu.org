  But the scene itself is constructed out of painfully juvenile delusions, much like a lot of hpmor.

I'm not sure how that appears in that specific scene? I mean, I get the general criticism - HPMOR owes a lot to Ender's Game, after all, which has a lot of the same traits - but not in that one, unless you mean the power fantasy is the ability to just stand there and take all that abuse without breaking down.

Then again, Harry Potter itself is a power fantasy. HPMOR still has that DNA.

  what you're talking about with hazing isnt what harry goes through

I know, but of course I haven't gone through anything quite like that, so I just used a comparison. Hazing is usually humiliation for the sake of creating bonds - those who go through it are connected by the solidarity of fellow victims sharing a common experience. What happens to Harry is more humiliation for the sake of breaking his pride, forcing him to swallow his instinct to react. The scene itself could be constructed differently or written better here and there, but as a concept I think is one of the strongest of the story, exactly because of how it pits Quirrell and Harry's philosophies one against each other, and because of the cognitive dissonance between the lesson and the way it's taught. Another one would be Quirrell's speech, in which he genuinely makes good points about unity and willingness to fight while also scarily sounding like a fascist. The only synthesis I can find for that is that the good kind of unity is the one that emerges spontaneously out of personal responsibility and willing cooperation: those who lack that ability are either condemned to be broken up and defeated, or be united against their will by a tyrant. But it's certainly an interesting moment and it does force one to engage with the reason why some "dark side" ideas are actually so fascinating and ever returning. It's not enough to say "these ideas are evil and shouldn't be spoken of!" to exorcise them: in fact, sometimes that simply means you let them creep on you until it's too late while you willingly pretend they aren't there or are just irrational ramblings of a few fanatics.
