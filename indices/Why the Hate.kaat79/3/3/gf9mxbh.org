Completely agree with this. I'd add also that a lot of these aren't preventable; the rational community enjoys "well thought out stories" and dislikes ones which are not. This is the whole point of the subreddit and should be encouraged, but it will piss off anyone who doesn't like one of the stories that are deemed as "well thought out" because to some people, this will imply that they are not "smart" enough to enjoy it (whether this is the case or not is irrelevant).
