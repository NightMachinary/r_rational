Nope, nope, you're totally right, that's where that happens.

I do really like HPMOR, there are a few good lessons to pull out of it (what do you think you know and why do you think you know it), and the way he played with the setting makes a lot of sense. I just don't like the author or the kind of culty groups that grew out of it.

All in all I prefer rational fics to rationalist fics.
