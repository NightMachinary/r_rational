  Like critiquing someone in a story or in real life for making an emotional mistake as irrational and they should never make such mistakes shows a lack of emotional self reflection imo because we are all susceptible to such mistakes, and if you think you aren't, you are likely making more of them.

I don't think that's really what the spirit of rational writing should be (this was heavily discussed some time ago when the definition of rational fiction was debated and updated). I know I have no problem having my characters make plenty of mistakes if it fits their personality and the situation. I think what really happens a lot of the time is that people find it hard to believe someone would make THAT specific mistake which also happens to be tremendously plot convenient. It's in the end all to do with suspension of disbelief. To make a recent example - in Queen's Gambit, Beth Harmon losing a match because she got hung over the night before due to her poor self control and being easy to sway and so played less than optimally is not unbelievable. Beth Harmon losing a match because she forgets that rooks move in straight lines would be, no matter how many emotions are involved - that seems something that should be so deeply baked into her brain, it's second nature.
