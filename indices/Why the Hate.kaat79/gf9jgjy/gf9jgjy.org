For transparency I used to be a regular visitor of r/ rational a few years ago, before I became a far more occasional visitor the last couple years.

A lot of the points made by others are likely true, although I can't speak to the alt-right infiltration personally.

One thing that kind of put me off the community is that there is a common culture of believing that rationality is the utmost standard to which all fiction should be held to, and some seemed to believe that the world as a whole should try and be understood through a mechanistic framework of pure logic. This used to appeal to me but as I changed I realized that this perspective was kinda irrational ironically.

The value of a story can come in a lot of different ways, and a lot of rational fiction can be bad from a storytelling perspective and a lot of irrational fiction can be great as they can create circumstances which have great emotional resonance. I think in part this dislike of this community comes from the exclusionary culture.

As a general paradigm this overall cult of rationality leads to this weird notion that other paradigms are inherently inferior. For science and an understanding of probability the rational paradigm is very useful, an openness to critique and the actual essays on cognition that Yudowsky writes are interesting to think. But swathes of the community I found had a preoccupation with rationality to the exclusion of the kind of common sense conclusion that you have to understand people as emotional, and that sometimes speaking with facts and logic without a consideration for the personal aspect of it comes across as callous, and occasionally ridiculous. Like critiquing someone in a story or in real life for making an emotional mistake as irrational and they should never make such mistakes shows a lack of emotional self reflection imo because we are all susceptible to such mistakes, and if you think you aren't, you are likely making more of them. A lot of people, unfortunately the loud vocal ones which might go to other communities, didn't think of rationality as a way of trying to overcome human's naturally irrational heuristics through careful consideration, but like spacebattles logic, the application of being smarter than everyone else to in order to become more correct, speedrun god-hood in stories and be better than others.

This problem is kinda exacerbated as a lot of the community seemed to use the mark of being a 'rationalist' as an in group, affirming these 'smart' qualities with the community and gaining a sense of identity in it. It makes sense how others outside the community would identify this sort of personal callousness and derision for anything which isn't 'rational' (often meaning 'optimally smart') and associate it with the community.

I don't think this is a fair characterization of the points which Yudowsky himself often makes on less wrong, or everyone in this community, but I do think that it is understandable how such an impression comes about.
