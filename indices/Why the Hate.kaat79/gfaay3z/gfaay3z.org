My feeling is that any idea X whose proponents say or imply X is better than other ideas from the same class attracts hatred purely reflexively from people who perceive it as a threat to themselves because they have no internal measure of self-worth, and also because some people just love to hate, and proponents of X have already singled themselves out, and so they're very prone to being targets.

Rational fiction is X, other kinds of fiction is the general class of ideas.
