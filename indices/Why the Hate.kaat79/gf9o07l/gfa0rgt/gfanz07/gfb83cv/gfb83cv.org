I think it's less that most fiction should be more like this and that more fiction /of certain specific genres/ should. Namely, the ones that depend heavily on world building and are very plot driven. Then of course it all falls down to how the work itself is presented. I do not resent the lack of consistency or logic in, say, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, because the entire thing is blatantly aiming to be stylish, over the top campy nonsense. But when something poses itself as serious and tries to get me involved in a complex narrative, that narrative better make sense (this is also, much less controversially, referred to as "good writing").
