Ya, it's super lazy. In my example the agent could have called it in, but the bad guys were monitoring communications and move their location or abandon the plan for another attempt later. They already showed in the show that the bad guys had an inside agent and had hacked the white house security systems. Or if Agent was shown to know about those things, she could have tried to confront the bad guys in the room she knew about without talking to other sources. Maybe bring some FBI friends she talks to in person. The bad guys could have had security though and ambushed them causing some deaths on the FBI side that get blamed on the main character and we are back to her foiling the assassination attempt but getting in trouble like the writers wanted.
