Oh, sure, that actually covers a large bunch of shows and books. There's also an argument to be made for how certain such stupid tropes are so common and consistent that they actively become diseducative. I recently watched a couple episodes of "How To Get Away With Murder", and if people get their notion of what the legal profession is like from stuff like that, well... let's just say they'll likely start looking at summary lynchings in a much better light.

In a lot of cases, irrationality is just a writer's lazy shortcut to creating engaging narratives without actually making the effort of working within a bare minimum of constraints. In that sense, I think it's worth criticising, because it actually does harm.

Bringing up a hot topic, but... this is something that really irked me in The Last Jedi. The movie is supposed to be about rebels fighting against a fascist Empire. Yet lots of people were entirely willing to defend the notion of a superior demanding unthinking obedience, even in the face of apparent certain death, from one of her own commanding officers, and blame the latter for not being satisfied with that, and even turning to mutiny when he thought the life of his crew was in danger. Now to me, that seems absurd. Even the real military doesn't work like that - orders can and should be explained unless there's a good reason not to. And these are supposedly resistance fighters, likely with a less rigid hierarchy. But most importantly, I would say that if you in good faith think your commander is leading you to death with manifest incompetence, you absolutely DO have a moral duty to protect the lives of your fellow crewmates. Even if that means breaking the code of whatever military you're enlisted into! And that somehow people who supposedly cheered for free thinking and resistance to power were perfectly okay with the notion of an absolute military hierarchy in which nothing but unthinking obedience is owed - a notion that in real military theory has been probably abandoned since, like, WW1 or so - is a special kind of absurd. But it speaks a lot to how the movie imagine of any military organisation is mostly that, so yeah, everyone just reads it in that light.
