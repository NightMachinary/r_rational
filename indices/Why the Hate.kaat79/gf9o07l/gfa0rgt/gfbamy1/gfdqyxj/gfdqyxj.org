I think that many genres would benefit from being more rational but some, i.e. many comedies wouldn't necessarily benefit, and given how much effort it takes to make a world truely self-consistent I can imagine many works in which the reward to effort ratio is not cost beneficial.

Game of Throne perhaps being an example of the latter. You might argue that it would benefit from a better exploration of the magic and it's strategic uses however the books are already slow in coming out and I would rather have them as they are than adding another say 20% creation time to each book.
