That's not at all what the idiot ball means. Dumb characters /should/ make dumb decisions (although just because a character isn't very smart doesn't mean that any kind of dumb action makes sense. Even dumb characters should have personalities that lead to specific kinds of actions). And obviously not every character should be a super competent genius (I'd argue that very few should be. It's hard to do in a way that isn't boring).

Carrying the idiot ball specifically refers to characters who make a dumb decision /that does not match their demonstrated characterization/ for no other reason than that the plot requires that they make that decision. One that doesn't make sense, given what we know about the character.

For example, a character who is demonstrated to be a coward, but he goes into the super spooky cabin anyways, in the absence of any other, over riding reason to do so, because if he didn't, then the story would end,
