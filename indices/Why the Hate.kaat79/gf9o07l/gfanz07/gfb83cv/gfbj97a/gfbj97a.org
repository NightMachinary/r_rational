Jojo's is exactly the type of niche genre that I agree doesn't need to be rational. But even average tv shows or normal fantasy books would benefit from having the characters behave in ways that are more beneficial to themselves and their own goals.

For example, I recently watched a show where an FBI agent uncovered a plot to assassinate the President. The agent told no one because she was afraid she wouldn't have enough evidence. So instead she tried to kill the assassin herself and got in trouble for firing a gun near the President. Makes no sense. Even if she had no evidence, the secret service takes threats seriously. She even knew the exact room number the assassin was using to snipe the president and when it would happen and being an FBI agent she knew exactly who to report to and would know that they would take it seriously and check out the room.

But luckily she was a better shot with her pistol shooting at a hotel room across a field than the sniper was with his sniper rifle firing at someone standing in the open with no cover so everything worked out....
