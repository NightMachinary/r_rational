I ran across someone basically asking to Steelman the Draka which is kind of a red flag; I was the only reply and equated it to steel-manning defection (For context the Draka series is an alternative history series where confederates emigrated to South Africa and made a racist military colony that ends up conquering the world; I'm not sure how many books it has but the future one is fighting an American derived colony the next solar system over when they develop reality jumping tech. )
