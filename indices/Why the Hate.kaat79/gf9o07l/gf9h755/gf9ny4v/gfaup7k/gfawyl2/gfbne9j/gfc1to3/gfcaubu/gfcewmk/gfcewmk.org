Hold up; did he say that? "wanting an ethnostate" != "wanting a holocaust". Just as much as "Wanting communism" != "Wanting gulags".

I don't think Facists or Communists should be banned because they believe those are optimal systems of government. If either of them say "Kill all non-my-race" or "Kill all liberals" then I would justify banning that. Is that what he said? (I don't know; he very well may have in which case I would support a ban).
