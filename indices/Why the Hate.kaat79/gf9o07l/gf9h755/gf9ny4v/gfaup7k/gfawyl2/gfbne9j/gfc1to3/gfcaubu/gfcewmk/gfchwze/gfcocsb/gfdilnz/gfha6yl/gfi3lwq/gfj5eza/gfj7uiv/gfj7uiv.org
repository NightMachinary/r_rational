But race realism isn't about reducing poverty at all. It postulates that people are more unhappy when they live in mixed communities. Why are they unhappy? Because they think race is a fundamental difference that means they can't trust people from a different race. Why couldn't they trust them? Because they're racist.

It's circular reasoning, is what I'm saying. It creates a problem, then sells itself as the only solution to that problem. If people didn't even /think/ in terms of race, the problem wouldn't exist. And if you did segregate them on the basis of race, they'd just end up splitting along new lines. Factionalism is hardly an exclusive of race divides. Superficial differences are what we use to /rationalize/ factionalism; factionalism in the end is just about bandying together to split the maximum possible amount of resources among the smallest possible amount of people. Identifying race as the one root cause of factionalism means either you're a grifter thinking the divide will benefit YOUR side, or you're an idiot. And a racist either way.

That said, my point was arguing about the differences with communism. I do tend to agree on censorship not being very good or useful. As a general rule, if certain awful ideas are uncommon enough that you can establish a solid, uncontroversial majority that's ok with censoring them, you don't /need/ to censor them - they'll only be laughed off anyway. And if they're actually getting common enough that censorship is controversial, then you already have a problem anyway that censorship won't fix. Censorship reeks of a majority losing its grasp on discourse that desperately tries to clutch to its dominance. It doesn't really work and it makes you look weak and fearful.
