It's a big difference though. Not if you take it to the extreme, then it likely becomes crazy, but a moderate communist becomes just someone trying to persuade people of their ideas, while a moderate racist... well...

Point is, the likelihood of implementing segregation without misery isn't just low, it's zero. Also the reasons for action are different. Communism may not work, but it addresses a real problem that exists independently of itself: poverty. Race realism addresses the problem of people not wanting to live together with other races, why don't they? Because racism tells them they can't. It's circular reasoning.
