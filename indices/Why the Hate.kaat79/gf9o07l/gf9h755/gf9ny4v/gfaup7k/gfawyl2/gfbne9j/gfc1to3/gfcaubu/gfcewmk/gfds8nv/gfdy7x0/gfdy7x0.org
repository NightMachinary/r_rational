It's an opinion. I just don't consider it a "political" opinion in the way we are taught to treat political opinions as deserving some basic respect and inclusion to be heard out.

Anyway, online communities being better off if those kinds if statements are banned is my opinion. It's why, despite them going over board at times, I find myself happy in forums like Sufficientvelocity.
