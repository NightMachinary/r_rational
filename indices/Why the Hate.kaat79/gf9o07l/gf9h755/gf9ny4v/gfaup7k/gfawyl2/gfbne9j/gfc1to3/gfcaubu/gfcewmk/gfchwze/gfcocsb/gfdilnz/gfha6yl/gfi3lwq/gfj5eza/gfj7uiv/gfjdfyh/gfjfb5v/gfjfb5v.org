  While Race-realism is: /Look at the poor people/ /Look at the successful immigrants who are earning more than you/ "They are the problem!"

That's not race realism, that's just nationalism. In the US, both whites and blacks have been living in the same country for centuries. But a race realist /still/ would demand segregation, even though neither group can be considered to be immigrants. The immigrant thing is much simpler: it suggests the game is zero sum, and so if someone else gets something, they must be taking it from you. It doesn't matter WHO the someone is.

  I mean if you are arguing that Race-realists care about overall happiness, and Communists about equal financial freedom then sure, I don't think that matters, the point is both are well-intentioned, and both are catastrophic when attempted to be implemented.

No, the point is that race realists argue about how race mixing lowers happiness and propose to solve race mixing. Communists argue that poverty lowers happiness, and propose to solve poverty. Neither actually really solves the problem. But in the case of communists, the problem is real. In the case of race realists, it's not, or it's created by them. Race realists are at the same level of demon exorcists, as far as contributions to society go.

  Uh, I thought your original reply was to my "political opinions should not be banned", so you meant he probably shouldn't be banned but you wouldn't call his opinion merely "political"?

I just wanted to point out that I don't think the two things are really at the same level. So if you wanted to make a distinction, you could. I'm not saying that's where the line for censorship ought to be traced, but if you did trace it there, the distinction would not be entirely arbitrary. That said, sure, Communism gets a pass for various reasons (one of which may be historical: Nazism had to be fought and defeated, Communism was a begrudging ally and then long term rival with whom however some sort of balance had to be found for the sake of not burning the planet in nuclear fire, so obviously our relationship to them is very different) that if you only went by amount of damage caused it probably wouldn't deserve. Though moderate socialism can be argued to be beneficial, moderate nazism is just less terrible than all-out nazism, but still pretty bad with no upsides.
