  I just don't consider it a "political" opinion in the way we are taught to treat political opinions as deserving some basic respect and inclusion to be heard out.

I mean I don't know about this other definition, but people are also taught to respect other cultures, even though they cut off the genitals of people, or respect other ways of raising children, even though they are physically abused, or a bunch of other things. Only the privileged take this stance, I don't expect Jews to give any respect or inclusion to people who want to continue the work of the Holocaust

I don't see how anyone could arguing that being a Nazi is not political. The Nazis were a political party and were firmly entrenched in any place that I'd expect someone to use the word politics.

It seems like a minor semantic issue but I think it's important to recognise that you absolutely can (and should) make decisions that exclude certain "political" opinions.
