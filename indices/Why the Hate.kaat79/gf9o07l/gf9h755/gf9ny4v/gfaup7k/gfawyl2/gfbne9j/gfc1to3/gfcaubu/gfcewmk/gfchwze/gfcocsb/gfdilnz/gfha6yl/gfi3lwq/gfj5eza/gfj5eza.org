IDK, maybe this line of discussion is kind of pointless, I'm arguing for not banning individuals on political opinions (Which pretty much means ANY opinion, The only thing I think justifies banning is actual incites to violence or other illegal actions), and the argument against that is "this political opinion is too harmful to allow" so my argument against that is "there are other political opinions which are MORE harmful and are generally accepted by (you)/society and you wouldn't think banning them is a good idea so why this one?" which descends into a "which is worse" argument which is kinda pointless because the point is that both are bad but that is irrelevant to whether they should be banned or not (IMO).

I kinda want to continue the "which is worse" discussion though since I find it interesting and you are an enjoyable person to discuss this with, but if you are sick of it just skip to the last paragraph;

I guess your comment explains exactly why everyone hates nazi's although the ideology is responsible for less deaths than Communism. From a completely surface perspective of both ideologies one looks like "racism" and the other like "equality". The problem is that isn't reality, and in practice what you are doing here is steal-manning Communism and Straw-manning Race-realism. Race-realism != racist (although I agree that most Race-realists are likely racists, the Ideology is not inherently racist) Race-realism is just the opinion that; "Communities with a single race will on average be more functional/happy/productive w/e than ones which are not", and therefor it would be a good idea to segregate (Obviously I disagree with this, and think diversity is a massive strength, but I try not to let this opinion bias me, and don't think it is harmful to discuss this seriously, in fact think it is more harmful to straw-man and censor any discussion on this topic). A moderate race-realist doesn't necessarily discriminate, just "tries to persuade others that this is a good idea". If they put this into practice by attempting do act on this belief in situations such as the workplace, government, etc, then I completely agree that is is BAD bad. The thing is, this has to be compared to a communist which is ALSO trying to implement his/her opinion in professional/political situation (such as undermining democracy, removing liberties to maximize equality etc) which is ALSO BAD bad.

  Communism may not work, but it addresses a real problem that exists independently of itself: poverty. Race realism addresses the problem of people not wanting to live together with other races

That is the same thing; straw-man vs steal-man. Steal-man of communism is "Reduce poverty by making everyone equal" and straw man is "I don't like people who are harder workers than me so give me their money." While a Steal-man of race-realism is "Reduce poverty by making everyone better off (by segregation)" while the straw man is "I'm racist so I want an excuse to allow me to discriminate against other races".

My argument for free speech is simple: Censorship ALWAYS increases power inequality by definition. Any sort of censorship can only ever be successful by someone with more power than the individual they are censoring, where power here is defined by "who's influence is larger". To me there is nothing more to be said, as a left-liberal power (and resources, happiness, etc) should be spread as much as possible, censorship is putting the cart before the horse and should be minimized as much as possible.
