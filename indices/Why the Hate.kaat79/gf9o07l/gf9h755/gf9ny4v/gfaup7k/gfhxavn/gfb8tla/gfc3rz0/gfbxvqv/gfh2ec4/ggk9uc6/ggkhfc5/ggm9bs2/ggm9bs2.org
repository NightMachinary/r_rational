I was not saying you were saying it was rational. what I was talking about was "side of the political spectrum are really enmeshed in what I'd call "emotion politics" - politics all based around people's feelings as the one metric by which all should be judged.".

I was arguing that all morlisc arguments are based on emotion. I did get something wrong though which was you where talking about right-wing in general which means I think you are even more wrong about.

not saying dose not ben shoprio often says stupd things he dose. but to predind left-wing pundits can't be as deranged is just not true.

e.g right-wing has obarma being born in another contery well left-wing has rassa trump conspiracy theory (well the right wing one is more obsered the left wing one was a lot more prevasive)
