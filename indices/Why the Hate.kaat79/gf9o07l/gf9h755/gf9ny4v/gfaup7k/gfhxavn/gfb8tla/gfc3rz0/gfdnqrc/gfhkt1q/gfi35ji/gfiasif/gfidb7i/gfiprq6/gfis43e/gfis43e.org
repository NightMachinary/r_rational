  I think our main difference is that you think that people are more influenced by and predicted by broader ideologies than I do. Maybe it's just where I live, but no-one I know identifies themselves by parties like that.

I'm thinking more of how discourse ends up looking like online, in journalism, and so on. Even though you may argue people act in /more/ extreme ways than they would in person in those settings, that doesn't make them less real. Plenty of movements and political change are driven by this sort of stuff (up to and including Trumpism, in fact). I'm not saying that people in general are predicted specifically by ideologies on an individual level, but ideologies matter as reference points. And ideologies change with time. Surely you wouldn't say that the left and the right today carry the same exact core ideas and policy objectives as thirty, sixty, one hundred years ago? The general sense of the two sides remains the same, but the specifics evolve all the time.

  In my experience, trying to measure a shift in localised, contemporary ideology from the ground level is doomed from the start.

What would be your approach to do so then? It seems to me like you're deconstructing the concept itself of there even /being/ an ideology too much. I'm not saying you can use it to slot people in neatly, of course, but it doesn't matter. For example the phenomenon OP notices - lots of left-leaning people considering rationalists with suspicion or outright spiting them - is certainly real, even though there are obviously exceptions (I can think of one person I personally know myself who would count as one).
