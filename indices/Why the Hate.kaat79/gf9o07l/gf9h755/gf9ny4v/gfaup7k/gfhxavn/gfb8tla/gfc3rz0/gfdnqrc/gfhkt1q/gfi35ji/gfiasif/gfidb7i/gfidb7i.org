I mean, an ideology is more sort of a... distilled average of individual people? Obviously it's really hard to pin down "purely left" or "purely right" people - though some who build their whole identity around that might fit the bill - it's more that people adopt ideas and often certain social contexts will reinforce them (so if I'm, roughly speaking, 90% left and 10% right, I'll still be loathe to voice that 10% while in a context of other majority-left people coded to be left like a political party or a movement, which then creates a feedback loop with others. This effect becomes stronger if those people are inclined to shaming or other forms of social pressure, which /absolutely are/ very common in political discourse these days).

My point isn't that everyone does this, though the discussion I mentioned involved academics who do /not/ like this approach complaining about peer pressure from the majority. There is such a thing as "mainstream" ideas in a certain environment, I don't see what's problematic with that, without a need to label individual people at all, which I don't think I did. My problem isn't with the people, it's with the specific shape the ideology is taking, the "meme" so to speak (in the sense Dawkins originally coined the term for).

  I'm certain that what you're saying is true for some people, to some extent. It seems very unlikely, however, that this idea is so broadly applicable that it could be relevant as a significant force all the way down to the level of international web forums.

You asked for an example, I made an example. There's more. My point is, there is a general trend towards this sort of extremely relativistic interpretation. If epistemology exists on a scale, from "Truth exists and I know it because it's all written in this Holy Book or whatever" to "Truth does not exist, everything is subjective to the point of solipsism", then the dominant epistemology associated with left wing ideologies would be slowly shifting towards the latter extreme in the last years, too close for my comfort, at least. And I'm still pretty relativist, of course! I just don't think it's useful any more when you get to the point of completely abandoning any hope of even /pursuing/ objectivity. Even with all its trappings and fake goals. It just feels like a lot of people have stopped trying altogether and have called the objective itself worthless, with actual philosophers and theorists (from whom these ideas originate) basically providing smart-sounding rationalisations for why this sour grape mindset is actually a good thing.
