I don't think I would agree here; Don't think there is really a distinction between either end when it comes to a lack of rationality for the members who lack it, while I have seen rational and educated members of both sides, even both extremes. And the rift I blame on a rising culture of non-tolerance, with the excuse of labeling opposing opinions as "harmful". Which I agree is shifted left atm, which I also think is the lesser of two evils even though Communists are just as bad as Nazi's since both ideologies lead to gulags (and the obvious example of this leaning is that nazi's get banned while communists don't).
