Here's an example of a discussion I saw some days ago. This was mainly among researchers from social/political sciences. Apparently, the common trend right now is to believe that if you're researching a sociopolitical issue, to take an activist role in those topics is encouraged as something that /enhances/ your research. The logic, rooted in critical theory, is that since every narrative and framing is expression of a power relationship anyway, you might as well embrace one openly. The opposing view, that you should strive to distance yourself from the topic and assess it in an objective manner in order to produce useful research, exists, but is in minority, and often draws accusations of right-wing bias. Because, after all, inaction is the same as standing with the oppressor.

Now note that I'm not saying that when people study these issues, "both sides" have a point. If you study genocide or discrimination, one side definitely ought to have every decent person behind them. Nor am I saying that it is possible to achieve perfect objectivity: it is always only a goal to aspire to. Nor am I saying that your research's results will always be perfectly apolitical: if one side blatantly lies or believes falsities, the truth will be political. And finally, I perfectly understand that if your subject of study isn't elementary particles but people, people who you often interview, befriend, live among, then it's not going to be exactly easy to keep a distance. There will be times in which you might feel a tension between your professional duty and your duty as a human being, as they might be at odds. You might feel like you just /can't/ stand on the sidelines and document as other people are involved in the fight.

The problem is saying that activism actually makes your work /better/. It really, really can't. Being personally involved will raise your emotional stakes in what you find out. If what you find out happens to support your cause, you'll be all too happy to publish it. But if it doesn't, you'll have all sorts of peer pressure and emotional investment in NOT releasing it, or twisting it; a lot more than you would otherwise (not that you usually wouldn't: but that will still be there, and be compounded). And this in the end hurts the cause too. If all the research - the job whose task should be to provide facts to the public so they may make their own mind on an issue - feels like it's somehow affected by partisan politics either way, then it loses more and more credibility. People stop wondering about what the facts even are and feel absolved in simply going with their gut; after all, it's what even those researchers do!

And obviously that instinct is always present, to a point. The problem is how we're completely losing any desire of fighting it off. Historically, the political left has generally stood /more/ for reason and objectivity. Pointing out how many social, historical, cultural or religious constructs are /not/ absolutes or laws of nature is rational. Asking for equality among humans where there is no evidence that justifies discrimination is rational. If the left abandons that stance in frustration too, what we actually end up having is a political spectrum in which no one agrees on anything but one thing: truth does not exist, reason is of no consequence, personal feeling is all that matters. But in that way it also becomes impossible to achieve any kind of compromise, because no one can just convince someone else to /feel/ differently without that change having some roots in a shared reality.
