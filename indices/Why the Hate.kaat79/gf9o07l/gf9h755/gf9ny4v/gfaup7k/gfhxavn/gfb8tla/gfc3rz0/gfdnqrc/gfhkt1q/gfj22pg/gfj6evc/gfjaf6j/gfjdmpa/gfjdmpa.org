  There's a reason why lots of leftists aren't really a fan of affirmative action anymore

Wait, who are we talking about here? Because I've read that opinion only from a minority - and usually it was people of colour saying that. If a white person did, with the same exact arguments, they'd be simply accused of being racist.

  Which part of Sanders' or Corbyn's platform was based on emotional gut feelings?
#+end_quote

Sanders has actually had his fair share of critics exactly because he's more old-school in these respects. But it might be here the problem is that perhaps I'm saying "left wing" more in general and incorporating more groups that perhaps you'd class as "liberals".

I rooted for both Sanders and Corbyn. The latter got IMO unfairly shafted by the whole supposed antisemitism scandal, though I also think he's not that great at communication - certainly worse than Sanders. But I actually wouldn't consider them part of this trend that much, they're both really, well, old. This is more of a younger generation thing.
