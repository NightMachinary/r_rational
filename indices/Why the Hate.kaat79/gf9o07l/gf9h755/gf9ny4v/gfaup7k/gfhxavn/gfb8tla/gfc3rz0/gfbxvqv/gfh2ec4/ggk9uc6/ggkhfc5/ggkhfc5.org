I was certainly not suggesting fascism as rational in the least!

What you're talking about is values and goals. But it's fine that values are not inherently rational, because you can't scientifically derive ethics. There's no absolute good or evil, so axioms such as “everyone is equal” still come from individual preference.

The problem I'm talking about is more in how matters are discussed and approached even beyond core values. All politics can use some emotional arguments, but what I find insidious is also rationalising their use by making up theories to justify it. When Ben Shapiro says “facts, not feelings” it's ironic because mostly he does /not/ follow that with actual facts, but it also shows that his public is very sensitive to the notion that they should give priority to reality over their emotions (they often are unable to do so, and that's their problem). While the left often plays with the notion that since facts are so filtered through subjective lenses, we might as well act like feelings are all we have.
