I mean, surely any decent ideology MUST be based on feelings at some point? A system that doesn't care about whether humans, in general, are happy or not doesn't sound like a good thing to me. As David Hume would put it, "Reason is and ought only to be the slave of the passions"; reason is useful because it allows us to achieve emotional ends more reliably, it's not an end in itself.
