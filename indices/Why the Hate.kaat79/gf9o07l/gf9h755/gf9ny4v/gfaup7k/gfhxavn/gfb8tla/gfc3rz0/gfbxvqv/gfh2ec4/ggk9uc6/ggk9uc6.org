  I think the problem there tends to be that a lot of people on that side of the political spectrum are really enmeshed in what I'd call "emotion politics" - politics all based around people's feelings as the one metric by which all should be judged

I would arguee it is more complex then that.

I would say fascism and communism both use simplified overly reductionist logic as well as highly emotive reasoning but I have yet to find a political ideology which does not use highly emotive reasoning.

​

with fascism, it simplifies the world by defining the nation-state and often race as fundamental things not as the human instotuces as well as that it ignors the indivule. in this way when a black man attacks a white man it is seen as as black attacks white not human attacks human and the success of the nation or race is proff of the suproty of the race not of luck or the actions of inducules and groups.

as well as that they ignore the idea of cooperation and focuses only on competition there for meaning that if another group exists it must be trying to attack you so it must be destroyed and that violence is the only real type of force.

​

with communism, it simplifies the world by defining government and business as fundamentally different with them believing that the people running the government would always think of the people first and never take actions to enrich them selfs.

as well as that they asume the world is a 0 sum system so takeing the money off the bissneman will not affect the the bissnamans production capspltiy.

​

all idolgeys have there simplifications and there are many more for both of these exmples.

I have yet to find a political ideology which does not use highly emotive reasoning.

what I mean by this is that even egalitarianisms base that all people have value and should be treated equally is a highly emotional statement.
