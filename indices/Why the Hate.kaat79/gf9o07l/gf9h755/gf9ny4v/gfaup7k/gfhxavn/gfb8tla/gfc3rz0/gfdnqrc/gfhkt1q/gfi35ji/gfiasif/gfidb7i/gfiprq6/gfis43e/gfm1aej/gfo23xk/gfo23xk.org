I think you're thinking more of the root causes. For example, take Trumpism. I could describe the ideology that got Trump elected based on how it's blatantly stated by his own supporters. You would say “but no, look, actually most people who voted him aren't that hard core, they did it because of economic factors so and so”.

Both things can be true, but in politics, words matter. Even if the activists and zealots are a minority, they set the line. If they win, that is interpreted as a mandate from the masses for /all/ their platform. For another example look at Brexit. Did everyone in that 52% who voted for it want No Deal? Probably not, but they still empowered a minority of hard line ideologues to go for it.
