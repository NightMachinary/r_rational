My guess is that you should model the situation via conflict theory; Rational fiction is enjoyed by people with a more rational, truth-seeking outlook, who tend to be contrarian to the status quo. E.g., HPMOR parodies the original JKR works. This is actually an accepted practice in fanon, so I don't know why people would be more upset over it. Perhaps because HPMOR is read by people not all that well versed in HP fanfictions, or perhaps because it is a smarter parody than others ... Of course, HPMOR is naive with its "science can save the blood purists" as they don't care about blood purity as evidenced by Voldemort, they care about subjugating the weaker muggleborns.

Anyhow, people don't like us thinking ourselves smarter than them and dismissing their favorite works as bullshit. They also don't enjoy rational fiction as much as normal fiction, as they don't appreciate the consistency and stuff, while the story tends to be weaker because there is only so much the author can deliver with their limited resources. This all culminates in some assholes hating our community.
