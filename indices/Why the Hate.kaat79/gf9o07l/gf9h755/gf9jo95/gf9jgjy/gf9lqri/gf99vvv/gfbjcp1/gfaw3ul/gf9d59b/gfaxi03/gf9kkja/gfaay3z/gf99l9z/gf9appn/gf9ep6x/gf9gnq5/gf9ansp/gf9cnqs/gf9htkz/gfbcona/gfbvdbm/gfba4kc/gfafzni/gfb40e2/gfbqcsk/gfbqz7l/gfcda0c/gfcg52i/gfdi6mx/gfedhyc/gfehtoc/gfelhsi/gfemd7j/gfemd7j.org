  Not at all! If you try and think of "infohazards" by wracking your brain for things that pattern-match to creepypasta, you're probably going to draw a blank. If you instead look for places where societies take steps to control the dissemination of specific pieces of information, you can find all sorts of examples from banal spoiler warning to deadly-serious classification systems. If you only do the former and then conclude "mere information can't be that dangerous" you've done yourself a disservice.

Yes, and you're still committing a motte-and-bailey here. None of the examples you give here necessitate being mysterious about why you hide the information.

  Did you try?

Well my first hypothesis was that the piece might be under Scott's real name. But if that were the case you'd just have said it. So that makes no sense. Besides Scott's real name is obviously not an infohazard.

Your last two paragraphs imply that you're talking about his real name after all. So you're being all mysterious for absolutely no fucking reason? Thanks for wasting all our time I guess.
