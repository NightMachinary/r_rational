Pardon, but I'm using the word in reference to its present self-described adherents rather than its detractors from the 80s. If you think Reaganomics would get better than a lukewarm reception over at [[/r/neoliberal]], you've made an error of prediction.

  i view economic issues as being the primary pole of ideology - so regardless of where you find yourself on civil liberties, a libertarian is a right ideology because of its stance on economic issues;

Ok, this is the answer to the question I was asking. If you're throwing out the social issues on which Scott is strongly on the left, it's not surprising that you're overestimating how far right he is.

I'd still argue that even purely on economic issues he's left of the median (albeit not in a traditional pro-labor way), and if your response is that a supermajority of the US is on the right economically then you're using 'unconventional' definitions twice over.
