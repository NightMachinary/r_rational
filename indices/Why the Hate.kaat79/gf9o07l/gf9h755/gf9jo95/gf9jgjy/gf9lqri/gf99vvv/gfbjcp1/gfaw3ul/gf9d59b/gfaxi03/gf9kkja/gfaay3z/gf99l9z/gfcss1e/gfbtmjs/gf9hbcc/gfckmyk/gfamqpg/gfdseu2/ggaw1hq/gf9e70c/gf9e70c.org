I mean... I am not sure because I haven't really seen a lot of posts here but whenever I share a little scientific data that matches a fictional world and could be pretty cool to add to the world building I get some hate because people don't want stories to make sense, they just want the stories and if everything contradicts everything then whatever... Which doesn't make sense, then you'd need to get rid of science fiction too...

I think people just don't like logic...
