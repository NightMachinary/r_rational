The same thing happens every few years with a different movie. The 70s had Taxi Driver. The 80s had Gordon Gecko. The 90s had Goodfellas. The early 2000s had American History X and The Wolf of Wall Street. (Lotta Scorsese here) Recently there was Joker. All these movies regularly get accused of supporting viewpoints that even a cursory viewing of the film would make obvious they don't.

Despite what so many people on the internet believe, audiences are usually savvy enough to understand satire. The people who support nazi shit with Tyler Durden or Travis Bickle quotes are generally doing so based on out-of-context quotes, sound bites, or YouTube videos.

The problem is that no matter how small the percentage of people who misinterpret the movie are, they will post their shit everywhere, and people will respond by accusing the creators of misleading the audience or "glorifying" the villain.

Of course there are people who put these villains on pedestals, but that's true of /all/ halfway-decent villains. After all, they did the same thing with the Heath Ledger's Joker and Hannibal Lecter who are much more obviously evil villains.

The truth is that if evil were never likeable or relateable, almost no one would be evil. In reality, people don't generally do evil for no reason. They do evil because they think it's right or cool or it will give them purpose or take away their pain.

My problem with that kind of criticism is that it discourages writers from writing 3-dimensional villains for fear of too many people agreeing with them. It's Poe's Law taken to the logical extreme.
