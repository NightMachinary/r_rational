Um, no they don't? And even if they did, the behavior of people in general is a terrible predictor of the behavior of people with Dark Triad traits. Manipulators lie about their motivations as easily as they breathe. When a manipulative narcissistic abuser either wants to be rid of their victim or they can feel their victim beginning to escape, they'll make up all sorts of lies about how they're the real victim and how their victim is the real abuser.

It's plainly evident that Gamergate began as a classic smear campaign, with Gijoni's attempt to recruit flying monkeys ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_monkeys_(popular_psychology)]]) to attack his victim quickly spiraling out of control into a movement.
