The Rationalist Movement doesn't have the best reputation online (unsurprisingly, most people get a little upset when they see a forum willing to debate Nazi Rhetoric), and that trickles down into how many people see rationalist fiction.

Its not just that a lot of people don't like HPMOR - its also that a lot of people also really, really don't like Yudowsky. The rationalist fiction movement is not something fully separate from the wider modern rationalist philosophy movement (and the politics that inevitably involved), especially because many people first discover the movement through fan-fiction. A surprising amount of SneerClub seems to be people who went pretty deep into the fiction/philosophy side of the movement before getting dissuaded by the politics, and that is reasonable; the entire character of Professor Quirrel in HPMOR does look different after you see some of the stuff that gets posted in TheMotte. The wider Rationalist 'movement' has seemingly decided to honor Free Speech over Moderation, and that's OK; but that does mean that the people who get to 'represent' rationalists online (especially in comment sections) aren't always going to be the 'the best', if you know what I mean, and that is going to affect how the average layperson sees rationalist fiction.

Plus the definition of rationalist fiction does feel, to many people, like a classic case of 'Not Invented Here' syndrome (another thing that is often a general critique of the rationalist movement that trickles down into critiques of rationalist fiction). Many people feel like the rationalist fiction community is just a bunch of STEM nerds who took concepts that already existed in literature (e.g the fair-play-whodunnit, among other things), gave it a new name and pretended like they invented it. I honestly believe the genre would not attract nearly as much vitriol if it was just called 'Fair Play' fiction or something along that lines - anything that gave some merit to the wider literary traditions that preceded it.

And to be absolutely fair, both of these common critiques do have merit, and are something we should think about as a community.
