The general thrust of the criticism against Yudkowsky is that he's arrogant and hasn't really done anything concrete to earn that arrogance. See: [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky][Rational wiki on Yudkowsky]]

Which I think is fair, but largely kinda... weak? Certainly wouldn't result in me making a subreddit "against" someone, but to each their own.

To be clear, though, [[/r/sneerclub]] does have a bunch of valid criticisms of the general rational community overall. They ALSO have a whole lot of relatively mindless hate.
