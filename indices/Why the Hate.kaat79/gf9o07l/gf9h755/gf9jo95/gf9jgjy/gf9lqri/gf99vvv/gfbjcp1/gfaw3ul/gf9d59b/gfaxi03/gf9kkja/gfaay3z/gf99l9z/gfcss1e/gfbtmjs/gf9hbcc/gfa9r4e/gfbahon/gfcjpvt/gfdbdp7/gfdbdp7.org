  Food is a genuine pleasure

For you, perhaps. To me, food is just kind of... there. Don't get me wrong, if you place two pieces of food beside each other I can select the one I prefer, but that's about it. Most days I eat some combination of rice and eggs just because it's cheap and filling.

I also feel similarly about music though, so it's entirely possible I legitimately have some kind of disorder causing it.
