  Personally I'm sort of intrigued by the idea that the Author of any work is probably the "centrist" in the room

I don't think this one really holds water. I hang out with game developers: they're consistently pretty committed to socially progressive ideas, and a lot of them are increasingly eying labor activism. Gamers, on the other hand... there certainly are pockets of lefties, but there's also a huge reactionary undercurrent that was made obvious with gamergate.

Maybe games are unusual in this regard, but I also suspect the most popular authors on this subreddit are a bit to the left of the community as a whole.
