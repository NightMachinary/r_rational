Personally I think part of it could be because of rational/ist/ fiction specifically. Lots of rationalist fiction is bad as fiction compared to mainstream fiction, from what I've read. And there's no guarantee that the ideas being put into rationalist fiction are actually true, useful, and relevant, which isn't a good thing when it's trying to teach you a lesson.
