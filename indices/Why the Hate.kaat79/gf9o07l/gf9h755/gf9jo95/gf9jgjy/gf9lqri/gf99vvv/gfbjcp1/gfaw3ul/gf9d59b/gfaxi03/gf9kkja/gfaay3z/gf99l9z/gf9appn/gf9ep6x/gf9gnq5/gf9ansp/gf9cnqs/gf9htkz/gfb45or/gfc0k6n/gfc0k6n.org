SSC culture war thread comment section examples would turn into politics debates because the alt-right/white supremacists viewpoints are masked by just asking question, or playing devils advocate, or citing an out-of-context statistic that's lack in context leads to implication racists conclusions.

The motte is more straightforward but still require some familiarity with the lingo and euphemisms to get at what is being communicated. I can find a lot more direct examples on themotte but finding one that is unambiguous and direct enough for someone that insists on maximum charitability is still proving a chore... (the culture war threads have thousands of comments each)
