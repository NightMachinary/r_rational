I guess that's fair

#+begin_quote
  I could imagine that annoying me
#+end_quote

That is also fair

But they don't need to be assholes about it, they can just say "Oh really? Ok" and then proceed to completely ignore whatever I had said. I think I would take the hint... Or they could be more polite while expressing it, like "ah cool but I don't really care about that kind of stuff so let's not talk about it", I've met people that say something like this and we just leave the topic alone and keep having a nice conversation instead of leaving me feeling down and with a horrible image of them.
