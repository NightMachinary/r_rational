  for anything of real importance, various flavors of stonewalling absolutely is the correct strategy. Standard SCGs go a step further than that, where the principle of collation holds that any collection of unclassified materials sufficient to determine classified information is itself actually classified.

Sure, but that's information you can't just google. When dealing with an infohazard someone can easily expose themself to with only a moment of weakness, I feel that approach is harder to justify. Nevertheless, I do see your point.

  The first question I'd ask you is: are you trying to roll your own crypto? Is this an idea that you're pulling from the best practices of the most successful entities with skin in the game, or are you trying to generate these strategies by yourself?

I wasn't aware of any entities of significant size actually DEALING with infohazard protocols. Normal classified information and secrecy really isn't the same thing at all, IMO; fundamentally different best practices apply when dealing with information that's genuinely harmful in its own right than when dealing with information that you'd just rather someone not have access to because it would hurt your position, especially when in the former case access to the information itself can't be easily controlled. And even if it is the best practice, neither you nor I have the capacity (unless I am very mistaken) to restrict access to information on an internet-wide scale, which inherently limits options with regards to total obfuscation.

That said, if you are aware of such organizations, I would certainly appreciate being informed.
