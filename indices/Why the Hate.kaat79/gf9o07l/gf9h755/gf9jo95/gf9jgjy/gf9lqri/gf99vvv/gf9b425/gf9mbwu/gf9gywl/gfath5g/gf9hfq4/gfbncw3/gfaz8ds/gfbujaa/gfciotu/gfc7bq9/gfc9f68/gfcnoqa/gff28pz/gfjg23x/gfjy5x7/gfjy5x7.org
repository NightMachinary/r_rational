Wikipedia's GG page bends over backwards to be even-handed. The rwiki page is spot-on from anyone's perspective other than those who want to engage in apologia for the harassment campaigns.

Sure, GGers don't /like/ the rwiki page of it, but that's because it calls them out on their awfulness in a way that's to the point and doesn't pull any punches.
