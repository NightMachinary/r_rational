Before I spend the time searching through old threads... Would several links to upvoted examples of paraphrased 14 words be enough to convince you? I could find that easily enough. I could probably find one or two examples were the 14 words are stated out right. I could find lots of examples of the 14 words and other White Supremacist talking points heavily paraphrased and buried in thousands of words... for instance you typically you find phrases like “Western Culture” used as code for “white”.

On the old culture war threads they often hid their power level (using enough code phrases and euphemisms that you needed to already know the lingo to realize what they were actually saying), but in themotte it is more blatant.

I am asking first so I don't waste time on something that won't convince you.

Edit: I found two examples right off the bat with a quick search of sneerclub's mockery:

The second example got deleted at some point, but it's quoted in the sneerclub thread, so I'm linking the sneerclub thread on the comment instead:

Edit 2: and another

How many examples would it take? I found a couple ones quickly but I could find and link a lot...
