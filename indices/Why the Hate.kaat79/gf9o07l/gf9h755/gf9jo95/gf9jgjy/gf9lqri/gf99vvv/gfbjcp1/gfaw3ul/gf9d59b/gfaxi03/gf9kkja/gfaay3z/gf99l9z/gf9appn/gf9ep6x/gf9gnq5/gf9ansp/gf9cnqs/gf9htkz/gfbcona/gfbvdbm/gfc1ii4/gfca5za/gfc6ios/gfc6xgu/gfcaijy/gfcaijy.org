  And I don't think Dylan Alvarez is a leftist, I think Dylan is Scott's best take on a middle class white person becoming a radical leftist because he can't actually empathize with that line of reasoning.

You have assumed the consequent. You presume that Alvarez is a representation of leftism because you believe Scott cannot interpret leftism charitably enough to understand it. If you don't have that assumption, you would have no reason to associate Alvarez and leftism at all.

Alvarez is quite literally a rebel without a cause, or better [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebel_Without_a_Cause][Rebel Without A Cause]] since he is deliberately, specifically acting as the heroic rebel protagonist of a movie. He is leftist only insofar as American pop culture identifies the rebellious underdog as stereotypically anti-rightist. If there is any lesson to be drawn from him, it's that the prospect of radical change without a clear goal ought to terrify everyone, which is a centrist point of view, not an anti-leftist one.

EDIT: Erica, by contrast, /is/ a leftist.
