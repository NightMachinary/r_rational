The US government is not the US government, it is a superficially identical facsimile of the US government that is owned and operated by Big Business / Big Finance / the corporations / the banks / Wall Street / Big Oil / Big Pharma / whatever. The same groups that libertarians foolishly believe should be running the world instead of the government /are already the ones running the world./

"The free market" is /by nature/ unintelligent and amoral, and it /must/ be regulated by government to prevent it from destroying civilization, because left to its own devices "the free market" will do everything in its power to redistribute wealth by siphoning all wealth out of the general economy and concentrating it in the hands of a tiny and powerful elite.

^{obviously the US government is the US government and not a superficially identical facsimile of the US government, it's called hyperbole}
