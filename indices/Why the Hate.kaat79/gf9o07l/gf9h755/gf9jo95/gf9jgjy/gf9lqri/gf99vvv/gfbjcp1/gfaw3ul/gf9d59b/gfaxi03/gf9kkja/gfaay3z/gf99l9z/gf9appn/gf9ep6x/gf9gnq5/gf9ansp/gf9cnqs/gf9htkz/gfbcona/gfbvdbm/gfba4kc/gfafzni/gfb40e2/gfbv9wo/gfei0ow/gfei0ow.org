Scott absolutely did not start out as a libertarian. He wrote several pieces against libertarianism.

He has drifted towards libertarianism in recent years. But not the leftist kind, for the simple reason that leftist libertarianism doesn't exist.

/edit/ Finally got around to reading that link of yours. It's bad. It's very, very bad. Completely fails to understand the debate around free speech, and what limits people are actually proposing. But setting that aside, I fail to see why, even were it persuasive, it would make more more libertarian. 'Free speech is important, therefore I should be against social security, minimum wages and wealth redistribution'. Seems a bit of a non-sequitur.
