There are slightly different dynamics depending on whether you're talking about a singular Author or a larger genre of work with multiple sources, but I'm of the opinion that it's far more useful to look at the audience population the work reaches, and from there who chooses to pursue it and at what level of depth.

Taking SSC as a particular example: you have a broad readership whose "center" is roughly around where Scott is. (Scott's position is reasonably close to the median user of reddit/blog platforms, so difficult to determine causality here.) But his most popular work is long-form critiques of certain culture war SJ issues - valuable to the center-left in an academic sense, but viscerally appealing to folks quite a bit further to the right. The skew propagates into deeper levels of engagement, so you get an interesting asymmetric decoupling between "likelihood of agreeing with Scott" and "likelihood of sticking around Scott's blog".

Or to piggyback on jtolmar's comment and phrase it a different way: audience size tracks total revenue, and it turns out that AAA games make more money /per developer/ than indies. The audience is weighted towards and reflective of an Author's most high-profile work, which is under no obligation to be most reflective of the Author's position.
