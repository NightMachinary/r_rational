  The point is you didn't say that, but that is what is implied when not clarifying.

I mean, I guess? I have always thought that words should only mean what they say but... It is true, that it doesn't usually work like that... For example, I will sometimes say something like "X is not the best" (I have a problem with that word) to me it means: "X is not the best" but other people understand that I said "X is not good" which no! They are different! But it is just me having trouble with understanding how I should word my thoughts for other people...

  And I am expanding on the reason for this; many people don't like logic because they aren't good at applying it

Oh yes, I liked your thoughts on the issue a lot!
