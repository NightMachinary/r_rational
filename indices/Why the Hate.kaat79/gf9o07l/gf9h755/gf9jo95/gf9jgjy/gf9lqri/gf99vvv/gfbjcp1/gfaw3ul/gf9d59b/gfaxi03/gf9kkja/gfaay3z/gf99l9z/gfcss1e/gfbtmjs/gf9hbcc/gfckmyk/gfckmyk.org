Having never encountered such a reaction, I am only making guesses. But from what I've seen, rational fiction tends to have a particular style of intelligence-based power fantasy to it which appeals to a different audience than your standard physical-based power fantasies. When done poorly, it is fairly grating to just about everyone; when done well, it is still grating to some.

Saying that rational fiction is a blight on the medium is like saying that any niche genre is a blight on the medium. Some would say fantasy itself is a blight upon literature; though less so nowadays.

The fact is, the smaller the niche, the less chance that it will produce consistent quality works. Most of us are amateurs, even if intelligent amateurs with a particular goal in mind, and 90% of everything is still going to be subpar.

It's just that when something is done loudly it attracts more attention, and like it or not this particular niche made quite a splash. More positive attention, more negative attention.
