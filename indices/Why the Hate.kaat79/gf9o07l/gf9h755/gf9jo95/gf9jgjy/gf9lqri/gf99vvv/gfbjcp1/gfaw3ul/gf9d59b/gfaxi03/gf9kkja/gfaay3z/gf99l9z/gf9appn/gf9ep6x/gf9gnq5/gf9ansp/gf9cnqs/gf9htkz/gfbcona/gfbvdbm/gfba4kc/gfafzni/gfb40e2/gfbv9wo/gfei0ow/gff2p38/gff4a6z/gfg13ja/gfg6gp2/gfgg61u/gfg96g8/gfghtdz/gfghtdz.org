No, libertarians think a lot of that isn't all that important, or is actively made worse by public management. And they have substantial basis for this. Schools are mostly a cross between prison and daycare - and the US isn't the innovator there, it's called the 'Prussian' model for a reason and remains more restrictive in Europe than here, and at least in Germany you can't even extract your kids from it; homeschooling is illegal and trying it gets you treated as a presumptive bigot. Park 'management' is a joke, and usually completely untethered to what the neighbors actually /want/. And for every useful bureaucrat protecting the public from something actually harmful, there are several more "protecting" them from something innocuous or actively helpful, like occupational licensing or life-saving medicine which hasn't been 'proven' efficacious. (A topical and egregious example: The EU is using the exact same data to decide whether to approve the COVID vaccine as the US did, but refuses to take action until Dec. 27. EU officials have outright stated that regulators are nearly certain to approve on the 27th, but won't take any preparatory steps for deployment before that date despite their confidence. Making the FDA look almost sane by comparison, which is rare.)

Libertarians are also, as I keep reminding you, not ancaps. /Reduce/ the government, not eliminate it. The Iron Law of Bureaucracy means that this is always difficult and never restful. If some portion of the government is removed and that goes very poorly, it will not be difficult to put it back; the history of private turnpikes, failed experiments which ended in the local governments buying them back, demonstrates this quite well.
