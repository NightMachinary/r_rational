There is a general problem with STEM types not knowing humanities stuff and “reinventing the wheel” when discussing things that are best addressed with knowledge/background of the actual field of study, especially humanities topics.

As for good examples of this.... Scott Alexander of Slatestarcodex identifies as left-of-center... but seems unfamiliar with and/or incapable of actually properly steel-manning basic leftist thought and literature (to be fair, the left-right divide in the US skews so heavily right that Scott identifying as center left isn't dishonest). This in turn skewed the Overton Window of the SSC discussion in a weird way, which combined with the ideals of discourse of SSC (charity, taking weird ideas seriously) led to the Nazi/alt-right infestation before several steps were eventually taken that caused the alt-righter to spin off into themotte.

As for other examples of stuff they make fun of... lot of lesswrong-adjacent Silicon Valley tech bros. Common reasons to make fun of them include: anti-academia viewpoints (startup founders are the real innovators and the background research done in academia is meaningless), idiotic libertarian views (failing at basic economics and empathy), and in general stupid ideas which they view as genius (thinking that being an entrepreneur makes them an all around expert in humanities and unrelated fields of science).
