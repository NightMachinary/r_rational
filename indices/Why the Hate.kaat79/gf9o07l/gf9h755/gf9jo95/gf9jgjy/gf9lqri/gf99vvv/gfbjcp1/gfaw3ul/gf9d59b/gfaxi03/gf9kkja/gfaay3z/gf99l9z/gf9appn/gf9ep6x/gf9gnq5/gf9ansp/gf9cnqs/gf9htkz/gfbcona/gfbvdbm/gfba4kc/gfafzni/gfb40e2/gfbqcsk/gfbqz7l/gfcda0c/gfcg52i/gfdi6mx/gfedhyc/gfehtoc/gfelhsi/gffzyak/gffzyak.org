  Harry Potter spoilers, as long as you mark them as such

But if you /don't/ mark it, you're inflicting an infohazard on the readers. (Or would have been, if you were doing it back when there was still new Harry Potter to spoil.) A minor one, which is why it is safe to mention it. And of course some people find it hard to resist reading spoiler-locked content even if they don't like being spoiled, so there even knowing that it's HP spoilers is an infohazard.
