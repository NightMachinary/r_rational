A lot of people have offered a lot of good commentary! I'd add one thing:

[[/r/rational]] is overwhelmingly centered around fanfic and web serials (mostly LitRPGs). There's very little in the way of mainstream (in the sense of "published by a major publishing house") fiction discussed on this sub.

The difference in polish levels and quality is massive, and most of the sub comes off as thinking that the mediocre-but-entertaining stuff that's our usual fare (which I enjoy, don't get me wrong!) possesses a degree of excellence past what it really does. I don't mean that the [[/r/rational]] folks should go read through the NYT Most Important Books of Whatever Year, that shit is absolutely awful, but any given year's Hugo Best Novel nominees are overwhelmingly likely to be better than any of the stuff we rave about.

So we've got a community that grew out of a mediocre (and extremely condescending, in the "I don't need to know the canon to know it sucks" way that is so widely despised) fanfic, and leaving aside all of the other, shitty/asinine communities we may or may not be associated with, we overwhelmingly discuss works of fiction that not only belong in genres which are treated with enormous disdain, these works of fiction aren't all that well executed, particularly in terms of editing/polish.
