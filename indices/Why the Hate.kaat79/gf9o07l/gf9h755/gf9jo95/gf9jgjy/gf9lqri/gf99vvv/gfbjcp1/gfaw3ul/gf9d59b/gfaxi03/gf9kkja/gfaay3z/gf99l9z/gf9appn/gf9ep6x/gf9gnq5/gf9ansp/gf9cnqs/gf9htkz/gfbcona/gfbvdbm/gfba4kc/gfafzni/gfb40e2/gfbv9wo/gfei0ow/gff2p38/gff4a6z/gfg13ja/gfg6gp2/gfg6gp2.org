US government is /unusually/ stupid and /unusually/ evil. It is not unique. Claiming that your own government is competent and good is claiming /your/ government is exceptional. It's probably the only one in Europe, if so; France prevents harmless exercise of religion because it comes from weird foreign transplants, most of the EU has a substantial underclass of "foreigners" who have been in their country for several generations but still aren't citizens (this is probably true of the Netherlands and Belgium but I don't know for certain), and no one in Europe has a reasonable degree of free speech. (The latter is actually an argument that the USA isn't even unusually bad; it's just unusually easy for people to express their misgivings. I don't think that's true, but it merits consideration.)

Government is /by nature/ unintelligent and amoral. This is not a generalization from the USA, but a derivation from first principles.
