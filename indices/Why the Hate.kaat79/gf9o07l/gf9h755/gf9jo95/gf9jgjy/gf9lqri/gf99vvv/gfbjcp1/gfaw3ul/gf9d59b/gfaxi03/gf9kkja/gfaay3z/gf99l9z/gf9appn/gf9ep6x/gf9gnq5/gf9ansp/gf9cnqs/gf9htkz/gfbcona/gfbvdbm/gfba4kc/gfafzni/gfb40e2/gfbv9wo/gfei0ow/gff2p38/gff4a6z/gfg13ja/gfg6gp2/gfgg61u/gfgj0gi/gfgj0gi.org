...What libertarians are /you/ talking to? Please tell them to shake the straw out of their shoes.

Libertarians don't think that "Big Business" should be running the world. One of the common hobby-horses of libertarianism is regulatory capture, i.e. big business using government to suppress the free market, control the marketplace, and prevent or neuter competition. This is only possible because libertarian ideals don't have meaningful sway in the legislature or rules-making bureaucracy. If it was an uphill battle to get any new regulations passed, then it would be much harder to lean on regulators to change things to benefit existing firms and discourage new entrants.
