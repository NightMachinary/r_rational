  drink Soylent for most meals

I never understood this trend. Food is a genuine pleasure. Drinking mostly Soylent is as appealing to me as listening to white noise instead of music, having a garden made out of concrete or replacing colored ornaments with greyscale storage spaces.

And I am neither an ecology aware vegan nor do I even like BBQ.
