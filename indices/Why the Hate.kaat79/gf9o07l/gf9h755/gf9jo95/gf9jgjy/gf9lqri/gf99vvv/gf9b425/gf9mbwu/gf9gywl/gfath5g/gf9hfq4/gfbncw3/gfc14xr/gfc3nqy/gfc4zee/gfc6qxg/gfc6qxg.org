Self-described libertarians in the US do tend towards R rather than D, but if you're going up a meta level from stated object-level positions to broad ideology in order to then turn around and predict someone's positions, I think you're missing the trees for the forest.

Besides, there's plenty of room on the left for people who break harder towards libertarianism than populism. I do a good enough neoliberal impression to answer questions if there are specific points there you'd think are irreconcilable?
