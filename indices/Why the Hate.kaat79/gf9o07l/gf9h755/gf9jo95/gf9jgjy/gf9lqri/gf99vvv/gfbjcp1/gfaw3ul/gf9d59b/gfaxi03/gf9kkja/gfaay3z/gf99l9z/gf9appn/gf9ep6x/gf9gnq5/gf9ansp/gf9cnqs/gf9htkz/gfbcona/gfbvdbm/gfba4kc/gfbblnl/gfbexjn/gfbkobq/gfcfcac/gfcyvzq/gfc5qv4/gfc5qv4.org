I picked the first examples I could quickly find, not the strongest examples. Sneerclub prioritizes mockable examples, not the examples most likely to convince someone intent on maximum charity. Additionally, a year or two ago sneerclub mods asked users to stop posting themotte links unless they were really off the wall simply because it was too low hanging fruit.

  Trust me, you just have to decode their lingo with as little intellectual charity and as much hostility as possible

And now I think I can't convince you regardless of evidence. There is a documented pattern of alt-righters using euphemistic language. If you are going to dismiss even blatant usage of racists euphemisms and lingo in the name of charity almost nothing will convince you.

Just in case you are willing to change your mind

Here another comment with some moderate racism in the initial comment and some really racists responses. Instead of concluding that IQ is a crappy, culturally biased measure of intelligence, commenters came up with some hard mask-off racists responses:

Among the highlights in the comments...

someone that doesn't understand IQ or the effects of colonialism (36 upvotes):

  The countries with average IQs below 80 on that map are exclusively in Africa and not part of the Arab League, minus Mauritania and Sudan. None of them have accomplished anything in modern history, save for the infrastructure built by colonial powers. They're mostly concentrated at the bottom of the current HDI rankings.

  Having an IQ of 80 makes it hard to function in Western society because there are elevated minimums for economic/marriage viability. It doesn't mean that a society of 80 IQs can't feed themselves. How do you think /any/ country's populace survived in an unbroken chain from single-celled organisms? Fitness and IQ in nature are not correlated. What's the IQ of a penguin?

and another highly upvoted comment:

#+begin_quote
  So 70 IQ children of elite whites tend to have syndromes and are ostracized, while 70 IQ lower class black children can have the same level of abstract thinking but still socialize as mostly normals.
#+end_quote

And someone points out the actual answer and only gets 9 upvotes, with a disagreeing response getting more.

#+begin_quote
  Occam's razor suggests to me in practice IQ is a flawed thing that more measures your cultural familiarity with standardized tests than anything useful

  Or in terms guaranteed to get me banned, it's a bullshit concept scientific racists use to try to legitimize their views
#+end_quote

If that comment chain doesn't convince you there is a problem I don't think anything will.

But just in case, advocating for lethal force against BLM protestors:
