No problem, though in this specific case I think I neatly hit all of my objectives.

  I have had the idea for a while that the best way to deal with an infohazard is not to reveal absolutely nothing no matter how much someone asks (that just increases the odds they'll get curious and check the source), but to act as a go-between, answering their questions as best you can without exposing them in order to assuage their curiosity

So, this is an enormously complicated subject that depends strongly both on what you're trying to keep contained and what kind of attention it's getting. The first question I'd ask you is: are you trying to roll your own crypto? Is this an idea that you're pulling from the best practices of the most successful entities with skin in the game, or are you trying to generate these strategies by yourself?

Skipping to the conclusion: for anything of real importance, various flavors of stonewalling absolutely /is/ the correct strategy. Standard SCGs go a step further than that, where the principle of collation holds that any collection of unclassified materials sufficient to determine classified information is itself actually classified.

Satisfying curiosity is a high-skill strategy when you're dealing with a particular individual you think you can outmaneuver, but it's unacceptably risky if you're dealing with either a large audience or with something you can't afford to leave to chance.

  I really don't think it's very productive to insult the person you're trying to protect from a putative infohazard, by the way.

At that point it wasn't about the infohazard - the libertarian swipe wouldn't have happened if they were the type to do so much as follow an offered link, so I think I'm in the clear.

(Link pass-through rate is like 10% at the best of times though, so it's not like it's a shot in the dark.)
