Trivially false. The traditional rebuttal is an unmarked goatse link, with the contemporary equivalent to "Snape kills Dumbledore" being a kinder alternative. What you mean is that you can't think of any information that does enough damage for you to care about, which is not exactly the best way to inquire after more serious examples.
