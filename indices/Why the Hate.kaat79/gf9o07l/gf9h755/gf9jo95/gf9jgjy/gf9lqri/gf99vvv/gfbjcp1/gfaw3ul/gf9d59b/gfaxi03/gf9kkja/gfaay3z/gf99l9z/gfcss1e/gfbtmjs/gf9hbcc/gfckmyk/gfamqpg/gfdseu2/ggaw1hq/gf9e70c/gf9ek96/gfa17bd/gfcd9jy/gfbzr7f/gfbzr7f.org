I've met people that don't like logic, history or facts. Like when we are talking about a show, I tell them "oh, did you notice? They have this technology advancement but they don't have this other one so it is very likely the story is taking place between x & y dates" but people usually just get angry at me and start saying that nobody cares, etc...

A lot of people don't like facts or logic (specially in fiction), that happens.

  There are reasons not to like rational fiction / the surrounding community that don't boil down to "people don't like logic".

Like what? Honestly having seen the attitude of this people, I can't think of anything else.
