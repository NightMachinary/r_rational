I agree with this statement the most. At their worst, rational books are about overpowered know-it-alls and Gary/Mary Stu's who can never fail and succeed at everything by virtue of being the smartest person ever. Sadly, that's what most outsiders seem to think when they hear about the rational crowd.

At it's best, rational is a system of tools and characteristics to write and analyze the logical consistency of a world and character's actions given the details of a specific scenario. Usually though, that kind of story has a lot of other things going for it as well, and readers outside the rational crowd rarely credit our tools and techniques. So we're judged by our worst.
