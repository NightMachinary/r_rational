I don't agree with you. Most of us can see that irrational fiction can also be very enjoyable, and sometimes rationality hurts the story. In fact, the whole shtick of rational fiction is to go up a level and view the fictional world in a meta way, and analyze how consistent this world is and how much the "narrative god" interferes (or needs to interfere) to make a good story. We then value this consistency and lack of "narrative force", alongside traditional literary virtues. Of course, if someone doesn't share our values, they would not benefit from our community.
