  Scenes like the one where quirrel reaches harry to lose, or Yudkowsky's rape play in three worlds collide, become serious black marks in those stories not because other things we read don't have those elements, but because the person writing them says they're supposed to be edifying.

I mean, to me everything involving Quirrell in HPMOR sounds like it has to be taken always with a pinch of salt. It's not that the lesson Quirrell teaches - knowing when to fold 'em, so to speak - isn't valuable. It's that he teaches it in an exceedingly violent way, and there's always evil undertones to all he says and does. And the "evil" element here isn't nullified by the fact that Harry benefits from it.

Personal experience: I've gone through a hazing process once. Nothing quite that humiliating, but still would count as bullying by common metrics. I think personally I actually have benefited from it in that specific circumstance, as in, it did force me to come out of my shell and it did help me integrate better with the ones who were undergoing it with me and so on. However some other people also broke under it, and quit altogether. Basically the point isn't "hazing is bad because it hurts everyone", nor "hazing never works". Hazing /does/ work with a certain percentage of people, that's why initiation rituals have been a thing for millennia. The point is what happens to those with whom it doesn't. For the most violent, extreme forms of hazing, this can mean even physical harm, not to mention the psychological one. That's what makes Quirrell's methods questionable - not the lesson, nor the fact that they can't possibly work. He does what he does because if it succeeds he's happy, and if it fails he doesn't give a fuck if Harry is hurt by it.
