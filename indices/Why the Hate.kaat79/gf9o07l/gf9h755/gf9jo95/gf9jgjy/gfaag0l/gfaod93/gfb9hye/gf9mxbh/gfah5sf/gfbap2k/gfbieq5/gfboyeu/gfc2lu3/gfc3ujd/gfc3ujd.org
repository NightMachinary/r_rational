  So in brief, the primary juvenile power fantasy in play here is 'im so dangerous that I can't fight back without killing them' which helps small children being victimized, turning their weakness and fear into power and resolve, but it is an egregious example of a theme that runs throughout HPMOR.

True, though Harry being a wizard, and Hogwarts a school where young children get given a deadly weapon and taught to use it... realistically, the body count in those books is much lower than it ought to be. Bullied children COULD totally kill because all it takes is the right spell hitting by surprise. And Harry does have some creativity. I feel like the issue there is that part of the conceit of the story is /also/ to explore the "what if we actually take magic to its logical consequences" idea and that inevitably makes it ridiculously deadly.

  I also don't see what ideological clash you're referring to in this scene, harry and quirrells are on the same page that harry has a problem and quirrells has a solution.

I may remember that wrong, but I thought at the end Quirrell said something to the effect of how Harry could take his revenge later, while Harry of course had no intention to do so? I probably mixed it up with something else.
