I wrote up more than I probably should've and then tried to post with reddit down =[

So in brief, the primary juvenile power fantasy in play here is 'im so dangerous that I can't fight back without killing them' which helps small children being victimized, turning their weakness and fear into power and resolve, but it is an egregious example of a theme that runs throughout HPMOR. I have no issue with the lesson about losing, and if I encountered this scene in a YA novel about, say, a farm boy who's sent to the royal academy before he kills the evil court magician to save the king's life, I wouldnt blink. But HPMOR and it's author embrace some really pretentious, lecturing BS about teaching people the true power of rationality, and this theme of juvenile power fantasies hits below the mark they set themselves, or maybe communicates too much about who is writing this and who it's for.

I actually like most of quirrells input, if you removed his desire to murder people he thinks are dumb I don't think he'd count a villain, even voldemort would be preferable to most real world hierarchies if he were a shade less irredeemably evil. I have no issue with the examination of uncomfortable moral landscapes.

I also don't see what ideological clash you're referring to in this scene, harry and quirrells are on the same page that harry has a problem and quirrells has a solution.

This is, surprisingly, less than I wrote the first time. Also, you might be interested in the novel Inda by Sherwood Smith. It's a really good 'children learn to fight' novel that I think is probably palatable to the /rational/ crowd, and it has a lot of the sort of hazing scenes you were describing.
