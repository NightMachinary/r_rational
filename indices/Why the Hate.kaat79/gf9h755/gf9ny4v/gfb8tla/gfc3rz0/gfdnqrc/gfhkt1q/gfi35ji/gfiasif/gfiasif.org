I used 'left academia' for people 'researching a sociopolitical issue' who believe 'that activism actually makes your work better.'

Although I mostly agree with your philosophy, I feel like your argument as a whole isn't quite logical. It feels to me like you're personifying movements and forgetting the person. Rather than talking about what tendencies and bias 'a left-leaning person' might have, you're describing people as being a faceless limb of 'the left' (though your phrasing varies). There are many steps in your hypothetical train of thought, but in reality I'm not sure a random left would pass step one. People just aren't so defined by umbrella labels.

I'm certain that what you're saying is true for some people, to some extent. It seems very unlikely, however, that this idea is so broadly applicable that it could be relevant as a significant force all the way down to the level of international web forums.
