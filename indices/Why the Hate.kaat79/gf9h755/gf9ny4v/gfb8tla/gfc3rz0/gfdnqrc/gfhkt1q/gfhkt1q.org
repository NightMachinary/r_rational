So you're saying that bias in researchers promotes anti-intellectualism and distorts published science. That there is a movement in 'left academia' towards embracing this bias, which furthers tribal thinking and makes compromise difficult, as there is no neutral academic basis that can be used to observe political ideas.

You're then saying that this lack of neutrality/objectivity makes it difficult for left to compromise with right, and distinguish nuance in right. That this means it's hard for left to tell if a [[/r/rational][r/rational]] comment is Nazi or just right.

Is my interpretation of your comments correct? I have some issues with your ideas, but I just want to check that I have it all down first.
