  I don't think you're understanding the point that those folks are making?
#+end_quote

I do understand it, I just think their priorities are wrong. I think they're overestimating the importance of some factors and underestimating others.

  Moreover, none of that actually has much to do with the politics of the folks involved and is instead mostly about what some subsection of academics believe.
#+end_quote

In the context of that discussion, the folks involved are mostly not even in the western world, so their own politics are generally a bit separate from ours in terms of categories. The academics here are just an example of what instead tends to be the mindset across people active on the left side of politics specifically in Europe and the US - and in particular in the English-speaking world.

  The average leftist isn't going to say that they believe in a particular ideology because of how politics make them feel, they're going to say that they believe in a particular ideology because of specific material issues.
#+end_quote

That's not really what I meant either, it's more about whether you think solutions to those material issues (such as economic inequality, racism, sexism, homophobia etc.) should be then measured against more or less objective metrics, or designed based on some kind of attempt at empirical evaluations vs. just going with what your gut tells will work.
