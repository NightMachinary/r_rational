I don't think you're understanding the point that those folks are making? Moreover, none of that actually has much to do with the politics of the folks involved and is instead mostly about what some subsection of academics believe. The average leftist isn't going to say that they believe in a particular ideology because of how politics make them feel, they're going to say that they believe in a particular ideology because of specific material issues. I mean, ultimately all politics are, at some level, a moralistic determination so it's not really possible to have literally no emotion but it is exceptionally rare for any leftist to say that they are leftist for no objective or material reason.
