  That's not really what I meant either, it's more about whether you think solutions to those material issues (such as economic inequality, racism, sexism, homophobia etc.) should be then measured against more or less objective metrics, or designed based on some kind of attempt at empirical evaluations vs. just going with what your gut tells will work.

Who is arguing for this though? You're strawmanning here. For the most part, no leftist is saying that gut judgements should be used to evaluate performance of policies. There's a reason why lots of leftists aren't really a fan of affirmative action anymore - it has mostly failed to address issues of inequality in attainment of secondary education except for mostly in the divide between men and women. Which part of Sanders' or Corbyn's platform was based on emotional gut feelings? They were, one and all, based on objective reasoning even if some people on the right might end up disagreeing with the policies in question. I'm really just not understanding where you're getting this idea that leftism is specifically more moralistic or emotional.
