SSC is Slate Star Codex, a subreddit/former website that at least a year ago had to stop this weekly newsdump discussion thing called "culture wars" because the the whole thing was slowly getting overwhelmed by neo-nazis, simply because most people don't like being near folks who believe that they shouldn't be allowed to vote/live/have rights due to where/what they were born as.

Scott Alexander was very confused at why having open nazis wasn't a good idea and blamed the people leaving for making the place unwelcome instead, so the people who left stayed away and found elsewhere to be, and then Scott approved this place called The Motte, which is supposedly nothing but the "culture wars" thing, but it's basically a hub for "race realism".
