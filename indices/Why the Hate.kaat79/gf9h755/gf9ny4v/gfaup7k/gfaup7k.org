I recall [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5xasve/d_friday_offtopic_thread/deh5iof/?context=3][one instance]] on this subreddit of outright Nazi content I had encountered here. The redditor I quoted there had made comments in other subreddits such as, "The Holocaust didn't happen, but it should have." He is now banned, thankfully.

If anyone has other examples of content like that in this community, I'd like to hear about it.
