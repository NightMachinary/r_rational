Not saying it's not still unrealistic, but you can change your ideology, not your ethnicity. Communism is more often presented as “people will understand how great it is!”, while ethnostates would require segregation. Even without active genocide, that sort of mass displacement never ends well (see the India / Pakistan thing) and even if done perfectly it would come at great human cost (such as splitting families and friends). In practice it's still calling for something that will cause a lot of pain for the sake of a very stupid and baseless theory.
