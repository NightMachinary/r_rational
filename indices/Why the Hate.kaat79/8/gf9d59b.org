To me, the name explains it all; *Rational* Fiction. - Which is emotionally correlated (whether it is true or not) with; "Smart people" fiction or; "Dumb people would not enjoy" fiction, which, if you don't happen to enjoy said fiction, and you are insecure about your intelligence; the very suggestion that Rational Fiction is good is a personal insult.

Combined with the fact that anyone at the end of a bell-curve is a minority, and that the favored target of "SneerClubs" mentioned in previous comments like to target things which exhibit an emotional reaction from them (such as what is mentioned above) and this community receiving hate seems kinda obvious to me.

That isn't even mentioning this community *is* kinda subtly snobbish (I mean, even my comment above wouldn't really be thought of as "Humble"). E.g. Just look at the comments on any story post of a not-really-rational fic. Half of it is strait up hate, the other half constructive criticism which to an insecure person is no different than hate. I mean, just look at the comments on Delve chapter posts; half of it is just snobby "why would you like this" subtly disguised as criticism.

Also, I have no idea what [[/r/aponty]] is talking about with nazi's I have never seen anything which even alludes to nazi's on here... - while the yudkowsky backlash is exactly the same as above.
