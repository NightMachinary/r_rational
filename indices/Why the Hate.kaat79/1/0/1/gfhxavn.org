Lesswrong (which I'd consider a predecessor to [[/r/rational]]) had a few disproportionately loud neoreactionaries (who are adjacent to neo-nazis, are the intellectual predecessors of the modern alt right, and which incubated people like Steve Bannon and by extension influenced Trump). Some of these neoreactionaries were participating as community members and others of whom were brigading and engaging in mass downvote spamming of anyone with leftist views. Many in the community tolerated them and embraced it in the name of "free speech". Yudkowsky himself firmly repudiated them and generally advocated downvoting and banning them, so it's a bit unfair to say that rational fiction (which was born largely from Yudkowsky) is tainted by assocation. Prior to that, intellectual predecessor OvercomingBias has also had a notable neoreactionary presence, probably in part to some of founder Robin Hanson's opinions. It's not super visible on this subreddit but if you know the history of things, it does make sense that people would associate that with us, even if most of us repudiate that.

  I can't help but think anyone who thinks that is so far left that anyone right of center looks like a Nazi.

I don't think Nazis are as far right from the center as you're thinking. You're imagining Nazis as this impossibly ridiculous far away point, rather than something which the populace fully embraced in recent history and which the populace is 100% capable of doing again with just a few steps to the right of the current scenario.
