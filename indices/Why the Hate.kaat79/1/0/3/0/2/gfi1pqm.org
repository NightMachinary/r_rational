The Rationalist community was born during the 2 years in which Eliezer Yudkowsky, author of [[http://www.hpmor.com/][/Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/]], blogged daily, first on Robin Hanson's blog, [[https://www.overcomingbias.com/][Overcoming Bias]], then later on his own blog called LessWrong. These blog posts are known as /[[http://web.archive.org/web/20161111231754/https://wiki.lesswrong.com/index.php?title=Sequences&oldid=5863][The]] [[http://web.archive.org/web/20170327154113/http://lesswrong.com/lw/72m/an_epub_of_eliezers_blog_posts/][Sequences]]/, and form the foundation of modern rationality discourse. For more on Eliezer's backstory, please see [[https://old.reddit.com/r/CultureWarRoundup/comments/iwu6wt/offtopic_and_loweffort_cw_thread_for_the_week_of/?limit=500#g6mns8z][my earlier comment]] on [[/r/CultureWarRoundup]].

A few years after Eliezer stopped blogging, LessWrong declined to the point of irrelevance and the community moved on to various other websites, an event known as the Rationalist diaspora. Scott Alexander (author of [[http://unsongbook.com/][/Unsong/]]), who had made a name for himself on LessWrong under the pseudonym Yvain, started a blog called [[https://web.archive.org/web/20200622131343/https://slatestarcodex.com/][Slate Star Codex]], which became /the/ major website of the diaspora. So popular was this website that it spawned it's own subreddit, [[/r/slatestarcodex]].

Like in a lot of other forums, political discussion started taking over the sub; the solution was to corral all political talk to a single recurring thread called the Culture War Thread, which quickly became the single most popular thread on the subreddit, accruing thousands of comments each week. Eventually, [[https://web.archive.org/web/20190222094427/https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/22/rip-culture-war-thread/][under pressure from critics]] (most notably [[/r/SneerClub]]), Scott decided to evict the thread from the sub. Those who wanted to continue the thread created a new subreddit, [[/r/TheMotte]], where the thread continues to this day. You can think of it as the rationalist politics subreddit, much like this is the rationalist fiction subreddit.

And you didn't ask about this one, but since it will probably come up, [[/r/CultureWarRoundup]] is a competing alternative to [[/r/TheMotte]] created by users who were dissatisfied with the latter's moderation policies.
