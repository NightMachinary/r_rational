Completely agree with everything; I've yet to actually see a single comment/post/story in any of the communities I follow which is supportive of Nazi's or their ideals. I can't help but think anyone who thinks that is so far left that anyone right of center looks like a Nazi.

Hope I get some replies with counter examples; would be really interesting to see, but the bookclub of weird tastes is spot on. Add to that what the name of the book club implies and of course you get haters.
