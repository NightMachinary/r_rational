  The gist of it was that materialist promises of salvation are false and polyamory is harmful to all its participants (both common themes in 'rationalist' works).

Materialism, maybe, arguable. But polyamory ? If the people involved are happy there's no issue as far as I can see. This view that there's a right way to do things and anyone that doesn't follow that way is doing it wrong, regardless of how they feel or think is disturbing.

​

It reminds me of anti lgbt propaganda. "There's a right way to do things, if anybody disagrees they are wrong regardless of how they feel or think" and "their happiness has a cost, think of their parents, how they feel".

​

It's a shit argument. If your argument is that being happy is only right and proper when there are no costs associated with it, you are automatically a bigot, because it applies to everything. To racism (x race being happier makes some people less happy), to communism (less wealth inequality makes some people less happy)..

​

I might be interpreting it wrong but if that's your argument, I'm sorry but it's a terrible one.
