I wrote up a criticism from a classical conservative point of view if you're interested, although it less applies to this sub than others in the 'rationalist community.'

  Those who fetishize 'rationality' often end up holding a reductionist view of humanity, human relationships, and meaning. Human beings are more than the sum of their parts. We are more than just pain and pleasure receptors glued to a processing unit.

  But in believing that we are just that, many 'rationalists' end up with strange conclusions about what is possible and desirable for humanity as we are. And that sometimes results in a belief in progress regardless of the human cost. Because, if we'll all be better off in a hedonium, isn't Thiel's techno-libertarianism the best way forward? Of course, when confronted with a political reality where those ideas are alien, there is tendency to support the subversion of the established order towards the interests of great men (tech entrepreneurs) who share those ideals. And that (revolution + hierarchy) is the foundation of fascism.

This place isn't nearly as bad as other 'rationalist' subs. It's mostly just slightly weird with a lot of needless convolution and over-complication. I only visit occasionally because it sometimes intersects with progression fantasy or plays with tropes.
