Uh, you might want to spell check that post, I literally can't understand some of the words.

But anyway my point was not about the fact that politics have a lot of appeals to emotion - that might be worth complaining but it's a widespread habit. It was about the irrationality of some of the fundamental theory adopted on the left, which traces its roots back to philosophers like Foucault. Anyone can fall into an emotional trap, but rationalizing how emotional traps are actually good and a legitimate epistemological approach means you'll throw yourself into them willingly.

(and I'm not sure what would be a Trump conspiracy theory, but the guy was plenty despicable and enraging without any need for those)
