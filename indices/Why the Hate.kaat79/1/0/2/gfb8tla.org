  I've yet to actually see a single comment/post/story in any of the communities I follow which is supportive of Nazi's or their ideals. I can't help but think anyone who thinks that is so far left that anyone right of center looks like a Nazi.

I think the problem there tends to be that a lot of people on that side of the political spectrum are really enmeshed in what I'd call "emotion politics" - politics all based around people's feelings as the one metric by which all should be judged. I tend to think that's not really a solid way of doing politics - after all, the racist likely /feels/ deeply scared and worried about those violent thugs who want nothing but to rape his daughters, and yet somehow I doubt we should pay that feeling too much heed - and that since all politics involves compromise and agreement between multiple parties, it can only be built on things on which entire groups can agree on, namely, shared, measurable elements of reality. I think a lot of people around here would probably inclined to think the same way (given the nature of the community itself), and so that probably creates a significant ideological rift.
