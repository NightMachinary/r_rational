I think our main difference is that you think that people are more influenced by and predicted by broader ideologies than I do. Maybe it's just where I live, but no-one I know identifies themselves by parties like that.

Also, more than the specifics of the philosophy, what I'm talking about is the feasibility of determining ideologies and attributing actions to those ideologies. In my experience, trying to measure a shift in localised, contemporary ideology from the ground level is doomed from the start. I'm not saying it can't be done, but I don't think a discussion and feelings of peer pressure are enough evidence.

I think you've heard my main points, and I think I understand yours. I've probably spent too much time on this, so I might stop here, though I'll still read any reply.
