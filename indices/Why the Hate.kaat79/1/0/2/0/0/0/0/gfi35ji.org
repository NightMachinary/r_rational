I am saying this is an example of a general philosophical trend towards making subjectivity and feelings not just drivers for action, but the lynchpin of political discourse (didn't say anything about “left academia”: that people who seek discovery and change with an open mind tend to be left wing is hardly surprising).

Basically, I believe “objectivity may be impossible to achieve, but all the more needs to be something we strive for”. This philosophy tends to be more “objectivity is impossible to achieve, therefore it is worthless and just a mask used to hide reactionary ideas”. Also, the philosophy then trickles down into popular discourse and becomes dumbed down, losing whatever nuance it had.

  That this means it's hard for left to tell if a [[/r/rational][r/rational]] comment is Nazi or just right.

No. I mean that this leads to considering any comment advocating for rationality or objectivity as /intrinsically/ reactionary, because those are just the names existing systems of power give to the status quo.
