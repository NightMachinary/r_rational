Oh, I'm not saying wingnuts on either side are more rational. My point is that the left isn't just full of people who act emotional, it's also full of sophisticated theories that /rationalise/ acting emotionally and make it sound like a very good thing and, in fact, the only right way of doing politics. That way, by the usual mechanisms of polarisation, the concept of acting rationally instead becomes purvey of the right - who gets to scream "FACTS DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS!" in between ranting how climate change is a hoax, COVID is just a flu that's being exploited by Bill Gates to inject us all with microchips, Trump didn't lose but was a victim of a strange, elaborate and ineffable conspiracy and democrats have satanic pedophiliac orgies in the basement of a pizza parlor.

I mean, there is absolutely no question that the right is in practice the most detached from actual reality and rationality. And lo and behold, on lots of topics the left absolutely /does/ appeal to it, because well, it makes sense. But the general discourse is very emotion-focused on a lot of things, even when you could actually make excellent rational cases for the same things. Left wing Twitter, when it's not busy dunking on whatever's the reason of the day to get /absolutely indignant/, reads much like a self-help book. I agree with all the core values, but frankly the packaging these days makes me facepalm a lot.
