Obviously, in the sense of feelings as driver to action. However, if for example you want to design a legal system, you can't decide to punish people just based on how their victims feel about their crimes. Because it becomes a social endeavour, you need to build credibility with all parties involved, and that can only be done on the basis of our shared reality. If all you tell me is “I feel this way!” I don't even know if you're telling the truth, and can't possibly check. Also even if you are, your feelings might be rooted in a faulty understanding of the world. Right now lots of Trump voters seem to feel that they won the election, should we give it to them because they're crying louder than anyone else?
