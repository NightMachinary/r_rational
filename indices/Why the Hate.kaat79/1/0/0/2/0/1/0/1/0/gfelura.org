  I mean I don't know about this other definition, but people are also taught to respect other cultures, even though they cut off the genitals of people, or respect other ways of raising children, even though they are physically abused, or a bunch of other things.

That sounds massively fucked up and I'm happy I wasn't raised that way. Respect for people in cultures makes sense. But for the practices themselves?
