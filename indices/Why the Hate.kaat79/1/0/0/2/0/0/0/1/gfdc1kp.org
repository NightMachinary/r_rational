To play devil's advocate, "remove" doesn't necessarily mean "kill." In the US, white nationalists and black nationalists are often surprisingly cordial with each other, because they fundamentally agree with each other's goal; separation of the population based on race.

Sure, everyone I've ever seen advocate for an ethnostate also ends up advocating for genocide at some point so it's entirely reasonable to be suspicious of them, but my point is just that the two ideas are not /necessarily/ linked.
