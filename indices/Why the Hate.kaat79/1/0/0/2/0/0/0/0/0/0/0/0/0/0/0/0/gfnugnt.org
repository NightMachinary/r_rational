  I just wanted to point out that I don't think the two things are really at the same level. So if you wanted to make a distinction, you could. I'm not saying that's where the line for censorship ought to be traced, but if you did trace it there, the distinction would not be entirely arbitrary.

Oh well actually, I would completely agree there, so with respect to the original point of this discussion I guess we were arguing if race-realsim is 98% or 99% bad XD.

But to expand on this and explain why I wouldn't draw a line at race-realism; to use an aircraft engineering metaphor;

to me race realism is like cutting a hole in the wing to reduce weight; It immediately damages performance, looks ugly, and if not repaired can expand and keep tearing until the whole wing falls off.

While Communism is like loosening a bolt in the engine to make it quieter; It seems to make the flight nicer, is completely undetectable without an inspection, and will eventually lead to catastrophe when the engine explodes with no-one the wiser.

They both end in disaster (and this is the criteria I would use for censorship IF it is necessary) one of them is more damaging in the short-term but the other is way more dangerous.

For the first two points, I agree/will concede them mostly with the above example as the revised reasoning.
