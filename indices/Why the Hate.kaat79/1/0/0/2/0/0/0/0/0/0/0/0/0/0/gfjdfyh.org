  It's circular reasoning, is what I'm saying. It creates a problem, then sells itself as the only solution to that problem.

I don't disagree this this; you are arguing WHY race-realism doesn't work which I agree it doesn't.

  But race realism isn't about reducing poverty at all.

Oh but it is! Just as much as Communism is:\\
Communism is:\\
*Look at the poor people*\\
*Look at the successful entrepreneurs earning more than you*\\
"They are the problem!"\\
While Race-realism is:\\
*Look at the poor people*\\
*Look at the successful immigrants who are earning more than you*\\
"They are the problem!"

Both of these are about making a better society according to those who believe in them.

  It postulates that people are more unhappy when they live in mixed communities.

I mean if you are arguing that Race-realists care about overall happiness, and Communists about equal financial freedom then sure, I don't think that matters, the point is both are well-intentioned, and both are catastrophic when attempted to be implemented.

If you are arguing that most race-realists are doing it for selfish reasons, while most communists are doing it for altruistic reasons then sure, I don't think I disagree with that either, and in my opinion a political opinion should not be banned because it is correlated with bad intentions. If you think otherwise that's a different discussion I guess.

Uh, I thought your original reply was to my "political opinions should not be banned", so you meant he probably shouldn't be banned but you wouldn't call his opinion merely "political"?
