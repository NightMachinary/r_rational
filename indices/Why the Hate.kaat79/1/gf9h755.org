I've never heard anything about this sneerclub or nazi issue before (in fact, this subreddit seems solidly left to me), but I do follow some literature groups. From the conversations I've had and threads I've read on here, I'm fairly sure that many rational readers (myself included) are massive STEM nerds who judge literature by unusual standards.

This subreddit is basically a 'safe space' for disregarding normal conversational and literary conventions. People tend to be more honest and rambling, and no-one really mocks others for that. I would bet that many people in these circles are either somewhat autistic or socially inept, if for no other reason than that sort of behaviour is more accepted here.

Also, everyone here seems to be having great fun using pretentious words and phrases, and earnestly sharing what they know without fear of being thought arrogant. I really enjoy that about this community, since there aren't many places you can do that, but it looks really weird from the outside.

Essentially, I've always felt [[/r/rational][r/rational]] is like a group of weird science kids who started their own book club where they can be themselves (maybe because I was in such a book club when I was younger). This on its own is enough to draw hate, I think.
