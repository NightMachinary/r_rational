I just want to say that I've never seen hate targeted at [[/r/rational]] and I've never been attacked because I post here.

I don't doubt it happens but I suspect if it occurs at all it's from people who've taken one glance at the name of the subreddit and made their judgements from that. An optics issue.

Plus, this subreddit doesn't exactly align with what the average book reader would expect if you asked them what rational is (a cold book of logic, whereas ther is plenty of character and emotion is in many of the stories [though not MoL really] popular here).

Either way it's not a problem, the subreddit isn't raided or harassed and if anything keeping the subreddit niche will be better for long term quality.
