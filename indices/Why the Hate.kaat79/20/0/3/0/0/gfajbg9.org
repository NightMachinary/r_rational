I don't dissagree; it is a good character trait to not feel threatened by people who have certain skills which are better than yours. It doesn't change the fact that loosing in a game elisits negative feelings in most cases and perceived inteligence is especially touchy for many people. I guess I should not have used a board statement in this case, many people do not have animosity to someone suggested to be more intelligent than themselves, but many do, especially if there are other factors which they already dislike that person for (such as not sharing the same fiction tastes).

And ironically, I also agree that holding this perspective may be correlated with arseholeness. It doesn't make it any less true though.
