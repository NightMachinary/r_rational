Actually, I think these are *both* the problem; if you are smarter than someone, they will have instinctive animosity towards you because of that. If you act in any way which *implies* that you are smarter than them, they will have instinctive animosity at that as well (in this case, whether you actually are or not).

This subreddit existing is literally implying "we are two smart for regular fiction", and [[/r/VioletNaofumi]] 's example is also a perfect example of this; He didn't tell anyone they didn't like logic, he just applied it better (or implied he was doing it better) than those who took issue with that. The only solution to this animosity is not doing anything which someone can imply from that you are better than them at something (pretending to be dumb). And acknowledging that this is the case makes the same people madder and is the attitude that you mention.

My conclusion though, is simply by existing we will get hate, and by acknowledging we will get hate for it we will get more hate; Nether of these two do I think we should not do, "existing" and "not pretending to be dumb" will put people off, but are both the whole point of rationality.
