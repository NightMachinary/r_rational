Wild, I knew about the Nazi problem, but I didn't realise it might be worse here than in other communities. Might be because I mostly frequent [[/r/rational][r/rational]] and don't go to LessWrong at all really. Also had no idea SneerClub existed.

I double-checked reddit rules and I don't think this is actually against them, so I'll just say the thread was on SpaceBattles.
