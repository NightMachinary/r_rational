Isn't it obvious why this is? Half of the time when the word "nazi" is used it's not used against actual Nazis but against "the kind of people we don't like". The kind of people who post at [[/r/rational][r/rational]] are far more likely to have been bullied at school than average; we all know how this game is played. Any rhetorical weapon, even if it's literally anti-bullying rules, is immediately weaponized by the powerful and against the powerless.

Speaking less hypothetically, a while back I posted that I didn't think Strong Female Protagonist is rational, and I got a comment back saying that it must be because "my politics" causes me to find it strange to see lesbian characters do good things. I found this to be incredibly baffling, and it was a little disturbing to see that sort of thing get upvoted. I don't think it's paranoid to think that casually slinging the word "Nazi" around is an attempt to move the overton window to a rather unpleasant place.

Don't get me wrong: I hated the far-right presence on Less Wrong back in the day, and I much prefer the friendly atmosphere we have here now. But I don't want this subreddit to become rationalwiki either.
