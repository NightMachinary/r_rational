Oh come on, that's stretching the definition of infohazard beyond all usefulness.

Plus, you're pulling a Motte and Bailey on me here. You're arguing that you can't post the link because it's an infohazard. But if infohazard just means "things some people won't want to know / see" then a simple spoiler tag would suffice. There's absolutely nothing wrong with posting Harry Potter spoilers, as long as you mark them as such.

And it still makes absolutely not sense why a piece of Scott Alexander writing would qualify as an infohazard.

Of course, that just means that I have no choice but to speculate as to your motivations die not posting that link. The most reasonable assumption seems to be that you're a libertarian and you don't want to link to anything that exposes libertarianism as nonsense. Which doesn't reflect well on you. And this pure speculation of course, but I can't really think of other explanations here.
