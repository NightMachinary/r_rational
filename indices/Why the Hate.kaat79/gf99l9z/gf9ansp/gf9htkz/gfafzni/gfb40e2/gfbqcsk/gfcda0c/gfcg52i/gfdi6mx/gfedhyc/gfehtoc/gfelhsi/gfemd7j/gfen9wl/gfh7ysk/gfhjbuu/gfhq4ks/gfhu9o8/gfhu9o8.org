  And even if it is the best practice, neither you nor I have the capacity (unless I am very mistaken) to restrict access to information on an internet-wide scale, which inherently limits options with regards to total obfuscation.

In the US at least, the methods of control are all about binding individuals who are specifically read into information - the information itself is only indirectly controlled per se. No worries there!

  Normal classified information and secrecy really isn't the same thing at all, IMO; fundamentally different best practices apply when dealing with information that's genuinely harmful in its own right than when dealing with information that you'd just rather someone not have access to because it would hurt your position, especially when in the former case access to the information itself can't be easily controlled.

I see where you're coming from, but disagree. The existing infrastructure/incentives are indeed mostly built around individual organizations (small groups all the way up to nation-states) restricting what would be detrimental for /them/ to be public knowledge, but in the case of context-independent infohazards each group will be likely to come to the same conclusion. If you're looking for a "pure" infohazard, look for the kind of info that the US classifies as soon as they can, that Russia desperately seek and then classifies, that China desperately seeks and then classifies, etc. Many such cases can be explained by the powerful seeking to maintain relative advantages, but there are a few instances where it's leaked far enough that relative advantage is no longer a plausible explanation.
