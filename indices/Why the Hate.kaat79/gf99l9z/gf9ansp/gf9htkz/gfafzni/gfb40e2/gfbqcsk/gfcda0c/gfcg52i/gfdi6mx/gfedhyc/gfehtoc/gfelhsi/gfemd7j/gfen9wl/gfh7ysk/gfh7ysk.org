Can I make a suggestion? I have had the idea for a while that the best way to deal with an infohazard is not to reveal absolutely nothing no matter how much someone asks (that just increases the odds they'll get curious and check the source), but to act as a go-between, answering their questions as best you can without exposing them in order to assuage their curiosity, and warning them before questions that have an increased risk of accidental exposure to the hazardous idea, suggesting alternative questions that can be more safely answered and might still provide satisfaction.

I really don't think it's very productive to insult the person you're trying to protect from a putative infohazard, by the way. I get the frustration, but that does not decrease the risk of their curiosity getting the better of them.
