Scott Alexander started out as fairly left-wing, but in recent years has been becoming more and more libertarian. I think this is a case of the fan base influencing the author. As you and others have pointed out, his social media channels got infested by nazis. But they also got invested by libertarians, and while the nazis have been mostly pushed out, the libertarians are still there, and they rule the place.

It's a real shame. His writing is still excellent in most cases, but whenever he talks about politics these days, libertarian bullshit pops up more and more often.
