Yang ran as a Democrat. He supported medicare for all, lots of action against climate change, wants to expand paid-leave, wants to reduce income inequality, wans to reduce tuition costs, and of course most famously supported an UBI.

He's a social-democrat, and a fairly left-leaning one at that.

If you think Yang is a libertarian I can see why you'd mistake Scott for one though. Virtually everyone would be a libertarian by that metric.
