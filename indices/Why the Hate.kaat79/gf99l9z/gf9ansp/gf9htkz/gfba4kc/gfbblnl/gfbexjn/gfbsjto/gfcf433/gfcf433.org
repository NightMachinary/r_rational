Instead of judging views through the lens of politics, why not judge it through the lens of decency? If I announce that I'm in favor of destroying your family and chasing them out of their homes, or if I consider some of your friends barely better than animals based on their looks, then my opinions have no place in any place of discussion that is trying to have an actually positive purpose.
