Then pick a new term, because we've already been over the ways this one doesn't work.

  We're talking about whether it is the case that dog whistles are only understood by their targets, and the answer to that question is no.

The word "only" is doing all the work there. I certainly hope that there are feds who are up on current extremist lingo, but it's 2020. Internet cultures move fast. A random redditor who can't stand to be in the same sub as even a single person who might be in that ballpark is much more likely to have read an article or two on 90's lingo and pretend they're an expert because they know what "1488" means. Notably, the person who kicked this off couldn't even supply a single example of a deciphered "dog whistle", couldn't seem to bear to even look at their purported examples, and had to dig deep, in a field of hundreds of thousands of comments, to find a single example of open bigotry (which had no effort to obscure it).

This is like a 5th grader telling you they cracked Enigma.
