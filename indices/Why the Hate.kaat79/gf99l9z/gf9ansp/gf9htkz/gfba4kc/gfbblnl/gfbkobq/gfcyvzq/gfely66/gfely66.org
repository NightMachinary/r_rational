Then the metaphor fundamentally doesn't work. Frankly, the premise that you can understand your outgroup's specifically coded lingo better than they can is just delusional. With effort and study you can get there, sure, albeit with some /FellowKids energy. But from this joker, who clearly isn't even reading his own examples, culled from a community that makes a virtue out of refusing to engage with their outgroup? It's the same energy as the Satanic Panic pastor insisting he knows all the Satanist code words.
