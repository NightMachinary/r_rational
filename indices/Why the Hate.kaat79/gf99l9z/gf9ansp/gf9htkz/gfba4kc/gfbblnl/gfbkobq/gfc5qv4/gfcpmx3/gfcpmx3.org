  Sneerclub prioritizes mockable examples,
#+end_quote

Sneerclub prioritizes being garbage. If they had a more blatant example to point to instead of this interpretive song and dance routine, then they'd do that instead of wallowing in garbage.

#+begin_quote
  Additionally, a year or two ago sneerclub mods asked users to stop posting themotte links unless they were really off the wall simply because it was too low hanging fruit.
#+end_quote

Then there should be some really off the wall quotes from the 2000 comments posted since Monday! The fact that there aren't is, at this point, strong Bayesian evidence that they don't exist in sufficient rates to justify your claims about the community.

#+begin_quote
  And now I think I can't convince you regardless of evidence. There is a documented pattern of alt-righters using euphemistic language. If you are going to dismiss even blatant usage of racists euphemisms and lingo in the name of charity almost nothing will convince you.
#+end_quote

Considering that I've been a frequent poster there since the Obama administration, yeah, I'd like to see some actual evidence of all the Nazis I managed to miss. Instead of these pathetic anti-examples from someone so clearly allergic to different ideas. Ok, McCarthy, I'm sure you're the expert on the devious codes the kids use these days.

#+begin_quote
  someone that doesn't understand IQ or the effects of colonialism
#+end_quote

No, that's your failure, along with the followup. This really isn't appropriate to argue in detail in this subreddit, so I'll just note that you managed to misunderstand the claims being made, or speculated in both quoted comments. The selective editing speaks of bad faith, too.

The third one, whatever it's correctness, is not actually a good post by the sub's standards; the first half is just reiterating one of the very claims being argued, and the second half is a mod-baiting insult that doesn't even try to make an argument.

I understand that that kind of low-effort swiping is fine at Sneerclub, or most of the rest of the internet, but themotte is at least trying to be better. For example, consider the /very next reply/, which highlights a problematic implication for that "actual answer".

#+begin_quote
  lethal force against BLM protestors
#+end_quote

That's an outrageous characterization of that position, unless you think the modal BLM protester is a violent pedophile in the middle of physically attacking a minor.

#+begin_quote
  And have some good old Race "Science"
#+end_quote

Yes, the newest reply there definitely has someone saying that racism isn't bad. It only took us 8 curated examples to find one in a thread with 3500 comments.

I doubt this convinced you of anything, but please, the next time you see something linked on sneerclub that seem /obviously/ wrong and outrageous and terrible, come argue against it.
