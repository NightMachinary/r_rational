What's really noteworthy in your first link is that the guy who called out the nazi got banned for it. And that's a pattern on SSC, unfortunately. You can say the most heinous things, as long as you say them politely, but you can't call them out, because that's a personal attack.

This goes all the way up to the top. This is how Scott Alexander himself moderates as well. I don't think it's ill will. I think it's naive optimism about how humans work. But the results are rather disastrous.

I once got banned from the old Slatestarcodex for calling someone a failure of a human being. The person I responded to, who was saying we should shoot ships of immigrants trying to cross the Mediterranean and then let the survivors drown, faced no consequences.

I'm still a fan of Scott. But yeah, he's a terrible moderator, and the people he appointed are terrible moderators too.
