  discussion norms focused on principle of charity and steel-mannning even heinous ideas let alt-righter and crypto fascists get a foot hold. See argentstonecutters linked Twitter thread why this is a bad idea.

My problem with this is, it's not like the alternatives work especially better. The approach "we don't talk about this; and if you say anything that sounds remotely like this we'll shun you on principle without even deigning you of an explanation as to WHY we think your ideas are wrong" also produces pretty bad effects. It's how right wing ideas got to pose as "counterculture" and as "this is the stuff the liberal Ã©lite doesn't want you to know" and so on. Frankly I have a general feeling that looking for this or that cause of the rise of the alt-right in the way we conduct discourse is a bit of a moot point. The real causes are probably rooted in much deeper issues - economic and social transformations, as well as the memory of WW2 just getting further and further away - and everything else is simply accidental.
