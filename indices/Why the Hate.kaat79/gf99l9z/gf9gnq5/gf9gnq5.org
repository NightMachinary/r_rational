I think it's also important to realize the connection the name has to the alt-right. Especially the "rational thinkers" on youtube who are all alt-righters and often a gateway for young men to those ideas. The idea of rationalist fiction as a gateway to radicalize young men is something someone puts forward in the SneerClub link (re: Yudowsky's writing specifically). I think in part because of this.

On the one hand I can see it. Authors don't often respect the ideas put forward by feminist critique, this is especially obvious when the author appears to barely have a surface level understanding of the literature. And a more blatant omission when the modern understanding of culture is completely lacking from the work. Which is an obvious failure of attempting to be rational (at both a surface level, and a deeper level, that it's probably hard to deconstruct tropes without proper cultural context). Which leads into the "I am very smart" trope, and blatantly missing ideas of soft power and bias in society.

On the other, the critique feels like a failing of "don't ascribe to malice, that which can be ascribed to stupidity". A lot of authors in this space are not professionals (the fact it's a lot of fanfiction proving the point), and in fact a lot of amateur media has these problems, and often a lot more implicit. I'd point to the overall shittiness that is most romantic fan fiction, and the professional works of the genre like Twilight and 50 Shades (a comparison I make in part because progression fantasies / litRPGs are the trashy literature genre aimed at masculinty (of which rational is often a sub-genre); in much the same way people view romance literature as that for femininity). Both genre's most popular authors are not great on these issues, and both have popular novels which are. Which returns to my point about most people just not being educated on the topic.

It's hard to talk about because it is part of the "culture war". So to me critiques like this ring hollow, especially when they attack how characters' internal thoughts are presented. I feel like the better parts of the genre are closer to hbomberguy's critique of the youtube rational thinkers: maintaining the persona, while changing the content. Which is to say hbomberguy comes off as a sort of cringe gamer pseudo-intellectual (this is his character) but uses it to counter people who often take that personality to talk about alt-right issues (in a way, a positive role model for that character). And I think part of what feels frustrating about these critiques is they draw a line between how authors in this genre present characters and the ideas it is often used to present. Which can be frustrating when, as a reader of the genre, I often identify with the way the characters are being presented (and I recognize the inherent bias that comes with that identification; the lack of emotionality relating back to toxic masculinity's suppression of displaying emotion; but some works use this to their advantage to display the bias). To say nothing of the inter-sectional problems such critiques often fail to be cognizant of (neuro-atypicalness; nerds/populars; etc.).

I don't know the answer, but I avoid the topic in general because it appears to be a culture war problem, where neither side seems to have taken a women's studies nor an anthropology class (nor the honest self-directed educational equivalent). It's basically just people shouting at each other. Hence why my personal view is to ignore the vague aspersions of hate, enjoy what I enjoy, and engage with people one on one if the topic comes up.
