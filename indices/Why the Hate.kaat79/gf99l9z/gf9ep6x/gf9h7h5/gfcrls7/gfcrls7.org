Also recommendations to certain fanfictions that have decidedly fascist themes. About every other month or so, somebody will recommend a fanfic of "Saga of Tanya the Evil", which follows the main character's entrance into post-WWI German politics. The fanfic is a straight-up apologia for Hitler, with the main character following all the same beats as Hitler's rise to power, all the while framing it as a misunderstanding and the result of overzealous underlings. Yet it somehow keeps being posted.
