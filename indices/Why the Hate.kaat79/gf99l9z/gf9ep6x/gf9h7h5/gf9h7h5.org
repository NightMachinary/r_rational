I haven't personally directly seen alt-righter content on [[/r/rational]] but I have seen recommendations of SSC without sufficient (or in some cases any) warnings about the alt-right infestation it had. And when I did post warnings about it in response to recommendations they ended up somewhat controversial with only a net one or two upvotes.
