Yudowksy, who has a very polarizing personality, draws hate. I guess he founded the sub or something? I'm sure other users can tell you all about him.

I come to the sub for the recs, as I do enjoy rational fiction and one of the best parts of the community is people who like rational fiction are actually capable of rational discussions. Other communities that discuss fiction on Reddit have really let me down when I feel like actually discussing a novel critically; not so here.
