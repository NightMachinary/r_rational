In the link, I believe he's describing cultural things, where it's a mix of politics and culture. One example is that whether or not you own a Ford F-150 pickup truck isn't a political statement, but if you meet somebody and see them in a big F-150, you can make a pretty decent guess as to their general politics. Food is not a political statement, but whether you eat organic vegan gluten free cousine, drink Soylent for most meals, or have a BBQ every weekend is information that informs politics. That's because politics are downstream of culture and the same goes with literature.

Rationalist fiction being doomed is part of a greater trend of rationalists and the rationality movement being on the decline. You're right that I didn't give strong evidence for it here, but it's a general trend I've seen.
