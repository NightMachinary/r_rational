I think you are missing the point of sneerclub. Sneerclub doesn't have high minded ideals, they see stuff that they think is stupid, then they make fun of it. People periodically make serious posts and are reminded by the mods that sneerclub is primarily about what is funny and not for serious discussion. The serious discussion goes on, because there isn't really a place for counter-rationalist thought elsewhere, but it isn't the goal of sneerclub.

As to the stereotype... I see lots of posts on sneerclub linking Twitter threads by Silicon valley entrepreneur types with completely stupid takes on things outside their expertise, so this view doesn't rely on stereotypes alone. And yes occasionally EY has a bad or weird take that gets linked. His posts on GPT-3 seem to misunderstand how it actually works so much so to make one question his knowledge of AI as a field or to speculate that he was being intentionally alarmist.

As for the view on HPMOR, I recall several sneerclub threads with highly upvoted posts pointing out that HPMOR ends with Harry slaughtering a bunch of Fascists, so the people that care are aware that EY didn't intend to promote Neo-Nazis initially and that it's a more organic unintended outcome.

Some of the hate for HPMOR does focus on the way it seems to sneer at the whimsical world building of Harry Potter, but I think that form of hate is primarily found in spacebattles and HPfanfiction and not in sneerclub.
