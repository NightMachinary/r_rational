I've been. Lovely chaps. Still pointing to this as evidence for the idea that ratfic is a gateway drug to fascism is so amazingly petty.

The only time I ever got curious enough to check who it was that was ranting about rationalists on tumbler I found a) a tankie who believed that murder was a construct of bourgeoisie morality and that liberals were obsessed with sexual freedom so they couldn't realize the obvious fact that women raped by nazis deserved to be lynched b) someone who maybe ironically advocated for voluntary human extinction c) a *shudder* rational wiki editor oh and also d) there was the one right winger who railed against it being a cuckold conspiracy or something (oddly enough not mentioning anything about jews). And these guys weren't my top picks or anything. They were just the first clicks that I found cussing at rationalists.

Of course it doesn't really mean anything aside from the fact that trolling is easy. As long as you can point out other people doing stupid shit anonymously and not have to explain any of your own dumbass behavior it's impossible to lose a mud slinging competition.
