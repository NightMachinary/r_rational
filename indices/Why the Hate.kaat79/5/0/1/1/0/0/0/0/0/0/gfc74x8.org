well, to me neoliberalism /is/ a very right wing ideology. it is borne out of the policies of ronald reagan and margaret thatcher. i view economic issues as being the primary pole of ideology - so regardless of where you find yourself on civil liberties, a libertarian is a right ideology because of its stance on economic issues; the same is true of neoliberalism.
