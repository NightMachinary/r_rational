This is 100% nonsense. Gamergate literally began as a harassment campaign targeting women involved in gaming that evolved out of another harassment campaign targeting one specific woman involved in gaming, and it remained (and to the extent it still exists, continues to remain) nothing but a harassment campaign orchestrated by channers.

Literally everything in your post is just the usual justifications for the vicious hate campaign masquerading as concerns about ethics in gaming journalism that were unleashed on every woman in sight. Fuck that shit, and let nobody here be misled, it is rank nonsense to the point where even Wikipedia doesn't give it any thrift.
