Gamergate began with a woman abusing her boyfriend, continued when no one would give him voice to complain, and when he resorted to fringe media to find someone who would give him a rudimentary platform, it quickly merged with the preexisting amorphous backlash against that woman's game development work (for a very generous definition of 'game'). Zoe Quinn was not a victim, but a sociopathic abuser.

It got out of hand, to be sure, but it was fueled by real problems and started by real offenses. And it got out of hand on both sides at approximately the same speed and level of vitriol.
