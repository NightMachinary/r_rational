I have little doubt that I would be horrendously disappointed by their notion of "nuance". Every 6 months or so they get brought up, and I find myself thinking that I ought to give them another chance, for the sake of charity. I scroll through their front page, read the comments, and it's usually /literally nothing/ but vapid vitriol, as in, not a single comment even trying to be thoughtful, or fair, or insightful. They openly scorn effortposts, in general. That place might be the saddest cesspit on reddit. It's like a monument to sour grapes.
