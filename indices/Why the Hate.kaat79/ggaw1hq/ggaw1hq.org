1. HPMOR is the first example brought up a vast majority of the time when people see wiki pages on rational fics. HPMOR is also extremely smug and not very well written (nor is it even particularly rational!).

2. "Rational" explanations for fictional phenomena often fall flat, even if a casual viewer can't explain why. "Blaster bolts in Star Wars exhibit x/y/z properties, meaning they are likely laser beams exerting gigawatts every time they so much as nudge a character" ignores a lack of exhibited effects such as "the bolts clearly not being lightspeed" and "the bolts not turning people into fine mist" and is a bad explanation because of that. The average Star Wars user won't know exactly what the issue is, but they'll pick up that someone is waving smart where they aren't.

3. Some people just suck. People exist whose engagement with fiction doesn't go beyond "picture and word bright and cool" and get upset when Thinkers:tm: are pointed out even if they're as simple as "hey isn't that his mom he's banging" or "why didn't he shoot the swordsman with his gun". I don't think these people are in the majority (online at least) but they definitely exist.
