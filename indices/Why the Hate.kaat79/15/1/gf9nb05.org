I think you've got the more likely case. The blue tribe is essentially policing a heresy, and the grey tribe's defenses against a blue tribe attack aren't nearly as well-developed as its defenses against a red tribe attack. (Also notably missing defenses against red tribe infiltration).

There's the remote possibility that the grey tribe establishes an identity it can be proud of, and becomes able to resist attention from the other major cultural players. Until then, attrition and security in obscurity.
