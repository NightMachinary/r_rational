It's a political/tribal reaction. Rationalism and by extension rational literature is [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/][grey tribe]]. To put it in short grey tribe is a cluster of personality traits of tech nerds: they're rationalist, highly online, atheist, not into sports, highly affluent, and so on... and these nerds like a particular brand of fiction.

Grey tribe is a subset of the general blue tribe (liberal umbrella group), but has been splitting away from it for some time for various reasons (too many to cover now). This accelerated after 2016. A prime example would be reddit going from from loving everything Elon Musk did to hating anything he does nowadays. Nobody can hate you quite like someone who shares /almost all/ of your views. For a parallel, think of how big and important the early 2000s atheism movement was, and now it's basically an unpopular shell that gets derided from both sides.

Back to rational and rationalist fiction, it's a hallmark of grey tribe so it gets attacked. Rational*ist* fiction is even explicitly evangelical of it's mode of thinking, which makes it more of a target. It was popular and accepted within blue tribe a decade ago because it had science and coherent stories, but times change. However, I should note that, it's not like humans are robots that get updates on marching orders. It takes time for the mobs to disseminate that something is uncool or 'problematic' in this case.

But it's a slow grind and likely won't reverse. Rationalists will keep disappearing, either joining blue tribe orthodoxy, sublimating over to red tribe, or learning to keep quiet about rationality.
