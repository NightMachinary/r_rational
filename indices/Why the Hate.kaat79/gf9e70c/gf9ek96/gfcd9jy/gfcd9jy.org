That doesn't mean she's wrong.

I realy don't like that Violet is getting piled on here. Yes, I get it, she worded it awkwardly and it's very low status to point out the true and accurate fact that this is a sub for high-iq people and that that's why we like stories that features complex plots and can relate to high-IQ protagonists. But gosh darnit, it's still true.

Also, Eliezer Yudkowsky and Scott A. are both Jewish intellectuals and I'm gonna go ahead and say that that's maybe got at least *something* to do with the absolutely ridiculous amounts of virulent hate they get.

It's not 'rational' to blame ourselves for everything, guys. That's just reversed stupidity. The truth is, there's a lot of "those uppity liberal rational types think they're better than us and they need teaching a lesson" going on and I have no desire to steelman that.

(I should clarify that none of my annoyance here is directed at you CouteauBleu, and that your above reply is still true overall)
