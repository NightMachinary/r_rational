  I don't think I am too smart for regular fiction, in fact, I like a lot of fantasy novels...

The point is you *didn't* say that, but that is what is implied when not clarifying.

  I am a she but yeah

Apologies

#+begin_quote
  my point was that a lot of people seem to dislike when we use logic in fiction...
#+end_quote

And I am expanding on the reason for this; many people don't like logic because they aren't *good* at applying it (which is perfectly normal to not like something you aren't skilled at).

There are plenty of people who are good at it but don't like it in fiction either, for whatever reason, but my point is that the former type of person will *also* feel threatened by someone else using it; hence the hate instead of just ignoring which the latter would be more likely do.

Note, I am not assigning negative traits to people not interested in "logic". E.g. I would also probably "not care" about some of the examples you gave such as "the story takes place between x and y dates" most likely because my memory isn't particularly strong and so I don't do well with trivia (and hence dislike/am not interested in it).
