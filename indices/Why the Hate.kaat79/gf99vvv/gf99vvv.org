I haven't seen the threads that you're talking about, but there's a group of people called SneerClub who basically despise everything Yudkowsky, and that includes ragging heavily on any of his creations (HPMOR), any fans of his creations, etc. Is it possibly associated with them?

Here's the Yudkowsky quote from 6 years ago that brought the title that they gladly accepted for themselves. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2n3yh5/what_is_it_with_dark_lord_potter_and_hpmor/cmad6x3/?context=3]]
