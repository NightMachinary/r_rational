I think this is what they would claim to be the reason. I think it's giving them far too much credit. The stereotype of a basement dwelling nerd without any real world experience inventing wish fulfillment to salve a easily bruised ego is what you come up with when you want to make fun of this place not where the grievance came from. Especially since the primary antagonist of this story is a psychiatrist with a philosophy major. The actual reason is much stupider.

Back in the heyday when big Yud wrote HPMOR fanfiction was in a very different place. There are reams of text demonizing the guy for accepting donations (it was going to cause all fanfiction to get shut down and deleted from the internet by the copyright holders) before Patreon made that a thing normal people are allowed to do and most of the rumors about him running a doomsday cult start thereabouts.

Also I don't know if you've noticed HPMOR is very snide calling people who liked the original out for the various moral hypocrisies of the at the time considered totally wholesome novel by progressive icon JK Rowling. The idea that only smart people are moral -> Yudkowsky running a nazi eugenics program is probably down to that more than anything that happened later.
