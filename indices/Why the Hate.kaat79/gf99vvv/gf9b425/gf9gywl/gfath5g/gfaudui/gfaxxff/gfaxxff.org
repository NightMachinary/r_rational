Fair enough. I actually mistook your comment for another one I read that was about the more general hatedom. Still I think "organic evolution" of nazism in this case is just confirming their own expectations and rooted in a history of nerd slapfights that look incredibly sad in retrospect.

Edit: I do think you missed the point pretty badly when you bring up silicon valley entrepreneurs. That being that association to these guys IS the stereotype.
