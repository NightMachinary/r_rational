  As for good examples of this.... Scott Alexander of Slatestarcodex identifies as left-of-center... but seems unfamiliar with and/or incapable of actually properly steel-manning basic leftist thought and literature (to be fair, the left-right divide in the US skews so heavily right that Scott identifying as center left isn't dishonest). This in turn skewed the Overton Window of the SSC discussion in a weird way, which combined with the ideals of discourse of SSC (charity, taking weird ideas seriously) led to the Nazi/alt-right infestation before several steps were eventually taken that caused the alt-righter to spin off into themotte.
