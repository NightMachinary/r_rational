TL;DR to any readers out there, this is vile bullshit and you should read this instead: [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gamergate]]

.

Gamergate began with Gjoni literally inciting and helping coordinate a harassment campaign under the meme-guise of BurgersAndFries targeting not only Zoe Quinn and anyone who defended her but the completely unrelated Anita Sarkeesian. When this turned out to not be a wildly successful movement in the eye of gaming culture (though it was successful in ruining several peoples' lives) he and a bunch of TiA/KiA/4chan /pol/ shitbags managed to broaden and rebrand it.

You're not wrong that to a lot of people it had nothing to do with him and everything to do with the targets of the vicious ire of the "movement", nor that it was "fringe media" (in the form of /pol/ and some of the vilest subreddits of Reddit) who primarily signal-boosted him (though, like, TotalBiscuit wasn't exactly fucking fringe media), but that's not because he was righteous nor is it because he didn't have "voice to complain".

The "real problems" and "real offenses" boil down to "some people, almost all women, who exist in the games and games-adjacent space exist and are outspoken".

It "got out of hand on both sides" in much the same way that a bunch of Nazis starting shit at a punk bar gets out of hand on both sides; there was on one side vile, reprehensible, coordinated behavior, and on the other side there was angry opposition by people who didn't want the vicious, toxic assholes to win. Hint: GamerGate is the Nazis in this allegory, and Anita Sarkeesian is the person who they first targeted, and I'm the cranky guy drinking whiskey and yelling at the neo-Nazi sympathizer, who is you.
