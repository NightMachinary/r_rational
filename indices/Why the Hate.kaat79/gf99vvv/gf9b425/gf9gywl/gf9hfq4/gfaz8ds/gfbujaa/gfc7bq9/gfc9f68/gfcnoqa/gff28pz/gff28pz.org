Rationalwiki is a steaming crock of shit on basically every subject.

  the completely unrelated Anita Sarkeesian
#+end_quote

Sarkeesian wasn't involved until she specifically involved herself. Because she's a opportunist who follows the adage "all publicity is good publicity". Which is usually true, and /was/ true in this case; she raised her profile significantly and ultimately profited substantially. From an effectiveness standpoint, it's impressive, and she only took mildly morally distasteful actions to do it, not anything morally repugnant, so she earns some degree of plaudits. (That's counterbalanced by her failure to deliver on her promises for /Tropes vs. Women/, which is more severely morally distasteful. She did not put a good faith effort toward producing them at the promised rate and depth, and regardless of how valuable you think they are, that's scorn-worthy.)

The same cannot be said of Quinn, who is an out and out sociopath, as is pretty clear if you read Gjioni's original file of the messages where she abused the shit out of him. If you didn't, when she then for her next trick fabricated a mentally disabled elderly man persona and used it as a pen name to write [[https://www.chucktingle.com/][wildly popular absurdist gay erotica]]? That really should have been a hint.

Eron tried to publish those messages and other evidence of the abuse with gaming news sites. When that didn't work he tried gossip rags. When /that/ didn't work he resorted to channers. Was this probably a bad call that would predictably lead to nastiness? Yeah, in retrospect it was. Most likely it was predictable beforehand that it would lead to more people harassing Quinn for unrelated things than to his actual cause getting advanced. But if /you're/ abused and the people giving your abuser a platform refuse to help /you/, I doubt you'd do any better. If you're lucky, it won't blow up into a household name (/that/ part definitely wasn't predictable).

  The "real problems" and "real offenses" boil down to "some people, almost all women, who exist in the games and games-adjacent space exist and are outspoken".

The real offenses were that Zoe Quinn *abused the shit out of Eron Gijoni*. The real problems were, and are, that the gaming press derides things that the historical core gamer culture likes and praises experimental games-in-name-only like DepressionQuest, and that the historical nerd subcultures have been increasingly under entryist attack (rarely malicious, usually well-intentioned, but attack nonetheless) from mainstream cultures, which threaten to take away the safe spaces for spergy people (/mostly/ men) and make those spaces follow the mainstream social norms which those people joined the subculture to get away from. These problems are related via the gaming press mostly being composed of that category of entryist.
