  Gamers, on the other hand... there certainly are pockets of lefties, but there's also a huge reactionary undercurrent that was made obvious with gamergate.

No such thing happened. Self-identified gamers at that time had a high rate of being past bullying victims (by now the label has been mainstreamed enough that it's less true, but the rates are probably still elevated), and reacted to Gamergate as another instance of the popular mainstream bullying them. (This may not have been true at the very beginning, I'm unsure, but it was correct within a week.) Gamergate was a defensive reaction to a gaming /press/ which was (and still is) dismissive of its audience and what they care about.

To the extent there is any 'reactionary' undercurrent in gamer culture, it was not revealed by GG, but /created/ by it. Snooty leftists insisted that they couldn't have any reason for disliking the status quo except being bigots. It is unsurprising that people who were bullied and tarred as bigots for daring to express contrary opinions had a meaningful number of people decide that if this is all it takes to be declared a bigot, maybe bigots aren't nearly as bad as their reputation. And if they're welcoming and the only people willing to say "Fuck, you didn't deserve that", it is unsurprising if some of them stay in those circles and drift closer to them in beliefs over time.
