Worth remembering that there is a difference between rational and rationalist, as the sidebar points out. Rationalist is really a very small genre, with only a handful of entries: HPMOR, Worth the Candle, Pokemon OotS are the most prominent. Looking at the SB thread which I believe you are referring to, looks like a lot of the issues are just generally with the "rational" tag or its use in titles, and only a small handful of people who are actually talking about rationalist fiction.
