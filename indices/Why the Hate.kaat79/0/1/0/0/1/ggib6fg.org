Lol, designated survivor is probably the worst show if you want well thought out character motivations. Literally the whole FBI agent plot has things like this. Like when the big bad terrorists knock her out and leave her in a van filled with explosives next to a government building in order to kill/frame her but leave the keys in the ignition and enough time on the clock that she can drive the van into a river. Why?

Plus the whole having access to all of the FBI's resources but never giving her any backup. The whole series drives me up a wall tbh.
