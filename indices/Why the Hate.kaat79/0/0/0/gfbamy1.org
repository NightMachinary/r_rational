I think there are aspects of rational (not rationalist) fiction that /would/ be a benefit to nearly all fiction. I don't think that a story ever really benefits from characters carrying the idiot ball or acting in ways that contradict their personalities and self interest (note that this /does not mean/ that characters should never make bad decisions, those bad decisions should just make sense with the rest of the character traits etc). Of course, some people would argue that those more general aspects of "rational" fiction aren't all that different from "good writing" and don't warrant a specific tag, and I don't necessarily disagree.
