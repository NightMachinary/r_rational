Crossposting [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/e2h85n/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_and_writing_thread/f8xr76p/][my question from this week's worldbuilding thread]] since it straddles the line between worldbuilding and munchkinning. (And because I posted late and missed most of the boat in that thread.)

Summary: the Shepherds are a species of sentient alien plant. They're about 300 square meters of grass, have a pitcher-plant like mouth, can also grow twiggy branching structures up to a meter tall, and have weak "muscles" in the bases of their grass and branches of their twigs. Their muscles are weak and get tired quickly, like a venus flytrap's. They can shuffle large, light objects across their grass. They can build scaffolds of twigs to perform fine manipulation. A healthy diet includes meat, soil, water, and sunlight.

What can the Shepherds do to get into space?

(There's one good answer in the linked thread, but more would be helpful to compare and contrast against.)
