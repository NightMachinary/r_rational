Great answer! I especially like the idea of trying to take advantage of roots for mining, and I like that your version didn't assume they can manipulate things with roots.

Criticism takes up more room than praise; I'd like to emphasize again that I enjoyed your response before we dig into the much longer nitpicking portion of this post.

  Unlike humans, each individual Shepherd has an effectively unlimited capacity for fine manipulation. They should be able to work on many different things at once.

Their muscles tire very quickly, like a venus fly trap's, so their fine manipulation is rate-limited by fatigue unless they grow multiple redundant manipulation structure. Those take up space, and they only have so much; they still need to photosynthesize. Also humans haven't ever been bottlenecked on availabile fingers. And I don't think the Shepherds necessarily are great at multitasking; most decisions they have to make in the ancestral environment are about where to grow what, which is not very time sensitive.

  Landing back on the planet is easier for them than for us, as they could bleed off speed by descending a little bit into the atmosphere and extruding sacrificial roots or blades to create a gigantic surface area.

I don't follow this one. You're suggesting they abandon their ship and skydive out?

  the Shepherds are basically in a post-scarcity economy anyway due to the fact that most of their needs can be met with zero effort on the part of other Shepherds

As a setting conceit, /every/ sentient species went through a phase where they can casually obtain a huge calorie surplus. This includes when humans evolved the persistence hunting strategy. I wouldn't trust being a carnivorous plant to maintain post-scarcity any more than being able to kill more gazelles than you could ever eat made our society post-scarcity.
