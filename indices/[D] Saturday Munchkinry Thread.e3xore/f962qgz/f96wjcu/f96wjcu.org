Unlike humans, each individual Shepherd has an effectively unlimited capacity for fine manipulation. They should be able to work on many different things at once. Their primary weakness is immobility, as this will make it difficult for them to prospect and mine vital materials for a space program.

To solve this problem, a large patch of Shepherds could cooperate to move the soil underneath them aside and dig themselves into an open pit mine. Plants are very capable of breaking rocks of arbitrary hardness apart with their roots, so hitting bedrock won't be a problem. They could keep feeding and watering themselves by cycling soil from the edges back through, and draining the pit isn't a problem because they are their own pump system.

Digging a mine this way would probably take centuries, but with a large enough area of Shepherds they could strip mine hundreds or thousands of miles of terrain without expending greater individual effort. I assume their needs for meat would be met by peripheral Shepherds doing actual shepherding, and the depression would feed them more water than they ever needed. They could perhaps trade their abundance of water and vital nutrients from pulverized rocks for meat and revitalized soil, making the whole enterprise worthwhile for everyone involved.

Identifying ores shouldn't be that hard. Plants can already produce and identify a surprising variety of pheromone-like compounds, so they definitely have chemical identification capacities. Some researchers have even posited that real plant colonies might have some kind of sapience, though I don't personally think there's enough evidence for that. The Shepherds could eat into chunks of ore the same way they would normal rocks, then note where the resulting mineralized fluid is building up in their systems.

To turn that fluid into a workable material, they could break off their reservoirs of fluid, dig a huge clay-lined hole, drop everything in, cover it over somewhat with more clay, then set fire to it through any number of means while pumping chunks of coal or even oil in on top. They might be able to keep that process going indefinitely, and they could figure out the layers different metals separated out to through trial and error by poking sacrificial roots into the crucible. Then they could build clay casts for whatever metal pieces they need and pierce the crucible underground to fill them. Their enormous degree of fine manipulation means they should be able to make really solid molds, and they could make that manipulation better by making thin metal rods to manipulate rather than twigs.

Once they have a forge, they can start an industrial revolution pretty easily. With thousands of square miles of mine they shouldn't run out of materials. Industrial waste should be pretty easy to handle, as their workers literally cover the entire work area and all personal injuries short of total annihilation are recoverable. Just shovel waste products into clay ampoules using manipulators you intend to sacrifice, then pass the ampoules across the surface to some safe dumping ground. Climate change could be a problem, but these are sentient plants. More Co2 in the atmosphere means they can grow more thickly and so sequester more carbon.

Once you have an industrial revolution, you've basically got everything you need for into space. Each capsule can probably only contain one Shepherd, hydroponically fed and carefully folded over itself to save volume, but each Shepherd can do the work of dozens of humans. The capsules could have mechanical protrusions containing multitools, so creating a station would be as simple as launching a bunch of capsules with varying materials and passing them out to assemble in space. Landing back on the planet is easier for them than for us, as they could bleed off speed by descending a little bit into the atmosphere and extruding sacrificial roots or blades to create a gigantic surface area. It would be kinda like deorbiting a massive cotton ball with even less density.

All in all, this would probably take thousands of years from the beginning of the first mine to first orbit, but given that the Shepherds are basically in a post-scarcity economy anyway due to the fact that most of their needs can be met with zero effort on the part of other Shepherds, it should be doable.
