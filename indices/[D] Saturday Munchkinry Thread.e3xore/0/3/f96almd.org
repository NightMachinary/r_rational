I should be able to have enough money to influence the 2016 election by the time the election cycle comes up, but I think I'd attempt to make it so Trump never runs to begin with. I don't know how much of a price difference there was between 2010 and 2013 in bitcoin but if it's significant, I should be able to get in some kind direct contact with Trump by 2013 which could be enough to stop him just by chance. Everything else I would do to stop him from winning would probably be mundane campaigning.

I have a terrible memory, so I don't think I would be able to prevent any major catastrophes, because I don't know when they happened. Maybe the Boston marathon bombing? I don't remember what year that was, 2012 maybe? Calling in a tip the night before might be enough. I think I would call every year from 2011 to 2015 to be safe, hopefully they don't start disregarding it. Or it could scare the perpetrators off to begin with. I could probably stop Andrew Hussie from getting scammed by the King's Quest guys, though. Oh, and was pepe already a thing by then? Maybe I could talk to Matt Heely, who made the comics, and try to reduce the online presence of his comics to prevent that phenomenon. It's likely to be replaced by something equally bad, but at least it'll be different.
