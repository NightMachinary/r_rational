Next to you is a button saying "press to restart the 2010s", per [[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/e3mcuh/you_awake_on_112020_next_to_you_is_a_button_that]]

You press it right away, ignoring the obvious ethical concerns, and suddenly find yourself mentally time traveled approximately 10 years back. You find yourself in a safe condition(ie not actively driving), but are otherwise dropped into your body and world of ten years past.

It's obviously easy to greatly profit off this situation- buy some Bitcoin, get the jump on alexnet, crispr and Uber... But you should be able to do better, influencing world events for the better. What do you do?

Obvious considerations: getting people's trust, lack of recent memories from ten years ago, lack of time to prepare before going back, potential governmental attention
