They're definitely lackluster, but it's about as much as I think I personally could manage. I think stopping Trump being elected is still pretty good, mostly for the cultural effects because that's what affects me more than the political effects. Definitely changes the tone of the second half of the decade.

I'm not a Brit so I wouldn't feel great about interfering with their government, and I don't find a stagnating GDP emotionally compelling. I also might not have ever thought of Brexit before you mentioned it, so it'd be difficult to do anything about something I didn't remember.

Also, I'd use excess funds for philanthropy but that's not going to be particularly influential. Oh, and hopefully I'd remember about the existence and actions of ICE and start up the movement against them again, in case that doesn't become a political issue of the year this time around.
