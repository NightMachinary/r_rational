So basically your three main “improve the world” goals are

- keep trump from being elected

- prevent an instance of a kickstarter scam

- keeping a right wing meme from going viral

I mean, I'm not trying to be mean but these seem so... minimal. 2 and 3 are practically negligible in the scope of a decade. The current presidency, despite the doom and gloom, has not hardly been the foreign policy apocalypse people were concerned it would be. Trying to get a candidate with a demonstrably aggressive foreign policy would be tempting fate.

Frankly, the biggest difference in global economy you could make off the top of my head is to consolidate money and influence for a few years and start campaigning against Brexit, considering the big loss in global GDP that gridlock has caused.
