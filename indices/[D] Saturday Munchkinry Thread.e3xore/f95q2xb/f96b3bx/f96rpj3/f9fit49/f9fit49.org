Probably the biggest change for the positive that I can make here would be to find some way (somehow) to end the disastrously corrupt relationship between Jacob Zuma and the Gupta brothers.

Mind you, I'm not actually sure how to /do/ that. There were (at the very least) strong suspicions of something not being kosher there since at least 2013, so it's hard to tell exactly how much help a few strategically placed warnings could be. And I'm not quite sure what else I could do to stop that whole saga.
