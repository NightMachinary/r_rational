Is it against the spirit of the question to use your knowledge of that button's existence? In a scenario where the button is only there to set up the premise you probably wouldn't find it again. It still seems like something worth checking in the first three months or so of the reset, since you can then make more detailed observations for a subsequent restart.

Again, you'll probably be ignoring some ethical questions by dedicating a restart to observations, and there's a chance even if you find the button that it won't work again, so it would probably be worth pressing at the five year point. By then, you won't have affected much, so even if you can't reset again you'd at least have clearer memories to draw from for the upcoming five years.

Priorities if you can restart multiple times include preventable natural disasters (early warning on forest fires, for example) and whistleblowing for organisations that were exposed for wrongdoing in the future.
