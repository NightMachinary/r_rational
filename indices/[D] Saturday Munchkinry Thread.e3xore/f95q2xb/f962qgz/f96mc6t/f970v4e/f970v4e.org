Are there de-aging potions in DnD? If so, I would set my undead servants on brewing them, then dole them out for free to my living ones. I would only ever need a fraction of an undead servant per living one to keep my entire kingdom healthy and young, and I could recruit new undead servants from anyone who tried to attack my people. I would put a hard cap on the number of undead servants I could control, well below the the theoretical maximum, and like the author stated in the thread I would have implanted myself with a cyst so I could use Suggestion to maintain my obsession with following the flowchart.

I would have put a limit on expansionism. Only invade kingdoms which attack me first, only kill soldiers you can't avoid killing and subdue the rest of them with cysts where able, using Suggestion to keep them peaceful only long enough to end the conflict. After winning, anyone who does not wish to recieve the cyst is allowed free passage out of my kingdom, but may not live in it. Outside visitors are allowed, especially for purposes of trade, but zero adventurers who refuse to take up the cyst are allowed. Nobody without a cyst may stay for longer than a week or however long it will take them to cross my kingdom to their destination, whichever is longer. Anyone who took up the cyst may ask to have it removed at any time, though they would then be required to leave the kingdom the same as anyone else.

If I ever stumble across someone else using this trick or any other which gives them the capacity to observe through and potentially control massive numbers of people, I would require them to adopt my flowchart for themselves or else declare immediate war on them. I can't risk someone who didn't think to create a flowchart with this kind of power, and I won't be able to tell which parts of the flowchart are vital and which are acceptable deviations.

I will send ambassadors out to neighboring nations, but will not allow any into mine. However, my ambassadors will be required to consent to allow themselves to be temporarily puppeted by me (for no longer than two hours at a time with at least 30 minites between periods, no longer than six hours in a single 24 hour period, and no longer than 30 hours in any 7 day period). I will make it known that ambassadors being puppeted are me, and speak with my full authority. This way neighbors can make treaties with my kingdom without ever sending a delegation to it. Any of my citizens may also give revokable consent to be puppeted in cases of imminent, life-threatening injury, and I will not puppet anyone else unless imminent danger to myself or the kingdom may be so averted.

Any living soldiers of mine would be required to consent to puppeting, though I would never puppet my command staff. Any commanding officer who told me not to puppet their subordinates would be promptly obeyed, as soon as I could make sure said soldiers wouldn't immediately die due to my compliance. Anyone who could remotely be considered an advisor would be unable to consent to puppeting.

I would never, under any circumstances, have sex with anyone who has taken up the cyst. If I found I needed satisfaction, I would hire prostitutes from neighboring kingdoms. I would put a hard limit on such behavior, though, and would pay their usual rate in addition to travel fees, with de-aging potion as an additional gift.

That's all I can think of right now.

Edit: Any advisor who has been chaotic good and in my service with zero questions about their loyalty for at least fifty years may suggest additions to the flowchart. Such additions must be ratified by 2/3rds of all other good-aligned advisors. I set it up this way because chaotic good advisors are only ever likely to ask for more rules in the case of blatantly obvious flaws in my system, and whatever they suggest must also seem a good idea to lawful good and neutral good advisors. A true neutral advisor with absolute veto power will be appointed to ensure no suggestions are contradictory or in violation of other obvious legal principles.
