Because the Shepherds can roughly manipulate all of their grass blades, they can direct the motion of small packages across their entire surface area. Fatigued paths just don't get used until they're ready again, and adjacent paths can take up the slack. That's why I said they have effectively infinite fine manipulation, as they can pass projects along to new patches of grass as the old ones tire. 300 square meters is a ton of space to pass small things through.

I was assuming the Shepherds behaved something like a hive mind because real-world plants do that. All rooted plants known to exist have a deeply interconnected network of [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhiza][Mycorrhiza]] which massively increase the surface area of their roots. These symbiotic fungi aren't particular about which plant, or even which species, they connect to, so entire forests are usually connected into one mycorrhizal network. Plants are known to send chemical messages to other members of their species and members of other species through this network, so communication and interdependence between adjacent Shepherds should be quite extensive. It is this network which makes some researchers think plants might be sentient. They look and behave awfully like nerves.

For the deorbiting suggestion, I was thinking the falling Shepherd could turn themself into a massive dandelion seed. Parachutes are good at airbraking, but they aren't the only effective design. Air resistance depends on surface area lateral to the direction of acceleration, so any design which maximizes for that will be effective. Once they slow down enough, they could crack open the capsule shell to increase their surface area even more while trailing even more extruded fibers to plop back to land with minimal injury.
