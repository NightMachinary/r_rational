Yes, and thank you for your suggestions!

I have been listening to the Writing Excuses podcast (I think either alexanderwales or eneaz pointed me to it originally) and I've been worldbuilding a D&D/Shadowrun-styled 'rational' setting. This was my 'fairy tale within a fantasy tale' prelude that isn't really connected to the main plot, but it emphasizes the story's future focus on 'eliminate suffering and deplete morbidity' over the necromancer's misled notion of 'defeat mortality.'

I combined the Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant and the Friendship is Optimal/Bluer Shade of White FAI rationalist tropes, but my version turned into more of a Buddhist introspective on the concept of dukkha-suffering. While I like the ending of Part 3, I struggled with the relevance of Part 4 for the 'Buggy Matrix' contest. Ultimately I decided to continue to write the pieces of the story I want to write and I can tweak Part 4 later on when I figure out how to write the "biotech singularity" concept a little better.
