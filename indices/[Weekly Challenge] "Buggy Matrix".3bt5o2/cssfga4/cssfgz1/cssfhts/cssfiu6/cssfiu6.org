** Part 4: Drake the Code-Breaker

“While Tia's wyverns patrolled the countryside and she ruminated in the deep delving, Drake worked on another project. Her triumphs over the dodecade taught him a valuable lesson. He had been too arrogant in taking on ambitious goals alone. He had single-mindedly pursued them to the point of cold utilitarianism. She proved that intellectual agency, curiosity, creativity, and collaboration were required to do the requisite work of detecting disease and relieving suffering.

“Praise Anab!”

“Drake knew the world wouldn't be able to cast healing spells of restoration like the Pious of Ages Past. In Tia's absence, he sought to create a new class of medics with his knowledge, skill and abilities.

“Remember, Drake could see at a level so small he could observe our indivisible units. He started recording the patterns that make us unique. He read through an ancient but unwieldy language encoded into the very fiber of our being. He decoded the basic quartenary assembly language that formed triplet units of codons. These translated into about twenty different basic building blocks that served all of the biological functions of humankind. He tinkered with and rewrote these sequences and supplied the small cells with various bio-alchemical sugar moieties, methylating, and alkylating agents. He tweaked the machinery that powered us.

“Drake could sense the quivering of his muscle fibrils and coordinate his movements perfectly. He could move and act in such minutely precise ways that he could continue his experiments well into his old age. He created a new condensed biocode; he created the metahumans. This new race would be capable of detecting disease and death to act as his minions in the world. They would record the manifest of disease and were gifted with racial abilities to comprehend reality on a single facet of the glittering crystal that was within his realm of powers as a Seer of Life and Death.

“When he died, the metahumans continued to the document and interpret of the physiology of life and the pathology of death. Where once the worlds most feared and vilified necromancer and his dracolich were the scourge of the lands, thousands of years later, they leave us a legacy of life. To study medicine, Iatromancy, is the most sacred duty born from the horrors of profane times. Forever do we bear the mark of his making.”

“That's your story on the racial ability of the metas? I get it, kind of. But us halflings got the shaft of the wheat! The elves and dwarves got the ears and beard of the seed.” Osler began to tick off on his fingers. Goblinoids have different types of enhanced sight. Elves have enhanced hearing. Dwarves have tremorsense with enhanced touch. How does the ability of not getting lost or catching fishes allow us to detect death?”

“Yes, it seems rather underwhelming, does it not? In any case, it is said that Drake's original tower lies just over these hills in the well of south two.” Damien waved dramatically. Glowing green and purple curtains of Aurora Iatropis flickered in ribbons across the night sky.

“That is where we seek the True and Final answer for how to defeat Morbidity and Mortality. Stick to your lessons, ask the right questions, and seek the noble answers. One day you may work with the medics and magics.”
