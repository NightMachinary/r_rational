Oh BTW, does anyone have an opinion about whether or not the quoted messages should be in quote format

#+begin_quote
  like this
#+end_quote

Or in actual quotes like it is right now

"like this".

I decided the way I did because I felt that reading a bunch of greyed text on a white background would become irritating.

Also, congrats to Farmerbob for last week's win, he deserves it!
