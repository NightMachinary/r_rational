I remember originally deciding to do that because I wanted to start with a feeling of unease. After reading your post, I reread the beginning and decided it was just confusing. I just thought of a compromise now: I reworded the first sentence so the protagonist is referring to it as a thread. Hopefully this makes it uneasy and not confusing.

But I'm not sure what to do with the title now. edit: forgot to say why. Its because I feel putting the title right after that might ruin the moment of the ending. Maybe if I can think of a good title that would match it could work. But then I'd be afraid people would think that the character was saying something in bold instead of it being the title (edit: at least while they're reading the title).
