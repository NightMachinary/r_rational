“Tell me a story, Dad...” Osler said as he warmed his hands at a campfire below a pot of fish stew.

“Which one?” Damien glanced down, gingerly dipped two fingers in and licked them, adding a dash of salt to the food. “The Book of Questions, the Catabolist versus the Anabolist...”

“Tell me about the dragons.”

“I have only one fable about dragons. I haven't told it to you before, because I wasn't sure if you were ready yet.”

“Why not?” Osler frowned and pointed at the light stubble on the top of his feet. “I'm almost eleventy until quarter-age now! I've heard about the dragons before and I know what is coming. I want to be ready!” He caught himself in mid-pout and tried to look as grown-up as halflingly possible.

Damien nodded knowingly. “You want to be ready? Don't we all. Very well, this is the Story of the Benevolent Dracolich.”

** Part 1: Seers, the Last of their Kind

“Once upon a time, there was a mage named Drake. He possessed a great many abilities but as far as magic goes, they were weak and piddling. By this point in the Verse, the greatest wizards had already died: among them were the Wishmongers, the Rulebreakers, the Forecasters, and the Elementbenders. Only the Seers remained, for their powers required the least mana.

“Drake possessed all the senses of sight. He could see the invisible rays to left and right of the Sun's prismatic spray. He possessed all the senses of sound, able to feel the moans of the earth and tides' waves in his bones. One by one, he apprehended every sense imaginable. He alone possessed the will to receive and the ability to interpret. He seized knowledge from the fabric of reality -- and the messages from the Twin Gods themselves.

“Drake's abilities and demeanor made him far-seeing. He didn't concern himself with the day-to-day drivel of fields and markets. Unlike the generations of arrogant wizardkind before him, he had the gift to see out into the Dark Beyond.

“First he traced the routes of the planetary bodies. The seasonal constellations became his closest friends. Then he began to see the individual thumbprints that made them each unique and although they were so far away, he eventually could tell how massive they were. What elemental stuff they contained. How long they glistered in the night sky to send him their weak messages from many eons ago.

“Where we only see blackness, he saw the background Glow of the Anabolist marking the beginning of the Verse. Where we see shimmering pointillés, he saw entropic fires of the Catabolist spelling the Verse's End. He ruminated on the infinity of the Cosmos and the finality of the stars. The gifts that the Anabolist had so carefully wrought from the beginning of time would be slowly torn to shreds one by one by the Catabolist, until all was dust and dead.”

Osler frowned grumpily, folding his arms across his chest. “I thought this was going to be about the dragons, Dad. I'm in no mood for the second lesson of thaumodynamics tonight.”

Damien's eyes crinkled at its corners as he slipped into a well-worn smile. “It's closer to Newt's Third Lesson -- but okay, we'll skip ahead.”
