** Part 2: The Code of the Necromancer

“Drake contemplated Death in all its forms. More than the emotional toll of death or the cessation of vitality, he mourned two things. First, the loss of Potential that Life could have offered if it weren't snuffed out. Second, the loss of Information that the Anabolist created and the Catabolist unmade.

“In the bitterest twist of irony, he made an Unshakable Decree that he would fight Death until his last breath. He became the world's first Necromancer, dedicating his magic towards the study of Death.

“Now, nothing could excuse his methods or his means, for they were quite immoral indeed. The Hellsink Accords are based on a systematic analysis of what he did -- and the direct denial of each item became a cornerstone of Ethical Behavior for today. What Drake lacked in magical power, he compensated for with ruthless ingenuity and calculated utility. In a secret laboratory, he documented each different way a person could die and in so doing, began to uncover the secrets of life, one by one. Much of the medical knowledge we possess now comes from the dissections and experiments he made while observing the processes of death. Since you are interested in the Dragons... yes? We'll gloss over the atrocities he committed. The sacrifices that were made to sate his appetite over the dominion of Death.

“Using the code of new life and a crude map of his own patterns of thought, he created a source to store his life-force if his body were ever to perish. In order to protect it against the fires of the Catabolist, he made it a powerful creature forged of steel frame and chain tendon. He fashioned the skeletal frame into the form of the Dragons of old. The tender electrical impulses of his brain were patterned and replicated unto a tiny intricate unit inscribed unto a single glittering dragon scale which he placed unto the skull of the beast. This draconic invention became known as the First Phylactery.

“Necromancy had such a terrible and frightening reputation among the ignorant and cowardly. His Dracolich was an imposing and massive laboratory instrument. It did not diminish the terror the populace held of the discipline of death. In order to better study the elemental structures of life, Drake imbued the Dracolich with a powerful breath weapon. Upon command, it could exhale an ashen cloud of semi-sentient smoke around a small object. Drawing upon his powers as a Seer, the swarm of black particles could precisely measure the speed, position, composition, structure, and mass of the subject's elemental components. Unfortunately, this process also irreversibly destroyed the subject, disintegrating it. However, the smoke coalesced into a dusty carbonized-diamondine dragon scale with a specific pattern of information. This preserved the targets precisely in their form and function, awaiting future revival.

“Drake measured the data from hundreds of dead and dying subjects. Much to his sinking dismay, he realized that he had erred -- his system had two fatal flaws.

“First, none of the dragon scales he created were the perfect crystalline structure of his phylactery. They were all flawed in different ways. Any diseases contained within them at the time of death remained. He had temporarily managed to stay the right hand of Death -- Mortality. However, the left hand of Death -- Morbidity -- moved onwards inexorably. Suffering, it seemed, was built into the system of life. And he found it very difficult to extricate. One does not ‘eradicate' or ‘destroy' suffering in much the same way that you cannot ‘kill' death. The bitterest piece of his triumph: his attempts at preservation seemed to capture the subjects at moments of EXTREME suffering. Each scale was a cracked gem of a person frozen in eternal torture.

“Second, the disintegrating cloud was incapable of perfect reintegration. The Catabolist had seen to it that it would be impossible to recreate the same being. When he tried to remake life, what the Dracolich's dust created was exactly the same structurally, yet it seemed to be devoid of their vital essence of consciousness. Perhaps being soul-trapped drove his subjects mad. Perhaps the recordings were not as perfect as he thought. Whatever the cause, only the barest remnants of their hindbrains remained. Base urges of hunger and fear were the only things retained. Moreover, many of the Reintegrated retained the Dracolich's mission. They sought to use their limbs and teeth to, ah, as Drake saw it, ‘capture and categorize the patterns of life.' But it was necrotic. And it was messy.”

“Ugh. I hate zombies. The wizard's revivication attempts turned out pretty badly.” Osler's face soured and he spat out fishbones from his mouth in between bites of stew and bread.

“That's right, Os. For all of his knowledge, the wizard lacked wisdom and kindness. His Unshakable Task was too great, his magical influence too small. He thought he conquered death, but it turned out that each and every cause of death required a new solution to recreate its life. He knew that he needed help.” Damien pursed his lips and then downed the last of his ale to its dregs.
