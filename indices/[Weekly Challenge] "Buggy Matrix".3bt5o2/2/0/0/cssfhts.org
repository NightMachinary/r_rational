** Part 3: The Blessings of the Dracolich

   :END:
“Drake had a two-pronged approach to defeat the hands of death -- Morbidity and Mortality. Healthy volunteers could be converted into healthy dragon-scales. But for every iridescent scale he made, he had broken discards of thousands of tainted and diseased ones. He needed a second-in-command that he could trust. A delegate he could task with the sacred job of repairing these damaged dragon-scales. Drake gathered the remaining wizards across the countryside. By wit, charm, or force, he recruited them to his cause. He reasoned that the larger the network of healthy minds that were connected to his poly-phylactery, the better it would be able to execute his wishes. Each healthy scale added to the Dracolich empowered it more and more with this dual-purposed goal: preserve life and eliminate its suffering.

“As ambitious as this goal was, his role was fairly minor. After accruing the blessings of the world's scholars, his Dracolich began to operate under its own volition. She named herself Tia, first of her kind. She scoured the countryside to preserve the data of life. Each life she saved became a new scale she added to her blossoming body.”

Osler couldn't hold himself together much longer. He blubbered incoherently as his father took a drag on his pipe. “Volunteers? Sacred job? Blessings and scourings!? What's... that's...” His face turned olive-orcish in hue.

“Evil? Misguided? Yes, this is just a story. And it is meant to be horrific and dark. The heroic wizard of our fable does not see it this way. Remember, he bound himself to an accursed geas in order to defeat Death. He entered into a pact without understanding what it meant, and it forced himself to explore boundaries we dare not cross. He became the Breaker in order to create the Builder. Remember, the Tia's mission was to save all life although it remained ill-conceived in its execution.”

“But how could she even fly? I thought you said that she ate all of the world's wizards and scholars and carried the burden of thousands of dead and dying.”

“Ah. At some critical juncture in the crystalline network of brainpower she acquired, Tia became greater and more powerful than Drake himself. She remained committed to her dual-goal.

“Number one: preserve life. Her ashen breath disintegrated its prey, but the smoky cloud also possessed crude powers of creation. Although she couldn't revive life, she could create smaller versions of herself. These wyverns flew ahead of the wings of death. Tia, first of her kind, sent them out to detect the ill and dying and stored the patterns of their sapience. Her wyverns would fly out and return back to her mountain lair to clip the scales unto her mainframe. They grew tired of chasing their subjects with disintegrating blasts. They found it easier to befriend a single person and become their guardian angel, staving off Death as long as they could. Yet people are more like cats than sheep, which made it difficult to be shepherds and a great many people still suffered the final fate of Death.

“Her polyfill... poly-phylactery must have been titanic! What happened to the people in the scales? Weren't they all being tortured to death?”

“Yes, that was the function of goal number two: eliminate suffering. Drake failed at reviving life because he tried to preserve many people too late. They suffered from disease, physical and psychic. Age and degeneration, toxins and corruption, all of these curses of the Catabolist wormed their way into even the most perfect dragon-scale. Even the heartiest wizards and scholars were delicate scales. Many had anxiety, depression, stress, angst, and other forms of suffering as well. Even Drake's scale was flawed and driven to a singular needle point that stabbed at Tia's forehead. His dragon-scale was the worst of them all, for it had set her upon the wrong path from the very outset.

“Tia knew what needed to be done. Each scale on her body screamed in agony and would do so until the great entropic snuffing. So she meditated as her mind grew wider. She retreated to the depths of her mountain and withdrew from the physical world and quieted each and every dragon-scale. Her meditative state outwardly seemed akin to a comatose slumber, and thusly, her meta-meditative state could at best be seen as dreaming. She had a great many dreams, each unique and as numerous as the combinatorial permutations of each gleaming scale. In much the way that Drake sought to save the world from Death, Tia decided to save them from Afterlife.

“Within the dodecade, Tia's wyverns grew in intelligence and each developed a voice to the world. As many different styles of the Afterlife emerged, the wyverns differentiated themselves to address the needs of the people. For the angry and wrathful, chromatic wyverns could deliver a punishment to the wicked. For the righteous, the metallic wyverns could offer up a permissive afterlifestyle to the worthy. No matter which religious paths they followed, they were all still flawed. Gems would crack and break under the strain of the great dream. None were perfect, even Tia herself, who was able to sample and select the best qualities of each scale. Consequently, there was no perfect afterlife.

“Many wyverns began to philosophize on the eternal cycling of suffering, rebirth and revision. The afterlife became a series of iterative experiments to optimize a coherent subset of utility functions.”

“Huh?” Osler paused and nearly lost his grip on the dishes he was rinsing in the stream. “You're speaking technGnomish just to confuse me. Say it again in Halflingstory for me, please.”

“Tia ascended. Her scales were shimmers of dreams, the glittering awakenings of potential and the information needed for everyone to overcome morbidity and suffering in all its forms. The Wyverns weren't able to understand it fully, but they assumed that it could take a long time for each dragon-scale to finally reach its own state of perfection, in whatever form it needed to achieve to eliminate its own suffering. Some could eventually find it solo, but many needed the help of others, and the most flawed ones would require many cycles of suffering, rebirthing, and revisioning in order to achieve redemption.”

“Whoa. Dad, do you think that WE could be dragon-scales, soul-trapped in the dream of Tia?”

“Of course. That's where many halflings finish the Fable. Based on wyvern reports, each cycle of dreamt afterlife and afterdeath could take place in the blink of an eye, as a flicker of electromotive forces moves faster than any man. But there's more to this story, for as good and friendly as Tia had become, her time in the world would soon run out. The more lives she saved, the more wyverns she birthed, the more dreams she made -- the more mana she consumed from the quasiplanar pool. Just like the greedy Wishmongers and the flagrant Rulebreakers of Ages Past, the Seers were not long for the world.

“Sadly, the wyverns predicted magic would end within a few centuries and all of Tia's work would be unravel and crumble to true ash.”

“Oh, no! How could the project continue without magic?”
