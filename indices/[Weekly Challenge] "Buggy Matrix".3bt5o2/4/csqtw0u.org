*SIMites*

/322 words/

It had started out as a failsafe.

A way of keeping things running smoothly.

Continuity was important. Allowing interactions to proceed with minimal disturbance. No one wanted to experience lag when interacting with their fellow SIMites. The premise had started off innocently enough. Should a load-imbalance cause some people to be rendered with less fidelity than would allow full consciousness, switch their processing over to simple scripts which would allow the interaction to continue while the imbalance was corrected.

Once full processing has been restored, merge the results of the script interaction into the subjects memory. Even in meatspace, people's memories are not the perfect record they think they are. Easily changeable. Easily malleable. The conscious SIMite continues without ever knowing about their brief period of consciouslessness.

The idea was simple. The execution, to borrow a meatspace metaphor, was bloody.

Load balancing kicked in when a solar flare knocked out most of the northern hemisphere's processing power. Conscious SIMites were zipped and shipped to available servers, while interactions shifted to the AI scripts. The servers in the southern hemisphere began to buckle under the sheer weight of a trillion frozen consciousnesses being sent for backup simultaneously. The southern servers began the automated load-balancing process of zipping and shipping their population of SIMites.

No one is entirely sure how it happened.

No one is entirely sure who was affected.

After the solar storm settled, and full server availability had been restored, it became clear that some SIMites had started acting "strangely". I noticed that people answered my questions with non-sequitors, became evasive when I pushed certain points, and seemed ignorant of things discussed only minutes before. I can't prove it, but I think that at some point during the meltdown, AI scripts overwrote SIMites.

I don't know whether the people I'm interacting with are conscious, or scripted.

I don't know whether I'm the only conscious SIMite left.

I don't know whether I'm conscious.
