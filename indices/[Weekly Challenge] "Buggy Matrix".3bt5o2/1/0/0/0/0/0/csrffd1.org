Not really. EY touched on the premise of Permutation City in the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/1/The-Finale-of-the-Ultimate-Meta-Mega-Crossover][Finale]], an Egan/Vinge crossover fanfic - basically, Permutation City is based on the idea that any computation that could happen is as good as having happened, in terms of being experienced "from the inside" by agents it represents. If you ask me, that's taking the "what /is/ truth?" nonsense and turning wise-sounding philosophising up to 11.
