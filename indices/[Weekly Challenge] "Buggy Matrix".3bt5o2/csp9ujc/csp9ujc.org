Ok Reddit, I'm posting this thread because I've got a mystery that needs solving. Something super weird dropped into my inbox today. I almost missed it but at the top of the message it says "sent 2 years ago." I've got a ton of messages, the latest being only an hour ago, yet they're all below this one. I'm almost completely confident the message is from my childhood friend, Joan, who is a master class troll, but how did she do it? Is there some bug in Reddit?

edit: Ok since nobody has replied to this thread yet, I thought I'd offer some incentive. I just got another message from Joan (this one from 9 months ago) and it seems like its forming a kind of story. I'm going to show the first message and if someone can figure this out I'll post more!

Just a little note before I post it though, the reason I know its from Joan is that its written in a language that we geeky outcasts created together in high school. But this means I have to translate, and there might be some weirdness I'll need to point out. Anyway here it is:

“The year two thousand and thirteen Anno Domini. The year of humanity's ultimate triumph over reality. Cell by cell every neuron fell to their silicon replacement. The rushing tide swept over us all by will or by force.

I still remember.

I entered a building one day that year with a head full of carbon. I watched the winter's snow fall outside. I left with a speck of tech stuck in my head.

I entered another building another day that year with a head full of silicon. I watched the summer's sun cast shadows outside. I did not leave.

I looked around the simulation I was then a part of. An infinite white expanse. It was time to see what I could do with such power.

I willed a chair into existence. I sat down. My mind raced through a microscopic fragment of the possibilities that near-infinite freedom afforded. I chose one. I went to Reddit.

I then dicked around on my computer for the next 224 years.

224 years.

That was bliss.

[note: that sentence could also be translated "That matched the joy of playing Pokemon" but that seemed less appropriate].”

edit2: Ok, still no replies in this thread? Lucky for you lot, I'm feeling generous, here's what the second message says:

“The hell what! [note: this is in the wrong order in the original, apparently Joan is getting rusty].

I am a god. A god shall not be defied. If a god wills a website to scroll down then the site will obey. But the sites have arose in unison against me, choosing to deprive me of the sweet nectar of their content.

Its just... odd. Everything else works perfectly fine for me. I even downloaded a mouse with a scroll wheel like the pre-Upload reenactors use and that worked.

I searched the entire internet and, well, nothing. I made a post on another website and nobody else had any issue. That alone almost makes me feel... lonely. Although that could also be the 225 years (or was it 224?) of blissful near-isolation too.”

Well, looks like I'm not the only one with tech issues heh.

edit3: hmm, this post is still on the frontage page of this subreddit right now, but still no reply. Slow day? Anyway, I'm starving so I have to go eat lunch, I'll be back later.

edit4: Ok, well, I'm back and I have two new messages (these from 5 months ago and 6 months ago). There's some oddness to these ones though, I think Joan is punishing me for pointing out the mistake in the last one cause these two have significantly more errors. I decided to just correct them for you, here's the first one:

“I've notified as many people as I can. Hopefully the problem is in good hands. I'm afraid I have to rely on trust [note: not sure if its that or “I'm afraid of relying on trust”]. I'm having trouble even writing this down. Body movement-type interaction is still fairly solid, so I've had to resort to using a keyboard like old times. But 224 years have done a number on my muscle memory. And I wasn't even a fast typer to begin with. Unlike my dear friend Joan.

Sometimes I would swear she could type faster than I could think. At least till the cancer forced her to become bed ridden. All these years and it still haunts me remembering it progress. Everyday a little less hope, every day her body slipped a little more from her control. I hate being melodramatic, but I think I'm beginning to understand how she may have felt.

Death may have taken her away from us, but at least we've had our vengeance against it, haven't we?”

You have a sick sense of humour, Joan. Never change!

Anyway, this time I'm holding the second message hostage only until someone just comments at all. You don't even have to attempt an answer!

edit5: Ok I've given up threatening you trolls, I'm just going to post the messages as I get them. I still don't get how a post that's done this well in this subreddit is not getting comments even with trolling, but oh well. Here's the other message:

“An avatar-to-avatar meeting. I can't remember the last time I had one of these. All these years and I still had the exact same body as the day I popped. X¥Z came to the meeting with one of those trendy dragon avatars. It glowed a radiant, bright gold. I still don't quite understand how their brains aren't overwhelmed with the phantom sensations and the vast rewiring necessary to simply operate the new body, but I suppose...[note: I couldn't understand the rest of this sentence]. I guess one must sacrifice for the Glory of Fashion. [note: this sentence was badly mangled, I'm not sure if it was intended to sound as sarcastic as I translated it].

X¥Z's voice clashed with its body. It was calm and measured, reminding me of Joan's. 'In order for your mind to speak with your world, you need an interpreter. In the pre-Upload days we created the Interpreter program so that the computer would understand the meaning of the simulated patterns of firing neurons that is your brain. I was the head of that team. I remember the rush, the never ending lines of code needed to create something that would function for an eternity. We've simulated so many billions for 224 years and there's never been a problem. Until you. The specific patterns of the way your neurons fire has changed over the years in a way that the computer is having trouble understanding.

'Well could you... I dunno, manually override it somehow?'

'I'm sure you know well how detested overriding mental interaction sovereignty is. Even those convicted of attempting AI aren't tampered with more than the relatively minor prevention restrictions that were set up pre-Upload. Its possible doing this would even require an Outside override. I don't believe this has ever been attempted. And the technical nuances aside, this is really a political issue. To fix this it would require, well, the politicians to act.'

'Oh my, its /that/ bad?'

'Yes, I'm afraid so.'

'So what's the worst case we're looking at?'

The glow of X¥Z's body dimmed.

'In the worst case, you're looking at the eternal void. If the right combination of factors confluence before we've had time to prevent this, the computer could start radically misinterpreting which may lead to certain defaulting and error-catching behaviours. This may include entering void space domain and rapid simulation speeds orders of magnitude faster than Standard Rate. Due to the time acceleration, suicide may be the only option to prevent this from occurring. However, by that point, the computer will likely not be able to interpret well enough to satisfy the strict rules on suicide. You'd have to choose earlier.'

[note: there's a paragraph here that is so completely out of order I couldn't translate it]

I gave a half-hearted smile.

'Well, umm, t-thank you for informing me and g-good luck. B-bye.

I shifted domain to my room. The smile left my face. Tears rolled from my eyes. A possible eon of hell or the guarantee of an eternity of nothing. Death's sweet beckoning for my companionship was alluring.

But death will die alone, waiting for me.”

Jeez, this is getting scary. I've never told /anyone/ this before, not even Joan, but I actually still have a stuffed toy salamander from when I was 5 that I still use when I get scared. I'm holding on tight, haha!

edit6: I realized there's a pattern in the scrambled paragraph from the last message. I translated the first sentence, will post when I have the rest.

edit7: “'What would that actually mean for me, though? What would be happening in my head?'

'It may result in massive psychological damage. You are likely to develop severe psychosis. Symptoms include constant hallucinations of all the senses. Periods of catatonia becoming common place. Thoughts that are delusional and paranoid. Your speech may become a word salad, an incoherent mess to both others and, possibly, yourself. Additionally, there is likely to be some form of impairment to your memory.'

I held on tight to my salamander.”

Oh.
