Oh, that was gut-wrenchingly painful. Good story!

My only critique is that the initial description in the first two paragraphs is clunky, and the level of detail just feels out of place in a short story where those details won't be used later. If the goal is to draw attention to the humanity of the character, I would either disperse it a bit while setting the stage (show, don't tell), or just scale the descriptions back and use another approach (perhaps more dialogue).
