The kid glanced down the bar at the brunette with the creamy skin and the bell-like laugh. The glance wasn't nearly as covert as he thought it was, nor even so covert as the last six glances had been; the beer was starting to catch up to him.

"Son, just go talk to her," said the guy next to him, sounding exasperated and tired all at once.

The kid glanced at him in surprise. "Yeah, right," he said morosely. "Like that'll happen." He stared back into his drink glumly.

The guy sighed and turned to face him. He was tall, dark-haired, somewhere between 'old enough to know better' and 'young enough not to care'; he wore jeans and a black leather jacket that was beat-up in a way the modern 'pre-distressed' jackets just couldn't duplicate---a way that said it had carried its owner through a lot of long miles and strange times.

"Look, John," the guy began. "I'm enjoying my drink, and I can't stand much more of the mooning. Just talk to her, okay? You'll do fine, I promise; she's into nerds. Open with 'Excuse me, that guy over there said you were into nerds and I told him he was full of it. Was I right?' That's a good tree, you'll do fine."

John blinked. "How do you know my name?" he demanded. "And what makes you think I'm a nerd?"

The guy in the jacket sighed and took a pull on his whiskey---a double, John noted. "I know everyone's name," he said. "Name, age, preferences, relationship status, strength, IQ...I know it all." He pulled on the whiskey again.

John frowned. "What are you talking about? Who are you, anyway?"

"Mal," the guy said, turning back to the bar. "Just, seriously, go talk to her, okay? I really don't want company right now."

"Dude, /how did you know my name?/" John demanded. "Are you stalking me?"

Mal sighed, knocked back the rest of his whiskey and signaled the bartender for another. The bartender was busy pouring for a group of guys down the bar, but he noticed the wave and hustled over to refill Mal's glass before going back to pour the rest.

"Kid, you wouldn't believe me if I told you," Mal said. "Just go talk to Daisy, okay? Really, you two could work great together. Hopefully not /too/ great, but that's not likely."

"Try me," John said. "You can't just drop something like that on a guy and then leave it."

Mal stared into his glass for a moment longer, then shot it down and set the glass on the bar with delicate care before turning to face John.

"Fine," he said. "You want the truth? I'm god."

John's expression of disgust hinted that he wasn't quite ready to convert; it made Mal laugh.

"Not God-god," Mal said. "Next best thing, though. I guess 'sysop' would be better. You ever see The Matrix?"

"Of course I saw The Matrix," John said. "/Everybody/ saw The Matrix. Are you trying to imply that it's real and you're some kind of superuser?"

Mal snorted in disgust. "Of course it's not real," he said. "Using humans for energy? Total bullshit. The Wachowskis failed thermodynamics forever." He took a contemplative sip of his whiskey. "Nah, my guess is they're using us for processing power. Dunno why they gave me chops, though."

John shook his head in disgust and started rummaging for bills in his wallet; once he started listening to drunks it was time to close his tab and go home.

"You've got five twenties, a ten, three fives, and sixteen ones in there," Mal said, not looking over. "What, did you just come from a strip club or something? Who has sixteen ones?"

John stared. "How did you know what was in my wallet?" he demanded.

Mal shrugged. "Told you, I'm a sysop. I see your character sheet. Yours, mine, Daisy's...everyone's." He snorted. "I can even change them," he said. "Just click the little arrows and change a five to a six...boom! Another twenty bucks appears! Goodbye, money supply and simple economics, Mal is here!" He shot back the rest of his whiskey and looked for answers in the empty glass. "It was pretty cool the first few times," he said. "Then it started to take the fun out of things."

John sat back, considering his bar mate. "Sysop, huh? Prove it."

Mal ignored him. "Seeing and fiddling the inventory isn't the worst bit, though," he said contemplatively, rolling the shot glass in his hands. "It's the preferences file that's the problem."

John raised an eyebrow. "Preferences file?" he asked. Yes, he should just leave, but at least the guy was interesting.

Mal nodded distractedly. "Yeah. I met a girl once. Didn't look anything like her"---he waved vaguely at the girl he had called Daisy---"she was blonde and cute. Not pretty, just cute. She had this smile, though...." He trailed off, lost in thought.

John waited, but nothing further was forthcoming. Just as he was opening his mouth to ask, Mal started talking again.

"Met her at an art class," he said. "I was rubbish at painting and I wanted to learn. Wanted to learn it on my own---I was determined not to just up-arrow my Painting skill." He grimaced and took another taste of whiskey to drown an obviously bad memory. "I did that with guitar. Spent a week practicing, got frustrated, up-arrowed myself to master level. I can play anything now. Shoot, I can listen to a song once and then play it back, make it better in the process. I'm the best guitarist you've ever heard, kid. One time, I played outside Santana's trailer; he came out and asked me to join the band."

John snorted. "Sure. How many of those have you had, anyway?"

"These?" Mal said, gesturing with the half-full glass. "Dunno. Doesn't matter, really. My Drunkenness stat automatically down-arrows if it goes past eighty." He shrugged. "Pain in the ass. Can't even enjoy a good drunk. Anyway, that's not the important bit. I met Sierra in this art class; I was determined to learn it the hard way. I noticed her, and her preferences file automatically opened. All of her preferences, neatly arranged for easy reference with nice little up- and down-arrows. All the possible conversation trees and how they would interact with those preferences."

He stared morosely at his glass, swirling the amber liquid around absently. "That was the problem. I wanted to ask her out, so I did. And, of course, the conversation trees were /right there,/ right in front of my eyes. I couldn't help but choose a good one---I mean, I wasn't going to choose a tree that was only two levels deep, right? Only way that ends is 'Piss off.' So, I asked her out on a good tree, and she said yes. We went for coffee at this little place down the street." He turned haunted eyes on John. "I tried not to look, I really did, but the trees were right there, and they weren't going away. I could see exactly what effect each branch would have---whether it would increase or decrease her Affection or Arousal stats, whether it would match against her Humor function, and so on and so on and so on."

John eased back onto the seat and leaned on the bar, curious. "That sounds...handy? I guess?"

Mal snorted and glared at him before knocking back his whiskey again. "You'd think, wouldn't you? Yeah, it was handy. I didn't push, didn't want to take advantage. I could have taken her home that first night, but I didn't---I went down a 'slow play' tree. Went on a few dates, things progressed. Next thing you know we're dating. The sex was awesome. We never fought, she was happy...it was good."

"So, what was the problem?" John asked.

"It was all bullshit," Mal said. "I could see her preferences file, man. If she came home in a bad mood, I knew /exactly/ what to say to get her out of it. When I rubbed her feet, I knew exactly where to press and how hard. I could put her to sleep or get her to tear my clothes off depending on what I wanted. A few times I even played guitar for her, after she begged and teased and poked at me about it. She'd sit spellbound, which just made it worse. And, of course, there was the PMS. That was where things really went wrong."

John frowned. "PMS? /That/ was your big failure point, Mister-I-can-do-everything-right?"

Mal nodded. "Yep. She had really bad periods, and I didn't want to see her suffer. So...I down-arrowed the pain.
