That was a slippery slope; I started up-arrowing her orgasms when we had sex, her immune system when I could see that she was starting to get sick. One night she wanted to make dinner for me for our anniversary; she hated cooking and was terrible at it, but she was determined to do it...I think she thought it would be a really grand, loving gesture. I could have found a conversation tree that would have convinced her not to do it, but I was tired that night and it was easier to just up-arrow her Cooking skill and her enjoyment of cooking."

He looked at the bar, shame written on his face. "Eventually I convinced myself that up-arrowing her Comeliness a tick or ten would be a good thing, would make her happier. I mean, she was cute but she wasn't pretty---she'd be happier if she was pretty, right? And I'd be happier having a pretty girlfriend. Of course, why stop at pretty, right? Just a few more ticks and she could be drop-dead gorgeous. That'd be even better for both of us, wouldn't it?" He glanced over at John with a wry smile. "What do you think, isn't she gorgeous?"

John frowned. "Isn't who gorgeous?"

"Sierra," Mal said.

John stared in puzzlement for a moment and then suddenly the light dawned. "Hang on, are you saying that you dated /Sierra Montane/? Supermodel Sierra Montane?"

Mal nodded. "Pretty little Sierra, all arrowed up. The change came on gradually, over the course of a couple months---weight fell off, measurements changed, skin got finer...while I was at it I up-arrowed her Sensuousness a few times as well. When she decided to try out for a modelling gig they practically threw money at her."

John laughed. "That's a pretty good story, mate. Okay, I'll bite---here you are, playing guitar with Carlos Santana and dating Sierra Montane, you can make money out of nothing...why exactly are you in a bar trying to drink yourself under the table?"

Mal snorted. "Told you," he said, shooting back his glass. "I can't get more than lightly tipsy. Anyway, I never played with Carlos. I don't even play anymore. I up-arrowed it, so what's the point? There's nothing satisfying about playing if you didn't work for it. It was the same with Sierra, after a while. I woke up one day and realized that I'd stopped seeing her as a person; she was just a collection of stats and conversation trees. I'd looked at her character sheet too much, knew everything about her...there was no surprise, no mystery or challenge, nothing left to learn, no need to work for anything. She'd become a puppet and was deliriously happy that way."

Mal tossed back the rest of his whiskey and set it on the bar. He pulled out a pen and started jotting something down on a cocktail napkin. "I broke it off," he said absently, more focused on the words he was writing than speaking. "I down-arrowed her Relationship with me and we parted as friends. I don't date anymore."

Mal pushed the napkin towards John and tossed him a casual two-fingered salute. "Go get 'er, tiger," he said, before turning and walking out of the bar.

John stared after him for a moment before looking down at the napkin. There, written in a neat hand, was a tidy little conversation tree.
