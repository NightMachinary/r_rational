/Click/ - *boop*\\
/click/ - *boop*

Stupid goddamn piece of trash

/click/ - *boop*

How bloody hard is it to make a fucking teakettle? Put a heating element in some plastic, wire it all together, and last of all, add a switch that will for fucks sake *stay switched* when you press it in.

/click/ - *boop*

But clearly the last step is just too much for Philisonic's engineers. You press the switch (/click/) and it just pops right out (*boop*). You replace the kettle, check it works in the store, take it to your kitchen, /click/, *boop*, and you have no tea but you must /scream/.

  Thu Jul 23 15:59:51 2134 -0700 89765b7 (HEAD) (upstream/master) Merge pull request #17223 in METASPACE/matrix: fix off-by-one error in a rarely-executed path of subquantum gravitational logfactorization.

  Also adds a unit test, based on the only know reproduction case so far; see matrix/tests/subquantgrav/kettle.hs

ETA: this is actually only 150 words, so it's not in the running for the price. still, I'd like it to stay here and be judged :P
