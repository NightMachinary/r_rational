  I touched briefly on sympathy for Mal, but... he neither deserves nor needs it. Just down-arrow existential angst, akrasia, and so on; up-arrow intelligence and wisdom and moral inclination, then... do whatever you want.

Huh? Self-modification is deeply scary and should definitely /not/ be taken up just because someone's angsty! What Mal did to Sierra is disgusting (especially since it was done without consent), but no reason to force him to do it to himself.

Once he down-arrows existential angst, akrasia; up-arrows intelligence and wisdom, he won't be doing whatever Mal wants; he'll be doing whatever super-Mal wants. And perhaps that would be worth it, but it's a decision Mal has to come to himself, and definitely not an easy choice.

I have so much sympathy to Mal; he's put in a position where his capabilities so much outscale his reasoning and prediction abilities. If you're given the tools to destroy or fix the world, the only reasonable thing to do is *nothing*. This is way too much power for one person to handle, and Mal deciding to not do anything with it is the good ending.
