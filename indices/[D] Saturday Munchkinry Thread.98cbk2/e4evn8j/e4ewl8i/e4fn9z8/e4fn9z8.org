If you've got a boring job, removing your need to sleep gives you more subjective time away from work. Waiting in line at the supermarket takes less subjective time and conversations occur at 1.5x speed, just like an audiobook. Subjectively driving at 1.5x speed probably makes travel more interesting, and webpages subjectively load faster.

The time you save experiencing these events can be spent doing other things at night.

In fact, I think accepting the slowdown and getting rid of sleep improves your productivity immensely. In a sense, it is making /the rest of the world/ faster.
