Idk, if I just used my power to understand the concept of 'understanding all concept instantly' I would understand which risks there would be in understanding different concepts.

I'd either just avoid understanding certain concept or if that was infeasible use the combined knowledge from understanding psychology, biology and chemistry to edit my brain if necessary. Seems like a catch all solution.

Examples of ways it could go wrong was getting a dehabilitating depression from understanding misery in it's complete form, or understanding the suffering of all being that had ever lived and that understanding leading me to want to destroy all life permanently to avoid that suffering. And with the understanding for rocket science, biology, quantom mechanics, astronomy and such destroying all life seems plausible.
