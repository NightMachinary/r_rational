What about generated pictures? Do you know where a 5-year-old girl thought her house is by looking at her painting of it?

How detailed do the pictures need to be? If someone reduces a number of images of the sky to a pixel each, sends them to you, and you look at it, can you deduce a secret message containing more information than was sent over the wire?
