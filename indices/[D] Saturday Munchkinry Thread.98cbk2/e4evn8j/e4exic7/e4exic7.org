You have a free GPS system, while other people need to pay for it. Except their GPS doesn't need them to see the sky, while yours does. Not exactly useful unless GPS systems crash.

On the other hand, if your power works on pictures that is a whole other thing. You can become an awesome detective, since any picture that includes a bit of sky immediately lets you know where the picture was taken. For example, if a kidnapper sends a photo of his victim and there's a window behind him where you can see the sky? You instantly know his location. You can also check for frauds and false alibis, comparing the location of photos that your ability tells you versus your suspects' claims of where they were.

There's another question here: does your ability only work on Earth? If you see the martian sky through a robot's visual feed, can you tell the exact location of a mars robot? You can get a job at NASA and remotely control robots on other planets to map them out.
