I already talk too quickly so talking 30% slower might benefit me.

I don't think I'll be able to think 50% faster, which means I'll be 30% slower than all my friends, and not to sound elitist or anything but my friends tend to be smart people, and while I'm sure they'd still love me just the same, I probably would become less fun to be around and would have trouble making new friends of the same calibre.
