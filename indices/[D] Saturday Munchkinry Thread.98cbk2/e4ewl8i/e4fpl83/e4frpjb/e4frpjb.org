I think you can train to do a lot of things faster though, like talking, walking, driving, etc., things you don't normally go as fast as you can because it would bother other people if you collided with them at full speed or talked so fast no one understands what you are saying. If you get 33.3% slower, you can just train to do things 50% faster in your subjective time. It will take a while to retrain all your skills to be 50% faster, but I suspect it is easier than it sounds.
