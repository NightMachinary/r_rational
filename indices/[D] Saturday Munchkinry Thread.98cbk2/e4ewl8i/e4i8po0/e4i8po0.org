Well I'm assuming that if you sleep extra to speed up your perception that your lifespan remains the same despite the sped up metabolism, after all if you don't assume this then your waking lifespan would likely end up being subjectively shorter. Similarly it seems like you need to assume slowing down your experience actually extends your lifespan otherwise your lifespan is also subjectively shortened.

Anyway if it were just a metabolic effect then speeding yourself up by sleeping extra could let you make a lot of money by either being the only known human with superpowers (at the extreme end) or just become very wealthy as a professional athlete.\\
However because your body is actually defying physics I think the best bet is getting rid of sleep entirely. You'd perceive everything as being 33% faster however that's manageable. Additionally picking the maximum amount of time dilation is in your best interest, because while it in theory doesn't increase your subjective lifespan, in practice it does increase the chance you live long enough to see anti-aging tech developed. Also notable is that since your body is blatantly in violation of physics (I suspect you might be able to use it to violate thermodynamics, but can't figure out how) you can probably become pretty rich off of the fame of being the only known supernatural phenomenon.
