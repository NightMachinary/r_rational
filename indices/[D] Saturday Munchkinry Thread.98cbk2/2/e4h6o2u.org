I hope I do not come in violation of the OP "ban", but I think that the twist at the end will make it worth it.

What's the worse that can happen for a person that has the literal power of "can understand all concepts instantly".

Assume no biological "backfiring", the brain of that individual has been somehow uploaded to a conceptual mind-space and the brain will suffer no ill effect.

How will the person live be completely ruined? Assume a universe indistinguishable from hours, so no known memetic hazards such as eldritch beings do exist.

If you were bestowed with this power, how would you minimize said ill effects?
