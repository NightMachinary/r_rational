I don't know about ordinary life, but you could become a super-hero/soldier/agent if you compressed your wake time down by a factor of 2 or 3, or more. They could shuttle you around in a helicopter while you're asleep, and then take you to places where you're needed, then you wake up and go obliterating people so fast they couldn't keep up or realize what's going on.

This would require you to basically devote your life to this super combat thing, and it'd still be dangerous even if you're really fast, but perhaps you could broker a deal with the government to do this for a fixed amount of years with an extremely high salary and then disable it and retire afterwards.
