The problem with slowing yourself down and eliminating the need for sleep is if you have a job that requires brainpower, you won't be as good as it as you used to be, so you might get fired or demoted if you started working 30% slower.

Actually even if you have a job flipping burgers, doing it 30% slower would be cause for a firing, too.

Then again, most offices have the proverbial person who works 30% slower than everyone else and seems not to be fired. But I'd still worry about maintaining friendships with intelligent people: all of a sudden I'd be thinking and talking etc 30% slower than everyone else, and I feel like if one of my friends got THIRTY PERCENT SLOWER they'd seem to change personality a lot: no longer with quick witty rejoinders, stuff like that.

As someone else pointed out, it'd make a lot of everyday situations better (getting places faster when you drive, lectures are sped up a bit, etc), but I think the stuff that I actually value - like friendship - would go slower.

Not to mention that you'd all of a sudden be 30% slower at writing and thinking and all of a sudden a 3 hour exam would require 4 hours to do. You'd have to see if you could get diagnosed with some learning disability (probably not hard if you're 30% slower!) and then get special consideration that way to have more time for the exam.
