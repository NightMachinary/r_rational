You are given the opportunity to permanently change how much sleep you need, with the following catch: time dilates so the quantity of subjective experience available to you as a result of this decision does not change. Which is to say that for however much more or less sleep you now require of yourself, your previous amount of waking awareness gets spread out over the time during which you are awake. So if you normally need 8h of sleep per 24h and alter yourself to need 4h of sleep, your newfound 20h of wakefulness gets spread out over 16h of experience, and you move through the world as if 20% slower in all respects. Conversely, if you require of yourself extra sleep and go from needing, say, 8h to 16h, you perceive the remaining 8h/24h of wakefulness twice as fast, so as to still "experience" 16h. Both your thoughts and your movements, reactions, and other physical processes are accelerated or deaccelerated accordingly. The gained or lost wakeful time is compensated by an opposite effect applied to your sleeping body. Should technology be developed to reduce the need for sleep by over 50% and you use it, you return to your prior, undilated sleep schedule (so something like melatonin would be fine, but any scifi brain-rejuvenators would not. This does not apply to behavioral change available to you now, e.g. short-polyphasic sleep schedules). You can also willingly cancel the effect -- but will never be able to reinstate it upon doing so. You still get sleepy after a normal amount of wakeful experience, and feel rejuvenated after a normal amount of dormant experience. The effect is applied on a cellular basis, and any matter incorporated into your cells sees the effect take place. You interact with external objects as if they had proportionally higher or lower energy.

Would there be any benefit to accepting this effect, and in which direction? Would you change anything, or do you currently occupy a global optimum? I think I'd be tempted to require of myself an extra hour of sleep, and thereby give myself a slight edge in any for of competition. The change in pitch and information transfer from others wouldn't be too noticeable, either, and I imagine I'd quickly acclimate. More extreme amounts (e.g. 2x-5x waking speedup) would let me dominate at sport but I think the impact on day-to-day life would be too burdensome. I guess in all cases you could donate or sell your services to Scienceâ„¢ to see if the effect could be better understood.

Also, is there any exotic, physics-y munchkinry to be had with the power as described (or interpreted)? The time dilation effect seems like it could result in some wonkiness at the extremes -- if you compress 8h of sleep into a second, it seems any minute, dreamy fidget would find you thrumming with vast energies. Even more if you compress your wakeful time into a second, and zip around like Quicksilver (but without any required secondary powers). If these sorts of considerations dominate your response, consider also the alternate scenario where the main effects of the power are the same, but they're accomplished by more mundane means -- your metabolism slows or accelerates biochemically, your nerve conduction velocity increases or decreases through improved myelination or whatever, your muscle fibers restructure to expand or contract more or less forcefully, etc. So that the lived experience is ultimately the same, but doesn't require reality warping, just hyperadvanced alien surgery.
