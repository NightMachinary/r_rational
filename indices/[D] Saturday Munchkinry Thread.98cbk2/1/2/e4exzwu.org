I would probably change it so I need no sleep at all. 16 hours stretched over 24 hours means my brain moves at 2/3rd of the speed, sure, but I don't particularly have any time-stressful situations in my daily life that I need to think fast for. At best, there are tasks to complete by a certain day, but 2/3rd speed over 24 hours gets the same amount of work done as normal speed over 16 hours anyway (if not more work done since there are other time consuming things involved with work that don't depend on my mind/body).

I mean, you can go the other extreme and need 23hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds of sleep to go stupidly fast whenever you're awake, but that's a really shitty superpower when you can only use it for 1 second a day and spend the rest of the time comatose and vulnerable.
