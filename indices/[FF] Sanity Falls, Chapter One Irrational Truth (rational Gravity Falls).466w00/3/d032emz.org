So, glad you made this, one of the shows I've put serious thought into writing a ratfic of.

My notes:

Dipper is very obnoxious and hpmor-like, almost to the point of parody. Will wait and see how that pans out. (Some deconstruction maybe?)

Mabel feels much closer to how I'd expect an exceptionally intelligent version of her to act.

Wendy being into the same stuff as Dipper kind of breaks my suspension of disbelief, but I can see it's necessary if you want this Dipper to look up to her as in canon.

The implication that The Northern Caves happened makes me very hopeful about your version of Bill.

I noticed there's no sign of cryptograms/puzzles, and no mention of gibberish or strange characters when Dipper's examining the Journal. Will that aspect of the show be making an appearance, either in the medium as actual puzzles, or as part of the plot?

I am excited to see where you take this!
