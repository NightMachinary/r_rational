The Northern Caves by nostalgebraist; Chesscourt is the "in story" series that The Northern Caves is focused on.

It isn't the easiest thing to read, and was posted here a while back to mixed reception.

I quite enjoyed it though, for what it was.

Beyond that, I hesitate to claim I know why it was referenced. I realize now there's a strong chance it was just a shout out.
