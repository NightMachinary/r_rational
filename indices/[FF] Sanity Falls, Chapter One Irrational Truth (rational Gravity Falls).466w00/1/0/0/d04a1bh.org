  Seconding that this Dipper is incredibly unlikable. I kind of hope that he gets eaten by gnomes. Also, Soos actually (somehow) seems less intelligent than he is in canon?

Did you miss the part there where Soos owned Dipper's smug, showing-off antics butt without even trying? Or where, in the show, he turns out to be smart and capable for pretty much of the time?

Or where Dipper in this story is being annoying now to represent a /certain type/ of shallowly competent, inexperienced, and fantastically un-self-aware rationalist stereotype, all to provide a strong character arc when he gets hit by a magical realism/sci-fi clue bat?

I'm now questioning everything. Like, whether you and some others ever watched the show /or/ read this fanfic chapter.
