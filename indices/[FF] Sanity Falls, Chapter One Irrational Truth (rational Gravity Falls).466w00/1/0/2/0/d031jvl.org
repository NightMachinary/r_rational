Mabel is no different than canon, where Dipper is... I don't know what his IQ is supposed to be, but apparently he's a twelve-year-old discussing obscure physics, teaching himself from the age of eight, and really giving us no reason to doubt his assertion that he is one of the greatest minds on Earth. He might be seriously lacking in people skills, but that's not what IQ is about.
