Having just read the first 22 chapters in the space of a few hours... I feel like I'm +voluntarily+ exposing myself to an infohazard.

Edit: Not sure if temporarily stopping reading 'broke the spell' or if the conclusion is just a little bit disappointing, but one way or the other it didn't quite maintain the compelling tension through the final chapters for me. Still well worth the time spent.
