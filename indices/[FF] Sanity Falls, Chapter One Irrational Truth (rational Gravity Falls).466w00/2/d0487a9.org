Let's see how we do on the anti-GaryStu scale:

- Unreliably arrogant narrator...
- ...who everyone but his sister will want to punch in the teeth
- ...who mistakes knowledge and breadth of experience for intelligence
- ...with an actual kid's voice in an intelligent rationalist story character
- ...who makes subtle mistakes, simply because he isn't unrealistically-perfectly self-aware and experienced

Lots of overturned tropes. Very well done fanfic so far.

Bonus points for AnnoyingInnerMonologue!Dipper getting owned by Soos and not realizing it. That now classic rational-fic "The Game" scene getting subverted was precious.
