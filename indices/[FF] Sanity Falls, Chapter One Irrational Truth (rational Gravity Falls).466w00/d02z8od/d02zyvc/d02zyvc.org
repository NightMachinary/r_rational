/prepares to read story, but less enthusiastically and more warily than before

EDIT: Seconding that this Dipper is incredibly unlikable. I kind of hope that he gets eaten by gnomes. Also, Soos actually (somehow) seems less intelligent than he is in canon? Dipper's condescension really isn't helping though. Also kind of weird that there's such a vast gulf in IQ between Dipper and Mabel.
