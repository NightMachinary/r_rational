  Did you miss the part there where Soos owned Dipper's smug, showing-off antics butt without even trying?
#+end_quote

The bit about him creating a rule with weird exceptions and so forth? If not, I wasn't able to read the whole thing, so I might have missed it.

  Or where, in the show, he turns out to be smart and capable for pretty much of the time?
#+end_quote

This is true. I haven't watched the show in some time, so I forgot.

  Or where Dipper in this story is being annoying now to represent a certain type of shallowly competent, inexperienced, and fantastically un-self-aware rationalist stereotype, all to provide a strong character arc when he gets hit by a magical realism/sci-fi clue bat?

Oh, sure, I totally get what's intended here. The problem is that I have to be in the head of a character who, for the time being, I'd prefer to see eaten by gnomes.

It doesn't matter how good your viewpoint character is /going to be/, if in the meantime it's a chore to be in that character's head.
