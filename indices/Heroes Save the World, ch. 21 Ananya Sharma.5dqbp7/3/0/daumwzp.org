  In India the Prime Minister is the country's leader in practice. You would expect him to be involved
#+end_quote

Oh whoops! I should have known that, too. >.>

I'm, um, going to fix that in a few minutes.

  The chapter felt even shorter than other chapters.
#+end_quote

I hear ya. This chapter seems to have run the gamut from your opinion to "I loved it," with myself being on the more hesitant side.

  Is all of the text supposed to be Ananya's thoughts/state of mind? Because otherwise the last line seems really weird.
#+end_quote

The text is at least generally supposed to be the POV character's thoughts/state of mind (there's some editorializing, and obviously it's not as stream-of-consciousness as it could be).

  Was she asked if she is okay with not attending school anymore? What about having some other form of education just so she doesn't remain, well, uneducated?
#+end_quote

Her feelings about school are a mixed bag. On the one hand, it's nice that she can pursue things on her own time, because it's more enjoyable and effective for her to learn that way. On the other hand, it's also, as the chapter points out, a reminder of how she's different from everyone else. She didn't think about that at first, though.

I imagine that Ananya is studying on her own time, and not just going without an education.

  How confidentially is India handling her existence? At the very least a bunch of scientists and engineers seem to know all about her now. Are her powers even secret?
#+end_quote

Ananya is being treated like a black ops project, basically. You can bring in engineers and such to deal with those, but security clearance has to be granted, etc.

#+begin_quote
  Keep up the good work. This may not be one of my favorite chapters but the story overall is pretty good till now.

Thank you! It really means a lot to get such fleshed-out reviews as you've been giving.
