I have two criticisms and X questions:

- In India the Prime Minister is the country's leader in practice. You would expect him to be involved The President does in theory hold a lot of power as well but that's due to presidents never having exercised their over to the extend that someone challenged them in court. Or so says quick googling. In any case, it is the Prime Minister and his party who decide the policy of the executive. In fact the cabinet is not even legally obliged to heed the President's advice. The President's job outside of emergencies doesn't go beyond putting his stamp of approval on it and making sure everything continues to be constitutional.

- The chapter felt even shorter than other chapters. Nothing really happened, be it plot or conversation, and the only things we learned is that her power limit is so high as to not yet have been determined and that she has a dislike for being irrelevant and a small tendency towards megalomania.

- Is all of the text supposed to be Ananya's thoughts/state of mind? Because otherwise the last line seems really weird.

- Was she asked if she is okay with not attending school anymore? What about having some other form of education just so she doesn't remain, well, uneducated? It could matter for someone who essentially has the power to partially lay low the power grid.

- How confidentially is India handling her existence? At the very least a bunch of scientists and engineers seem to know all about her now. Are her powers even secret?

Keep up the good work. This may not be one of my favorite chapters but the story overall is pretty good till now.
