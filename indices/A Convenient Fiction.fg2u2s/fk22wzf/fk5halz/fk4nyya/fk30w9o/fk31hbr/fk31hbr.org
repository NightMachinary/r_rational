Thanks for the feedback! Before I reply in spoilers, I will say that speculation like this is exactly what I want to encourage and reward in the story.

The boy is meant to be a terrifying antagonist, but he hates /bargainers/ for a reason. I should clarify a bit in-story how this works. I'll be getting more technical with the start of chapter 6. Short version is that Munin owns the Deals, but the entities involved in the the pacts, including Faustian and even Munin himself, are still on the hook for what they owe. The one owed the services is what changes. That's what makes the Deals such a huge prize for any spirit capable of using them.

More specific to the Deal at issue, Surret is now bound not to seek retribution against Munin rather than Faustian. Faustian's service to Surret remains intact. Having this work otherwise would cause Munin to get all of the responsibility along with the bling.
