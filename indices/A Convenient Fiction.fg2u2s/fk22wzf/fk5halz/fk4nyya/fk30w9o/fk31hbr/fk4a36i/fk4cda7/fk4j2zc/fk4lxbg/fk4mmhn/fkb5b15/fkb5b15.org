I'm seeing some upvotes on your comments, so I'll seek some more critical input after the story has progressed further. I think I will end up rewriting this bit in chapter 1.

At issue is that Surret has gone missing at times, but never anywhere near as long as his last one. His absence is now barely felt by his family, and there's a good amount of buried resentment because he wasn't there to parent and help pay the bills throughout almost all of his kids' childhoods. They think he's dead, or maybe worse. The concept seems believable enough to me, but I will own that I can do a better job selling this to the reader.
