yeah I can believe there would be resentment, but if a loved one vanished and was presumed dead or worse, and they showed back up after 15 years and it was clear it wasn't their choice or fault, I don't think the typical response would be "hey fuck you for not paying the bills." By then I feel like they'd have moved past the frustration to just sadness then resignation. It would take a pretty shitty person to know their loved one was basically kidnapped and unable to return home for years and respond only with anger and rejection when they return.

Now, the kids I could understand being frustrated - they were still young when he vanished, they only knew him briefly. They probably wouldn't have a deep connection to him, though it might be mend-able over time. I'm mainly thinking the wife. Certainly their romantic relationship is over, but I would think he'd still be able to be friends and see his kids if he wanted.
