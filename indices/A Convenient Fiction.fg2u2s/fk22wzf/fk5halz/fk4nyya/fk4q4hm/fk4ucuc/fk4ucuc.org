  How would you change it?

Wow, you're asking me for /constructive/ advice? Shit, I'm not trained for this.

More seriously, normally in a story you have kind of a rising action pattern, where first you introduce the character's normal life, then you start introducing stakes; usually something the main character wants, or something that threatens them. As the story progresses, the main characters does something to get what they want / escape the threat, which progressively introducing new elements, that complicate the plot, create obstacles, and generally build up whatever it is the character wants (so that, ideally, we start empathizing and wanting it for them).

Eventually the story reaches a tipping point, the chekov guns are fired, the tension that was built up is paid off, and the characters reach their new situation (eg the isekai protagonist comes back home changed after defeating the dark lord).

This story... doesn't really have that? Like, it has /ideas/, but it doesn't really have a "set-up -> build-up -> pay-off" structure (yet).

Problems are introduced (Surret is trapped on an island) and solved almost immediately (Surret goes after the bargainer). Dor needs to do something to save some random world, Dor is given everything she needs to save that world with no visible effort.

There aren't really /stakes/. The closest we have is Surret and Dor wanting to see each other, except Surret doesn't know anything about Dor, and Dor doesn't seem to care that much about her biological father.

Don't get me wrong, it's interesting and new. But so far it's just, like, a collection of things that happen, with little direction.
