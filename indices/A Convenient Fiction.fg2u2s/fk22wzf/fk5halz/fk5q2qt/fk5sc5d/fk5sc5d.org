Makes sense! It's a Homestuck thing-- an Incipisphere is a reality instantiated by a session of a video game (long story) which contains a planet for every player (the planets' size and distance from each other are... /context-dependent/) which is named /The Land of X and Y/, with thematically appropriate values of X and Y for each player, like The Land Of Light and Rain or The Land of Wind and Shade or The Land Of Heat and Clockwork.

So yeah I was pretty sure it wasn't a matter of Faustian grabbing an Incipisphere for his plans-- I think he'd go less postmodern in his selection of battlefield-- but either way I love the above sentence, great work.
