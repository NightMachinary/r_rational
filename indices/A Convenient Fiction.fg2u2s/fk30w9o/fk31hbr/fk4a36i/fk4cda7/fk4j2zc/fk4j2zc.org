I wasn't at all swayed by faustians justifications in ch2. He's set up as untrustworthy. Also if Sutton's family is aware of his penchant for disappearing, as we learn later, the reunion shouldn't be as fraught as Faustian claims. They know he goes to other worlds and actively trained his daughter against the eventuality. Sad as it might be, they should be sympathetic to his plight and allow some interaction with his children.
