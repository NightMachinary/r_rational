Thanks! Out of curiosity, how far have you read?

To tip my hand a bit, that's the first impression you're meant to have, and also a big part of why Surret loathes /bargainers/. Stories about clown gods messing with heroes for the evulz get dull fast, so I'm trying for something more nuanced. While I hint at it in chapter 1's second bargain, chapter 2 is where I have Faustian speak briefly with his partners about why he interpreted the Deal as he did.
