The first deal involves an ongoing deal though, and we've seen 3 versions of it - 2 he proposed and 1 counter offer he accepted. Let's say he's not sure which version he agreed to with Surret, but he wants to reveal Surret's full name for whatever reason. In reverse chronological order:

Case 3: He may use the name only with prior authorization - saying Uther would be a fourth mistake.

Case 2: He may use the name if approval or permission is likely - Surret has already made it clear he does not approve of his first name being used and forbade its use. If Faustian said Uther, that would again be a fourth mistake.

Case 1: He may use the name if Surret would "reasonably approve" of the use - well, even though Surret has maintained the boundary of not using his first name, there can be an argument that the restriction is not a reasonable one. Then again, Surret never approved of the name being used even when being otherwise reasonable, but only when the name was being used to get his attention, not to describe him, so I guess it's up to whomever decides such things to decide if the use was fair. Faustian has some leeway in this case.

Of course, it seems the rule is whether the opposite party would be satisfied by what they received, in which case Faustian should avoid agreeing to not do something whenever he can or at least set a time limit on such things. If he doesn't provide enough of a boon he can try harder and make it happen. If he does something he's not allowed to, he can't easily undo it. Would Surret be satisfied with the reasonable approval argument in the case where his name was dropped in negotiations with Dor? Probably not, even if he agreed with the second half of the argument. Good thing for Faustian that nobody was around to hear and tell Surret.

So there's gotta be a perfect memory thing for deals going on too or Faustian wouldn't use the name so freely. Also I wonder if everyone Faustian has ever made 3 deals with knows they're not allowed to say Munin's name now but can use Faustian's name to bind him. Also since the phrasing was so vague, if people can't use their own name to bind themselves (such as signatures or wedding vows).
