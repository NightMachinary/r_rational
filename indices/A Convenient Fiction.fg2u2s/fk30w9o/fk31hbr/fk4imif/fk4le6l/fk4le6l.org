Correct on your first point.

The birthday party is planned for the chapter after this next one.

Regarding standardized language: Faustian is somewhat protected because he is the one who delivers second in most situations. Surret and Munin turned this on its head when restitution for a 3x broken Deal entered the picture. They already knew what Faustian's side would be, more or less.

Deals are artisinal things, and very difficult to standardize. /Bargainers/ make arrangements with lots of bizarre and otherworldly beings, many of whom are enormously powerful, short on attention, and quite vengeful. There is at least one other consideration for mortal Deals, hinted at in chaper 2.
