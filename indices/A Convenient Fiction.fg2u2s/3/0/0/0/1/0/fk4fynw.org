Gotcha. I'll try a read-through and see if I can clarify the hints in the story, or maybe throw in a couple more.

You were correct to infer that Surret was owed big-time for Faustian's screw-ups.

You are also correct that Faustian will be a weasel - but I don't want that to come across as effortless, nor as purposeless. Lack of consequences ruins dramatic tension, as do heroes and villains with perfect track records. Thanks for pointing out that Faustian is in this neighborhood.
