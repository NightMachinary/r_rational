even if the information were reliable, I'd find it strange that the family would be so aware of the situation as to train their daughter, but still consider him a "deadbeat dad." Would there be regret, resentment? Sure. But she must of known of his condition /before/ he left, and after 10+ years she must have come to some peace with it. I would expect some sympathy. and the possibility of being part of his children's lives, even if their relationship is over.
