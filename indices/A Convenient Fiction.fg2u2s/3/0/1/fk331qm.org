Looking forward to it.

So far I'm rooting for Surret, maybe Dor, and against Faustian, and slightly against Munin with the caveat that she can get back to 'for' if it turns out her actions at the end there are to Surret's or Dor's benefit.

I notice this ranking matches how much we know about each character's motivations so far so maybe that's intentional.
