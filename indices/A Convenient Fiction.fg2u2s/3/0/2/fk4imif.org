Ohh, I had to read this a second time. Now I get it I think. Even though Munin owns all the deals, she only gets the benefits which Faustian was previously entitled to. Nobody whom Faustian has made deals with can use Munin's name for purposes she wouldn't agree to, or whatever the specific languagewas in each deal, but Faustian still owes Dor a party, presents, and cake in a birthday-like context (which Faustian promised in exchange for making the deal fast and making a counter offer, I guess).

speaking of nonspecific language, Faustian is really bad at this too, for it being his concept so to speak. How's he supposed to keep track of his agreements if he doesn't insist on standardized language and terms?
