I'm a bit hesitant to speak to all of Faustian's abilities because spoilers. His approach to Deals with mortals is somewhat formulaic, as you've noted.

The domain of forbidden knowledge is interesting, as it relates to the transfer of Deals. I'll clarify as follows:

Surret still cannot speak Faustian's name in disallowed context, however doing so will result in a penalty and restitution to Munin. The same is true for Faustian in regards to Surret's name. But, that said, things run off the tracks and get pretty messy. I think I'll instead simply clean up the language of Surret's request.
