I've just finished the first chapter and came back to comment:

I enjoyed this quite a bit, and the subversions were well done. I liked the fact that the temptress was about companionship, not sex. The truck didn't make a lot of sense to me and I'm unclear what happened to his stick or how the two related, but I didn't have an issue with it. I didn't see the twist coming where it's actually the devil's story and not the man's, and I'm curious to see where you go with it.

Overall: Nicely done.
