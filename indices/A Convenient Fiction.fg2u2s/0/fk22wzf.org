Hi, folks.

I've decided to try my hand at a short story, exploring the side of isekai that normally just works itself out once the tale is told. I'm looking for feedback on the work, and advice on my technique and ideas.

My goal as an author is to create something that makes perfect sense when you finish it, but still manages to surprise and delight.

I've got five chapters up so far. If you would be so kind, please read it and let me know what you think!

Edit: Hey, just to be clear, it's okay if you don't like it, but useful criticism rather than quiet downvotes would be appreciated. Not much I can learn from, otherwise!
