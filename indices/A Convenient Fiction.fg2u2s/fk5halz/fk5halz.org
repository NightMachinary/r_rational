I'm enjoying this.

I'm reasonably confident they're not in an Incipisphere. They're... they're not in an Incipisphere right?

The power of threefold repetition reminded me of Pact, as did the dealings of the /bargainer/ and the oracle.

I enjoy that Surret's power derives from the secrets and names he knows, the debts he can call upon, and his ability to turn those things into leverage. I enjoy the conversational minefields. More mines!

I look forward to learning more about the power structures of this setting. I imagine, since different fictional worlds seem to be accessible a la /Marriage and Monsters/, there's no shortage of gods drifting about, so I have to wonder what Faustian is planning.
