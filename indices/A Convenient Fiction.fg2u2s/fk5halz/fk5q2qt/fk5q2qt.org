  I'm reasonably confident they're not in an Incipisphere. They're... they're not in an Incipisphere right?

Heh, well - I actually don't know what Incipisphere is. I did include and will continue to sprinkle in references to actual fiction (/Earthsea/, /Lord of the Flies/, /Scott Pilgrim/, etc.). The /Lands of Song and Artifice/ are an original creation. They're intended to be a children's story world, much like Narnia. I didn't want this work to be FanFic, though, so I make my own worlds.
