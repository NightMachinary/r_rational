I really like this feeling of unquestionable out-of-your-depthness this chapter creates; this is /exactly/ what should happen when untrained people are trying to barge into some evil plot, Harry Potter-style.

That said, the All-Mother of demons, the High Father of dragons. Coincidence? I wouldn't be sure.

So, what's going on with the nonexisting visit? Nic indeed hallucinated it? Unsatisfying. Someone modified his perceptions for the duration? No important reason to do so that I could think of. Dizzy and Fanny and Davo are lying? No likely reason for them to cooperate on this that I could think of, let alone so competently. Someone modified memories of Dizzy and Fanny and Davo? For what reason? Arcanum poisoning causes overlap with alternate timelines? Now that's unlikely.

Fine, what did it /accomplish/? Simole was the one who handed him the pen in the other version of events, and that version didn't have Fanny and Davo visiting him. I don't see a useful angle here.

Nic decided that Delzina cared about him enough to visit him. Was it was done so he would seek her help with infiltrating the library? It still seems pretty inconsequential. Alternatively, was Fanny-and-Davo-did-it version of events fabricated to make Nic believe Dizzy didn't care for him as much?

If latter, it could've been arranged by Dizzy herself. If former, some yet-unnamed precog would be the only one with the motivation.
