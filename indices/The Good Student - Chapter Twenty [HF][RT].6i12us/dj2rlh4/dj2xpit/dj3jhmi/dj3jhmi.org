Good point about Arcanum shielding.

No, whoever did it must definitely have planned for Nic remembering everything: Fanny and Davo's version of events includes him "rambling like a loon", which would convince him he hallucinated everything but which is unnecessary if his memories were supposed to be edited as well.

Whether or not Dizzy has the skills personally matters little: she has her father's resources to call on if absolutely necessary, and albeit she firmly subscribes to "the only power we have is the power we take for ourselves", it doesn't mean she can't use henchmen or call in personal favors. She could've gone as far as arranging her /own/ memories to be edited, to sell the act.

  Maybe Nic was hallucinating Dizzy, and Simole stumbled upon the scene when she tried sensing Nic's mind?

Interesting idea. Yes, maybe.
