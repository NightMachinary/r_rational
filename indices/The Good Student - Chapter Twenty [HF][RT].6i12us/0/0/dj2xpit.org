Regarding the nonexistent visit, I guess the natural question to ask is whether Dizzy herself has the abilities to fabricate Fanny and Davo's memories. And if she did, why not Nic's?

A related fact that might answer the last question is this tidbit from Chapter Nineteen:

#+begin_quote
  “...The other thing such a large dose of Arcanum does to a person, apart from killing them, is shield them from prying eyes. There's no way to look inside Nic's head to see if it's really him. Or if he's alone in there.”

  “You can do that?” asked Fanny, blushing hard. “You can look inside people's heads? Can you read their thoughts?”

  “No,” said Simole. “I'm not a carnival sideshow. But I can sense presences. People tend to have a specific... feel to them. I'm not sure how to explain it.”

Admittedly not much has been established about the mechanics of Arcanum yet. If it /is/ possible to alter people's memories, then presumably the skill would be related to the one Simole is describing above. It also stands to reason that the Arcanum in Nic's body would have prevented attempts to edit his memories. Perhaps the person who was changing people's recollections wasn't aware of this fact. If it /was/ Dizzy, then her surprise at Nic's recollection might have been genuine. Even if she was able to play it off convincingly this chapter, we know that Nic isn't good at reading people. He might not be a reliable narrator for that matter, with all the people poking in his head.

To be honest, I find it unlikely that Dizzy has the skills to alter memories. I think it's more likely that Simole is the source of the anomaly, even if her motives are unclear. Maybe Nic /was/ hallucinating Dizzy, and Simole stumbled upon the scene when she tried sensing Nic's mind?
