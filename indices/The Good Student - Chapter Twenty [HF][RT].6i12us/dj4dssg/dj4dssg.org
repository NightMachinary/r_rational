Hmmm the pace of progression in the story seems a bit to high... also everything in this chapter is sooo dramatic. I really hope the story will slow down a bit again and goes back to the world building and his school life.Right now it feels very rushed, one plot after the other.

And i feel like theres a huge amount of missed potential in this chapter : so Nic talked to the Minister and tells him about the doorway (wish we can be sure he knows exactly what he means) , now why would Simoles father then turn up at night and ask about her body etc.? first of it would be quite rational to assume that the minister and the former archmage know each other quite well as both of them are probably 2 of the most powerful man in the kingdom, and that the minister knows exactly why simoles father betrayed the kingdom and wanted to erase all magic (after all its actually his job to know such things) . So heres a guess wouldnt it be thus very rational to assume that the minister after talking to nic would guess that simole is probably still alive and secure her body and then rush of to talk to simoles father? after all he should for one know that simoles father is not truly powerless and bound in prison, and secondly think about it 2 of the most powerful man both basically in the same position trying to protect the kingdom or humanity from the darkness, most likely having a past of encounters with each other interwined with interesting events of the past that chaped the country, both of them having strong and independent daughters etc. First of it would have made absolutly sense for him to talk to simoles father thus not only slowing down the pace of the story , but also giving us a huge chance of seeing more of the character of both of them while they interact with each other, even giving a huge chance of hinting at events in the past adding to the worldbuilding. Right now both the minister and the archmage seem to be very 2 dimensional , and I would have loved to see them react and talk about this, and about their daughters... also ensuring simoles father that her body is safe, would have given the whole story time and room to breath and would have lead to a less rushed version of nics story. Not to mention the whole plot is now centered around nic, which feels a bit like lazy writing.
