It depends. On the one hand - sure, having a friend that you can trust completely, and who shares you expertise and expenses without adding much in the way of costs sounds awesome. But on the other hand, you'd have to start worrying about being found out. You have a time machine, and you have to keep it quiet unless you want to /immediately/ be subject to irregular rendition. Time travel, even the relatively restricted time travel used in the movies, is way too powerful for anyone to know about it, unless you have significant leverage first.

(Living with a double doesn't work for Abe and Aaron, because they're the sort of people who can't self-cooperate.)
