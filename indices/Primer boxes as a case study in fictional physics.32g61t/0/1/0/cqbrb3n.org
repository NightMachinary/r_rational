  Ordinarily you'd have a 2^{-100} chance of succeeding, but with a time machine you can raise that to near certainty, by doing an exhaustive search (using a 100-digit binary number as a counter) and then looping the right answer.

That only works if there's a less than 2^{-100} chance of failure. Otherwise, your system will fail before reaching the correct answer.
