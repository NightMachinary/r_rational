Yeah, I'm very familiar with Sam's writeup. The first half of my writeup covers most of it, I think, and goes slightly further by specifying probabilities and describing (indirectly) what happens if you open the box midway through the trip.

Your writeup on exploits is also quite good. It looks like we can prevent disasters with near certainty. Also, you could use the device as a sort of generalized "outcome pump". Let's say you're facing a difficult situation where you have to answer 100 yes/no questions correctly. Ordinarily you'd have a 2^{-100} chance of succeeding, but with a time machine you can raise that to near certainty, by doing an exhaustive search (using a 100-digit binary number as a counter) and then looping the right answer. That can help you solve many kinds of problems, like convincing the gatekeeper to let you out of the box :-)

The big problem to me is, indeed, the physical interactions at the boundary. It's hard to imagine that any inventor would be uninterested in such questions.
