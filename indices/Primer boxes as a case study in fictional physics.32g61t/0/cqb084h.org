[[/u/sam512]], who wrote /Fine Structure/ and /Ra/ among other things, has a fantastic breakdown of [[http://qntm.org/coffin][Time Travel in Primer]] (also, [[http://qntm.org/commentary][a fan commentary]] that's quite good). I believe that Sam's interpretation is the correct one.

There's a bit of fuzziness to the Primer model that I'm not sure that you can easily solve. How outside physics interacts with the box is one big question mark - obviously they still experience gravity, and presumably the flimsy box would be blown apart by the vacuum if they didn't experience outside air pressure, but it's not clear how this actually works from a physics perspective. For the purposes of the story, it's unimportant. If I were writing /Primer/ fanfic, it would probably be played for horror - they don't really understand how the box works, only that it does, but the temptation to go back in time and make millions overwhelms the caution that they should be feeling (which gets compounded with the shaking hands and bleeding noses).

If you allow that the box can be weighed to see what's in it, you're going to run into the "problem" that you don't really need to travel back in time at all; you could just send information in the form of throwing some weights into the thing. (Alternately, they could have built a simple robot that opens up the door at the correct time and outputs stock information at point A that they put in at point B - again, without any danger to themselves aside from the existential questions. From there it just becomes [[http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2010/01/exploiting-multi-universe-time-travel.html][exploiting multiple universe time travel]] the old-fashioned way.)
