You have a time machine. This gives you near-godlike ability to predict the future by careful use of automated devices and the small primer boxes. You can either use a long-range box as a dead man switch, or a bunch of short-range boxes with automated relays so you can view the data stream at any time.

Sure, you might end up with a bunch of versions of yourself that suffer from bad outcomes, but that happens anyway, even without time machines.
