Pact/Pale (by Wildbow) is a worthy mention. Obviously Wildbow doesn't write 100% rational stuff, but one feature of all his stories is the extent to which the worlds are explained using logically consistent rules, and Pact/Pale (which are set in the same world, but disconnected from each other) are no exception.

I especially like how he explains the masquerade, which is IMO the hardest thing to get right about urban fantasy: everyone, from humans to supernatural creatures, are incentivized to keep the existence of magic secret for a bunch of really good reasons. Particularly interesting is Karma, because for everyone you bring in you're responsible for some of the negative Karma they gain, which means both that you don't want to bring in too many people, and that you want to carefully vet the people that you do bring in.

Also they have Wildbow's usual standard of interesting powers and characters whose motivations are thought through and shown well, but that goes without saying. Pact is a bit too intense throughout for a lot of people's taste and doesn't do a great job of showing off a lot of the cool worldbuilding it sets up, but Pale makes up for both those problems and was intended to do so without requiring people to read Pact first.
