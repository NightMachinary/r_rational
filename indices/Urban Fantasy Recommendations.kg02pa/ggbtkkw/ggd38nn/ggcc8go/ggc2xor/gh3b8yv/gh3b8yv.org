I'll toss in the Rivers of London series, which follows a young British Policeman as he is launched into the world of supernatural crime, British wizardry, and local gods.

Part urban fantasy, part police procedural, this series is a great companion to the Dresden Files. It has many of the other series' charms, with very few of its flaws (power creep, male fantasy, deus ex machina).

The audiobooks are truly among my very favorite; the voice actor really personifies the MC in a way that few Voice Actors can.

The worldbuilding is strong and deep, the banter is snappy and witty, the characters are realistically flawed and human, and each book manages a tidy plot while tying in with a larger story arc. The series is less rational and more rational-adjacent.

8/10 would recommend to any Urban fantasy fan.
