I highly recommend the Skullduggery Pleasant series. It's urban fantasy with some pretty impressive magic being thrown around. Plus you get some nice scenes where the book goes "OK so we know how this is a trope in books, so we going to specifically not do that." which is pretty nice. Some examples of magic being used:

Flying, walking in walls, teleportation, fireballs, folks getting their head ripped off then putting it back on with blood magic and regenerating the damage, true name magic, etc.
