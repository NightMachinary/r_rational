Someone just reviewed my book as "a cross between Dresden files and Supernatural". I haven't actually read the Dresden files, having bounced off the TV series without really enjoying it, so I can't vouch for how accurate that is.

"Emily Voss Episodes 1-3", by Nick Lavitz.

Am I, as it seems, the *only* person who reads/writes Urban Fantasy who hasn't read The Dresden Files? It feels that way...
