[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28307/the-zombie-knight-saga][Zombie Knight Saga]] is really fun, and surprisingly consistent (even rational at parts). The premise is that the main character dies in chapter one, and is revived as a "servant" to one of many grim reapers, which nets him powers.

Really good power usage and powers in general. Worldbuilding too, although that takes a while to really show itself. Some villains come off a bit cartoonish imo but it's not handled in a bad way. It's the closest thing you can get to Hunter x Hunter in literary form.
