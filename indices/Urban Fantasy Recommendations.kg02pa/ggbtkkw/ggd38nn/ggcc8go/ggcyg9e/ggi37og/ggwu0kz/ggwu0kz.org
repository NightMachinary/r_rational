The best way to describe Pact is an extended million word fight scene, but not one of those martial arts ones. It's the fight scenes where the hero gets stabbed three times in the stomach, and half the fight is just exhausted, sweaty men trying to stand up because they are that tired and in pain, and by the end of the scene he's killing the other guy by drowning him in a blocked urinal.
