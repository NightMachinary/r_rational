I personally really like the lore books for the Tabletop RPG Vampire: the Masquerade. They are all self contained stories, so you don't need to know much about the RPG itself.

Just to give a little glimpse of the setting, stories follow vampires who belong to one of the 13 Clans, each with unique abilities and cursed in a different way.

These aren't sexy twilight vampires though, they are predators who are clinging to their humanity and playing out a facsimile of a mortal life in order to keep their urges at bay.

All of the Vampires descend from Caine, who was cursed by God to walk the earth for all eternity. Thus he is the first generation vampire. As you go down the generations, Caine's blood gets more diluted and vampires become weaker.

In the current Modern Nights, blood has weakened so much that there are now half vampire/half human hybrids that are extremely weak, but are also able to walk under sunlight and not suffer much from the vampiric curse. Elder vampires consider this as a sign of the end times, but they like to keep things close to their chests and vampires younger than a few centuries usually have no idea about it.

While the street level stories of vampire skulduggery and murder is going on, there is a hidden global intrigue between millennia old elder vampires. Some of them are trying to awaken their Clan's progenitors, also known as Antediluvians, while others are trying to prevent it lest they all be destroyed. It is also possible that both sides are merely puppeteered by Antediluvians themselves through subtle mind control. Antediluvians are 3rd generation vampires with god-like abilities, however it is in doubt whether they are dead, alive or in torpor which is vampiric hibernation.
