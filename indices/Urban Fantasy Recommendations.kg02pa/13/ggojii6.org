unironically, I would recommend the *Sookie Stackhouse* series (also known as Southern Mysteries) as well as *True Blood* - the TV series based on these books.

Now, the series is (mostly) vampire romance, but it tends to deal semi-rationally with all of the practical questions one might have about the supernatural. Like, how exactly can vampires inherit wealth? How can the do taxes? If vampiric blood can heal humans, should there be a vamp on hand in every hospital? What would be the social, economic, and political ramifications of vampires "coming out of the coffin" and artificial blood being invented for them?

My favorite little bit about the series is that the vamps in it do not have vampire fangs in places of their canines, which would be extremely awkward to feed with: they have pointy "rattlesnake fangs" over their lateral incisors, that snap into place for feeding. This way, their fangs actually match the fang marks on a victim, and do not require them to gnaw through the neck to reach it with their canines; as would be necessary with the "traditional" type of vampire fangs.
