If I'm allowed to plug my own work briefly: The Daily Grind is a modern exploration of how normal people would react to the discovery of a classical D&D style dungeon. Except the dungeon looks like an eternity of cubicles, and the monsters are staplers.

First few chapters are iffy, but the writing does improve over time quite a lot.
