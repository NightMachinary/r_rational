Yeh it's honestly a pretty good series. Pretty long too. First 9 books are a great self contained story I can vouch for. After I haven't had a chance to read. It starts off kinda small scale and such, but eventually you get some pretty impressive stuff being thrown around. Good humour too (from what I remember. Been a bit.).

One joke I remember abit:

Two characters discussing how to infiltrate an enemy lair. 1st character: OK I'll go first and scout out if it's safe. 2nd: Why? 1st character: because I want you to be safe. 2nd: But if you go and it's not safe and you die I won't be able to get out of here alone. And that's not safe. 1st: True. But then I'd be dead so I won't be around to feel bad about that.
