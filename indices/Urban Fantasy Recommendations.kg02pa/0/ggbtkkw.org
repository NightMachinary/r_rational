N. K. Jemisin just published a badass book called /The City We Became/ this year about the avatars of the boroughs of NYC awakening to fight off an extradimensional threat. It's fucking cool, and the audiobook has the best production quality/sound editing of any I've ever listened to (which is a lot).
