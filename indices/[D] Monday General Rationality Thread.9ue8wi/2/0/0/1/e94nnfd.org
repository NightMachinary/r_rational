You think I just posted a copy of something written elsewhere?

Can you please provide a link to where anything similar to what I wrote exists? Because I came up with what I wrote on the spot and being accused of plagiarism is mildly insulting.

EDIT: Whelp! Looks like I've been pranked! Sorry about getting a little snippy with you. I thought you were referring to what I wrote instead of the top-level comment. I'm a little sensitive to being accused of plagiarism due to some unfair incidents when I was younger. So I jumped to conclusions prematurely.

At least it was an funny joke instead of people being assholes.
