I am so sorry you had to deal with a sterling example of the ways people can be assholes and I feel even worse for the poor checkout girl.

Just keep in mind that no matter who comes up with new ideas or research, their personality in no way should matter in regards to the information shared with the world. So I hope this horrid experience doesn't affect your perception of Harris' work.
