Whelp! Looks like I fell for something pretty amusing.

Don't worry, I'm not upset at all! I'm used to being pranked. I work at a job with coworkers who love to be extremely sarcastic and play some goofy pranks. 9_9

It's kinda funny rereading my reaction. I was diving in headfirst to reassure the basic faith in humanity's goodness. Ah well, I don't regret anything I said.
