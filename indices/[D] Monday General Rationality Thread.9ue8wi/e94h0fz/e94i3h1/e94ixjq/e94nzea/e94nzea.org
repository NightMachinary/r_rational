I've only read one book by him a while ago, [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G1SRB6Q/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i3][Lying]], which was moderately enlightening about the psychology of lying and just how much of a difference it makes to just tell the truth. I'm a lot more truthful after reading than before it. I would tell little white lies, but now if I'm tempted to lie, I either just don't say anything or force myself to verbally admit a painful truth or two to others. Usually things work out better than I would expect when I'm actually truthful about some bad mistakes of mine.

Of course, I'm utterly disappointed in hearing that Harris tried to steal a freaking candy bar which is completely at odds with my perception of an author who wrote something like Lying.

EDIT: Turns out it was a joke and the incident with Harris never happened. I really need to work on my rationality-fu some more to better suss out pranksters.
