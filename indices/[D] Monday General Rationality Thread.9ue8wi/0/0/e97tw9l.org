Short answer: no.

Every action you take is to maximise the probabilistic benefit to all of your future selves, and winning a lottery will only benefit a vanishingly small proportion of your future selves, while costing all of the others. The net effect is still negative. In general, considerations based on quantum immortality should produce the same results as classical probability theory. The only difference is if you pre-commit to killing yourself in unfavorable situations, with the confidence that other versions of yourself will succeed.
