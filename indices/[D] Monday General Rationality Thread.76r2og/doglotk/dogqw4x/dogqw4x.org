Avid boardgamer here.

The overlord mechanic is a common one (Descent etc) but unfortunately it translates very badly into fun. Someone has to play the Dungeon Master; this means extra rules, an extra playstyle someone has to learn, it removes the DM player from the other players - in my group we've always had trouble even finding a DM! An easily exectuable ranomization mechanism like drawing from a deck that still provides adequate difficulty is hard, but worth it.

My No. 1 Rule of boardgame design is crispness. Clean rules. Its very tempting to add a thousand extra rules and exceptions to your game, eg. for simulation purposes, but ultimately they distract from the game. Someone has to remember them or look them up.

2) Having good tooltips and design conducive to gameplay are a huge part of learning the game. I always reference Vlaada Chvatil games from Chzech Boardgame Edition for this. In "Galaxy Trucker" you build spaceships from a multitude of parts. The function of the part can at least partially derived/described by its form/colour.

If its green, it uses energy, If its brown, it has to do with engines, if its pink its doing something with weapons. There are extra cards for each round you put on the board. Reminders of the most common events printed everywhere etc.

Or take "Galaxy Trucker" - they basically invent a whole new symbolic language that serves as a reminder. [[http://www.pixelpark.co.nz/images/categories/RaceGalaxy980.jpg]] No text on most cards! And on the cards where they do something new and use non-standard symbols, in the very low right corner an explanation text.

Even just printing cards for each person with the turn order and on the back the available actions is worth a lot.

/ahem/ I have strong opinions on boardgame design.
