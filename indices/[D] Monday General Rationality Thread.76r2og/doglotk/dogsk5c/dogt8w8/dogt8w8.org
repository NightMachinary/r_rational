Totally! The human interaction in the trading and negotiating is what keeps Monopoly an interesting game despite the variety of board games that are now out there. What frustrates me about it however is that if the people you are playing with are out to get you from the beginning (as my friends tend to be when I play monopoly with them) then there isn't a way that you can win just by playing well mechanically.

Settlers of Catan is similar in that the human element of trading and trying to undermine the person in the lead is important, but its key difference from Monopoly is that you can win despite everyone being against you with sufficient skill and some luck.

I still want the human element of competition of the haggling and backstabbing which is why I'm trying to make it not just a strict 1v4, but also encouraging the inter-party strife.
