I appreciate the mechanical advice! That's definitely the area I'm least competent in. I've been consulting with a friend who is super interested in game theory and bouncing ideas off of him, but the more people I talk to the more refined the ideas get!

The issue that I have with a randomization element is that it takes away a lot of the intelligent opposition factor from gameplay. My example for this would be Sentinels of the Multiverse. On he surface it seems like an interesting game, but it quickly becomes very stale because of the limitation imposed by there being no shifting and evolving strategy because the opponent is fixed in the ways that they respond. I think what sets my idea apart from some of the other overlord style games is that the conflict won't only be Dungeon vs. Adventurers, but also Adventurers vs. Adventurers which could incentivize some interesting behavior from the dungeon player.

It's definitely feasible that playing the Dungeon will be something that not as many people will be interested in, but I think it's also necessary to have an intelligent opponent trying to divide the group. One of the ways I want to keep the dungeon side of gameplay both crisp and interesting is by having there only be one resource pool to draw from, but a variety of choices to make in how you grow that resource pool.

The mana pool will dictate everything about what the dungeon can buy: rooms, monsters, and modifications, but it will also grow depending on what each set of players does. Whenever a monster is killed, the mana cost of the monster will be completely refunded to the dungeon minus whatever evolutionary mods have been put on it, but for every turn it remains alive, the dungeon gets half the base mana cost back. So the adventuring party is incentivized to kill the monsters as fast as possible to prevent the dungeon from building up to much mana. Also, certain rooms would have mana pools that also add to mana production to make another type of key room.

In regards to the card design, I completely agree. The design needs to be as crisp and intuitive as the gameplay is. I think by sticking to the theme, hopefully the gameplay will be fairly easily understood. There's a couple graphic designers I know who I've been talking to about card design that I may end up pulling onto this project should it end up going anywhere.
