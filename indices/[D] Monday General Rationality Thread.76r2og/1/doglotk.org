So I've been looking into designing a tabletop card game lately and I'm curious about what the [[/r/rational]] community thinks make good aspects of game design. A recent trend I've seen in gaming has been towards the extremely complex which I've enjoyed because it's a departure from the overly simplistic boardgames I grew up with like Monopoly where there isn't as much way to play the game mechanically consistently and succeed as a result.

The general model I'm looking at is a 1v4 game in which one player is making all the decisions for the dungeon that the larger party is exploring. Drawing from a single resource mana pool, the dungeon creates new rooms, spawns monsters, and tries to kill the invaders by modifying the monsters with evolution cards and equipping them with loot that the adventurers can steal.

The adventuring party on the other hand has a mechanic for fostering conflict within the party. Each player draws three secret goal cards that can affect party play and is competing to be the first to finish those goals and escape the dungeon. Some examples of this are things along the lines of Plague in your village: Escape the dungeon with three health potions to treat the epidemic affecting your village. Avenge your family: Kill five of the hideous goblins that murdered your family.

Would this be the sort of thing that would interest you in a card game? If not then what suggestions for improving gameplay or mechanics would you propose? I'm interested in seeing what you all think!
