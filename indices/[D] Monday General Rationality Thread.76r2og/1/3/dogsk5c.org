I don't know if this is helpful, but the thing that makes Monopoly "complex" is the interactions between people. You're right in the fact that Monopoly, by itself, is quite simple. But when you add the human interaction and possible house rules on how trades and borrowing from the bank works you get all of the complexity of human trading and economics with very simple mechanics.

With that idea, you could try going that route, much like Settlers of Catan, where the mechanics are very simple but the mechanics force human interaction and trading or negotiation, which ramps up the complexity immensely while keeping the act of learning the game vey easy and approachable.
