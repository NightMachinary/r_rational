Yeah I've definitely taken a lot of inspiration from Munchkin in the way that the adventurers develop and become more powerful. The idea itself came out of reading The Bound Dungeon and realizing that games dealing with dungeon management haven't ever really done the idea justice.

I think the secretive nature of the goals would actually add a lot to the competitiveness. Originally when I was thinking about it, it was just going to be the dungeon versus the adventurers, but I realized that wouldn't really make for as much fun from a competitive standpoint. A lot of the goal cards I have in mind will be things that are counterproductive to effective party play. For instance, collecting potions and trying to escape with them limits the amount of healing for everyone in the group and could cause intense conflict when everyone knows that you have been drawing a lot from the consumables treasure pile, but are refusing to help someone for whatever reason. Also, I think I'm going to make it so that only half of the adventurers can leave the dungeon or that there's a turn limit to escaping so that it will add tension to escaping.

I've also toyed with the idea of allowing people to draw more goal cards and assigning each one a point value, but I don't know if that would add more to the mechanic or just be an unnecessary complication.
