Ooh, I /like/ that. That would change it from "goals" to "bonus points" though.

Taking a healing potion out of the dungeon could be worth +100 points for anyone but only one player knows that and could trade other players to get it. Killing the Goblin King gets you a Vorpal Sword, but only one person knows that as well, and can seek him out for a better chance of the equipment.
