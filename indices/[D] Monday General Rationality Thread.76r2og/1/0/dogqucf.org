It's a neat idea, kind of reminds me of Munchkin, but you need to avoid the same pitfalls as that game did. It's fun the first few times, but you eventually get bored of how it always devolves into all the other players screwing over the one who's closest to victory until they run out of cards.

The immediate question I have is why players would keep their goals a secret for each other? It's not like they wouldn't want any help with their objectives. If it's more interesting when they keep secrets, you need to incentivize that behavior. Competitive co-op has been done well before, I suggest looking into examples.

I've heard the Bloodborne card game pulls it off well and there are subreddits dedicated to board game design that you can ask around.
