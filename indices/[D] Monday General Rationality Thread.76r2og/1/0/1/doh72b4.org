  The immediate question I have is why players would keep their goals a secret for each other?
#+end_quote

The simplest way to ensure this is to make some of the goals distinctly anti-social (example - the player on your right once stole your drink at a bar. Your aim is to ensure that he does not leave the dungeon alive.)

People who get such goals have strong incentive to lie about their goals, making such information unreliable at best.
