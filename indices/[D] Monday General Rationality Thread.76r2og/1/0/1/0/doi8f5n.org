Further down the line, like if I release the game and also release expansions, I want to make goal decks specific to the different adventurer classes. For instance, the Thief class might have a goal card that says that you want to murder another member of a party, but that would be completely out of character and setting for the Healer class. The support role classes especially are the ones I'm having difficulty balancing because they need efficient party play to work which is exactly what I'm trying to discourage.
