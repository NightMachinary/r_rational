Sounds cool to me!

Things that pop out to me:

-Tabletop Layout. For the sake of simplicity, presumably the rooms will just be square pieces that are set down on the table. Because it's a dungeon, after all - if you want both branching paths and permanence, you probably have to lay out tiles o' dungeon (though you could sacrifice those things). This means the rooms have to not take up much space - it can't be like DnD where you're moving around on a grid punching orcs on specific squares. Maybe the rooms could have a couple subdivisions, and you could put character and monster tokens on the map.

-Combat. You don't want the characters to be doing the same thing every time. On the other hand, you need simplicity for this to be a good game. On the third hand, if you're playing a swordsman, you don't want to have to draw the card "Hit them with the sword" to be able to hit people with the sword. So in combat, you want people (and monsters) to have access to some things they can always do, and some other things they have to spend resources to do. But that's sort of a DnD / Sentinels of the multiverse mindset. You might also choose to go with a more Munchkin route, where combat is decided on single comparison of numbers representing overall strength (or a few in a row), and there are some things that give you a permanent bonus to numbers, but also some resources you can spend to get a temporary bonus, and sides take turns spending resources until someone passes or runs out of resources. But this might make things too samey, especially if you want to support a ranged-melee distinction. Depends on how much you want the emphasis to be on the mechanical play of combat I guess.

-Making optimal play also fun play. In a realistic 1v4, the optimal play is almost always to take out one person first. But this is precisely zero fun for the person who gets targeted and then has to play dead. As a dungeon, killing adventurers is your goal, so it can't be too rare or being the dungeon sucks. Maybe when one adventurer gets killed, or discouraged, or even gets what they want and leaves, another takes their place, leading to a more roguelike feel? Or maybe the party share some sort of morale resource, which the dungeon can deplete by winning combats, so when they lose it's all at once.

If they're discovering loot in the dungeon, somehow you have to make it optimal for the dungeon to give them loot that is fun for them to play with!

-puzzles and traps. Classic dungeon elements! Breaks up the monotony of all combat all the time. Other events include resting, trading, and skill checks (if you have such a thing).
