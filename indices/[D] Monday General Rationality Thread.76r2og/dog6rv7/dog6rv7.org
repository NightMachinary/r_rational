Today or tomorrow I will get an email informing me whether I have gotten a job and I'm afraid of what will happen if I do. It seems likely that I'll get it, they hired a classmate of mine with the same qualifications and are interested in recruiting a person with my skills, but I've gotten used to being lazy. I had so little luck finding work that I eventually stopped trying, so I've been lounging around for weeks looking for things to distract myself from the despair.

Then I heard about this job out of the blue and it's the best chance I've ever had, working a 12-hour shift on an assembly line 4 days a week. I've never done anything like that before and I don't know how I'll respond to cutting back on hedonism so much after so long. At the same time, though, I need this job both to maintain my financial solvency and prevent another depressive episode about my employability. I want the job, but I'm also dreading getting it.

POLITICAL ANXIETY UPDATE

I have managed to find a community/ideology that exemplifies everything I fear about modern politics, and it's *literally* called the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Enlightenment][Dark Enlightenment]]. That name wasn't given to them by academics describing them, they actually named their subreddit [[/r/DarkEnlightenment][r/DarkEnlightenment]] and it has 12,000 subscribers.

I knew racists, fascists, and anti-intellectuals like this existed, but I didn't know they were actually advertising themselves as the evil counterpart to the movement that gave us science, democracy, and civil rights. Since when did *The Dark Side* become something to aspire to? What the hell does this mean?
