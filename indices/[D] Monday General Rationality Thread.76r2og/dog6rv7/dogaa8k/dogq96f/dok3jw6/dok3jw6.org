  This is basically right, you'd be surprised how receptive people are to the dangers of democracy and progressivism, how much more eagerly they'll accept our views on the jewish question than you'd ever think.

To respond frankly, I'm not surprised at all. Antisemitism never really went away (did we even expect it to?), and besides, /merely ordinary/ right-neoliberal groups have been pushing "the Dangers of Democracy and Progressivism" /so fucking hard/ these past 20 years or so that they're actually pretty cliche.

What nobody's been spending on is defending the principles of /democracy and personal freedom/ as actual, affirmative goods.
