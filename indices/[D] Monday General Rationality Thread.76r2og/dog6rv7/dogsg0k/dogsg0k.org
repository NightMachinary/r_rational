Hey.

First of all, I hope that this problem has already been solved for you in the best possible way, but if not, I'm happy to give my own perspective; just, you know, realize that I'm a random person on the internet.

I had a pretty long stint where I didn't have work, and I was able, to a certain point, keep busy, but it was often not very satisfying how I was keeping busy, even when I was writing or trying to learn coding.

However, I did eventually get a job, unfortunately I had become, in many ways lazy, and I was concerned about that. I was also concerned about my job as it was undefined and the parts that were defined were not things that I had explicitly done before. It also was not a very lucrative job, but it was a job (minimum wage in California).

In terms of how to approach it; I would recommend reveling in the idea of learning and getting better. As you are part of this sub-reddit I assume that learning and understanding is something you find value in.

Maybe your job will be totally devoid of learning anything interesting or cool, although I kinda doubt that, but then, instead, learn about other areas, learn about those around you, and if things are still unsatisfying, create a plan where you can take that money, save it or invest, and find a better place to be.

For me, personally, my job was very cool to me but very challenging. I worked the first 23 days straight; I made friends with people that went on to do much greater things (at the time they were not in a very influential position and now they are).

There's a lot, in my opinion, to be excited about in regards to a job.

It also helps that if your financial situation is such that the job will prevent you from eating beans out of a can with some tapatio.

Best of luck.
