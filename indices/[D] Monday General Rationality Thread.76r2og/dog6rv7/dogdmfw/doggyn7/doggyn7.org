Did you read the description of their ideology on the sidebar for that sub?

  Secular progressivism is the memetic descendent of Puritan Calvinism. Blasphemy, inquisition, indoctrination, and brainwashing still occur from the perspective of the progressive religion. Therefore, progressive culture is referred to as “the Cathedral”. The Cathedral consists of influential people in politics, journalism, academia and education acting in an uncoordinated manner to advance progressive principles in society; often deceptively. We do not imply conspiracies.

  Hierarchies are a natural consequence of innate differences and are necessary for societies to function. Stratified outcomes alone are not enough to prove discrimination or a failure of "social justice". There is no "social justice," only traditional justice.

That's just the first two Common Ideas, and they come after a specific mention of [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Racialism][race realism]]. This is not a community interested in debating morality or promoting a view that discourages absolutism. These are racists who have rationalized their prejudice with fake science and conspiracy theories.
