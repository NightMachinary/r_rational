As a follow up, here is a PM I received from a user who openly identifies as a fascist:

  I'm not so confident. I don't think this is just a congregation of all the radicals who were already around, I think these are relatively young people who have been radicalized and are encouraged to radicalize others. I'm worried that Nazis are growing in number.

This is basically right, you'd be surprised how receptive people are to the dangers of democracy and progressivism, how much more eagerly they'll accept our views on the jewish question than you'd ever think. The internet is perfect for redpilling en-masse. You've already got people self-segregating by ideology, fandoms, etc, so it's easy to tailor specific messages to specific groups. I can semi-reliably redpill mainstream conservatives and libertarians on counter-semitism and race realism given what they think is an environment of civil debate, and leftists are generally very easy to convince that democracy is an abject failure, for example - just agree with them for the wrong reasons. The difference between us and our enemies is that any we recognise any ideological goals and principles can only reliably be accomplished after winning, so that should be the only non-negotiable principle, the sole hill to die on.
