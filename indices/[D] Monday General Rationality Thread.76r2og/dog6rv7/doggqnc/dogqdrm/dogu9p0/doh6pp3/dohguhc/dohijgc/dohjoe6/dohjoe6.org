  I find it funny that, for all that he was afraid that you'd treat him unfairly, he would have been banned more quickly if not for you.

He was just so /open/ about being a Nazi. I really appreciate an evil villain who's willing to state their ideology and goals /up front/. If he had but been able to effectively argue for and implement fascism on this subreddit /despite/ telling us all that was what he was doing, he would have reached Baron Harkonnen levels of magnificent bastardry.

It would have been a little like when you meet the villain and they're all like, "in 10 minutes you're going to walk out that door and tell your armies of righteousness to surrender", and you're all like, "Fuck that and fuck you", and then they manage to make it happen nonetheless.
