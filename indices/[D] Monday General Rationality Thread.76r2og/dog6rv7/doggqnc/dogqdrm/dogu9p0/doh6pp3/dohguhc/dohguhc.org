Looking back at our mod logs, the other two had wanted to ban him already for a comment where he said Hitler did the Soviet Union a favor by invading ("on top of having done nothing wrong, of course", quoting him), but I was going at a light touch. Then, "he started referring to other users as having no intrinsic worth and to one user's sexual choices as basically degeneracy" (quoting myself).

Emphasis on that first clause. Lots of people have stupid, arbitrary criticisms of others' sexuality. Start treating people as requiring a justification to be alive and get banned.
