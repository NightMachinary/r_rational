I'm really not sure how inciting a kind of civil war between ~65% of the population (self-identified "whites") and ~13% of the population (self-identified "blacks") is supposed to result in anything /useful/ happening, /let alone/ what the /fuck/ these guys think they'll accomplish by also targeting 1.8% of the population (Jews).

Thing being, the user you're talking to /always talks like that/, which is why he got banned from here. On the other hand, he's the one "sitting on a giant pile of utility" while I'm just hoping the world will let me do /one fucking thing/ I actually want in the meantime while civilization collapses, so he's probably telling some measure of the truth.

On the gripping hand, he's /insane/. Sure, history's moving in his insane direction, but that doesn't make his worldview /right/, it just means he's found a way to rationalize the direction of the wind.
