Re: darkenlightenment, normally I'd be concerned about the radicalization of insular groups, but these guys are so ridiculously authoritarian/racist/sexist that they can't feasibly get much worse. So I prefer that they quarantine themselves, where the trend towards radicalizatiom will actually make them less likely to pull in outsiders.
