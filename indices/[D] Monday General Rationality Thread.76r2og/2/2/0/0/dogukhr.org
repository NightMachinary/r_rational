Eh, he's overestimating his own influence. Political groups do that a lot-- they ban all dissent, then take the lack of dissent as proof that they're popular. Yeah, they'll get the occasional convert, but they don't account for all the people who leave their ideology because, again, dissent is banned, so they don't realize it. And people /do/ leave radical ideologies all the time-- look at how much the KKK has shrunk over the past few decades.
