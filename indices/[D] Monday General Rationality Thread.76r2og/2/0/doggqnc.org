  Today or tomorrow I will get an email informing me whether I have gotten a job and I'm afraid of what will happen if I do. It seems likely that I'll get it, they hired a classmate of mine with the same qualifications and are interested in recruiting a person with my skills, but I've gotten used to being lazy. I had so little luck finding work that I eventually stopped trying, so I've been lounging around for weeks looking for things to distract myself from the despair.

Can we swap places? I just got told today that expected revenue rises from new clients didn't materialize, so my contract's not getting renewed.

I know I'm putting in PhD applications this season - /again/ but with nice tutors to help make them great this time - but /goddamnit/ joblessness /sucks/. You don't get money each month, /and/ you don't get a neat daily schedule, /and/ you don't get to feel useful to other people from doing something focused every day.

  I have managed to find a community/ideology that exemplifies everything I fear about modern politics, and it's literally called the Dark Enlightenment. That name wasn't given to them by academics describing them, they actually named their subreddit [[/r/DarkEnlightenment][r/DarkEnlightenment]] and it has 12,000 subscribers.

Think of them like Radical Inquisitors from Warhammer 40K, but /unironically/. They think the goal of their political program is to protect the rest of us from the Things Man Was Not Meant to Know, and to guide their culture to glory and success by systematically indoctrinating it to follow something vaguely like the Imperial Cult. Kinda.

  I knew racists, fascists, and anti-intellectuals like this existed, but I didn't know they were actually advertising themselves as the evil counterpart to the movement that gave us science, democracy, and civil rights. Since when did The Dark Side become something to aspire to? What the hell does this mean?

To make my own contribution, a civilization begins to fall when people take /sheer edginess/ seriously as an ideology.

Or maybe it doesn't. At least by my standards, "Get out there and die for History/God/Country/Ideology" is pretty fucking edgy, but /everyone/ seems to be into /that/.

Seriously, though, they're /really fucking edgy/, often with some really negative personal experiences backing up the views.
