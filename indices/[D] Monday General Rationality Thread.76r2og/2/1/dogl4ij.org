IIRC they call themselves the /Dark/ Enlightenment in direct contrast to the Enlightenment, which they think is a mistake and which they are trying to roll back. If it had been called the Endarkenment for some reason, then they'd be the Light Endarkenment, and if it had been the Doggishment, then they'd be the Catdoggishment. They aren't really looking at it any deeper than that.
