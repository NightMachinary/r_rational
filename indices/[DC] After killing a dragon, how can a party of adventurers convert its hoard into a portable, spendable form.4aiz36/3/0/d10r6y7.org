The local legal system is powerless against Murder Hobos, which is why they called in Murder Hobos to solve their dragon problem in the first place. They may reduce petty theft from the locals, but this still leaves you at the mercy of other Murder Hobo parties. Or Dragons/Monsters/etc.

Honestly once you have that much gold you need to decide if you want to continue adventuring. If so, Option 1 (and hey, in a couple years you can come back and have another adventure re-liberating the same village!). If not, hire an army with all your gold and become a new regional lord.
