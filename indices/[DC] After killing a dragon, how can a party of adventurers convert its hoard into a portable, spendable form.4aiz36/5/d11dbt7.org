I always thought it would make a lot of sense for dragons to be bankers themselves.

One rational dragon who wants lots of metal to sleep on could do worse then to effectively act as vaults/banks.

Make deposits and get a nice credit note.

If some one tries to forge the notes then they get angry dragons and so on.
