First Adventurer's Bank, now open for business!

Come see us at the old Dragon Cave!

Live 'on' the hoard. It was good enough for the dragon. If you had the magical and physical oomph to kill a dragon, you should be able to turn the cave into a reasonable keep with some effort. Hire dwarves to do the work after you set up security measures.

Once you have everything all nice and organized, if you want to move somewhere else, build a new place first, THEN move your gold in a controlled fashion.
