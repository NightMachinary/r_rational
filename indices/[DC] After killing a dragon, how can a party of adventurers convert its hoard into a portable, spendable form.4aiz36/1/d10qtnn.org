The best solution for a high-level party is to have the wizard or warlock cast the 8th level spell Demiplane, which opens a door to a persistent dimension that is a 30 foot cube, for a volume of 27,000 cubic feet. The demiplane can be reached again by casting demiplane if you know the contents and "nature" of the plane -- depending on DM interpretation of "nature", so long as you don't let your other wizard friends visit, it should be fairly safe. There is no limitation on the number of demiplanes you can know about and use as a bank. Each demiplane can store about 1.6 billion pieces of gold, though, so you probably won't need many of them.

Just don't get trapped inside without any way of transporting yourself to another dimension, because even casting demiplane again from the inside will only take you to another demiplane.
