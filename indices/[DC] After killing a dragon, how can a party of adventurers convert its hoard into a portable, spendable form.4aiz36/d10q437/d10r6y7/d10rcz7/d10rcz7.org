In the absence of an army-backed legal system, you can't hire an army to protect your gold with gold. The soldiers would simply take the gold they are supposed to be protecting. You'd have to very carefully build up a system of loyalty and power hierarchy and charisma from the ground up.

A chaotic system with dangerous vagabonds makes sense, but if the local legal system is /totally/ powerless against even a single murder hobo, then we've essentially found ourselves in a society without property rights. Which I think is impossible, legal systems and property rights tend to form spontaneously in non-hunter-gatherer societies. If the murder hobos are at the top of the power hierarchy, the murder-hobos themselves would form them.

Hmmm.. "guilds"?

That said, I mean... you killed the dragon, right? So you must be at least approximately as good as the dragon is at personally guarding the treasure. You've got some time to figure out what to do.
