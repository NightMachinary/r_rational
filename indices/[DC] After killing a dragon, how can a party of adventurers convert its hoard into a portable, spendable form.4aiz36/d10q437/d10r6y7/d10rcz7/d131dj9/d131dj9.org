Presuming you have at least one /magic-inclined/ Murder Hobo, there are all sorts of solutions to this.

But even if you don't, an interesting thing is that---for the /price/ of 100 grunts---you can likely hire one good wizard who can set things up to protect your money from far /more/ than those selfsame 100 self-interested grunts. This doesn't even require continuous employment; just some "contract work" plus a casting of Permanency. That done, you can switch to the 100 grunts as a long-term solution, knowing they won't be able to overcome the wards/compulsions/illusions/whatever.

Either way, you want both magic /and/ grunts: the magical protections you've got on your treasure might be "good enough" in some strict sense, but the main point of the grunts is actually to harry and interrupt the would-be adventurers who are trying to deconstruct or dispel your protections without triggering them. DRM works... if you never get more than a few seconds' time to look at it before someone charges at you.

And, yes---this same thought process is exactly where all the dungeons you're raiding yourself, came from. :)
