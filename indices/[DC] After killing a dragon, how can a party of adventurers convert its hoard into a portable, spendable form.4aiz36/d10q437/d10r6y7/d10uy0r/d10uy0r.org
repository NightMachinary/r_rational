  The local legal system is powerless against Murder Hobos, which is why they called in Murder Hobos to solve their dragon problem in the first place.

Different incentive structures. Dragons live on gold and the occasional foraged cow and/or princess. Murder Hobos live on ale, which requires coming to town and dealing with an economy functional enough to support a brewery. Dragons don't care if the kingdom falls --- they can eat moose and barbarians instead of cows and princesses if they have to. Murder Hobos do care, because if Arn√∂ Alewright has to go back to subsistence farming, the ale will stop happening.
