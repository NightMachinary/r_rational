Shrink item is a third level spell, and can shrink up to 720,000 gp worth of gold if you're at the lowest level to cast it. It will end up only weighing about 3.6 pounds, and it will stay shrunk for days. The problem is it only works on one item. But you can probably just cast fireball or something and melt it all together.
