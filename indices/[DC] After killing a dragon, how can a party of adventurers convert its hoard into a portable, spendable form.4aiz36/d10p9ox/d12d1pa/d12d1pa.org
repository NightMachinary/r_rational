  A Portable Hole can hold the entire hoard--but a rogue party member can steal it easily.

That's not a problem specific to portable holes; it's a problem with any easy-to-carry form of treasure. If you've excluded all solutions that make the treasure easy to carry, of course you're not going to be able to carry it.

  Solution 4: Secure the dragon's lair and make it your permanent depository location. Problem: You don't want to be tied to a single location that must be guarded. You're a party of adventurers, not a party of dungeon keepers!

While making it your /permanent/ depository location is bad for this reason, you can make it your temporary depository for long enough that the other solutions which involve time can be implemented.

  The bank can now make demands on you, holding over you the threat of confiscating your credit.

If you're powerful enough to kill the dragon, and if the bank was not powerful enough to kill the dragon, then you're powerful enough to force the bank to let you have the credit and not confiscate it.
