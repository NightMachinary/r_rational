*tl;dr:*

/Situation:/ You (a party of adventurers) have just killed a dragon that was menacing a nearby village, and are now in possession of its hoard.\\
/Problem:/ You need to move that treasure to a shop (far away from this small village) in order to buy anything with it--but a dragon's hoard consists, not of value-dense, easily-portable magic items and art pieces, but of heavy gold coins, since a dragon wants money it can sleep on, not money it can spend. The coinage necessary to buy a magic item may weigh more than an entire party member!

--------------

/Solution 1:/ Take all the coins that you can carry and walk away.\\
/Problem:/ This small portion of the dragon's hoard may not be commensurate in value with the effort that you expended in killing the dragon. Also, many other people, both good and evil, will eventually learn of this abandoned treasure and rush to claim it, putting in danger the village that you just saved from the dragon.

/Solution 2:/ Rent or buy magic items ([[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/wondrousItems.htm#portableHole][Portable Hole]], [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/wondrousItems.htm#bagofHolding][Bag of Holding]], [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/wondrousItems.htm#handyHaversack][Handy Haversack]]) to carry the gold.\\
/Problem:/ Renting may be exorbitantly expensive. A Portable Hole can hold the entire hoard--but a rogue party member can steal it easily. A Bag of Holding or Handy Haversack is only a temporary measure--you must have cleared out and secured another dungeon as a depository location beforehand, and that brings with it all the problems of Solution 4 (see below).

/Solution 3:/ Hire goblins or dwarves to transport the gold through the ground to a depository location.\\
/Problem:/ Setting up the contract takes time, during which you must guard the hoard. The contractors may charge exorbitant fees, or steal some of the gold as they transport it, or tell other people about your depository location. You must have set up the depository location beforehand (see Solution 4).

/Solution 4:/ Secure the dragon's lair and make it your permanent depository location.\\
/Problem:/ You don't want to be tied to a single location that must be guarded. You're a party of adventurers, not a party of dungeon keepers! Also, what happens if you kill /another/ dragon?

/Solution 5:/ Call in a large bank and give the hoard to it in exchange for an equivalent amount of credit on its books.\\
/Problem:/ The bank can now make demands on you, holding over you the threat of confiscating your credit.
