What do you need this gold for exactly? Either you intend to spend it on somewhat lighter weapons/materials/artifacts... or what?

If you plan on spending it then any temporary solution like the BoH one should work fine. And buying the bag would let you use it on the next horde too.

If you plan on hoarding it longterm... Well I wouldn't, I'd certainly at least invest it in something, even if that means letting a country borrow it with interest, or starting your own city (possibly on top of the horde). Of course you could get betrayed by whoever you let borrow it, but hey, you're adventurers. Betrayal is just another plot hook, and frankly its their loss if they're dumb enough to double cross dragon slayers.
