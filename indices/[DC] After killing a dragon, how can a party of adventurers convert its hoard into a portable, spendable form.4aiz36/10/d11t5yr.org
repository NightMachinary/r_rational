In old-school Dungeons&Dragons the idea was that the game will progress from dungeon delving into barony management and such as the adventurers gather funds and fame (and levels). Partly this was probably because of the miniature wargame roots of DnD.

So one alternative is to not convert a dragon hoard to a portable form, but instead to invest in real estate, armies and other forms of power. The drawback is that this is more localized, but the advantage is that it can produce gains if managed well. From a fiction point of view this just provides another kind of challenges and story hooks.
