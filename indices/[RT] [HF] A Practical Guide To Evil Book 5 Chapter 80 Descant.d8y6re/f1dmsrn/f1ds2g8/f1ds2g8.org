It presents an interesting workaround to his curse. If he says to Cat with a grin that he poisoned 'Hakram' last night, is he talking about the orc or the goat?

For all we know, he has a whole barnyard out back labelled 'Dead King', 'Malicia', 'Ashur', and 'Nicae' and the discussion with Cat was a lie from start to finish. I don't actually think that's the case here, but it means we still can't take anything he says even as true, even the literal wording that Fae-speakers would normally be forced to stick to.
