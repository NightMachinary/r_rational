I wonder whether the judgement is on the literal truth or the intent behind the words.

The exact curse/phrase is:

#+begin_quote
  Through lies and deception you have brought great suffering, and so from you I take that poisonous gift: never again will you speak untruth, lest it be the last words you speak at all.
#+end_quote

By what measure is the untruth judged? Does the Choir of Mercy act as the arbiter and judge?
