I think one of Malicia's corpse-puppets. It's been a long while since she and Cat talked face-to-face, and between the Salian gambit and the upcoming Still Water ritual she's been re-entering the narrative in a big way. With Black, Masego, the Accords, the Dead King, her ongoing plots and plans, and Callow joining the Alliance, they have a lot to talk about.
