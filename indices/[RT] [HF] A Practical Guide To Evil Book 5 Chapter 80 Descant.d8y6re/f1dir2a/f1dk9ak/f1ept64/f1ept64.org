Wait. This is Tyrants play! The key to Hakram's game being playable was having the points hidden and doing deals under the table. Kairos has been working on deal with everyone for a while, but no one thinks he is a imminent threat, just a common threat. So they give bits and pieces to him in exchange for critical leverage against each other, and the Tyrant keeps accumulating shit.

But do we truly know how far he is, even as readers? What if he is one stone away from winning the whole thing and everyone just thinks he is on half a pile yet?

Jesus I'm dumb.
