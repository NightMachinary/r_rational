I think there's some missing text in here, because as you say having such a restriction on a minor business would seem odd. Perhaps [[/u/carturo222]] meant to say that the border fort or village or monastery or other institution that the restaurant was in had been built within 'nonmagical sight' of the border?

The other thing that bothered me was that the responses to the divinations was "probably" or "probably not", but the guard seems to think that they're certain.

I don't see that this requires stupidity or minimal tension, because there are apparently methods to block divination. The trick then becomes trying to figure out what's hidden by exploring the edge of the block, as the Warlock did to predict Aran the Peacemonger's arrival in /What Good is a Glass Dagger/ by Larry Niven.
