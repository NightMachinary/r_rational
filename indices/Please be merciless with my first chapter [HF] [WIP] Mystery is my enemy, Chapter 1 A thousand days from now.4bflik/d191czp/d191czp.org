That short chapter had at least four separate instances where someone pointed out that you can't use a spell on another spell.

- *a spell could not target another spell*---it was simply not possible.

- That would be casting a *divination about a divination*, which as you know can't be done.

- “*A spell cannot target a spell*. So, why can I use animation magic on your diagrams?”

- Since it's impossible to divine Who is divining about my plans?, because it would be *casting a spell to target another spell*, it's more practical to cloak an entire portion of the future from all possible Seers

Seems a bit heavy handed.
