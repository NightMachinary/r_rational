A great deal will be done with glass and ceramics. Diamonds will probably be very common, since the planet has very little iron in it's core, and it is tectonically active. A lot of gemstones have metallic content, which means they will be extremely rare on Nirvana, but I have not yet catalogued useful gemstones that will be possible. Aluminum presence may be significant, but extremely difficult to process. If I CAN think of a easy way to process aluminum without metals or computers or hydrocarbons, then it will be rare. If I can't think of a way that aluminum could be processed easily, then there are quite a few minerals containing aluminum that will be interesting.

I'm pretty sure that disassociating silicon from oxygen on a industrial scale isn't going to be possible without computers. I will not say impossible, since the science of chemistry still is well understood. It almost certainly won't be cheaper than a charcoal or wood industry though, for most purposes. Alcohol will likely be the liquid fuel of choice, or perhaps vegetable derived oils.

I will say that the citizens of Nirvana will resurrect the Roman hypocaust. With improvements, of course. I'm likely going to be stealing a LOT from the Romans, Greeks, Chinese, and Egyptian cultures, and putting a bit of thought into how to improve them. I hope to have lots of fun with this.
