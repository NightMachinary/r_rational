Fair enough. Albert can assign importance to things, and is capable of throttling down rather than pushing processing power into something that he doesn't consider important. He will not shut completely down. Not willingly. He's not entirely certain how his sanity will hold up, so there are two important things he has to consider.

First, he needs to see if he can help humanity by encouraging a greater schism between atavistic instinct and human thought.

Second, he needs to preserve himself for many thousands of years in order to allow significant evolutionary impact on humanity, knowing that all prior AI have lasted only a tiny fraction of the time he requires.
