A science nitpick - there's no reason that an AI needs to feel boredom (or anything analogous to it). An AI can be just a utility function optimizer, instead of a turbo human with a metal brain.

You can handwave this away by saying that no real progress has been made on programs with self-improving abstract reasoning coded from scratch, so all AI software relies on simulated neurons somewhere. Other branches of AI never panned out not because it's impossible, but simply because humans weren't smart enough to make it happen.

Neural network based AIs don't have to have anything resembling human emotions, but something analogous to boredom/curiosity specifically is necessary enough.
