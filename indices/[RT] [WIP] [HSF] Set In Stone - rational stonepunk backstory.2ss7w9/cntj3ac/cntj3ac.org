Excellent ideas. The background itself was a good read. I anticipate great things from this story and look forward to reading it.

A few things that bother me a bit:

Humans here are capable of genetic manipulation and molecular bioengineering, but only live on the order of 150 years. Why haven't they achieved biological immortality? Death is bad.

Also, why wasn't humanity subdued or destroyed outright by a rogue AI? Clearly, AI's cognitive potential far outstrips humanity. This should be trivial for any superintelligent AI to accomplish.

Relatedly (and this is probably a minor nitpick, as I understand the literary constraints at play here), the upper ceiling of AI intelligence as portrayed here falls several dozen orders of magnitude short of what I would expect. I presume the reason Albert has not crashed headlong into the physical limits of information processing is due to limited resources. But I feel this should probably be addressed at least, given Earth's history.

These are not by any means showstopping issues, but I would expect a truly rational fiction to address them. In a world that differs from our own by essentially epsilon, the discrepancy from expectation really stands out.

Again, I think you have something wonderfully full of potential here. Can't wait to see what you do with it. :D
