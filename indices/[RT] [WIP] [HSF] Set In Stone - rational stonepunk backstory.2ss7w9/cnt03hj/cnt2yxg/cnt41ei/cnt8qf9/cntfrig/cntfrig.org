I read the back story today for the first time, commented on the errors, and then reread it after your comment. I thought I remembered Tom the first time, and then Toby the second time.

Hmmm, it's scary how well my brain can lie to me about what it thinks it remembers. My apologies.

EDIT: Wait this is a conspiracy coverup? Ooo, I was fooled...(Sir? I need you to look at my neuralyzer.)....Never mind! There has never been any conspiracies here!
