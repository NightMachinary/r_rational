A few little mistakes I noticed in the backstory:

1) "...dangerous to awaken a new AI in the system architecture of an old AI, as the */old/* AI would deduce within hours of creation that it was occupying the â€˜body' of an old AI."

Shouldn't old be read as new?

2) "He had managed to create an AI that was willing to throttle itself in order [to insure] that it didn't spend most of it's existence in a painfully bored state."

You seem to be missing the necessary words, [to insure].

3) */Albert/* was over a hundred and ten years old at that point, and in good condition for his age.

I think you meant to write Tom instead of Albert.

Other than these minor errors I didn't notice anything else, and I loved the changes you made to the back story for how humanity collapsed.
