Understanding the scale of this is a bit difficult because the forces are so titanic, but I had considered it.

This solar system is not Nirvana's home system. When captured by this solar system, sufficient force would have to have been exerted on the planet to bring it into a stable orbit. My belief is that such forces could be sufficient to restart plate tectonics, especially if it had been captured by an initial close approach to the sun, followed by later exposures to gravitational effects of the gas giants.

I have changed the backstory slightly so that the planet's plate tectonics never stopped, only slowed.
