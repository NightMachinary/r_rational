My back of the envelope calculation (which is likely to be wrong) shows, that you'd need to slow Earth down from 100 km/s orbital velocity to its 30 km/s in order to heat it up by 500K. That's higher than the escape velocity of the sun, so it is imaginable that a planet capture might bleed off enough velocity to heat the planet up by hundreds of degrees. Must be hell of a capture maneuver, though.
