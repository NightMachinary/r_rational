The backstory alone is worth reading. I'm anticipating the first chapters and wish you great success with this story.

Minor nitpick: Plate tectonics is, as far as we know, driven by an interaction between the cold, hard plates of the crust and convection flows in the mantle. As such, they stop when the mantle gets to cold to allow for convection flow. As such, once the planet is too cold for plate tectonics, it would need an enormous amount of energy to heat it up again. "Kneading" by gravitational/tidal forces would need to be so severe that the crust hardly stays intact and massive earthquakes every days would be the result.
