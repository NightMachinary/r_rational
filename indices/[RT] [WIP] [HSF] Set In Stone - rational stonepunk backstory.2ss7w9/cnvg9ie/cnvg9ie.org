Since metals are scarce, do they rely more on gemstone type materials? In particular, carbon and silicon are likely to be abundant still, so you could have quartz, diamond, and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_carbide][silicon carbide]]. The major engineering challenge isn't strength, but brittleness.

One amusing idea for using purified silicon would be to [[http://nextbigfuture.com/2012/03/lunar-silicon-vs-helium-3.html][burn it as coal substitute]]. Hydrogen generation through shift reaction is a more likely use though.
