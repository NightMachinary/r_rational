A quenchgun requires superconducting temperatures, so a massive cooling system would have to be built into it to keep it safely below the superconducting temperature of the coils. Like modern tunnel building on Earth, a lot of infrastructure would be built as the mining occurred. As the project reached the center sections of the moon, that massive cooling system would have, step by step, been brought into operation, cooling the rock immediately surrounding it, and hardening the molten rock beyond, allowing the mining equipment to advance through hardened rock, step by step.

The heat from the cooling of the rock surrounding the tunnel through the core would have been planned to provide a great deal of the power requirements for the second half of the bore.
