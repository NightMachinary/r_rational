Just picked up this story. I really like it.

I saw there were rewrites or other chapter on SV and am guessing you are re-writing to slow down the escalation some: this is good. I only read the last few chapters to catch up, and then checked and found some big discontinuities: what I read on FFnet seemed a lot better at slowly turning up the heat. The work on SV is good, but the little I read: has Accord texting during a conversation, offering Gyros during a meeting, and Coil sharing how his power works. . . three more and it's time for breakfast.

You've probably decided how you are going to make gravity work, but you asked an interesting question so here is my 2cp. As far as I know the gravity shadowing might not happen because gravity seems(?) to be a curvature of space space/time and not propagated by particles (anybody correct me if I'm wrong on this I don't go much past general and special relativity). IMHO a portal might propagate gravity across it as the two different potential energies and the curvature averaged out? If the gravity shadow came from /Bio of a space Tyrant/ kudos on your classic SciFi
