I continue to adore this fic. Keep up the good work! Taylor's conversation with Gauthier was heartwarming and generally great, and I loved the description of Gauthier regarding "hollowness". I'm not sure if it's that you've gotten better as a writer or if I've just read more of your words by now, but I'm starting to get a sense of your style and I'm really digging it. The sentence starting with "The wind was frigid..." maybe isn't the best example of a distinctly you-ish line, but it is excellent nonetheless.

Some typo notes (etc):

#+begin_quote
  I woke up to an empty house, which was the usual. Dad left for work an hour before I did for school, and an hour and a half since I'd started using portals (which was arguably incautious, but it was really hard not to portal everywhere).
#+end_quote

This part confuses me. Danny left before she woke up, but after she started using portals?

#+begin_quote
  The outdoor jacket and hat *was* a darker, charcoal gray
#+end_quote

Were.

#+begin_quote
  I made a portal to the door of the station and went inside, then immediately made a beeline for my favourite bench in the lobby and sat down. It was interesting, how I'd managed to find a *favourite* bench, but I'd spent so much time at the station that I was already used to the place. I'd spent the night on *this couch*, once, about a week before.
#+end_quote

"Favourite" is a british spelling. Also, what couch?

#+begin_quote
  Those were protests, where the people forced the elites to do the right thing.
#+end_quote

Unnecessary comma.
