This is probably the most flattering thing I've ever read. Regarding your points, some are errors whereas others are stylistic. I'll see if anyone else is confused about the same points before I start rearranging those.

First point, it's meant to be parsed like this

#+begin_quote
  I woke up to an empty house, which was the usual. [Before my trigger event] Dad left for work an hour before I did for school, [but presently left for work] an hour and a half [before I left for school, as a direct result of my using portals to cut down on my travel time].

Second one is an error on my part; it should be were.

Third one is a mix of two drafts. It was originally a favourite couch, but became a favourite bench. Ironically, I distinctly remember being aware that this might happen, and triple-checking to make sure they matched. Apparently it got mixed up anyway.

"Favourite" is a Canadian spelling as well as a British one, and I've tried to stick to Canadian spelling since there's basically no way I'll manage to keep to American spelling without slipping up.

Final one is a mistake, but not the one you described.

#+begin_quote
  [The anti-Vietnam demonstrations and the unions' fight for the eight hour workday] were protests [and therefore by implication the prohibitionists weren't "true" protestors], [because a "true" protest is] where the people [force] the elites to do the right thing.
#+end_quote

Gauthier is essentially going full No-True Scotsman here, with a double helping of The Worst Argument in the World. The whole statement is an artifact from a different version of their conversation that got a lot closer to hugging and crying and would've derailed the plot for the next three arcs. Without the rest of the conversation to provide context, she's setting up a comparison and never really delivering, so it's unclear and it looks like I mean to say, "those were protests where the people," which I would never do because the correct phrasing is "those were protests in which the people".
