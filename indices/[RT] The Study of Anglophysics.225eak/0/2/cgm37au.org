I share an interpretation posted in the comments: It's a platonic nanofabricator, i.e. it's a device that performs the function the expedition party expect it to perform. Nothing is necessarily even going on inside the machine; it could be a black-box replicator for all it matters. It takes natural reagents because they expect it to (or more correctly, either because Adwell expects it to or doesn't expect it /not/ to). This is probably because A) Adwell was at least cursorily familiar with the technology, so he shared the conception of what 'nanofabricator' means with the party, or B) Adwell wasn't familiar and thus had raised no objections to its existence and function, respectively.

Of course, the problem this raises is that it's not exactly obvious why matches wouldn't work! My hypothesis for /that/ is that matches, being conceptually simple, were completely understood (on a reductionist level) by Adwell, and so his universe rejected their function as a consequence of the fact that the basic reagent equation for match combustion isn't anglophysical (isn't anagrammatical). Whereas the nanofabricator (almost certainly not understood on a cause-and-effect reductionist level by the party, analogous to that the average physicist couldn't outline a laptop computer from scratch) wasn't forbidden because there was no specific reaction or reagent process to declare anti-anagrammatical, or something like that.

Of course, this breaks /more/ things, because Adwell almost certainly knows a thing or two about basic human biology, and AIR + FOOD + WATER -> MIND + AMBULATION + FEELS isn't anagrammatical! But it's always difficult to make consistent a universe governed by an entity with discretion. =p At the very least, this post was interesting to write. I really enjoyed the story, for the record!
