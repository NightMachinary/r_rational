  ... either that or it's just a quirk of the ship they're on.

Mostly this with a little bit of both.

My vague reasoning for why it makes sense is that a) Closed ecosystems will tend to exhibit random weird variation just 'cause and b) Having a distinctive look for your ship is useful for creating a sense of cohesion, so where weird quirks occur they will often get exaggerated.

Apparently one of the weird quirks that the Eschaton Arbitrage crew ended up selecting for is really good hairstyles.

(My supplemental reasoning for why this made sense is that I think that it makes the Lesbian Space Pirates joke/world-building work even better)
