Just started reading the first chapter and gotta say, I think I'll stay :)

As a software developer that is only just maturing in the field, I laugh and cry at how hopeless some of the institutions of our society are and how small minded a lot of people can be.

(Sorry for the rather generic comment, I'll read more, beyond the first chapter related to copyright and comment again haha)
