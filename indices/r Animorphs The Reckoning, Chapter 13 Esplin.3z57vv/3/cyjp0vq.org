I am reminded of an idea brought up in another rational fanfic (I think it was [[/u/datapacrat]]'s MLP fic) The Fundamental Theorem of Poker. Basically, Esplin is overestimating animorphs numbers and capabilities badly enough that he is making interesting mistakes. I wonder if the animorphs can capitalize on this tendency. Unfortunately, he seems to be updating extremely quickly on his threat estimates... I am kind of worried if the author can actually let the animorphs win without serious Ellimist intervention (it was in canon, so it wouldn't quite be a deus ex machina, but it would be kind of story breaking). Given canon, I think one major intervention at a decisive point might be reasonable, so long as it merely gives the animorphs a fighting chance (as in canon) as opposed to giving them a win.
