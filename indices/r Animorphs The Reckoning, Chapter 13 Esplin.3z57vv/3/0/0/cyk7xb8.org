The problem here (and it's a difficult one, that I've spent many hours discussing with close friends) is: how do you tell a story that's truly ABOUT the Animorphs, and yet also have it take place on a galactic-civilization-affecting scale?

In canon, we go all the way to the top---Yeerk, Taxxon, and human cultures are FOREVER altered by morphing technology, and the resolution of the war creates galaxy-wide accords that shape the face of future history. It was a huge stretch to have all of that hinge on the decisions of five kids, especially in a universe that contained things like the Chee, the Ellimist, and the Time Matrix.

If you're K.A. Applegate, you can just fall back on Ellimist Ex Machina whenever you have to. In a rationalist fic, it's not that easy. By rights, this story should be about the President, or Visser Three, or the Chee as a whole, or just a straight-up two character drama in which the Ellimist and Crayak are really the only entities who matter, since they're on scales like 10^{6} while everyone else is a 1 or a 10.

But I want it to be about Jake, Rachel, Cassie, Tobias, Marco, Ax, and to a lesser extent V3 and Garrett and Jara Hamee and Erek King, while also playing in that same universe. So my solution is to include all of the same pieces, but to balance them against one another. If you've got 1,000,002 on one side and 999,998 on the other, then suddenly it becomes believable that the number 5 can tip the balance.

Fortunately, canon provides us with exactly the right framing for such an otherwise-unlikely-and-unbelievable "perfect match." The chess game between Ellimist and Crayak is what makes the story work. They've got their own personal codes, their own side agreement, and they're each willing to abide by the outcome of the match, meaning that the Animorphs can have a disproportionately large impact without the need for a lot of godlike intervention. Ellimist is tidying things up here and there, but not affecting the PLOT. Mostly, Ellimist and Crayak's job is to keep one another OUT of the plot.
