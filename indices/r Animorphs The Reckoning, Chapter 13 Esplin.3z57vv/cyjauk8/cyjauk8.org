So Rachel somehow tricked Erek into leaving the field without her, and then he couldn't get back in to stop her from attacking Esplin? I'm not sure what happened with the hologram he was hiding her with. Was he able to leave it up, even though he was compelled to try to stop her?

Is Esplin's modified fighter the thirteenth from chapter 12?

Actually, that's a question I forgot to ask: if there are "presumably four" on the surface, and an unknown thirteenth that Ax can't detect - it sounds to me like there are five that Ax can't detect, he assumes four are on the surface, and one could be anywhere. That seems like a strange assumption. Am I reading it right?
