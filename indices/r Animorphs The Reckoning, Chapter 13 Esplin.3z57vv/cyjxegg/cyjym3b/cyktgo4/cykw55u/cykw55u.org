Hmm. I suppose the only examples I can think of are actually in reverse, with the yeerk dying while in the human host. I suppose there's a couple of offscreen mentions, but I can't actually think of any examples of hosts dying and thus killing the yeerk. You'd think yeerks bailing mid-battle would be much more of a thing if so.
