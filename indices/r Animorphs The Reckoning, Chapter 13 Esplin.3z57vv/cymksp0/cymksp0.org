At first, I took the talk of stuff hidden in "artificial skin" and an "extra set of eyes" to imply that Esplin had managed some REALLY freaky stuff with the morphing power.

Cloning is still pretty freaky, though. That's another strike against the Animorphs winning... but of COURSE the yeerks would have press-ganged the Arn into service.

Not sure what to make of the Leeran ability. Does it do that to everyone who passes within its range? If Rachel had been out of range, would Esplin have gotten nothing at all? And who got the bigger benefit from the hypersight, Esplin or Rachel? Given how incredibly unprepared she was this chapter, I'd say Rachel... especially since with Ax on the team, the Animorphs are going to be radically changing their game plan anyway. Esplin won't be able to predict that, since Rachel doesn't know about Ax yet.
