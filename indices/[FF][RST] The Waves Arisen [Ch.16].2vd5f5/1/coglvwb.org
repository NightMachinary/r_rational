  Caution was a habit, after all---and what were the odds he would suddenly find himself needing more chakra than that?

Well, from meta knowledge we can now predict that Naruto will soon need to fight a battle requiring ridiculous amounts of chakra... or that the conflict will become one that raw power can't solve.

Is anyone else worried how the Kyuubi will interact with all these shadow clones with nature chakra?

Alright, so the one non-quote thing the slug said was too many minds, right? My guess is that multiple pre-collapse human minds have been absorbed and the only coherent things they can manage to say are famous pop-culture quotes because of how the interaction of their mind works.

So uniting WMG about chakra: "Chakra" was part of some post-scarcity, post-singularity resource allocation and distribution system. I would guess it might even be fictitious, like in Ra, in that it is just a way of interacting with an abstract system. It is capable of synthesizing resources. It can generate water "easier" (perhaps less expensively in terms of system resources) than earth because water is just hydrogen and oxygen whereas earth has heavier atoms. "Chakra" can also perform/carry mental processes as a basic function (perhaps this indicates it directly ties into computing resources?). Evidence: The kyuubi's chakra is applies an alien utility function to the user's mind (possibly Kaguya's?), Orochimaru uses his Chakra to possess people, certain abilities like the Sharingan imply large amounts of computational/information processing power.

WMG about backstory: An out of control command to create water caused the first collapse. After the first collapse, war broke out among the survivors. Kaguya seized and possibly literally consumed some advanced pre-collapse artifact that granted her direct control of Chakra and a huge array of associated abilities. The ability pased on to the Sage of Six Paths and his descendants, resulting in ninja as we know them in the present.

Edit: Thougt of something else:

  “The cause in which they died will continue.”
#+end_quote

The dead minds of the pre-collapse people continue on, existing in the natural chakra's processing substrate? Or the cause of the collapse continues... the Chakra system?
