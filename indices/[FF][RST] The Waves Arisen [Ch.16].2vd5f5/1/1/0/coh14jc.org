Oh dang, so I guess everything was quotes then. But with the Tibet hint and the water hint, they all seem like they might have meaning. Just to get all my guesses at the meaning in one place:

- Water refers to the disaster that created all the water

- On top of the world/Tibet refers to their location on the Tibetan plateau.

- So I jumped ship... The survivors made it to Tibet via ship?

- "The cause in which they died will continue". The Chakra system continues even though it caused a disaster?

- “Here's who? The man from the moon... Surprise motherfucker... I'm the king of the wooorld!” “...Wow, what a totally amazing, excellent discovery---not! ...Stop that astronaut! Bring him to me... A witch! A witch! We have found a witch---may we burn her?” A lone individual spammed water clones recursively to create the disaster? Or maybe because the chakra system looks like magic? Not sure about these ones.

- "Please forgive" and "Too many mind". The disaster where someone fork bombed their mind into water clones? Or the slug has too many minds rendering only able to quote common memes of its hive mind? Or Naruto's shadow clones are too many minds.
