"the cause in which they died will continue" is from a bush speech addressing the then-recent loss of space shuttle columbia; this implies that the apocalypse was a result of human technological development. however, i doubt that it happened over any substantial period of time, because the instigator either would have a) stopped it before it became a serious issue, or b) not stopped at all.
