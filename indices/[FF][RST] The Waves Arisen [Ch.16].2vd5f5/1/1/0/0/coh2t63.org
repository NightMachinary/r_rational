  “Here's who? The man from the moon...
#+end_quote

I don't know this quote.

#+begin_quote
  Surprise motherfucker...
#+end_quote

YouTube tells me [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzcVp3VAeIY][that's from Dexter]], but I don't know the context. Doakes (speaker) is a cop, talking to a serial killer who only kills bad people. I don't actually know why they are there or what they are talking about, though.

#+begin_quote
  I'm the king of the wooorld!”
#+end_quote

Leo DiCapprio in Titanic, while standing on the bow of a ship that was going to sink.

#+begin_quote
  “...Wow, what a totally amazing, excellent discovery---not!
#+end_quote

From Wayne's World, referring to the 'Suck Kut', a home hair cutting product that's basically an expy of the real-world Flowbee. </dating_myself>

"...Stop that astronaut! Bring him to me..."

Said by Dr No in the eponymous film, as James Bond is climbing into a rocketship disguised as an astronaut.

#+begin_quote
  A witch! A witch! We have found a witch---may we burn her?”
#+end_quote

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrzMhU_4m-g&t=23s][Monty Python]]; they dress a woman as a witch (including fake nose) and come up with a torturous chain of troll logic that should never have worked, yet it does. Turns out she /was/ a witch.

#+begin_quote
  "The cause in which they died will continue".
#+end_quote

I don't recognize the quote. I thought it was Nixon's [[http://watergate.info/1969/07/20/an-undelivered-nixon-speech.html][undelivered moon-disaster contingency speech]] but that's not it.

#+begin_quote
  "Too many mind".
#+end_quote

Most immediately, this was what let Naruto master nature chakra, so it's possible that it was just the Slug Sage trying to help out. It could be a reference to something else, though -- a runaway AI, gray goo clones, an army, a social movement, etc.

#+begin_quote
  [Hypothesis]: A lone individual spammed water clones recursively to create the disaster?
#+end_quote

Water clones aren't net-positive unless you're a jinchuriki, and the jinchuriki didn't exist (as far as we know) until the [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Hagoromo_%C5%8Ctsutsuki][Sage of the Six Paths]] split the Ten-Tailed Beast into the One-through-Nine Tailed Beasts a few centuries before the events of the series. As a hyperpowerful reality-warper living in the fairly distant past, he's a good candidate for the cause of the problem, but I get the impression that it happened much earlier.
