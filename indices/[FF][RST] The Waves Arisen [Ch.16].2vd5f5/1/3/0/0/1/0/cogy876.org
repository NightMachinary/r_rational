Yep, if you have to assume a billion billion ninja for a thousand years - even the millennium seems like a generous estimate, let alone 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 ninja active for that time. Even if mean water created is a million times greater due to the crazy skewed distribution, that's not plausible.

I think a more plausible scenario is that there was a "water cataclysm" which doubled the worlds water somehow, and the jutsu is simply triggering bad associations.

In reality there would be severe and pervasive and /obvious/ (even obvious in a story which barely mentions setting) impacts from this kind of change to global oceans and associated atmospheric stuff, but I'll set aside climate science with the conservation of mass, for now.
