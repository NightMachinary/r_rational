The slug could just hsve talked nonsense and Naruto might have just figured it out himself. Jiraya did say it was all in him all along. :) The slug talks by basically referencing memes anyway. Wonder how it got that information.

No need for the torus anymore. Naruto can just summon millions of himself and sit on all enemies until they die.
