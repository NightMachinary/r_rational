So, brute forcing the magic donut seems pretty feasible right now, though one of the biggest concerns would now be making sure that the endless pool of shadow clones doesn't dispel too frequently (the recoherence limitation would be the biggest boundary on learning speed). Add an imbuement of nature chakra, and you have a citybuster in the palm of your hand.

After defeating everyone, the next concern will be where conjured water comes from, and how to get rid of the massive ocean. Do you have a specific location for the ninja continent?
