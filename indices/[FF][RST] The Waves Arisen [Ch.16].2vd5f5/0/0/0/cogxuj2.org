Woo, rusty earth systems student here...

Gravity: increases by zero to ten percent; the earth is very big and generally much denser than water. Zero because we're probably talking about surface =g=, rather than orbital stuff.

I'll come back to atmosphere and weather.

Tectonic plates will be basically unaffected - they're driven mostly by sub-surface issues. Small regions could see some significant changes due to the massive pressure, but at continental scales I expect it averages out (mostly).

Global soil is mostly /very wet/. The Plateau doesn't have much at the moment, since it's geologically new and gets washed downstream, but per descriptions of significant vegetation that must change.

Global ocean and atmosphere systems would be /fascinating/, in the way a doctor would be fascinated by a man walking up with ten kinds of cancer, one limb, and crowbar through the skull.

Without knowing the temperature, purity (especially salinity and dissolved gasses), placement, and timescale and spatial variations of those things, I can't even guess.

- How well mixed is this new ocean? Ours takes ~10^{6} years to mix well. Salinity, biology, etc all rely on this.

- What temperature is it? I'm thinking here mostly about global energy balance of earth - adding water at any temperature other than 15 degrees will change the mean (surface) temperature of the planet a /lot/, and with massive specific heat behind it.

- There is literally too much here to think about right now. If people are interested, I'll look up more numbers in the morning.
