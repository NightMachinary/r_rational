I was assuming this was the extra water produced by all the water jutsu that have ever been used.

EDIT: checking my math:

There's that one jutsu where a stream of water comes out of your mouth. Here's my Fermi estimate:

- 10cm diameter stream, 10m long when formed = 75,000 cc = 75L
- Every second it produces another 75L
- Generally used for a total of 10s per battle
- Used only by water type ninja (1/4 of population)
- Easy technique, so all water types learn it
- Used in every battle among those who know it
- Active duty ninja average 1 battle / day across a career averaging 3 years (most die as genin)
- 400 days in a year, so every ninja who knows it generates 400 d/y * 3 y * 750L = 90,000L over their career, rounds to 100,000L
- There have been ninja for 1,000 years
- The total ninja population over the last 1,000 years has been X
- Ergo, over those 1,000 years there have been 100,000L * X ninja * 1/4 water/all ninja = 25,000X liters created
- There are [[http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/oceanwater.html][352,670,000,000,000,000,000 gallons of water]] in the oceans, meaning 16E21 L rounds to 25E21 L

This would require X = 1E18 ninja ever lived. Looks like I'm wrong about something -- probably the entire idea. There are plenty of other water-creating jutsu, but unless something in there is recursive this idea doesn't work. Can water clones create water clones and am I correct that forming water clones does not require pre-existing water?

Naruto should totally have his water clones start creating water clones up to a reasonable limit. No reason to stay limited to a measly 6000 mc / s regen rate after all. Much better to regen all 2M every second.
