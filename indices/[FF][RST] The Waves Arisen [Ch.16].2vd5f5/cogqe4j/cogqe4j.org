...OK. My reaction to all that is basically unprintable, but here's some strategic notes:

- Naruto is now capable of becoming immune to decapitation strikes. He can trivially regenerate from any shadow clone back to full power.

- Becoming immune to conventional assault should be a priority

- Vulnerability to "exotic" attacks such as Sharingan mental hacks, Rinnegan soul-magic, weird seals, etc. is the next big thing. Naruto might dismiss it as legend, but...

Setting notes:

- [[https://wertifloke.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/map5.jpg][Story map]], [[http://homepages.dias.ie/%7Eajones/tibet/tibet_topo.gif][Tibet topo map]]

- That's a beautiful map you made, OP. My basic GIS skills are jealous.

- Sea level has risen by approximately five thousand meters from the present day. (Holy shit, maybe a hundredish from climate change isn't so bad?)

- That's suspiciously close to exactly doubling the water on Earth - obviously exact numbers are hard to get, and it could be a genuine coincidence about the height of the plateau.

- What else might still be above water? [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_highest_points][Look for Naruto's backup bases here]] - no sense letting a disaster in Tibet take out a swarm intelligence.
