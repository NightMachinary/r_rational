  That's suspiciously close to exactly doubling the water on Earth - obviously exact numbers are hard to get, and it could be a genuine coincidence about the height of the plateau.

If we assume "doubling the water on Earth" is exactly what happened, would this additional water mass pushing on the earth's crust do anything to:

- Gravity levels?
- Atmospheric pressure at sea level? (Or air quality? O2 content? H2O content/humidity?)
- Tectonic plate momentum?
- Weather patterns?
- Global average soil aridity/arability?

One thing that immediately sticks out to me is that the oceans would also now be about half as saline as before. (I presume water jutsus generate the equivalent of distilled drinking water.) I wonder how much that would have impacted global marine biodiversity...
