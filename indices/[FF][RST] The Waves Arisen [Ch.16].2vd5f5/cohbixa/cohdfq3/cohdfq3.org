It seems very likely that every single Jinchuuriki that was sealed young enough and lives long enough will stumble on this eventually. "How many, and long can I keep x clone going" isn't an experiment that requires unusual curiosity to attempt, and well, once you do that, the fact that it gives you infinite chakra isn't something likely to be missed. But without the shadow clone, infinite Chakra isn't a world breaker. The only really good abuse of it is to couple it with chakra transfers to other ninja, which would paint a really enormous bullseye on you in battle if your enemies catch on. So, hey, maybe there are more than a few very similar hideouts carved into the bedrock, most of them empty because of the eventual demise of the builder.
