Idk man, seems like a bit of a cop out to just let him get to infinite chakra with water clones. The water clone trick is able to be done on its own, and the "chakra overflow" without having to even dispel them only makes it easier to stumble upon.

It seems like any Jinchuuriki who knew the water clone technique would be able to use this cheat.

It also seems likely the ninja system or at least Jounin would have discovered any obvious numbering system for chakra use and catalogued the costs of all known techniques. Jiraiya and Naruto imply some complicated math being used at many levels of being a ninja. Studying chakra is one of the first things ninja would do.

Any kage trying to make their Jinchuuriki a more powerful weapon would consider their differences from normal ninja, of which chakra regeneration is the most prominent outside of triggering, and looked at techniques to leverage this boon.

I'm not saying it's impossible or even exceedingly unlikely for this to slip through the cracks. Maybe there just haven't been enough generations of ninja for this kind of knowledge to propagate until now. Maybe Jinchuuriki are treated as subhuman, more as a bomb than anything else.

But the fucking fourth Mizukage, man.
