It's true that it's against the rules but it doesn't seem like the mods care much. I've had multiple script-form stories up there for about six years now and nary a peep.

Honestly, my impression is that the site is running on autopilot. I don't think there's much moderation and there doesn't seem to be much in the way of new code development. (Then again, I haven't been interacting regularly for a while now, so maybe I've missed something.)
