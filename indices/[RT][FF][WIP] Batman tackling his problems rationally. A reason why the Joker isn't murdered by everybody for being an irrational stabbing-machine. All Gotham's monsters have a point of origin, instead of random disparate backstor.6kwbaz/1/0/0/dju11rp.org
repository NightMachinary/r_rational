  Author's Note: Extinction burst refers to the concept of eliminating a behavior by refusing to reinforce it.

Not quite. That is just extinction. Extinction burst is a specific phenomenon where when the reinforcement is removed the occurrence of the behaviour will decline until a surge in behaviour occurs (the so called extinction burst). If no reinforcement is provided for the surge then the behaviour soon reaches near-complete extinction.

Lets say a kid throws tantrums in order to get candy from his/her parents. The parents decide they have had enough and won't give the kid candy when the kid throws tantrums. Throwing tantrums is the behaviour, getting candy is the reinforcer for the kid. When the kid no longer gets candy for the tantrums the behaviour will become less common until the kid decides to throw a super tantrum (The extinction burst) in case just trying harder will work. If that doesn't work then the kid will give up (The behaviour will become extinct). If it does then the kid will keep doing the behaviour
