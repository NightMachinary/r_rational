What is batman's superpower? [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NG3n_gONws][He's rich]]. His prowess as a superhero comes from a) his martial arts training and b) his ultra high-tech costume.

First, costume. The cost of such things is mostly R&D. Once it is developed, it's possible to produce them.

Second, martial arts. He trained for about 15 years, which is long, sure, but there are plenty of people who train more. And people in army/police special ops teams are among them.

So here is the thing. Instead of going vigilante, he should have funded a creation of a special police force, and then equipped them with his costumes. At the same time, Bruce would have more time for developing even better varians of the armor. Moreover, being police, they wouldn't have to face the complications of vigilantism. And one of them could actually shoot Joker for, you know, resisting arrest.

Such a ploy would never work in a comic - this force would be essentially an elite mook squad, good only for being slaughtered. But we are talking rational here, and there is no doubt that a hundred professional batmans would be miles beter than a single one who does it as a glorified hobby.
