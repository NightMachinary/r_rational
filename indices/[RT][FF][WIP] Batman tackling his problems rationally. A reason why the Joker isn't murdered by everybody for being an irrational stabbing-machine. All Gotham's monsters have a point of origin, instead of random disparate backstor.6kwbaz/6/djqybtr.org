YEH! This good! Minor spelling/grammar issues here and there, but otherwise written as what writer intends on saying.

How did Fear Gas counter the arcane? That part could use a bit more explanation and detail, either that or I missed something.

As far as the entire story is concerned I get what you're going for, aiming for Deconstruct with character behavior focus. It can be great, so long as you update and give actual resolutions, in a sense that characters end up different characters than their comic originals.

I will say I am not a fan of what happened to Moth man, would prefer the OG version of a guy fighting in a moth costume. I mean thats just so awesome not to have in a book! Who knows maybe someone else takes up the mantle as a legacy?
