Thanks for the notes!

The line about John not saying that is a line I adapted from a therapist roommate I had who would say stuff like that when I teased him about being a 'bad therapist.' (The joke was me being ironic. I'm sure you've gotten the thing where people assume you're treating every human interaction like it's a session, and they act surprised when you say something biting). But you have a good point. I don't think John would "never" say that in a session. In fact, I think the line may be contradictory to things the character later says.

I was aware of the negative thing. Since Bruce is not a psychologist, he would only be familiar with the common vernacular usage of negative reinforcement. Plus, the sentiment still makes sense, since the reinforcement is literally "negative," ie, not conducive.

Again, I agree with your note. The way it is now is too confusing, and John probably wouldn't think to use the common usage. And it's a case where it sounds like I'm wrong to people like you who know the real terminology that John would know.
