Very well done! Definitely going to be reading more of this :) Two quick notes you may already be aware of:

#+begin_quote
  "What kind of therapist would say that shit?" "Not a good one; never during a session."
#+end_quote

You might be surprised :) Usually it would require a good rapport between the client and therapist first, but that kind of blunt borderline-insulting honesty is a tool like any other in the therapist's toolkit, and I've used it to great effect, particularly with younger clients who appreciate someone calling them on their shit in a humorous way. A response he might give instead is:

"Never during a first session. But we're already friends, so I don't have to wait to build rapport, and we've already decided this isn't a therapy session, so I can be honest and direct without having to spend time building trust. And, honestly, I can see through your bullshit."

#+begin_quote
  "Just because the reinforcement is negative, doesn't mean it's not reinforcement."
#+end_quote

From a technical standpoint, "reinforcement" is the correct word here because it's encouraging behavior, but "negative" is not: Negative reinforcement does not refer to /introducing/ things that are unpleasant, it refers to /taking away/ things that are unpleasant, which is what makes it a reinforcement. In either case, because of the Joker's particular perspective, if he's being described as someone who seeks attention, even in the form of Batman's fists, then Bruce punishing him is /positive reinforcement/ because he's giving him what he wants: to withhold that attention would in fact be a punishment, specifically a Negative Punishment, which is the technical term for "removing a thing that is desired."

It's a bit confusing even for psychologists sometimes, but the rule of thumb is that "Reinforcement" and "Punishment" refer to the thing being desired or not by the person, and "Positive" and "Negative" refer to the action being introduced or taken away. A simple fix to this would to just change the line to:

"Just because the reinforcement is something we'd normally consider harmful, doesn't mean it's not reinforcement."

Again, great chapter, looking forward to reading the rest!
