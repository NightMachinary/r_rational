Wonderful story, though I'm curious why "the Batman" aspect of Bruce Wayne's psyche hasn't fought back against Bruce's attempts to move beyond it. I can see Wayne losing the fire of his motivations and seeking new ways to realize his goals, but part of being the Batman is an utterly indomitable will. That willpower should be nearly as strong facing up against apathy as it is fighting weaknesses of the body.

If Bruce Wayne's psyche is fractured enough, that is a fight he will have to engage in at some point.
