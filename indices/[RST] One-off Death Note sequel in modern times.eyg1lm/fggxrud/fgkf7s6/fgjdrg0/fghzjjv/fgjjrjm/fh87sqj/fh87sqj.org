Very interesting, but very disappointing ending.

I get that there should've been the moral statement, but this "deus ex machina" was really frustrating part. There obiously were more "normal" ways of making protagonist to pay for what he did - like being killed by random robber for his money, or world war being unleashed because US has the power of Kira, etc.
