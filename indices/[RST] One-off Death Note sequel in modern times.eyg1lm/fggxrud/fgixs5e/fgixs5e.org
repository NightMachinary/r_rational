Same. But without a message, it's little more than self insert "this is what /I/ would do with the death note!" fanfiction, like most bad rationalist fiction. The fact that the original author wrote it has no bearing on that fact.

And while the rule /did/ come out of nowhere and was worded specifically to screw the guy over, the rule was added by a Shinigami who actually /did/ just want to screw the guy over. So at least it makes sense, even if it's unsatisfying.
