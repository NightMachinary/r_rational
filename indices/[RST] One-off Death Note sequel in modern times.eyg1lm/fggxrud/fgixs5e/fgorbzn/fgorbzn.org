I think the message is in general that no matter how you go about it, the power of something like the Death Note is intrinsically evil and you can't really escape its consequences. The protagonist thought he was being clever by not killing anyone himself, but in practice, he knew he was /enabling/ someone else being killed, maybe even start wars. In the end the rules were made up because he made the mistake of treating Death Gods as only passive observers rather than beings with their own agendas and Death Notes of their own.
