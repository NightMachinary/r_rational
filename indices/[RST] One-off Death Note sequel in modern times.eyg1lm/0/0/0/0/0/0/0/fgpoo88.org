Well, the manga cut on his conversation with Ryuk, but "a Shinigami can not be killed even by a bullet" is part of the rules, and in fact if Ryuk told him the full story of Light he can't have avoided explaining him that - as well as that Shinigami only die if they kill a human to extend the life of another, or if they run out of lifespan because they stop writing names.

At that point, whether they are sentient or not becomes a sophistry. He's talked with Ryuk and seen him pass the Turing test with flying colours, so to speak. It's either a being with an independent mind, or an avatar of a different being with an independent mind, and in either case there's supernatural shenanigans involved. In fact, if Ryuk was fake and a puppet of some other entity, the simple fact of having put up such a deception would make him /even less/ trustworthy.
