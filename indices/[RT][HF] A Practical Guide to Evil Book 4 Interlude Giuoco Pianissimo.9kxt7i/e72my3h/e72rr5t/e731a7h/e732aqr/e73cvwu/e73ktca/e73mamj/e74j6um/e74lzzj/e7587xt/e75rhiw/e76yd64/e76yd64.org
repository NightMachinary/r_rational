I do mean them. Callow is a preindustrial farming nation, with massive chunks of their farmland burnt down, their biggest trading city in ruins, their economy in tatters, and their military has horrific casualty rates, but instead of the citizens having to be forced into the military and the kingdom of callow starving, they're... just fine, apparently, and everyone is totally behind the black queen who caused literally all of this. If this were to happen in a comparable country multiple hundreds of years more advanced in tech, you would have widespread food shortages and mass starvation, even without having to feed a massive training army being taken from the population of farmers at a critical time; most states from comparable tech levels would have collapsed completely.
