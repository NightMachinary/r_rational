To quote TFS!cell: I have so many questions!

Does this person know who hakram is, and is lying to Hakram? That seems pretty ballsy, but that's the only thing that really makes sense here. Like, if they're a poor refugee in a medieval world, in a city with crushing housing prices, as a single parent, how the hell can they afford to give away meat to a random org? Like, poor people in modern countries have difficulty supporting kids as a single parent; add in all the above and it boggles the mind. That despite losing their home and livelihood they have 0 complaints whatsoever and are super stoked despite, in there eyes, and orc being in charge only seems to work if they recognize hakram and don't want to be seen as diesloyal, but that just raises further issues.
