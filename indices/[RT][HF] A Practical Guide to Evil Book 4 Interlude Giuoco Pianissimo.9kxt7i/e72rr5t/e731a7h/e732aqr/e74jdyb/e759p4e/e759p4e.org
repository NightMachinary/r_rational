1) the Story needed Hakram to see that he has friends in the town - not everyone fears orcs, even if they fear the Deadhand. A free feed of a strip of meet is a Good way to make him feel welcome in the city.

2) didn't the refugees from the edge of Callow just bring all their animals into the capital? If there's ever a time to give away gamey meat to someone who just had a friendly chat to you, it's now.

3) if she is a refugee, she's new to the city too. Seems like Callow is the type of place where cheap meals might be shared between friends. The exact economics of callow is obfuscated and kept deliberately in flux.

There's a lot of unbelievable stuff in the story, that isn't one of them.
