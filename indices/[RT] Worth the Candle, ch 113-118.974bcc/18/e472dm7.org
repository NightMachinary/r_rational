I have a lot of separate thoughts about this set.

- I really, really liked the counseling chapter. Probably my favorite yet.

- I think Pallida is more likely to provide a love interest for Amaryllis than Juniper, even though it's obviously starting from somewhere unhealthy. I don't think Amaryllis is going to get in a relationship with Juniper, because why would you want to be with someone that is mildly revolted by touching you? Sex with Amaryllis in some ways would feel tantamount to rape because there would definitely be a coercive aspect to the mismatched needs.

- I do think that one or more characters will flip shit on Bethel; she doesn't make sense as a companion right now. She's too useless in a majority of actions the group can take, because she's stationary. Ropey makes a better companion than she does. The worst part is that she probably could have ended the fight much sooner.

- Valencia's social fu is not infallible. She thought Heshnel would probably be on their side, and at first glance it appears like he wasn't. She also thought Everett and Gemma would be on the same side. They clearly weren't. At the same time, her reluctance to drop the devil after counselling was alarming.

- Where the fuck were the void weapons? The rock monster could have been brought down much easier.
