  . I don't think Amaryllis is going to get in a relationship with Juniper, because why would you want to be with someone that is mildly revolted by touching you? Sex with Amaryllis in some ways would feel tantamount to rape because there would definitely be a coercive aspect to the mismatched needs.

Note that Amaryllis is capable of hacking her own soul. She recognizes that Juniper wants her and that it would be pragmaticly useful to be in a relationship with him. If she wanted to then she could get rid of her dislike of being touched, crank her libido way up, and increase her romantic interest in Juniper. I don't think she will because she's smart enough to know that being a rebound is not likely to last, and that it would be too obvious that she was doing it for mercenary reasons.
