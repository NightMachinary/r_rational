Late to the party, but I had to come and get it out...

Man this latest batch was a depressing ride!

Props for the convincing, gut wrenching writing style. Actually, it was 3 strikes for me:

1. The relationship that's been nurtured for countless chapters, vivisected, slaughtered
2. Fenn, the fun, carefree character that was breathing some lightheartedness (sometimes) into the story, abandoned and bled to death
3. The plot to eventually heroically rescue the soul of the latter and along destroy the hells and save trillions of endlessly suffering souls, annihilated

Can't wait for the next tragedy to unfold!
