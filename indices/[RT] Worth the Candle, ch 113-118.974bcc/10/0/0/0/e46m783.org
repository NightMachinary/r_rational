There are two souls, or two parts to the soul, I'm not sure which. From chapter 67:

  “The term ‘soul' is imprecise,” said Fallatehr. “You likely think of it as a small white thing pulled from the heart or head after death?” He gestured first at his temple, then at his chest. “That is the anima exa, a physical manifestation of the soul, unique to the mortal species, but not synonymous with the anima ipsa.”

  “But the soul can be extinguished,” I said. “And as far as I can tell, that has no bearing on the bones themselves.”

  “The anima exa can be extinguished,” said Fallatehr. “And in fact, nothing in the world can prevent that, so far as is known to me. That has little bearing on the anima ipsa.”

  I frowned at that. “Naively, that doesn't make sense. You're saying that the soul continues to exist in the bones, regardless of whether someone goes to hell?”

  “No,” said Fallatehr. “What I am saying is that by every method I have been able to use, the soul continues to be accessible well after death, even for those confirmed by infernoscope to have passed into the afterlife.”

  I heard movement from behind me. “If that were true --” Amaryllis began.

  “It is,” said Fallatehr.

  “There would be metaphysical implications of that,” said Amaryllis. “If the souls of those in hell could be manipulated by means on Aerb we --”

  “They cannot,” said Fallatehr.

  “Why not?” asked Amaryllis.

  “The principle of planar disjunction,” said Fallatehr. “It was the talk of the Guild of the Essential Soul, prior to the subjugation and death of ninety percent of its members when Manifest's exclusion zone was created.” He seemed slightly wistful for a moment. “Obviously I had no ability to conduct novel research on planar disjunction from within Amoureux, and I was not allowed the courtesy of taking a copy of the relevant studies into the penitentiary, but all available evidence pointed to the fact that the soul was, in fact, incapable of crossing the planar boundary.” He waved his hand. “Much of this is tangential to the subject at hand.”

  “Har har,” I said, raising my deformed hand slightly.

  “We might think of the bones as intermediaries,” said Fallatehr. “If the soul is a complicated book of exceptional length, the bones are men who study that book and give answers to those who seek them. Each has a deep connection to the soul, and is conversant on its own area.”

  “But when you burn a bone, you affect the soul,” I said. “So it wouldn't seem like a very good metaphor to me.”

  “Metaphors are rarely good,” said Fallatehr with a shrug. “We -- I say we, but there are by your accounting few left alive who might have given me a proper conversation on the subject -- don't understand precisely what happens when bone magic is used. It appears to affect both donor and recipient at the level of the soul, with other effects as a result of that, but the actual mechanism is opaque, despite the numerous tests we've done.”

It's always seemed to me that the "anima exa" is the part that gets collected and used for fueling motorcycles and the like, and the "anima ipsa" is the part that goes to the hells. Or that, because the "soul" can't cross planar boundaries, maybe the anima ipsa already exists on another plane.
