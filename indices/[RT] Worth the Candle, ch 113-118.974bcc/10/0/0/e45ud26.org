It's possible her soul was destroyed, I'm not sure. But given the attention the hells have been given this set of chapters, it'd make narrative sense for Fenn to end up in the hells.

It's not clear exactly how the poison works. I don't think it's just randomly destroying parts of the soul. My current hypothesis is that it worked by degrading the soul's conception of the body, given that when Joon looked in his soul, he saw the body there damaged.
