Oh, great. I was wrong on both counts! It looks more and more like I was insufficiently careful in reading and came to the correct conclusion about the second girlfriend through sheer dumb luck. Ah, well, broken clocks et cetera.

Also, it looks like we both skimmed right over poor Rache, who I'm sure is a very nice person and just as deserving of intricate fan theories about her shared past with Joon. So I suppose I'll make some up since I'm going to reread anyway.
