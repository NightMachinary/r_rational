I don't think Fenn's soul has gone to the hells. I think it was destroyed, like the souls that people of Aerb use as fuel.

(I mean, it's /possible/ that soul-destructions are a lie perpetuated by devils to manipulate mortals into generating billions of souls for them, and that in actuality all "destroyed" souls go to the deepest layers of hells where the infernoscopes can't see, but that's an entirely separate issue. As far as we know: soul destruction is possible, the poison appeared to be degrading souls, therefore Fenn's soul is likely destroyed.)
