Excellent chapters. Enjoyed it the whole way through as usual.

If I knew I was inside a narrative and was in a realationship with the MC I would probabaly be mindful of the fact that breaking up with the MC is a massive death flag. Having said that /being/ in a relationship at all with the MC is a massive death flag in itself since even if you make it through the arc where you are rescued from danger half the time you get killed off in the next cycle to start a revenge story or establish the threat of the next big bad. It's a tough one. Maybe better just to stay friends with the MC.
