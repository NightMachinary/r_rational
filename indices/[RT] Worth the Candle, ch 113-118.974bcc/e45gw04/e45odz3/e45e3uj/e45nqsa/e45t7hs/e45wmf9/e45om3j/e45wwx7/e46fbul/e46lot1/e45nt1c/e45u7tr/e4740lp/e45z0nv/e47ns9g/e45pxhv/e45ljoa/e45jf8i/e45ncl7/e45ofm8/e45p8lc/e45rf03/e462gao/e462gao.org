I'm on the fence on whether Val consciously decided to sabotage the relationship (it's not like she grew up in the sort of environment that rewarded principled ethics), but either way, I do wonder what the thought process was in deciding that Val should be Joon and Fenn's couple counselor.

Leaving aside that therapy on close friends is a bad idea in general, Val had very strong incentives to want Joon and Fenn to break up. Even if we assume she didn't break them up consciously, she probably let some bias creep in without realizing it. Even if she didn't, that doubt is going to color her relationship with Joon (and maybe Fenn) for /years/.

I mean, they're rich, and they have a teleportation key. If they want couple's counseling, hire a therapist. If they want to give Val some experience at therapy, have her get some formation first, and give her a part-time job with people she has no prior relationship with.
