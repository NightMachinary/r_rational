There were 20 billion under Uther; 5 billion presently. Major invasions like the Ice Wizards and Apocalypse Demon could easily kill some. Prophylactics, industrialization, and genetically incompatible interspecies marriage could lead to 500 years of sub-replacement fertility. Just 200 years (10 generations) of a global average of 1.8 kids per women would lead to 7 billion people on the world; unless I was reading the calculator wrong. That's actually a pretty common birthrate in our world (the US doesn't have positive population growth without immigration). Amaryllis does mention prophylactics in particular. The exclusions probably get too much credit.

The reason I mentioned Solace in general is the fact that she's a druid got the response “How much raw power is your side of the table packing?” However, that makes your point even more valid; if druids were so powerful, and they are, how could the second empire exterminate them?

And while I agree that a straight multiplication of rarity, the powers synergize pretty neatly. Joon can pump speed, strength, and vitality by draining blood and bones, and then replace those bones with soul magic. And heal himself. It's not a perfect translation, but there is a noticeable correlation between dual classing in this case and power.

So I think we're nearing a point of agreement; which is that this system is heavily titled more towards offense than defense. There are so many avenues of attack that defense is very hard, and offense is very easy. Alpha strikes become hugely important.

So, to answer your original question about why it was so hard; Uther's minions were playing constant defense for threats that came out of the woodwork.

And while I think you're right that increasing skills has diminishing returns, it's not an exponential curve. The reason I see is virtues like Bladebound. Some virtues seem really powerful, like soul sight; it's not just increasing your combat ability, it's also increasing your ability to perceive, prevent, and protect against alpha strikes. (Which gets to another point of agreement; there are threats that you could never see without soul sight.) It's probable that without these virtues, you don't survive certain threats.

One more tangentially related point; Uther's minions were also losing magic items as this was going on. His greed heirs were taking stuff.

As for Doris Finch: a government could probably repeatedly void bomb the area, hire a dragon to raze the area, starve the area, etc. The easiest way for the party would probably be creating a soul virus. Assuming that she uses soul magic somehow, alter two of her so that the alteration would make her value the mission of exterminating non-altered Doris Finch, and hate herself in general. As part of her programming, she would reinforce her own programming before it could fade. Once all the non-altered ones are dead, the remainder have a kool aid party. You wouldn't even have to alter that many values to do it.
