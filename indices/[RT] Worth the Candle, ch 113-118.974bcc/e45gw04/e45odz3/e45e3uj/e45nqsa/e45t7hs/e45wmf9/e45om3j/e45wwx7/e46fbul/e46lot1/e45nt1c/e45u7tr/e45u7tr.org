OK so I have a question about the nature of threat confrontation. Heshnel said after Uther went missing, his followers stopped the rising threats but only after heavy losses. But how heavy are we talking? It sounded like the group facing the threats were small, powerful groups of Uther's people so the losses would be relatively small too. Dozens, maybe low hundreds in terms of lost members or family/loved ones but nothing in the grand scheme of things right?

Yet if the scale and number of threats are really that bad, shouldn't this be a unified, planet-wide effort with every major government setting things aside to deal with this rather than a small group? Joon and Uther are powerful, but not as powerful as an entire organization since individual power can only go so far. They've very nearly lost fights when they go up against other small groups like this one, Larkspur, the gold mage etc. Imagine if they were facing 20 Bellads, 50 mages of all types with a support staff of hundreds, there'd be no winning in a fight there, only retreat. Equally, such a large force should do better against the rising threats.

The thing is, the manner of threats Joon and Uther typically face are like DND party sized things, enemy parties, BBEG, giant monsters, etc, never entire militaries because those types of confrontations are narratively difficult and less dramatic and personal than the party sized stuff. But if you were optimally trying to face some insane apocalyptic threat, why throw dozens at it and hope when you could throw thousands? I imagine an international special forces organization with a strength in the tens of thousands should be created to deal with this stuff.
