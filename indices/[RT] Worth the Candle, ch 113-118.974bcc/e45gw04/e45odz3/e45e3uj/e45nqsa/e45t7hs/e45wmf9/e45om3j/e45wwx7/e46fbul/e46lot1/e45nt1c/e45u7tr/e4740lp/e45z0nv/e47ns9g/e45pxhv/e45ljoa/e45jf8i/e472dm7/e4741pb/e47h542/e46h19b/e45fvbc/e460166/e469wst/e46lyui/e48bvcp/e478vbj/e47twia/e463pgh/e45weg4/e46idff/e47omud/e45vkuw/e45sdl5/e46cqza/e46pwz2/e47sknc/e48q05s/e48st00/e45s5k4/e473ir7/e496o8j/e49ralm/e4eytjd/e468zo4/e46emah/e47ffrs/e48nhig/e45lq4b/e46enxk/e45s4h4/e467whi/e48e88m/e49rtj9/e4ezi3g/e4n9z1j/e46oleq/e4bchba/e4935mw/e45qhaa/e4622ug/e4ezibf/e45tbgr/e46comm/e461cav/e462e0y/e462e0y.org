Not them, but I don't think you actually gave reasons for your complaints. What exactly was dumb? O'kald had a good reason Valencia didn't catch (and I assume it will be expanded upon in the future), and it led him to betray everyone. Nothing about that seems forced.

The only thing I would call dumb in the last few chapters would be getting on the ship in the first place, but that didn't have any negative consequences on its own, and Fenn is impulsive enough that it's not really out of character.

Valencia intentionally riling O'kald up without having full control over the situation was also a mistake, but I don't think she's experienced enough that you can call it an Idiot Ball thing any more that you can call Joon an idiot for not being the perfect boyfriend.

If Fenn dying turns into a drama handled with the subtlety of a DC superhero comic you might have a point, but we aren't there yet, so I'd hold your complaints til then.
