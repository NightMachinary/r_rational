It really isn't here though. Global warming isn't on the same scale, I've said it before in this thread but people can look at the evidence for it and dismiss it, they can't do the same for the things that exist on Aerb.

Also global warming is a very distant and impersonal threat, not something people are really equipped to respond to rationally. People just don't respond to certain threats proportionally because we're still just animals. If a dozen people are killed by a pack of wolves or machete wielding maniacs in your city, the response would be extreme right? If a dozen people died due to antibiotics no longer being effective because of their overusage, the response wouldn't be the same. The types of threats on Aerb and response are in the first category, they are extremely visceral and imminent in a way global warming just isn't.
