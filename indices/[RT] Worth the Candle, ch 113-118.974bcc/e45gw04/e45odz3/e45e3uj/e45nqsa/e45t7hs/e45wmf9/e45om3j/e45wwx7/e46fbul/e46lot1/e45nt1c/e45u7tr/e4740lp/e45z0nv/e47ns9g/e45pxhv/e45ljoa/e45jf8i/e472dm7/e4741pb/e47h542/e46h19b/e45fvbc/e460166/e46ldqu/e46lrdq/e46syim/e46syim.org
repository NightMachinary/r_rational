You're right, and I don't like my original argument. It wouldn't have hurt to have an in-story explanation.

That said, there was no rush to fix Joon and Fenn's romantic relationship, only their working relationship. The only time constraint here was getting the team back in working order for the meeting, which Val did. I don't think they split because of a time constraint in the therapy session, but either because Val overestimated her abilities, sabotaged them, or had longer term plans for therapy.
