I thought about addressing this idea, but I didn't end up doing it. I don't think this is the case, for various reasons:

1. Aerb doesn't seem like that type of world to me, where you get something that in some way correlates with what you deserve, even if in reality nobody deserves hell. Aerb, while not universally shitty, just doesn't seem to be the sort of place with even that level of fairness.

2. This implies a fundamentally true "Good" and "Evil" baked into the universe. There is admittedly some evidence for this, given the effect in the white tower, but I'm not sure we can conclude yet that this is a universal force rather than a mental effect that uses one particular person's form of morality. That said, a determinant for who goes to hell based on a morality that Joon or most readers wouldn't agree with, for example with soul magic being inherently evil like the tower seemed to think, is probably the most interesting form of a morality based hell sorting. I've toyed with the idea of a campaign based on that idea in the past, where good and evil are fundamental forces of the universe but don't necessarily align with what I or the players see as right and wrong.

3. Mary said that the first few levels of hell weren't much worse than the island the story started on. It seems worth living under those conditions. People tend to think of themselves as good, so if there was the belief that if you're a good person you don't suffer that much, I'm not sure soul burning would be as universally considered the right thing to do as it is; even shitty people would rationalize why they're actually a good person and would be on one of the first levels.
