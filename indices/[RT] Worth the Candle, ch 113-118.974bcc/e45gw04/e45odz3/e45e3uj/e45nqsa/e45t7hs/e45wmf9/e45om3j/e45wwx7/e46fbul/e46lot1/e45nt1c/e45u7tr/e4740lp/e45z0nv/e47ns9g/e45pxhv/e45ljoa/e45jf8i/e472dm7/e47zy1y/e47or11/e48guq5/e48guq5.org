Reading between the lines, it seems that void weaponry was outlawed because its usage is somehow related to the activity of the Void Beast. Maybe the Void Beast is reacting to the frequent usage of void weapons by the party previously? Not the best theory seeing as how relatively easy it is to create and use void weapons (Fuchsia Coterie, Larkspur, Mary).
