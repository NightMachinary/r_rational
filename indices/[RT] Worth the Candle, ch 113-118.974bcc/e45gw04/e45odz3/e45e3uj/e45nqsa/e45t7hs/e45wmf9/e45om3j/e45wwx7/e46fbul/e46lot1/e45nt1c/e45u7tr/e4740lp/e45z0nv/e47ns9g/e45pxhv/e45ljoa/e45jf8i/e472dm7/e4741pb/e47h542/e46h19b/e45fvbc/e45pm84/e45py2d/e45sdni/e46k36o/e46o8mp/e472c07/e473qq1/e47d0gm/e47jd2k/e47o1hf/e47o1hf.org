  Track the degradation, repair as necessary.

And how is Joon supposed to tell what is degradation, and what is a change that Original!Fenn would have made? The relationship counselling session was just the latest in many examples showing how Joon is not great at interpreting how other people think/will act, but even if he had a godlike social skill (as in the actual stat), I doubt he'd be capable of doing that.

He doesn't even completely understand himself, and you expect him to be able model how someone else would act indefinitely?

There's a scene where Joon sees a list of the things he values, and he doesn't understand why one item is higher than another. I don't think even Fallatehr, or anyone, for that matter, could do what you're talking about.

  Even if the degradation were unpredictable, I imagine the person degrading would have a fair bit of input on the matter, not just Joon.

I just can't see this being realistically possible. People don't understand themselves or others enough to do this, but even if they did, this would be an incredibly invasive process they'd have to do every day.

All to make someone who still isn't Fenn, and definitely doesn't have her abilities.
