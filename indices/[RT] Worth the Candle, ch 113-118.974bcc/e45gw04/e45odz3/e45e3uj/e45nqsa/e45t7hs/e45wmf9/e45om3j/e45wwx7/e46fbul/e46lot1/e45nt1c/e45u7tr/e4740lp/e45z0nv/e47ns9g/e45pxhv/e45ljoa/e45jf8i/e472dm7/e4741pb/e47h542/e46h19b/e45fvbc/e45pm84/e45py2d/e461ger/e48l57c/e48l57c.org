  Valencia swooped forward and took the crown from Solace's head, then placed it firmly on Amaryllis', standing back slightly and giving every appearance of counting to herself. I couldn't see her face, but she was radiating tension. After a few moments of the crown of thorns being in place, she took it from Amaryllis' head and placed it on Grak's. Valencia glanced at Fenn, just for a moment, then back to Grak.
