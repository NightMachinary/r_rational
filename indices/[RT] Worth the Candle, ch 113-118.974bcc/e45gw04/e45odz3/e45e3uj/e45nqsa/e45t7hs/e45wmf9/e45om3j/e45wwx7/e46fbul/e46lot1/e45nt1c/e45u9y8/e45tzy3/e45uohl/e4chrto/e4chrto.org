  Mary said that the first few levels of hell weren't much worse than the island the story started on. It seems worth living under those conditions. People tend to think of themselves as good, so if there was the belief that if you're a good person you don't suffer that much, I'm not sure soul burning would be as universally considered the right thing to do as it is; even shitty people would rationalize why they're actually a good person and would be on one of the first levels.

How strict is it? Is the average person good enough to get into a lighter hell? Does the average criminal deserve an infinite amount of suffering? What point does such suffering serve if rehabilitation and reintroduction to society is impossible?
