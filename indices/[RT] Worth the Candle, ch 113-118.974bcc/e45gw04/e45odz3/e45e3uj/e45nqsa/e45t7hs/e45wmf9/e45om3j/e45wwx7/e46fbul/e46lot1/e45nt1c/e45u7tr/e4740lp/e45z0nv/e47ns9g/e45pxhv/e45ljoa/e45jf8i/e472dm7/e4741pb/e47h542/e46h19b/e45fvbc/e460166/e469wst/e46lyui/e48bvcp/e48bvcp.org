As great as these chapters were, I think they could have used more descriptions of the adversarial party's appearances. The combination of fantasy/foreign names and the number of characters introduced made it difficult to remember who was who. That said, it has been nearly a month since the last group of chapters was released (and since I read them), so the problem could just be with the way I'm pacing my reading.
