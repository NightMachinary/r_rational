God this has taken like an hour to compose.

Man I must look like an idiot, I keep getting the details wrong. I could've sworn I read there were 17 billion people on Aerb. I'm digressing but this is interesting me, how'd they lose 15 billion in 500 years? I got the impression exclusion zones were relatively small, the size of a city and the surrounding area, a few thousand square kilometers maybe. Even if all 50 of them (I hope this number isn't wrong too) happened to mega metropolises like New York, that's still only half a billion and that's assuming everyone caught inside the exclusion zone is doomed and none escape.

What kind of events are happening to cause 15 billion in deaths over that time period? That's insane, I'm now wondering why the people on this planet aren't more traumatized. This universe is worse than Warhammer 40k. It'd be like more than 3 WW2's worth of deaths happening every year. That first year alone, presuming they have a birth rate even half our own of 19 per 1000, they'd have to lose 190 million people just to keep the population stable. That's mindbending, what the actual fuck is happening there?

Your point about research makes me wonder if that could be the eventual fate of all schools of magic. Tattoo magic users develop it too far, DM says OP and excludes it.

Anyway I like all your points since they all go some way to explaining away the lack of powerful individuals, but just not enough in my eyes to account for the numbers we're seeing.

Your final point on the statistics of powerful individuals is the most convincing if its right, it does balance what we're seeing with the numbers, but I'm not sure it is.

A number of counterpoints:

- I hope this isn't wrong too, but I thought no one other than Uther and Joon multiclass into multiple magic schools, everyone else just specializes in their school or build. This means you can't extrapolate the power of his enemies/companions with a straight multiplication of the odds (I'm presuming this is how you got the 1 in 5 billion number with Solace since measuring her power by saying she is the last druid left alive doesn't make sense). If Joon is 1:10bn and he is facing a velocity mage that's a massive threat, you couldn't accurately say that threat is 1:100m or 10m right?

- The measurement of power and talent also can't just be a straight multiplication of the odds, after all, you wouldn't say a proficient fighter-bone mage would be 290x more powerful than a fighter or a bone mage 290x weaker than a fighter. It'd be like judging the skill or talent of a high level sous chef by comparing the odds of him to a Olympian neurosurgeon.

- The pressures and motivations on Aerb are vastly different and combat applicable skills would be in far greater demand than here on Earth. Not many people, relatively, are needed or want to grow up to be professional athletes or soldiers. This isn't true for Aerb, there is a pressing need for combat capable people and likely much higher stats.

- If Joon is 1:10bn, and the people a tier below him are 1 standard deviation down, there'd be 500 of them roughly, 5000 roughly for 2. 5000 is around the lower end of the number I had in mind of powerful individuals, but it still sounds like enough to deal with 50 threats if they are almost as powerful as Joon, as they collectively would necessarily have near mastery in every school of magic, access to extremely high level entads and resources. This feeds into my next point.

- In terms of power on Aerb, there are diminishing returns as you go up the bell curve. The difference between 6.46 and 6.8Ïƒ is an order of magnitude, but that doesn't mean each order of magnitude translates to a 10x increase in power. Even towards the end of Uther's journey where he was arguably the most powerful individual on the planet. Falling and hitting something could kill him. If you placed Joon and his party up against 5000 people 2 sigmas below them, they'd lose, period. Joon might be able to do a few things that group couldn't do, but the worlds greatest swordsman can't beat 700 decent ones.

Two of the arguments I can think of against a group of powerful but not absolute masters not being able to face some of the exclusions that explain some of it:

- Certain magics, even at mastery level, are of no use against certain exclusions

- Absolute mastery or skill past an extremely high threshold is inherently necessary for even basic survival against certain exclusions and near mastery, regardless of quantity won't help.

Also, what do you think of Doris Finch, how would you deal with her? She seems like one of the more easier ones to deal with.
