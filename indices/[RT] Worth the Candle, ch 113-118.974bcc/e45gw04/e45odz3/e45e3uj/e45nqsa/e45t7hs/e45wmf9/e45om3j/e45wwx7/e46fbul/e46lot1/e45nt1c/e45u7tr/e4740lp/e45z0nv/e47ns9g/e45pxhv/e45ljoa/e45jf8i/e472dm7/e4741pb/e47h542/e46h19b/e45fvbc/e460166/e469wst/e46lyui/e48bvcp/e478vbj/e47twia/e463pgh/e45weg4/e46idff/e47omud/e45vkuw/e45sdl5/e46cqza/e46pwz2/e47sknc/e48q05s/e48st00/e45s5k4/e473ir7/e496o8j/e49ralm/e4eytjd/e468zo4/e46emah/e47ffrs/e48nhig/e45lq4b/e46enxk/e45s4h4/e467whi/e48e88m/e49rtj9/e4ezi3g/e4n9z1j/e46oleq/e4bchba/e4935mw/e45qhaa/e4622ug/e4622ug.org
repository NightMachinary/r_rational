I think you should try a little harder to suspend disbelief, but I agree on one point: it's getting a little weird and video-gamey how many people are willing to engage piss off someone they know is the reincarnation of Uther and his Knights even when death is on the line.

Like, after so many characters go "Meh, I could take him", you start to wonder if the narrative magic is supposed to include making people value hurting you over self-preservation or something.
