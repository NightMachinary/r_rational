I can totally see a lot of twists around Val, but I like her character so much as it is I'm choosing to just dismiss the possibility out of hand. I'll let myself worry about it if and when I'm forced to.

I kind of hope Fenn stays dead for at least a while. Having a second reincarnation so soon would be rather trivializing. But yes, I suspect she might come back eventually, it certainly seems within possibility. TBH, having her die just after we'd looked through the hells took a lot of the impact awayâ”€as long as she doesn't end up there herself, that is.
