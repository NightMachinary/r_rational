I've typed and rewritten this post a couple of times; it's a good thinking exercise.

First off I think we have to assume that most of the threats mentioned are so esoteric, throwing waves of mooks at them would be useless. In many cases, it could make the threat worse, like Manifest or the Necrotic Zone. That said, artillery probably does exist, and many of the various exclusions could probably be flattened. Delores Finch or Manifest are prime examples.

What you're saying makes sense; the hex is huge with a lot of diversity. Land that has supported 20 billion people and now has 5 billion people should have a lot of resources to throw at any problem; especially since it's relatively industrialized. Why does Aerb suck at producing high powered individuals when the potential is there? I can think of a couple answers, but I'm not super-convinced by them.

- Arthur had a completely different mode of thinking. If you read old fantasy, /The Dragon and the George/ has several examples of puzzles that a Medieval knight would find impossible to solve just because they grew up to become a Medieval knight. When they lost Arthur (and Vervain), they didn't just lose his power, they lost his ability to unconventionally solve problems and his metagaming ability. They had to do things the stupid power heavy way.

- Power comes from research, research comes from centers of learning, and centers of learning come from areas of high population. But too much power means an exclusion. It could be that every time there's a Silicon Valley of Aerb, someone invents an exclusion worthy magic. The exclusion worthy magic has probably killed most of the city, thus preventing a lot of people from reaching their full power. We know this happened to Pendelham (city of flesh), Silmar (necrotic field city), and Lankwon (capital of the Second Empire).

- Researchers can't stand on the shoulders of giants, because the DM imprisons those giants. 6 of the 13 Horrors to slay seem to be people who researched new magics.

- Almost no one else in the world actually gets to increase their primary stats.

- Investiture rules keep powerful people from getting entads that would make them Epic. And a bunch of powerful relics are wasted on rich idiots.

- We're underestimating the skill of the party /and their enemies/, and it's throwing off how we see skill distribution. During the Fallatehr section, Amaryllis described herself as fighting like a seasoned fighter of the pits; essentially a professional athlete. I did a bunch of research here, but it looks like just playing in the top tier leagues puts you at somewhere between 1:80k and 1:100k. So two adventures ago there should be something like 50,000 people that could compete with Amaryllis physically. I think it's implied that Joon is a better fighter. At the same time Joon is a better bone mage than a certified one. There are an average of 290 doctors per 100k people in OECD countries. That puts Juniper midstory at 1:34m. The math gets more complicated if you split the doctors up between bone mages and blood mages. Assuming similar proficiencies with gem and blood magic and by midstory, Joon is somewhere in the magnitude of 1 in 10 billion by the end of their third adventure. I only mention this because fighting+bone+blood+soul have synergies together. This fits with Solace having a 1 in 5 billion power.

Pallida is a Renacim fighter good enough to stay in the fight with Joon. In Vallencia's chapter she says that there are only about 20,000 Renacim in the world. If the Renacim have the normal distribution of professions (which they probably don't to be honest), and Pallida is as good as a veteran pit fighter she would be at least a 1 in 25b individual.

My point here is that, the narrative has been dealing with the high ends of the bell curve since relatively early on; and right now the characters are on the very extreme ends. (My math is real shaky here) So right now the characters are somewhere between 6 and 7 sigma; going up the bell curve means that guys the tier below tor even two tiers heir power are still pretty rare.

It's been a long time since I've taken stats, so correct me if any of this is off.
