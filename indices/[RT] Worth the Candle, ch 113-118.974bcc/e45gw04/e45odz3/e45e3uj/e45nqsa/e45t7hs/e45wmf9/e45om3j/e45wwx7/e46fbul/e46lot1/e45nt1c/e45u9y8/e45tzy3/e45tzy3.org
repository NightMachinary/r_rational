My assumption is that the hell you get reincarnated to corresponds to how evil or good you are before you die.

A highly good person like Abswifth would end up on the first or second level, while an extraordinarily evil person would end up in the 4000+.

It works on a cosmological level to encourage people to be good, and help curb the idea that "I'd go to hell anyways" by there always being an even lower hell to go to.
