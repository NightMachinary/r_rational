Thanks for your thoughts. First, there's no sarcasm attached to my use of the word incredible. It's clear Val is, socially, operating several levels beyond where anyone else in that room is. Together with your second point that's pretty much the gist of what I'm trying to say. Val sees the relationship itself as a problem, for whatever reason - that's not why Fenn and June went into the room, though. That's not what they wanted out of her "therapy." If Val wanted to, she could have done a lot more work to heal their budding rift. Instead they broke up.

Because - it appears to me - she made the unilateral decision they should break up for them. That their relationship didn't match up with her paradigm/ideal of a healthy one, plus the fact that them breaking up would lead to a better group dynamic for the Council of Arches as a whole. That's a decision that I see as incredibly paternalistic from someone specifically in that room to mediate. Someone whose own life experience when it comes to romantic relationships, by the way, can be summed up as "has read Harry Potter." I don't think that's Val's choice to make.

Like June said to the Locus, and I'm paraphrasing, "it didn't feel unhappy." Maybe you're right, and Val's right, that June and Fenn were interested for different reasons, looking for different things, and had several issues communicating. That doesn't mean their relationship isn't worth pursuing. They were still happy. And, contrary to Val, I do think they made each other better people.

Again, I'm being fully serious when I say Val's incredible in social terms. If she can so accurately predict their flaws and relationship conflicts and how things will end up, though, she should also be able to model their behaviour in the room right in front of her. I think you have to take away that Val got exactly the result she wanted out of that session. A result that both (a) diminishes Fenn and June's own agency in their own damn relationship and (b) isn't in line with what they were looking for when they sought out her help.
