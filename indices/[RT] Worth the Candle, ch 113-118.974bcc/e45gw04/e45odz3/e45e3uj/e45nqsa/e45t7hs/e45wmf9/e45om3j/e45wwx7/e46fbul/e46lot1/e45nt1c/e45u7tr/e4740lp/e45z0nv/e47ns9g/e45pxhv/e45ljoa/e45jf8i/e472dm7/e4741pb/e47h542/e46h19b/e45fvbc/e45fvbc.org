At last, my withdraw comes to an end!

Thoughts:

- I doubt that Val sabotaged joon/fenn. Infernals are ill-equipped to heal, and we have seen little evidence recently that Val wants to get with Joon -- I'm betting that she simply overestimated her abilities, or was worn down from overuse.
- Holy somkes, RIP Fenn. They still have her soul, but who wants to bet that the Locus won't be as keen to reincarnate her, if that means creating a pattern of use that constrains the locus. If that WAS permissible, then at least they can now hire someone to sit in the time chamber and play mom to Fenn
- Perhaps a quest in the future to find the exclusion zone which made it impossible to overwrite a soul in its entirety? That would be another way to bring fenn back...
- Interesting the restrictions on immortality -- however, there are a number of characters floating around who have gotten past all of that. I'd guess that the soul decays at the same rate for all characters? If so, that's a very slow rate, given the number of very old people around. If damnation in hell is eternal, then that means that decay halts in hell. Soul magic would likely prevent physical or mental decay. Perhaps skin magic, making a complete encasement around the soul (as described in Chapter 80, could wall the soul in and extend its lifespan?
- You can see another realization of this game where Joon focuses on his social skills more. In that outcome, he would have his loyalties much higher, and get wicked companion bonuses. Bethel would be more inclined to come with on trips, and the party would be more powerful together. It is rapidly becoming clear that the value of the social links between party members is very important.
- On a related note, it is likely that Joon will respond to this by investing a point or two into SOC, mitigating some of these issues. However, it's unlikely that he'll invest deeply into SOC, since that would remove most of the interpersonal conflict from the story, which is a major story thread.
- Looks like the team has a few allies now? Pallida was helpful. I hope that Joon isn't to consumed in rage to save/trust her... Their knowledge and resources could be invaluable, and may allow them to bring Fenn back more easily.
- lol @ solace "I got better." Looks like someone's watched a bit of Monty Python
