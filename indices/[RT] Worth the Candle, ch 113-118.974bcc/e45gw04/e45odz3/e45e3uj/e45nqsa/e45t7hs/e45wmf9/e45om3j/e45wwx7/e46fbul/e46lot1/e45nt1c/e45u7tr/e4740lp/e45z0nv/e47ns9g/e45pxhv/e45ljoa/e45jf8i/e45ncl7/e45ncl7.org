I thought Val was a terrible relationship counselor. She had a clear conflict of interest and didn't facilitate well at all. A lot of her arbitration was towards more escalation and she really policed the conversation in ways that just led to more conflict without resolving the extant conflict. She also kept inserting her interpretations of either of the two as the last word, which I found grating even just reading, but I hate that sort of serene psychoanalysis in real life and I think that bled over there. Val did a lot to raise and identify problems in their communication; she did very little of the actual, necessary therapeutic work identifying what steps they could take to /fix/ those problems.

I also thought she was way off base trying to impose her ideal relationship on Fenn/June with that "you don't make each other better" garbage. Yes, June may not be the same person he thinks of his ideal self as. That doesn't make who he actually is incompatible with Fenn as she is and wants to be and it doesn't mean their relationship is a net negative.

All that said, I found the breakup part very believable. The way they never really talked about the letters and their emotional ramifications has been a red flag for a while, looking in from our outside PoV. On the other hand, conservation of narrative means we don't see every minutiae of their relationship or even every "big" conversation. I just found Val's social-fu lacking: if Val possessed the otherworldly social acumen needed to make such fine-grained insights about them she should also have been able to shepherd the relationship back to more stable ground. Instead she shattered it. The lines about devils not knowing how to build, only break, and being disposed to only tear down, I just didn't find persuasive enough.

e: so I guess in conclusion you can put me in the "Val sabotaged things" camp and also that that chapter really hurt to read for someone who ships Fenn/June (even if Best Girl was becoming a bit of a weeb).
