What was with the hot dog? Did Joon pick up 100 wishes for hot dogs from the DM and I just forgot?

Chapter 114

  “Yeah, I know,” I said. “It's hard to prove, if not impossible. There is this, though.” I held out my hand. “I wish for a hot dog.”

  A hot dog appeared in my outstretched hand.

  Dehla began gesturing frantically as I took a bite. The hot dog wasn't very good, as I had known it wouldn't be. I'd used three of the hundred hot dog wishes already for testing, the first to make sure that they actually did something, and the second and third to make sure that there weren't combat applications. Grak had watched when I'd made the third wish, but hadn't seemed as surprised by the results as Dehla seemed. It was a new wavelength of magic, distinct from the signature of the entad bands, and noteworthy in that regard, but it wasn't going to upend anyone's conception of reality.
