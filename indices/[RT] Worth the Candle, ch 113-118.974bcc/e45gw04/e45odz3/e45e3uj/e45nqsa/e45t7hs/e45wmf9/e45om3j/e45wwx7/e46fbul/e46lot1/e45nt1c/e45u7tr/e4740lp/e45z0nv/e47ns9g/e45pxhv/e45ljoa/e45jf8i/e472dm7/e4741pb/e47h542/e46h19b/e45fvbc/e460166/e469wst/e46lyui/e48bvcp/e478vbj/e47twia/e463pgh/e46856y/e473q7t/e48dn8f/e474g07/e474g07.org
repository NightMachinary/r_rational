In 1e/2e it was called Girdle of Masculinity/Femininity (which I remembered wrong too)

Table 99 here

I have no idea what edition you have linked with the first one and acknowledge that in Pathfinder it was called that, but I assume that since the text is referring to D&D and indeed the early editions of D&D.

  You are just assuming the creators of the manual would have cared about the distinction between 'gender' and 'sex' that you are making here?

Well my first comment shows that I don't really think that was the case, they had separate stats for male and female characters. Women couldn't get a STR higher than 18/50 in AD&D so I doubt they have a strong consideration for the complex meanings of those words. However, Juniper sure does and I'm sure he would have a comment about it being gender not sex.
