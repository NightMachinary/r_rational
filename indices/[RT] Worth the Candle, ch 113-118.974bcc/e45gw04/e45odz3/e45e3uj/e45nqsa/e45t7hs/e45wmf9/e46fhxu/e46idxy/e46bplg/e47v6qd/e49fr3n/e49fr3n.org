I think the limitations of Fenn's luck were explored some when discussing their Arches setting, where Joon used cards instead of dice, partly due to a time-constraint on how forward-looking Fenn's luck could be. But, I really like your theory and don't think we know quite enoigh details on Luck's mecahnics to be sure. (If not, then I suppose it's possible that Fenn's extreme Luck reaction was literary rather than literal forshadowing.)
