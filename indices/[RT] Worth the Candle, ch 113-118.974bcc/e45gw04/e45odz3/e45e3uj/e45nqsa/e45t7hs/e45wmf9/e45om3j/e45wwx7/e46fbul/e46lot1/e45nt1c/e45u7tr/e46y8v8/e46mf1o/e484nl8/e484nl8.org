The problem with this logic is that all professions, mages especially seem to have quadratic power and versatility. When you lose people at the top in this universe, you are losing irreplaceable contributions to art, science, education, and the military. 50 decent tattoo mages together could make an awful lot of fireballs, which would make them a great fighting force, but it's possible that none of them could make a blast that literally ages you. Vervain dying likely meant that thousands of new breeds of flowers never grew. Diseases might go uncured, etc.

Similarly, throwing thousands at certain threats might be meaningless.
