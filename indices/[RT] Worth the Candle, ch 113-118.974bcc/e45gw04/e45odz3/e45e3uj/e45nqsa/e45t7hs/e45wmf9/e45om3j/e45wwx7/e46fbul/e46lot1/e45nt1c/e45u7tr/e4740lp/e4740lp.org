I don't think Valencia deliberately sabotaged the counseling, but I'm inclined to think that devils don't see the value in flawed, imperfect, but still trying relationships - which are all we have. What they do see are the weak points they can target.

I think it might have worked much better if Val had simply watched while the two of them talked things over, then gave them advice individually and privately.
