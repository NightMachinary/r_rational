That isn't what I understood you to be saying; you claimed there would be "far more" people of half the skill, not ~2.6x, and that there would be a significant number of people "almost as good". I do agree more with the prior that lower-skilled individuals make a majority of the overall skill pool in summation, and that it is odd the government isn't mobilising forces more globally.
