  I copied Fenn's body into it, the same process that I'd done when grafting the ribs, the same process that Fallatehr had used to make a mimic of Amaryllis. The soul's image of the body was dependent on the body; the scars on Fenn's arms were there on the soul because they'd had a chance to set, and any injury could be written onto the soul as the soul adapted to the reality of living with that wound. This soul would never have a body, and the image of Fenn's body that I'd written over would never change either.
