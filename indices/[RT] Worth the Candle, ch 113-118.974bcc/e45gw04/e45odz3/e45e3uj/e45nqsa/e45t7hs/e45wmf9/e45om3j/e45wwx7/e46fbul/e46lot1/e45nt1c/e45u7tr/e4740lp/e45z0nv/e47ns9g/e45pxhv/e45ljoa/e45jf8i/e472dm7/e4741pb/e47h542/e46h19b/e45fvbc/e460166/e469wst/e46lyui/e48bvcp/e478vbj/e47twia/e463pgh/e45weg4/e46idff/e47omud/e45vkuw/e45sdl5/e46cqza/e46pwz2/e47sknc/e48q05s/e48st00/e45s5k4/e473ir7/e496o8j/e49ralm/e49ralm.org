Feels like this is a major turning point for Joon. Now he's confronted with the death of another person important to him, except this time he can do something concrete about it. His hand is being forced for good or ill. But what's the lesson here...? What's the moral at the end?

If he succeeds, it distorts his coping mechanism for the death of loved ones. Does he truly intend to play Aerb's over-god and create utopia at the end of this road?

If he succeeds at a price, it's just more depression fuel of the world he created where "evil couldn't be undone...and the world would never be set right." But maybe the takeaway is that we live in an imperfect world and we can only ever try our best.

If he fails, he's going to have to seriously relearn how to cope. And like others joke about Val, he hopefully has an effective grief counselor. On the /bright/ side, the game won't be skewing his acceptance of the finality of death.

Regardless, I'm awfully sad. Like for others, Fenn was my favorite character and the primary breath of life in their dour party. O One True God of Aerb, master of not just the physical layer, or the game layer above that, but of the reality both are embedded in ... I know it's naive and selfish, but please don't let her stay dead. Amen.
