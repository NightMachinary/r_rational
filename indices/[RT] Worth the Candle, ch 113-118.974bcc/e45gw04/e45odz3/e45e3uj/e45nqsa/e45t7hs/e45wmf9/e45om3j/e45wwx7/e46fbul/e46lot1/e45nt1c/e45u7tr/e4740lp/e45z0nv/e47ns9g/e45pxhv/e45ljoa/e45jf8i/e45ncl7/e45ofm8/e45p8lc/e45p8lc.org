Why blame Val for Fenn's choice? If you think Fenn should have stayed with Joon, wasn't that Fenn's fault? I was impressed because I thought she did a good job analyzing the problems in their relationship. Complaining that she didn't magically solve their problems in a single conversation on top of that seems like expecting too much.
