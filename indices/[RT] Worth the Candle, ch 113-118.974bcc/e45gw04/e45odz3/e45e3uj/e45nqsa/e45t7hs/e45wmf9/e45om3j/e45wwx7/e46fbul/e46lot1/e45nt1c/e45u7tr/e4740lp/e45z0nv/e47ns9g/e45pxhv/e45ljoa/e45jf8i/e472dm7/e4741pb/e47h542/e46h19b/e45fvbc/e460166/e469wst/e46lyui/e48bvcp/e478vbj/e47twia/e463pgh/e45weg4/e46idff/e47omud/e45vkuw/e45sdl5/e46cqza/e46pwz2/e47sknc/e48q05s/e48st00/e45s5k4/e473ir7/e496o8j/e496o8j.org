I'm relatively new to this serial, and this is the first update that's come out since I caught up. How often do new chapters go up, on average? This is one hell of a note to be left hanging on.

I honestly wasn't sure whether the dysfunction of the Juniper/Fenn relationship was bad writing or a deliberate attempt to write an unhealthy couple dynamic. I'm glad to see it's the latter, even if I do think Val overstated how unfixable it was.
