  “I wish for more wishes,” I said.

  “*Okay, I'll give you one hundred more wishes, but they can only be used to wish for a standard-issue school cafeteria hot dog*,” he said with a smile. “Rookie mistake there, I thought you were better than this. And anyway, I'm not giving you those kinds of wishes. Little things, not plot breakers.”
