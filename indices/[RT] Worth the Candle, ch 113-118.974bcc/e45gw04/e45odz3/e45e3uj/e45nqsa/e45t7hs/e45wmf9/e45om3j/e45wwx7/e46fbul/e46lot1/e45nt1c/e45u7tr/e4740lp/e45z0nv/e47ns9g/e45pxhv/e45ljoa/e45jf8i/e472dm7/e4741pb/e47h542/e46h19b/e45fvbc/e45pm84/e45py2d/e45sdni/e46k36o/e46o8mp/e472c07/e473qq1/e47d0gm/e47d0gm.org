  I'm going to be pedantic and address this point anyway, if Joon and Mary can live with some occasional soul touch up then this doesn't really matter.

Lets say he could copy over the mental parts of Fenn. I'll admit that would work for the short term. But people change over time. Joon would have to either keep her eternally the same, or decide what minute alterations to make.

Even if he had the stomach for that level of soulfuckery, which he definitely does not, I don't think he has that capability. How do you decide how each experience changes a person?
