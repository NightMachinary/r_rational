"Uther killed my wife a thousand years ago" is not a good reason to betray and murder an entire roomful of people, some of whom you have worked with for most of those thousand years. EVEN ASSUMING that he did it on purpose.

I, too, am generally enjoying the story, but I, too, am sort of irritated that the party keeps betraying and/or murdering what seems like every single new character that comes up.
