  The easiest way for the party would probably be creating a soul virus. Assuming that she uses soul magic somehow, alter two of her so that the alteration would make her value the mission of exterminating non-altered Doris Finch, and hate herself in general. As part of her programming, she would reinforce her own programming before it could fade. Once all the non-altered ones are dead, the remainder have a kool aid party. You wouldn't even have to alter that many values to do it.

Heh, this is pretty devious. Would Doris have a single soul that was connected for all her copies or does each copy have it's own soul? If it's the former, that's an easy win.

How would you deal with Manifest, Door into the Soul, Unwavering and Better with Loops? I only mention those because the rest are too vague to properly gauge the difficulty of. Though Z-Word, Everything Eater, and Fleshsmith all sound like straight up regular fights against tough bosses, the abstract ones like REDACTED and Loops seem the toughest to me.

Caldwell sounds like a dude with an incredible first strike ability but just a regular guy, deal with at a distance. Unwavering might be done with a soul value changes.

Btw, Fel Seed is being hyped as the BBEG and Joon said the magic surrounding him was quite degenerate, but I wonder how bad it could be. He kinda just sounds like a super rapist, what powers would that entail and why would it be impossible to kill him? Does he get reincarnated inside one of his brides spawn or does he enter the person that kills him?
