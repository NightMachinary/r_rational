  Juniper is selfish, but doesn't want to think of himself as a selfish person

Is he? He strikes me more as apathetic, without any coherent long term personal goal he is pursuing (it used to be the accumulation of power, but that stopped after he soul edited himself). It looks like he seems to be mostly following short term pressures to avoid bad events, for example their current quest line got started because they were worried about the dream skewered accidentally saying 'Shia LaBeouf'. Before that they needed the time chamber to get Solace back faster in order to save the locus, before that they needed to a soul mage to save Juniper who burnt through his own bones, before that they needed a cure for rat rot for Amaryllis, before that they needed to save Amaryllis from a gold mage, before that it was acquire Amaryllis's artefacts (which is the last time the parties main activities have been directed at a coherent long term goal).

To me it looks like Juniper will go to extraordinary lengths to protect his friends but not do much to advance their, or his, position.
