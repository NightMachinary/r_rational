Crackpot theory time: Val killed Fenn

#+begin_quote
  Valencia swooped forward and took the crown from Solace's head, then placed it firmly on Amaryllis', standing back slightly and giving every appearance of counting to herself. I couldn't see her face, but she was radiating tension. After a few moments of the crown of thorns being in place, she took it from Amaryllis' head and placed it on Grak's. *Valencia glanced at Fenn, just for a moment, then back to Grak.*

Devil-inhabitted-Val certainly sees something in that glance, and I think we can assume that she either knows at that point that Fenn is dead, or that Fenn isn't going to make it, and goes on treating Grak.

Did Val, who could read "Blue Fields nuke", really fail to predict that their enemies would split so lopsidedly, and, explicitly when mentioning scenarios, fail to see that one half would be willing to turn on and kill the other half right there?

It is conceivable that +the Simurgh+ Val arranged the breakup between Joon and Fenn in such a way that Joon would triage Fenn to last priority, and kept Bethel away so that the group would be at a disadvantage which could be directed to her own ends on the battlefield.
