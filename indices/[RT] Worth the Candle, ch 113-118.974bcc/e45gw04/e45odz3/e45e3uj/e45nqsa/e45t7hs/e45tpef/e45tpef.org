That's giving Val a bit too much credit.

I could see if she helped arrange the breakup so that she could swoop in as the rebound. I could see if she gave less attention to Fenn in the heat of combat because she doesn't like her so much.

But it's way too much to think that she planned out her death via getting her opponents to do it 24 hours in advance. It's just way too chaotic in a fight for her to try and rely on that.
