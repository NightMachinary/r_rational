...Or too little credit :)

What exactly did Valencia see to know something was up? She seems to just blurt the warning out. Once she identifies it's poison, why does she only pass her crown to Juniper? During the group's preparations, why is she intent on downplaying the need to prepare for an attack?

Hmm... A poison that corrodes the soul... Sort of seems like the kind of thing Fallahtehr would've been interested in. O'kald probably just had some laying around though... Hey Valencia sure is being helpful, grabbing Amaryllis and handing her off to Juniper... Without going back to pick up Fenn...?

Oh.

  “For years,” Valencia said, “For years,” she said again, between breaths. “I was theirs for /years/ and I don't, I can't.” Tears were streaming down her face.

Maybe eating a thousand demons is a bad idea?

From Chapter 102:

  Even with a lesser devil like this one, it was sometimes hard to find herself in the mix. The devil was dead, taken apart into component pieces, but those pieces were a part of her, augmenting her thoughts and, to some extent, feelings. She had been working hard, with Mary's help, both to become more of herself, so there was less for the devils to overwhelm, and to keep from reaching into that well of understanding just because it was there. She tried to think about the devils as voices, independent characters, but that wasn't really true. They were dead, and she was simply using their skills or knowledge. It was easier to think of them as separate, so that she could say it was a demon telling her how to kill everyone in the room, rather than her own thought that she wouldn't have had without the demon in her.
