I mean, I would still call it murder if the only action Val took was to keep the helm on Grak when she knew Fenn needed it to live.

But I /do/ think she may have enough battlefield control to, e.g., keep Joon alive, maybe offer support elsewhere, and give Fenn none. They were overmatched - it wouldn't take much for any of them to have died there, and Val can easily tip the balance - or choose not to.
