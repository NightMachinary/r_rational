Hmm, I'm feeling something...

Val ate over a thousand devils, I think she overloaded, and is now thinking like a devil.

The devils orchestrated the breakup & then chose for Fenn to die.

Joon would now be second guessing himself, did he leave Fenn for last because of the breakup? Did he cause Fenn to die?
