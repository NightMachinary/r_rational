  Jun's poison-treatment triage leaving Fenn for last
#+end_quote

In fairness to Juniper's triage prioritization, after treating Solace, their healer, he seemed to have worked on each of them based in large part on the order in which they succumbed to the poison. Fenn was the last one standing and fighting, so in combination with her luck, Juniper probably guessed that she had been the least-affected, and thus was in the least danger.

In hindsight, this had already resulted in Fenn being the last one carried out of the danger zone, giving her potentially greater exposure, and Juniper did not take a moment to reconsider that.

But yes, leaving Fenn for last in both the evacuation and the treatment does seem to contrast with her views.
