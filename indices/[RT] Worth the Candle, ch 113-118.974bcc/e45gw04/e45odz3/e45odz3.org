These chapters hit pretty hard, and were pretty sad. I was especially struck by Valencia's comment that Fenn was the only party member - Jun included - who wouldn't be able to bring herself to kill Jun even to save the world, and how that contrasted with Jun's poison-treatment triage leaving Fenn for last.

Kind of a depressing end for the woman who apparently valued Jun's life more than Jun himself did.
