  I thought the break up scene was beautifully done; i was left with this kind of aching sense of loss. For me personally the death scene following right on top of that the chapter after didn't give me enough breathing room and meant Fenn's passing didn't hit as hard as perhaps i would have liked. I'm curious if others felt similarly because i predict i may have just been an outlier here.

I really appreciated the breakup scene, too -- though I don't think I got hit with the sense of loss just then. I remember fixating on Fenn pouring her heart out, then inner monologue "I have so much I want to say... *I stayed silent.*" And my main emotional reaction to that was just frustration with Joon. I figured it'd play out and get resolved, comfortably, and probably soon.

At the end of 118, that feeling of loss you mention - it caught up with me pretty hard.
