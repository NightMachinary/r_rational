Some thoughts:

- Fenn was my favourite character for the majority of the story and i'm terribly sad to see her go but, presuming she actually remains dead (at least for a reasonable portion of the story), i'm happy AW is willing to kill off major characters. I personally love the tension added to a story when there's a genuine risk of character death.

- I thought the break up scene was beautifully done; i was left with this kind of aching sense of loss. For me personally the death scene following right on top of that the chapter after didn't give me enough breathing room and meant Fenn's passing didn't hit as hard as perhaps i would have liked. I'm curious if others felt similarly because i predict i may have just been an outlier here.

- I guess we're going to get an opportunity to see how Joon's developed as a person as we compare how he deals with the loss of Fenn versus how he handled Arthur's death. I wonder if he'll confront Bethel, seeing as her presence would have made Fenn's death less likely.

- Fenn's death occuring immediately post-break up is no doubt going to give Amaryliss plenty of narrative theory thoughts to chew on.

- Joon leveling up has just gotten a lot more dangerous. If he levels up post combat and amaryliss is incapacitated then he's in trouble.

- Loved Valenica's mindgames with the fake breakdown; Devil & Demon Valencia is one of my very favourite parts of this story. I have a massive soft spot for Valencia the character too; the kind of naked vulnerability she showed when Joon was doubting her is very endearing. It's not hard for me to see how she's 'Joonbait'.

- There's a lot of appreciation on this subreddit for when a story goes the extra yard to make the worldbuilding or the plot especially real and true to life, and this story does that, but one of the ways it sets itself apart is how it puts this same attention to detail in making the characters real. One extremely innocuous example from the latest chapters: Fenn saying she may need to leave the group for a while, putting some physical space between her and Juniper, after therapy has broken down and the break up's in progress. The next day Joon narrates in passing that it looks like she decided to stay. This kind of small detail makes everything so /real/ to me. Like, most other stories would never have Fenn mention something like that to begin with unless it was set up for her /actually/ leaving, yet that sequence of events is exactly the sort of thing someone might do during a break up - either overreact in the moment or really try to hammer in to the other person how you feel, wielding this big emotive club saying 'yes, i feel strongly enough about this to do /that/', but come the next day not actually follow through or even have ever been particularly likely to. The story is littered with details like this and in the same way that digressions about dragons effecting the commercial airline market make the /world feel real/ it's these little character moments that make the /people feel real/.
