Joon had good reasons for pulling her out of the building last. He went for Solace first as she's the healer and Grak was right next to her so he took both out of the fort together. When he went back in he was confronted straight away with Valencia struggling to drag Amaryliss out - presumably from context she was kinda close to being rescued, so he helped Valencia drag Amaryliss out. I thought the sequence of events was all very natural and understandable. The later decision to attempt to heal Fenn last (and the fact Valencia casts a look at Fenn on the ground before leaving the helmet on Grak) is more open to question imo.
