  Joon. You tried to save Fenn last. I think that sums up your actual thoughts on her.

I don't think it's necessarily as meaningful as that. He was going to have to save /somebody/ last, one way or another. Should he have made a conscious decision to save Grak last, just in order for the last one to not be Fenn?

I agree that it's a /suspicious/ coincidence that Fenn died right after the break-up, but I see at least three possible culprits: Juniper (as per your argument), Valencia (either recognizing that Fenn is doomed and subtly manipulating Juniper to save Grak instead, or (less plausibly) orchestrating the entire thing as per [[/u/NoYouTryAnother][u/NoYouTryAnother]]'s theory), and the narrative.

*Edit:* On second thoughts, he also dragged her out of the building last. Which is possibly why she died sooner than everyone else. Hm.
