Regardless of whether or not Val sabotaged the therapy, wow she got thrust into such a shitty position there. She has to accomplish something part of her doesn't want to do, while knowing she's unlikely to succeed and that everyone will distrust her more if she fails.

Good group dynamics are important (and hindsight is 20/20) but really they should have just let this one ride until they could get a therapist without all of these conflicts of interest.
