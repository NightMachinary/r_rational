  As a glimpse into Val's thoughts, this shows both that Fenn/June comes second to group cohesion in terms of her priorities and also that Val is capable of incredible leaps of logic.

Remember that Val has the equivalent of thousands of years of experience, here, so I don't know that the leaps of logic were 'incredible.'

  I didn't expect the therapy conversation to magically fix all their problems. I did expect that Val, capable of determining that the relationship "wouldn't be salvageable" (is she a precog, now?), would also be capable of guiding the conversation in such a way as to have Fenn and June leave aware of their problems and working to bridge those "disconnects" having slightly "kissed and made up." Instead they left with their relationship over.

Wait, if the problem is "they're in a relationship," then isn't it the case that the therapy conversation magically solved all of their problems? I think she was basically right about what interested Juniper about Fenn, and how that conflicted with what interested Fenn about Juniper. I think the version where Juniper sees Fenn as an equal and a resource, rather than 'the fun one,' and they're able to establish an equal partnership, happens because Juniper and Fenn stop dating for a while and he treats her like a coworker and then they later resume dating, if it makes sense for both of them.
