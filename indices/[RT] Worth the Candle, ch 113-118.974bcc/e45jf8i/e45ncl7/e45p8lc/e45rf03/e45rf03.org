Fair warning, this is probably not worth the read. I'm in paper-writing mode and it's really showing, I think, but anything to avoid thinking about my deadlines for a bit.

I do think Fenn and June could have made it work. I also agree that ultimately it was Fenn's choice. I blame Val for her stage-setting and for the way she framed their relationship as an overall bad thing and not only unworkable but not worth working /at./

Unlike teaching, when it comes to real behavioural change I don't believe the Socratic method is effective. It's not enough for the therapist to lead the patient around in circles with insightful questions; especially not when it's couples counselling. Behavioural therapy has to take steps towards modifying that behaviour. Fenn and June weren't in that room to talk about their feelings and their deep-seated Oedipal complexes; they needed direction just as a much as they needed to be heard by each other.

The first step in achieving any goal is figuring out what that goal is. The first step in problem in problem solving is, perhaps not surprisingly, quite similar: identifying its specifics. Val did this really well, such as when it came to things like Fenn and June's systems of thinking and how they communicated.

However, it's not enough just to raise a problem as a therapist. Val consistently did two things that really bothered me. One, she really did very little to offer /positive/ feedback. Val picked out a bunch of June and Fenn's problems, but she didn't do much prescriptive work in terms of what they could do to improve, marginalize, or diminish those problems. Second, she had a pessimistic outlook on the relationship and I think it really coloured the way she led the discussion. Take this passage, for example:

  “It's deeper than that,” said Valencia. “There are disconnects between the two of you, both in terms of who you are, who you think you are, and who you think the other is. Those are the things that we need to very delicately reconcile.”

  “Very delicately ... because otherwise we'd fall out of love?” asked Fenn.

  “One or the other would, yes, or neither would, but the relationship wouldn't be salvageable,” said Valencia. “This is the reason I thought it would probably take a few hours of discussion. It would be better to resolve things over the course of weeks or months, a little bit at a time, but the problems between the two of you are already interfering with our ability to function as a group.”

As a glimpse into Val's thoughts, this shows both that Fenn/June comes second to group cohesion in terms of her priorities and also that Val is capable of incredible leaps of logic. Also, and most importantly, she appears to believe that June and Fenn are fundamentally incompatible. I don't think it's a huge stretch to say she walked into that room poisoned against the very idea of Fenn/June.

I didn't expect the therapy conversation to magically fix all their problems. I did expect that Val, capable of determining that the relationship "wouldn't be salvageable" (is she a precog, now?), would also be capable of guiding the conversation in such a way as to have Fenn and June leave aware of their problems and working to bridge those "disconnects" having slightly "kissed and made up." Instead they left with their relationship over.

Maybe it's just my inability to appreciate how fundamentally capital-E Evil inhabitants of the hells are and the strange way their social skills skew away from doing anything positive. But they're also capable of perfectly modelling good behaviour and are perfect actors; it seems odd to me that Val doesn't have the toolkit, even if it's a warped, abstracted idea of it, to guide and frame the discussion in a way that would have had Fenn and June walking out tentatively reconciled, aware of their problems, and working to fix them.

What's more likely - that the uber-competent devil-channeling Val failed, or that she got exactly the outcome she was looking for? My view is that in a lot of ways, Val made the choice for Fenn and June, here, that they weren't going to work out and jumped ahead to that outcome. Fenn came in thinking it was "just a fight" and June had similar thoughts. They left broken up. Is the same Val, who can model a traumatic breakdown and how it will cause schisms in a group she hardly knows, simply not able to treat people she's intimately acquainted with with kid gloves? Draw your own conclusions, I suppose.
