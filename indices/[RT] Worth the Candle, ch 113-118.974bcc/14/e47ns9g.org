  “You arguably both broke democracy,” said Valencia. Her voice was calm and understanding. I sort of hated the level of control she had. “One of the primary pillars supporting group unity has been kicked out from under us, and there's nothing to replace it. Amaryllis agreed that any self-modification would be mediated by the group, and you've set a precedent that the will of the group and established order could both be bucked at a moment's notice. Grak was already only hanging on by a thread, and without group unity, he's likely to go through with leaving us once we have the money he thinks he needs.”

  “There's nothing left of Darili Irid,” I said. “I talked to him about it, in private. Where's he going to go?”

  “That's not for me to say,” said Valencia. She turned away from me. “I've already collected too many secrets, most of them on accident, and it's not my place to reveal them all.”

If Grak leaves the group after he gets the money he plans on killing himself.
