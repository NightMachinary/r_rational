Well, 116 fucking gutted me.

At this point it's been a few hours and I still haven't read the last couple chapters. Spoiled myself enough to know Fenn dies, which... doesn't really surprise me. I do think it's interesting that I'm viewing what happens next through a very narrative lens while there's so much debate in the story itself as to what influence narrative has on the world itself.
