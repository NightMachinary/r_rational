The thing is, I don't think Uther ever did have army destroying levels of power. Uther's enemies were DND campaign type enemies. Powerful entities that could be defeated by a small band of heroes.

My point was, getting more powerful can only do so much. You might be able to beat a dozen opponents, but not a hundred or even 50 if those enemies are even averagely powerful and working together. The progression of power in the setting isn't exponential or such that one guy can overpower hundreds of average level people in the same skill.
