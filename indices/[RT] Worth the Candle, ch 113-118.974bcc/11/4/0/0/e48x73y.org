That might be true for physical skills but it isn't necessarily true for magical ones.

An extremely powerful mage could have defenses that are both cheap and practically impossible to break without magic approaching a similar level of skill.

Such a mage could (even if it took a long while) defeat entire armies given the defense is cheap enough.

edit: and (unless I remember wrongly) we do have indications that truly ridiculous levels of skill are possible to reach. Joon's (used) skills are mostly in the 20s, but his skill level (in a given skill) has been described as "above average in the field" numerous times. Given that skills range all the way up to 100, I would be surprised if there are more than a few, if any, practitioners in most/all fields of magic that would have (equivalent) values above 70-80. Let alone such values in multiple skills, which might have synergistic effects.
