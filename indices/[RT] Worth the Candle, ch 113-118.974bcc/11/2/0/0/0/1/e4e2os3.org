  For extreme talent like Fallatehr to exist and to not have anyone appreciably near them in skill would mean the bell curve must be heavily skewed towards the middle with Fal and pals being extreme statistical anomalies, and that makes no sense to me. For talent to be this unique, it tells me there must be some kind of meta that arbitrarily limits the number of powerful people for narrative reasons.

Bad example. Soul mages were specifically hunted down, and soul magery was outlawed. Therefore, if any other soul mages of similar tier existed, /they would hide their existence/. In fact, since magic exists to /test/ for their abilities, they might want to fake their deaths to stop (well, reduce) people from looking for them!

A more convenient explanation would be Fallatehr's prison, which makes him unique because the /entad/ is unique - it traps him (and therefore likely stops him from faking his death+disappearing), but also protects him and makes faking his death unnecessary. Thus, he's the "only" amazing soul mage alive.

  This model is probably fundamentally wrong somehow, but I feel like the people of Aerb should have these threats in the bag. Half a dozen world ending threats have been mentioned, but even if there were a hundred, with 17 billion people working the problem, I can't see how they lose when considering the talent they should have.

"World-ending problems" are, by definition, problems that specifically can't be feasibly solved. That is not the same category as "major problems". Maybe there /are/ more top-tier mages, they're just tied up in major-but-brute-forcable problems.

  I don't understand the blaise nature of governments when there's literally only 2 years left in the library. It's like their all just waiting for someone else to fix their problems.
