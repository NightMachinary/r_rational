  Heh, this is pretty devious. Would Doris have a single soul that was connected for all her copies or does each copy have it's own soul? If it's the former, that's an easy win.

I assumed multiple souls for Doris because the different ones can't get along and have different magical powers. However, because they can't get along, they would probably be shit at facing a unified threat.

Better with loops = teleport, snag with glove and kill him inside the separate dimensional space with a team B to do extraction if one side gets caught; but by that time I would bet Joon will have revision magic. Soul poison would also do it, or sucking his bones out, or having Valencia suck his soul out.

Manifest you could use a magic artifact that refreshes your souls and can't be taken off; Joon might be able to make non-Entad artifacts. Or just send Valencia and Bethel; neither of which have souls to be affected. Really I think getting / building cruise missiles could solve a lot of these problems. Unwavering would be much the same; with the added problem that the loyalty the Goblin is inspiring is the same as Juniper's loyalty.

Redacted sounds like the hardest to me, it sounds like blanket destruction would be your best bet. This would probably need some ridiculous epic level magic; or an industrial state carpet bombing.

Door into the Soul sounds like they need some sort of stealth, invisibility, or flattery. Then a quick stab would do it.

I don't know about Fel Seed, but my guess is that he's Arthur; that's just mine and most people would disagree.
