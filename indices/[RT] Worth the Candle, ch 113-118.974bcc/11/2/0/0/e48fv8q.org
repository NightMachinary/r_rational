Sorry I was unclear. A couple points:

- Everett was one of Uther's Knights, this is mentioned a couple places.

- Furthermore, Everett discovered a form of immortality with some limits; if he wasn't exceptional there would be an increasing number of skin mages using it. Hell, a lot of people would become skin mages if there's a chance at immortality. 17k people a generation over 20 generations would mean that there would be 340k immortal skin wizards; far more if you count the fact that population is slowly declining and used to be 20 billion. It's improbable that they could keep a secret that big.

Fallatehr studied the soul for centuries, and only made it up to 180 skill. Dwarves and Humans are at least 2/5ths, probably more, of the total population. Members of the shorter lived races wouldn't have the opportunity, and Fenn said most elves would make shit scientists. Juniper is a mage of "some skill" at a paltry 24. Fenn was the best Archer in a major city with a handicap at around 50 (I believe).

I think a reasonable conclusion is that gaining power isn't very easy for NPCs on Aerb. If that's true, than 1 in a million is probably too low a guess on their relative rarity. 1 in 100 million might be closer, in which case you're talking about a relatively close knit community of several hundred to a few thousand. Deaths would be felt intensely.

- If top tier talent is very rare, then you lose a couple things. You lose training, combine that with a declining population, and the bench of top tier talent is probably much more shallow than when Arthur left for good. With population decline, major events, and exclusions, they've proabably lost more than 1/4 of their pool.

- Additionally, you lose an economic incentive to research top tier magic. Making a cheap password locked tattoo and selling the plans would probably make more money than researching a Gem magic spell that had 100 times more dense particles but required 10 times the mental fortitude. However, the dense beams would make it easier to understand particle physics.

- Militarily there might be threats that are too esoteric to defeat with thousands of mooks or even an army of low level wizards. An army of creatures made entirely of energy; fifth dimensional invaders; the soul magic version of grey goo; creatures made out of the void; wizards that could summon antimatter.... Only the first and the last could be countered with an army of low level wizards (including revision mages), and the last it would be a roll of the dice.
