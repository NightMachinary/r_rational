Holy fuck, that got intense. Moreover, if this took more than five minutes, Fenn is in one of the hells (assuming the soul poison wasn't deep enough to destroy her soul entirely). Come to think of it, I'm rather unclear as to how the hells work. We know there are different hells, with the higher numbers being deeper and worse. But what determines which hell you go to? My prior assumption had been that you start off at the first hell, and every time you die you go a level lower, but that doesn't seem to be the case, looking at the details in these chapters regarding the hells.

Regardless, given that Joon just saw recently how bad the hells really were through the infernoscope, it seems quite likely that Fenn's presence in the hells will be discussed. I can't see Joon leaving his ex girlfriend trapped in the hells. Valencia can make her time there more bearable, but not by that much. Joon's quest to destroy the hells may become quite a bit more urgent. Killing literally all of the demons and devils would be a start, but I'm not sure Valencia is up to that yet. If we've been told how many there are, I don't remember it, but it's got to be in the billions at least. A way to enter and leave hell would be an important step, but I'm not clear enough on the metaphysics of Aerb to even speculate as to whether that's possible.

Well, I'll speculate a little. Valencia could act as a gateway between world, potentially. If her tendrils can grab onto the souls of non-infernals, she could pull them up. And we know she can avoid chewing them up, since she did so with the Locus. But the locus entered willingly, and the only evidence we have that she might be able to grab human souls is that one ability she has.
