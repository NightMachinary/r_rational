I'm not saying anything about it being RIGHT. But every single person would believe they personally were good enough to get into a light hell, because people aren't rational. Few people think of themselves as evil.

Look at real life Christianity for an example: Not a lot of christians think they personally are going to hell. Everyone else, sure, but them? No.
