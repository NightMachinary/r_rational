I think you're probably right.

A couple of chapterdumps ago I posted about the degree to which Juniper has been neglecting Grak. The next update included Joon making a more serious effort to connect with Grak, /but/...

I guess I'll back up and say first, I have to agree with the Val-did-this camp as far as the breakup and Fenn's death.

  I need to learn and grow on my own,” said Val. “And it's too easy to talk when there's a devil to draw on.” “Too easy?” I asked. “Too easy and too hard,” said Val. She flopped backward on the bed and stared up at the ceiling. “It's easy to see the things that I could say to get my way, there are memories that I can reach to when I don't know something, but the devils ...” She waved her hands helplessly in the air above her, which might have been a funny visual if she didn't seem so distraught.

  “I would share you with Fenn, or be your secret,” said Val. She stopped, with confusion crossing her face. “No, that's --” She looked at me. “I'm relying on the devil too much, letting it guide my path, that would have worked, but it's not me. Amaryllis explained the, the biology, I know how, it just seems so gross.” She dropped her pose and looked at her hands. She looked up at me. “This is what I think I was trying to say.”

Val loves Juniper. Val wants Juniper. Val wants Juniper to be happy. Val -- who in many ways is still a child-- knows for a fact, via devil juju, that she could use her talents make Juniper happier than Fenn /ever/ could. The closest thing to an ethics class she ever had was reading /Harry Potter./

I think Val did it, but I don't think Val is at fault. She is at the mercy of forces she cannot understand or control, and has been failed badly by the authority figures in her life.

So, about Grak. These chapters made me realize that Juniper has been doing the same thing to the rest of the party, too. Only Amaryllis' quests have been prioritized, ostensibly because gathering the resources and power of Uther's bloodline should make the rest more doable, but... what has he really tried?

Solace was polite about the fact that Juniper has been ignoring the Locus. Joon even feels kinda bad about it. But the reason he went to hang out with the Locus was the breakup.

Juniper is selfish, but doesn't want to think of himself as a selfish person. Maybe Fenn's death will help him realize that he could have been pursuing her side quests, /helping/ her the way she has helped him from day 1 instead of just accepting the assumption that he's the most important person in the universe. I don't know if that can happen as long as Val is nearby and continues to have the same values.

If Val is going to make a play to wrest control of the party from Amaryllis, Grak's life may be in imminent danger.
