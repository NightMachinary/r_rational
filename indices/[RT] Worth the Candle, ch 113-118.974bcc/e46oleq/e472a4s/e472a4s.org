They explicitly considered Prince's Invulnerability, but it only gives you six seconds of protection, it's not clear it would have helped against the soul poison, and Joon decided the equivalent of "they're less likely to attack us if we think they're less likely to attack us." Which isn't the idiot ball--I think this was true with Masters, for example.
