I'm the kind of reader who tends to enjoy the lore/worldbuilding a lot more than the interpersonal stuff, so it was a little jarring to get mostly character drama, when I was expecting to get more Uther stuff and/or world details. That said, it was interesting to see the Official Couple actually talk through their issues, even if it may have ultimately been detrimental to the relationship.

I bet Blue Fields is super heavily irradiated.
