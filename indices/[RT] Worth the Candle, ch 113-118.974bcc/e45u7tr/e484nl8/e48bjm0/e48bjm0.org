People like Vervain and the rest of Uther's knights were probably unique in the same way Uther was since they gained power proportional to him. But guys like Everett? He isn't one of a kind. He could be a fantastically intelligent and talented individual, but those kinds of people are commonplace enough even in our world. Even if he were the 1 in a million type, there'd be 17,000 others like him.

Skill, intelligence and talent can't be as irreplaceable as your making it out to be, it doesn't make sense for it to be that unique a commodity.

Do you mean that because certain threats aren't threats that can be physically confronted with an army? Like a guy in a room? Or do you mean meaningless because the loss of so much high level talent would make it Pyrrhic?
