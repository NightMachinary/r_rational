I wasn't using Fal as an example of a soul mage, I was using him as an example of power/talent tier. There should be people as powerful and talented as him, but not necessarily specializing in the same thing as him.

There /have/ been world ending problems before, and they were solved, even after Uther left. Conventional power can confront these problems and defeat them. It's just difficult and costly, but not so much so ordinary people can't do it.

What?
