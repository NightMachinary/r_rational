I don't understand the blaise nature of governments when there's literally only 2 years left in the library. It's like their all just waiting for someone else to fix their problems.

zeroing out the co2 emissions of a country is relatively straightforward if you are a government willing to be dirigiste about it - A ten, fifteen year sprint of reactor construction, no taxes on electric cars, and taxes on gas (including natural gas for industry) that escalate on a formula each year, and there you go, global warming done, with no unreasonable hardship for your citizens, because you are now the electric nation, and your electricity is carbon neutral. For some strange reason, this does not happen.
