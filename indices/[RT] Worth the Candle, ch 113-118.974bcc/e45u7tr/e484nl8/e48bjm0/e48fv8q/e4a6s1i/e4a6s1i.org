Woops.

Anyway, everything you're saying about the rarity of talent seems right, the lack of tens of thousands of powerful people running around is evidence enough. But that makes no sense to me.

Here's my model of how the universe operates; presumably the people of Aerb follow a bell curve of talent and skill similar to our own. People like Fallatehr or Everett (But not quite Everett since he has that insurmountable knack bonus) are at the extreme end of the curve right? Let's go with the 1 in 100 million number, that should still mean there should be more people a step below them that are 1 in 90 million. There should be people half as good but far more common since the relationship between skill and talent and occurrence isn't linear, i.e there should be far more than double the number of people half as good.

And this is what I mean by throwing thousands. Throwing thousands of nameless mooks and redshirts against those types of enemies might literally accomplish nothing, but a force of even hundreds of people almost as good as the absolute top tier should be far more powerful than that small group of top tier.

For extreme talent like Fallatehr to exist and to not have anyone appreciably near them in skill would mean the bell curve must be heavily skewed towards the middle with Fal and pals being extreme statistical anomalies, and that makes no sense to me. For talent to be /this/ unique, it tells me there must be some kind of meta that arbitrarily limits the number of powerful people for narrative reasons. I know there's Uther the Chosen One, but ordinary powerful people managed to put down the remaining threats when he left, albeit at great cost.

This model is probably fundamentally wrong somehow, but I feel like the people of Aerb should have these threats in the bag. Half a dozen world ending threats have been mentioned, but even if there were a hundred, with 17 billion people working the problem, I can't see how they lose when considering the talent they should have.

In one story popular on this sub, Mother of Learning, one of the reasons for why powerful individuals aren't more common is because the people at the top tend to hoard their lore rather than sharing it and teaching capable people freely. There's nothing special keeping the number of powerful individuals down except societal reasons. I wonder if a similar principle is at play in this story.

Finally, I feel like the response to these threats are woefully inadequate and a consequence of the nature of threats on Aerb. There's no doubt in my mind that the nations of Aerb if they really tried could deal with many of the exclusion zones themselves, but simply don't try because the threats are bottled up, not pressing and would be too costly to attempt. I don't understand the blaise nature of governments when there's literally only 2 years left in the library. It's like their all just waiting for someone else to fix their problems.
