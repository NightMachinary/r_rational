Or maybe the first time it triggered during the encounter and Joon failed to react to that, already pushed her past the point of no return?

Luck isn't really well defined, so if we assume that it works by a principle of warning you when your worldline would collapse to the point of inevitable harm/death/other negative consequences, then at the point of it triggering they would be either soon nuked to oblivion (where she dies) or it would end up in an inevitable no-stops-pulled confrontation (looking at O'kald's tenacity I don't imagine they could have avoided this however they tried) where Fenn would end up getting neglected in triage due to the falling out or generally being to low on Joon's list of priorities (where she, again, dies). And hence the luck already did trigger back then, when Joon's decision to stay made this inevitable.

Nothing concrete here to prop this up, given how luck is underexplained, but just some food for thought.
