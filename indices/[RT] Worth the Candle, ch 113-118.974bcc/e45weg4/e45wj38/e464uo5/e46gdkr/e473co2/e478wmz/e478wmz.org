  As far as I could tell it would be OOC for Tiffany to "put effort into seduction"

Would it, after they were "dating"? I'm not sure I agree with you here, but I definitely thing the other one was a hint... on the other hand, now that I think about it, Joon said that Tiff wasn't technically his girlfriend, so maybe it does refer to Maddie.
