I think Joon is generally held to expectations that are far from reasonable by this subreddit but this comment from him specifically did stand out to me as rather, uh, /dickish/. In his partial defence he was dealing with the potential end of his relationship which is not the best of times for summoning empathy and/or compassion unrelated to your current turmoil /but/, yeah, this is an instance that i think a little outrage is warranted.
