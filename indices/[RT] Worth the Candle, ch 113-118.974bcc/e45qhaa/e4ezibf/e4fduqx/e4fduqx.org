Thanks. I don't think it's particularly acidic. Some people have a hair-trigger downvote reflex (though I would have hoped for less of that in [[/r/rational]]).

I mean, the events and characters of the story /constantly/ talk about the differences between narrative, story-focused games and free-form, sandbox games. This is the biggest selling point of the whole novel for me. It's way more fun for the story to try to emulate a sandbox campaign while satirizing more structured stories. I would say it's mostly succeeded at that .But Fenn dying here, 24 hours after a breakup, comes down extremely hard on the side of this story being more normal, with a protagonist who suffers the drama of various love interests while saving the world, with the "twist" of the characters being fully aware of it. This simply is not as interesting a premise for me, and is annoying for the story to execute a good premise for hundreds of thousands of words then become less good.

Compare Fenn's death to when Solace died to the void grenade in the prison. That came out of nowhere, but it's totally accurate to how characters have died in my own game group and countless others. Characters die when the party rolls bad perception and gets ambushed, not when a narrative thread logically terminates. This is part of what makes these games so engaging.

Seriously, what's going to be the fallout of Fenn's death here?

- If her soul was totally destroyed by the poison and can't be resurrected, then she's permadead, followed by drama between Amaryllis and Juniper and the narrative/sandbox conflict. However, I don't think this will happen.

- If she went to hell, then there will be a lot more focus on Juniper and Valencia as they try to figure out if infiltrating hell or whatever is even feasible. This just means that Fenn goes from being sidelined by the plot to outright damsel'd.

- If they can restore her soul from backup, then it's just a regression of her character, increasing the disparity between herself and Juniper, even though Fenn won't be aware of the fact that she broke up with him. If I were a betting man, this is what I expect to happen, if only because of Maximum Drama.

But I'm not excited about any of these options, which is why I wrote this is in the first place. Maybe the story will take a different and surprising path, but I don't see how any of it is better than /just not killing them off in the first place./
