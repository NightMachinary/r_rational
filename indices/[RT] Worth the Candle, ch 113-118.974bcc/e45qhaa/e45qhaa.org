I don't like being critical, but I found these last chapters extremely boring, despite featuring what is presumably a major character death. The new group of NPCs isn't interesting because the story's done this too often before. Fenn dying immediately after the breakup is not only so predictable it's trite but we all know the author is better than that which somehow makes it /even worse that they did it anyway/. Which, continuing to assume that the author is skilled and creative, means that they have a different subversion in mind, but we won't enjoy it because we can only expect it, because the alternative is Amaryllis' Narrative interpretation is correct and this is one of the most obnoxious stories I've ever read.

No, I'm not a hardcore Fenn/Joon shipper who is so upset she died that they'll quit reading. I'm upset that a story with so much promise and When O'Kald said “My wife” as a reason for betrayal and murder I almost combusted with indifference. Again, /assuming the author knows what they are doing/, they are intentionally writing dumb characters to force the plot. And not only is the plot being forced, its forced in a dumb direction, which is dumb in-world, in the meta-context of narrative structure, and somehow even the meta-meta-narrative structure of the story discussing narrative structures.
