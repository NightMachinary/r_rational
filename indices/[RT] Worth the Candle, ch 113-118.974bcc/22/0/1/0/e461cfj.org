  I laid down next to her and pressed a shaky hand against her collarbone. Her skin was cold and pale. There was too much blood around her mouth. I felt for a pulse first, but my fingers just fumbled at her neck, and I didn't really know how to take a pulse anyway. I tried to gain access to her soul, but the thread of Fenn wasn't there anymore, not in her skin or the blood that wet my fingers.
