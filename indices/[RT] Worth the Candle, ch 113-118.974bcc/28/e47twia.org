... crazy theory, but this feels like the DM was mad that JuniperXFenn was going so well, and decided to /subtly/ maybe use Valencia as a proxy to mess that up so that his OTP (Amaryllis, who he specifically designed for Joon) could flourish.

It didn't work completely since it was only a "break" and there was a good narrative chance of them growing mature apart from each other and then a "second chance" happens which sticks since now they both know each other's flaws intimately and hopefully have taken steps to alleviate them.

To prevent this, the DM actually kills off Fenn. Just like all of Uther's love interests, this has a tangible external cause (the enemies using soul-acid so that Juniper couldn't reincarnate in hell, and soul dissolving being one of the very few things Juniper could heal), and /just/ enough coincidences (Fenn being taken out last, given the crown last, and ALSO being healed last) to make it look inevitable, which means high possibility of DM fuckery/narrative causality.

I know Juniper decided to take him at face value, but I'm not sure that was the right call, since they /still/ don't know what motivates him.
