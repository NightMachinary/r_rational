I was sure it had been stated explicitly that Joon dated her and it didn't end well, but it seems I imagined it. I did find the reference to a girlfriend other than Tiff or Fenn in chapter 97:

  "She's the only other person he's been with,” said Fenn. “I know that I would prefer if you changed.”

  “Er,” I replied. “Technically there was another.”

  “Wait, what?” asked Fenn, looking over at me. “When? On Earth, or Aerb?”

  “Earth,” I said.

  “Well then why don't I know about it?” asked Fenn.

  “It's a long story,” I said. “Can I be a chickenshit and write you a letter?”

  Fenn crossed her arms over her chest. “Well ... fine.” She said it in a voice that let me know that it wasn't at all fine, and that she was only agreeing because she didn't want to be an outrageous hypocrite. “I just didn't know you had another girlfriend. I told you all about my boyfriends.”

  “She wasn't technically a girlfriend,” I said. “Or, maybe only technically a girlfriend. I shouldn't have said anything.”

I could have sworn, on reading your comment but before looking for it, that Maddie was specifically mentioned. It seems I just drew the conclusion with her being the only other female from Earth listed as part of the gaming group crossed with the falling out where she is mentioned by name. Luckily I turned out to be right, but I guess I have an excuse to reread and examine where else I've been making leaps that might pay off later.
