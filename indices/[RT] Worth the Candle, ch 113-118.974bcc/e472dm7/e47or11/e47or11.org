There's a contrast between Grak and Bethel. She's much more actualized now, in her current role, while Grak isn't that invested in all this adventuring but lacks direction. I wonder what happens when those two talk.

Maybe they'll also discuss the 'ingenious' non-anima ward.

Void weapons? Probably another ward, and a harder sell to ask for that one to be taken down.
