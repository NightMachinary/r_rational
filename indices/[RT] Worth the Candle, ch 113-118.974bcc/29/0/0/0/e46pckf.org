this is true. I usually only run groups that I have known personally for a long time though, so my thoughts on what is or is not a good idea for a cursed item may be skewed by that.

though, if I am not mistaken, the actual item was called neither. I seem to remember it being called something more verbose, like the belt of masculinity and femininity, or something along those lines.
