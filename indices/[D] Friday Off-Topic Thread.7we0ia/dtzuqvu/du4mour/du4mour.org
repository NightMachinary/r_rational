Landmarks, interesting Landmarks, are definitely the way to go. You can have sections where the protagonist keeps looping back to the same heckling magic statue of a jester, only to later reveal that the maze layout changed based on that interaction. You can have the protagonist feel as if he's on the right path, exulting his success in his head, only to come back to the same gnarled oak from the previous chapter. Before he sinks into despair, he notices that this gnarled oak is actually not the same one and was there to bait him into taking a wrong turn. You can have skeletons that respawn and attack him and the protagonist initially navigates the maze such that he stays away from them only to realize he's going in circles and that the maze creators intent is for him to follow where the skeletons are spawning heaviest to exit.

There are...a. Lot of things you can do that don't necessarily require giving the reader an accurate map. Though, if you're confident in your maze drawing abilities, drawing one for yourself could help the writing process
