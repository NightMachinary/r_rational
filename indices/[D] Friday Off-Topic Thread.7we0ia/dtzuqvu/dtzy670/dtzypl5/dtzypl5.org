I guess that's doable, but what I'm asking is for suggestions on writing prose related to mazes. The images should support the writing, not using the writing to support the images. I'm not that good of a drawer to get away with mainly using images.

Good catch though. I got stuck on the idea of using overhead drawings rather than a ground-level sketch.
