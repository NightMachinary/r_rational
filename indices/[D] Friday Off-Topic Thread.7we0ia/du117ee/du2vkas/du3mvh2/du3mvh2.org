  what's the deal with weight cutting, why is it moloch
#+end_quote

Biggest driver: in combat sports, being heavier is better (to a point: heavyweight has a limit of 265lb but most tend to weigh around 240lb).

So if you are fighting people who are 175lb, it's better for you to "walk around" at say 185lb and somehow lose 10lb of water weight really quick just before the fight, and then regain that water weight before you fight, so you can have an extra 10lb of muscle.

This becomes the dominant strategy, so (virtually) all the fighters who are fighting at 175lb "really" weigh say 185lb or 190lb - so you're not actually getting an advantage by cutting from 185 to 175, you're just avoiding being lighter than all your opponents.

It gets worse because the weight cutting is dangerous, especially if not done properly. If you don't rehydrate well enough it can make you more prone to serious injury - something to do with hydrating the fluid that cushions the brain (of all the deaths in boxing, which also has weight cutting, none have happened at heavyweight, where weight cutting is not required).

So you have a bunch of professional athletes engaging in a long, expensive, painful process (you have to eat a certain diet, run on a treadmill in a hoodie, alternate between saunas and ice baths; they used to rehydrate with an /IV/, but that's been banned, though apparently everyone still does it because how will the UFC know and you can order IVs to your hotel room in vegas because it's good for hangovers apparently?), just so that way they can shrink to a lower weight so they won't be smaller than the guys who do that.

  Could one design a different system, which does not reward cutting weight by dehydration, maybe measuring and correcting for total body water with bioelectrical impedance analysis or isotope dilution, so one could use hydration-level-corrected weight classes?
#+end_quote

Isotope dilution takes a long time and requires that the athlete not eat or drink anything during the measurement so probably not a good idea. Bioelectrical impedance is not super accurate - it's OK for your scales at home but not for this sort of thing. You'd want to use a bodpod type device that would get accurate density. But really they do urine dehydration tests to measure these sorts of things.

The best way to ban weight cutting would be by doing what [[https://onefc.com/martial_arts/][ONE FC]] does:

- Athletes must submit their current walking weight and daily training weight regularly. Athletes will input and track their daily weight online via a dedicated web portal.
- Athletes will be assigned to their weight class based on collated data and random weight checks. Athletes are not allowed to drop a weight class less than eight weeks out from an event.
- During fight week, weights are checked daily. Urine specific gravity will also be checked the day after arrival and three hours prior to the event. Athletes must be within their weight class and pass specific gravity hydration tests all week and up to three hours before the event. If an athlete falls outside the weight, or fails a test, they are disqualified from the event. Doctors may request additional testing at their discretion.
- Catchweight bouts are allowed. However, the athlete with the higher weight will not be heavier than 105% of the lighter opponent's weight.
- ONE will conduct random weight checks on athletes at its discretion.
- Athletes may petition to change weight classes outside of the eight-week competition zone and must be within their new desired weight at that time. In addition, athletes must pass a specific gravity urine test when their weight is within the limits of the newly petitioned weight class. ONE doctors can request additional testing to determine the amount of weight drop allowed over a specific time.
- The usage of IVs for the purpose of rehydration will not be allowed.

  How was the event itself, did you enjoy it?
#+end_quote

Objectively the event wasn't "one for the ages" - it never really was going to be, the card kind of sucked - but it was so much fun / surreal to be /in the arena/ as the fights were happening and to see everything. I was surprised that the commentary wasn't piped through - I don't know why but I assumed it would be? - and it was amazing at the first prelim fight how nuts the crowd went when Bruce Buffer started talking (with the early prelim fighters getting only a perfunctory clap).

I had trouble buying tickets when they went on sale (I was on the "mailing list" so I got an early code and I couldn't get on a purchase page) so I ended up paying twice as much for tickets as I'd originally planned but I'm kind of glad I did as our seats were decent (not good - that would have been another 50% but who's counting). Then probably about 5% of seats in our little section were not filled which shocked me because apparently the event sold out.

A lot of the Aussies won so that was great. I still wish Bobby Knuckles (Robert Whittaker) could've fought - he pulled out about six weeks ago - but you can't have everything.

And the energy of the crowd was second to none. My favourite thing about watching MMA is the crowds - we go to the sports bar at our city's casino to watch it and just having other people there to go "Oooooh!" and clap and stuff makes such a difference over watching something at home with just two people. So having like 8,000 people was insane. When the event finished seeing the thousands of people walking along the city's footpaths was unbelievable.

I hope it comes back but it'll be another 2-3 years.
