guuuys i'm going to be at ufc 221 tomorrow i saw the weigh ins this morning it was so awesome i am so excited

even though the card sucks and romero didn't make weight it's never been to my city before (the cage was illegal until a year ago) and it'll probably never come again so HYPE HYPE HYPE let's make the most of it!!!!!!!!!!!!

i know this isn't even rational-adjacent (okay beyond weight cutting as a practise being moloch all over) but i am so excited and this is off-topic so i'm posting anyway
