Does anyone here run alt accounts? I have a few, and three rules for them:

1. *Don't lie about your credentials*, where "credentials" are interpreted broadly to mean life experiences (e.g. don't claim that you have a degree that you don't, don't say you lived someplace you haven't, don't say you met someone when you didn't). You shouldn't be doing any of this anyway, but it's one of the shitty things that people do with alts sometimes.
2. *Don't create false popularity* by commenting on your own stuff, upvoting your own comments/submissions (against site rules here and some other places, and checked for via automation), or backing yourself up in an argument. I kind of feel like people shouldn't be swayed by two people making an identical argument, but they are.
3. *Don't say anything that you couldn't handle being linked back to you*. Partly this is just prudence, rather than a matter of ethics, but I think the ethical part comes in from people saying things that they don't actually believe or stand behind, which you shouldn't be doing, and which alts might potentially enable.

For myself, I find alt accounts useful because there's baggage attached to this handle, and while most of it is /good/ baggage, it's still something that some people will bring into a conversation, or that /I'll/ bring into a conversation.
