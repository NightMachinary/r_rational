I have a similar thing, sort of. I noticed that I find arguments more compelling when they are interesting and/or unusual. I've caught myself being persuaded by arguments that I dismissed as meaningless drivel earlier, just because someone found an interesting way to phrase them.

I'm trying to be more conscious about this now, but so far, it doesn't seem to make much of a difference.
