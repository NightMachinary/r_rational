  I kind of feel like people shouldn't be swayed by two people making an identical argument, but they are.

This is a thing where I'm really not satisfied by my brain's algorithm.

Actually, it's even worse than that. If I hear someone make a convincing argument, I'll be somewhat convinced. If I later hear (or see or read) the same person make the same argument to a different audience, I'll retroactively find their argument less convincing because they've used it twice.

I think what happens is that, on the second "exposure", my brain internalizes "Hey, this isn't actually spontaneous and from-the-heart stuff, this person actually spent /effort/ making this argument sound good", which makes its convincing-ness seem more artificial.

And, overall, that makes sense, but it just highlights that I was naive to take the convincing argument at face value the first time around. (sort of, I don't actually think I'm naive, don't make me caveat this sentence to death)

  For myself, I find alt accounts useful because there's baggage attached to this handle, and while most of it is good baggage, it's still something that some people will bring into a conversation, or that I'll bring into a conversation.

Yeah. I'm commenting a lot on Worm right now, and I don't know if I'd do it as much if every time I posted something I thought people might compare it to something I had written.
