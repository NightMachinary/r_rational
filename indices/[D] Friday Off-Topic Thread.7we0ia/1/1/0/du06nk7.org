  I kind of feel like people shouldn't be swayed by two people making an identical argument, but they are.

  This is a thing where I'm really not satisfied by my brain's algorithm.

You can try to become more cynical. Look down on others as silly irrational agents. Then you become like me: whenever I hear something, I think "that's stupid" before I even parse it. I then attempt to prove that it /is/ stupid, to prove to myself that I'm smarter than everyone else.
