You're enthusiasm about a topic, which I would never have expected here, is super-refreshing!

I tried muay thai for a year some time ago, but in general I know very little about mma competitions. Could you tell more, what's the deal with weight cutting, why is it moloch?

I just did some quick googling, is the extreme dehydration before weigh-in the problem? Could one design a different system, which does not reward cutting weight by dehydration, maybe measuring and correcting for total body water with bioelectrical impedance analysis or isotope dilution, so one could use hydration-level-corrected weight classes?

How was the event itself, did you enjoy it?
