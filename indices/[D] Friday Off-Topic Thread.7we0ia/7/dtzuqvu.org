I am writing a story about exploring a maze, but I've ran into a problem. How do I describe a maze in a story?

I could ignore keep track of a path and just focus on landmarks and interesting features the protagonist notices on the paths that he slowly learns to specifically navigate to. I could include pictures of the maze that he has explored so far, but that entails a birds-eye view which would give the reader more information than he has access to (which I don't want).

Does anyone have good ideas about writing the exploration of a suburban maze or know about stories that does a good job talking about how to explore a maze?

Edit: Are there any books on dealing with real-life mazes? Like if you go to corn mazes to solve them as if it was your job rather than just for fun?
