It's been a while since I've read it, but /House of Leaves/ has a section like that. It's more about the feeling of exploring a maze, rather than giving the reader a sense of what the layout of the maze is -- it seems really hard to use prose to convey visual information like that.

If you wanted images, you could do them with a "fog of war" style, but that still might give the reader more perfect information than you want.
