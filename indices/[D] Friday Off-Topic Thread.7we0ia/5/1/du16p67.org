Bit of a different recommendation than the other things you'll no doubt be pointed towards, but I recently read [[https://www.amazon.com.au/Come-you-are-Surprising-Transform/dp/1476762090][Come as you are: The Surprising New Science that Will Transform Your Sex Life]] and I found it very impactful and meaningful. I think it's a valuable read.

Some parts I rolled my eyes at because they were written in an overly familiar way since it's aimed at female college students, but there were like 3 or 4 parts of the book where I was moved to tears by.
