One of my New Years resolutions was to read more actual books, including "serious non-fiction". I was in a bookstore recently, but their selection was much more limited than I remember from the Borders they replaced. And what they did have left me with massive indecision paralysis.

So I thought I'd ask you fine people for recomendations. I'm willing to consider a very wide field, science, philosophy, history, political theory, even more esoteric stuff.

What non-fiction did you find very thought-provoking? Very interesting? Which would you point to and say "that's /the/ book on topic X"?
