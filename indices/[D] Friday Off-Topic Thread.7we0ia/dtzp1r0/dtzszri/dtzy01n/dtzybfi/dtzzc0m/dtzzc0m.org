  Sound like he's dividing it into 'questions' based on mark percentage, not on what work it covers.

Agreed, and I think it's a bad practice that distorts expectations.

As an example of what it was like, one question was very similar to:

1. a) Draw the electric field lines and equipotential surfaces around the point charges drawn below.

   b) An electron is traveling in the +x direction at 1.0 * 10^{7} m/s at the origin, and slows to 5.0 * 10^{5} m/s at x=2.00 cm. Find its acceleration, the time elapsed, and the potential difference between those two points. Which point has the higher potential?
