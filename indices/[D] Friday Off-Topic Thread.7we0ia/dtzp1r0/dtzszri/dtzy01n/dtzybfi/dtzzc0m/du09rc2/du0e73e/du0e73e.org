The electric field and electric potential was most of the test. IIRC, the questions were:

- Given some point charges in 2D space, calculate the electric field and force on a charge.

- Draw the electric field lines and equipotential surfaces around some charges.

  The electron traveling question.

- Calculate the surface charge density of a hollow metal sphere with a point charge inside.

  Derive the formula for electric field along the major axis of a charged disk, given the voltage.

- ???

  ???

- Find the resistance of a wire of a given length, resistivity, and diameter at two different temperatures

  Solve a simple circuit
