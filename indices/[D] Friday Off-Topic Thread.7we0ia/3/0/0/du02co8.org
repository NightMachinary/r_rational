Offensively, there's a lot more going on that allows us to customize how damage is dealt, that doesn't really give a need for alternate offensive sub-types like we have for defense. For instance, physical attacks don't have to scale entirely off of ATK and be defended entirely by DEF, while the same holds true for special attacks and SPATK/SPDEF. If I use Tackle, it might scale 20% off of ATK, 40% off of Weight, and 40% off of how fast the pokemon is moving when the hit landed. Headbutt might scale 20% off of ATK and 80% off of DEF. Fine-tuning like this lets us represent how damage is being applied in a much more granular fashion than typing's general bonus/resistance.

However, coding the same sort of thing for "this is all the ways this particular attack can be defended" is far more tedious, which is why we started doing multiple defensive sub-types to help encode certain archetypes.

Generally in canon, types encode a lot more than just damage. For instance, Fighting is less effective against Flying (presumably) because of Flying's ability to dodge and weave through the air. We already have dodging through space, so any evasionary aspect of types needs to be completely stripped out. Likewise, we've tried to remove any thematic influences, such as Flying doing extra damage against Bug--one might argue that beaks etc can rip through chitin, but if that's the case wouldn't it be /even more/ effective against unprotected Normal flesh? In this case it's pretty clear that it was a purely thematic choice: Birds eat Bugs, so Flying 2x Bug.

(This particular case is especially clear due to the fact that Red and Green originally had a Bird type that was consolidated into Flying late in development; references to it still exist in the game's code.)

Offensive moves can also have their typed damage divided any way the designer wants, in increments of 1%. Thunder Punch thus would hit for something like 40% Electric and 60% Normal, and have weakness/resistance prorated accordingly. Now, many canon moves, as you've pointed out, are prime candidates for reducing to Normal-type damage since they don't do anything /inherently/ different. A beak hitting flesh or chitin or solid steel or a fish is going to have its damage defined by how sharp the beak is and how soft the target is, which is what ATK and DEF are for. Thus, I think Peck deals all Normal damage. The Gust family of moves are really the prime example of Flying moves, which for the most part I've interpreted as a Wind type, offensively. Maybe Gust does 95% Flying 5% Normal just for a token effort to simulate debris, and maybe Whirlwind or Hurricane are closer to 70/30.

For a while I waffled on the existence of piercing/cutting/bludgeoning damage but opted not to encode it with a type or mechanic. If there are examples of moves that particularly rely on piercing etc damage, then we can by design convention simply include those considerations into the move damage calculation. Maybe Slash scales normally off of ATK and is defended normally by DEF, except that for every 5 points of ATK you have, you ignore a point of DEF (or something). If enough of these patterns emerge to be used in enough places, I'll probably consider a keyword-based addition system to moves, so it would be like a TCG where you would see the word *Piercing* in the move description and know that it cuts through DEF as described above.

(if it wasn't clear, each move is going to be an individual script file, structured in a way to make bog standard moves trivial and more in-depth moves straightforward enough to produce.)
