Looking at the current type interactions, you've given certain types multiple types of body part that they cover, which is actually really interesting. But do you plan on doing the same for offence? As an example, flying moves in the games cover both attacks via bird-like body parts (eg peck), but also attacks via wind (eg gust).

Maybe these are just spread out over different types, like peck being a normal move or something, but then there is also an argument for, as an example, cutting/piercing/blunt damage. How is offence handled?
