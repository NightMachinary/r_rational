You also have to let go about needing to read more. The thing with the author, is that he's consistently updated about 9k words every 3/4 weeks for years. This is crazy compared to many online fics/fanfics, which just die or are unknowable when they'll update (eg. Dungeon Keeper Ami).

So ultimately, you need to find other fics to satisfy your [[/r/rational]] cravings, and suddenly recall MoL when it gets updated. And if you do forget exactly what happened, all the better! You only get maybe 5 rereads at most because of spaced repetition, which is unfortunate. So enjoy it as much as you can!

A fic with a similar premise is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid][Time Braid]], which is a Naruto fanfiction. Don't worry about knowing the characters for that one. It ends up doing some really cool stuff regarding looping, but definitely has some really fucked up (torture) parts, which kinda sucks, but was good enough for me to +get through+ devour it.\\
It has some really cool looping and magic type stuff that I literally haven't seen anywhere else, which is why I like it so much.

Note: it's pretty unrepresentative of other Naruto fanfiction.

Another looping fic I recommend is [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/][Purple Days]] for the ASoIaF (Game of Thrones) series. It's cool, not really because of the magic, but because the looping character is Prince Joffrey (who, if you don't know, is a horrible person). He gets better, and becomes someone I can root for, after the first arc.

I can't really think of other particularly good looping series that I can think of, so you'll have to deal with other stories. I've liked most things recommended on this sub, so just look through, and give them a try, even if they don't sound great, they probably are. This sub has high standards.

Also, another one of my favorite fics is A Hero's War, which is *the* magic uplifting story. It satisfies my need to have cool stuff be done with magic, experimenting to get to that point.
