Yeah, you don't really need to know anything about the series, really. Maybe.

It starts when Joffrey dies at his wedding from poison, thinking that Tyrion (the Imp) was the one who poisoned him.

It may be a good idea to briefly look through the main cast on a wiki, lest you get confused from the large cast size.
