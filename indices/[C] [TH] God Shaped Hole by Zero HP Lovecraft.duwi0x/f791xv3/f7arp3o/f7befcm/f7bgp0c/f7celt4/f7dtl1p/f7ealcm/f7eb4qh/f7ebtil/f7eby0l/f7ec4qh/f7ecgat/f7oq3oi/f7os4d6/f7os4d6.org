Oh, misgendering fictional characters could be easily explained away. The character who did so was ignorant, or bigoted, perhaps. But in With This Ring, the author didn't just misgender within the narrative---he also expressed transphobia as a person, claimed that the decision to misgender was the correct one, and then went on to make an attack helicopter joke. Like, trans people might want to know that before reading that story, that's all. And in the Chinese novel we have no /direct/ evidence that the author is transphobic, but we do have a lot of evidence that points that way. The culture is transphobic, the main character makes fun of trans characters every so often, and everyone kinds of treats them as a joke within the narrative. Whether or not the author is transphobic is irrelevant there, because the point of the Author Politics tags was to warn people who care about that kind of thing. A trans person might, depending on how heavily they suffer from gender dysphoria, feel /physically ill/ at reading a work where trans people are treated that way.
