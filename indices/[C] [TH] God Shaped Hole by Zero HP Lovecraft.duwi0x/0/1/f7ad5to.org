The Gig Economy reminds me of [[https://www.inkitt.com/AlexBeyman][Alex Beyman]]'s [[https://www.inkitt.com/stories/horror/35463][Persistence of Vision]] with the idea of life appearing in bizzare substrates and mediums which gives it a somewhat Lovecraftian vibes.

After reading all three stories by Zero HP Lovecraft, I think that Alex Beyman shares a lot in common with Zero HP Lovecraft. Both of them write stories thinking about the future with lovecraftian themes and how memes can be dangerously effective on the individual. Zero thinks about the market as a memetic danger, while Alex does the same thing but with religion in [[https://www.inkitt.com/stories/horror/7465][Triangle Opportunity]].
