Explain as little as possible, only when it makes sense that there would be an explanation in-universe. "Show; don't tell," to be cliched. Emphasis on the "don't tell"; be consistent enough, and the part of the audience who cares will start to figure things out, and the part that doesn't either won't mind or wouldn't have gotten far enough in the first place.

I'm trying to think of a fantasy epic I've read that was explicit in its worldbuilding, and I'm struggling to think of anything other than /The Silmarillion/, which was explicitly the worldbuilding companion to LotR. The world just kinda builds itself, as the characters go about their business. Foreshadow aspects that the audience needs to know are available as potential problems or solutions, but the audience doesn't /need/ to know everything to understand the story. If the audience is interested in the 90% of the worldbuilding that inevitably can't fit in the story proper, that's what appendices are for.

(Now that I think of it, /The Wheel of Time/'s starting each book with a fluffy establishment paragraph following some wind might have been a stealth way to draw parts of the map. I mostly just built a mental map of the world as the characters traveled and heard rumors of distant happenings, more than from the winds, though.)

The key point here is: what does the audience /need/ to know? You need to know far more, to get the pieces set up properly, but people in our world don't typically know anywhere near enough about our actual world, or its actual magic systems, and still get by. Maybe the trouble is that those of us who do learn rl lore tend to do so from dry exposition in textbooks and classes, rather than through experience? (It's hard to show rather than tell when it comes to ancient history, after all.) But again, what does the audience /need/? In HPMoR, we don't see Harry and Hermione in class very often, or read summaries of what they read in their textbooks. We see them do experiments, and hear Harry's thoughts as he's considering character backstories, and we especially see Harry get frustrated by how confusing it all is, and get in trouble for misuse of munchkinry. HPMoR gets away with less explicit (and more subtle) worldbuilding than canon /Harry Potter/, partly for being fanfiction, and partly because of its different focus. When we do get infodumps, it's usually either in a classroom context, or Harry giving a lecture about some article he remembers reading. And the most memorable of those tend to be wrapped in character interactions or strong emotions (Quirrel, MacGonogall, etc).

I think, one of the things that broke my attempt a few years back at rationalifying my soft sf novel was how making the plot and character actions make sense shoved the important information back so far, it felt like the reader would have been jerked around and felt deceived about where it all was going. The trick is to establish at least enough in the first paragraph to know what kind of story they're getting into, and if there are big twists that would break those promises, hint early. (Ex, /Leviathan Wakes/ is mostly hard science fiction, but a major plot point gets kinda eldrich and horrific and involves lots of handwaving. If this had happened without warning in the middle of the book, it would have felt very out of place and like it broke the promise of the setting. Since the prolog showed us a brief sample, thenshoved it back into the mystery box, it fit much better when we finally got back to it.)
