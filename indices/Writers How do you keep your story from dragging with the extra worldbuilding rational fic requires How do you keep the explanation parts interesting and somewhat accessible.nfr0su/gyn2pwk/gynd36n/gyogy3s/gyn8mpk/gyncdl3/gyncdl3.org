What great authors are able to do is incorporate aspects of the world, history, rules of magic, etc, into the plot of the story itself. Make that info essential for the characters to solve a problem or win a conflict, and suddenly your reader will be invested in learning about the world you've created. Again, this is hard to do and takes lots of practice, but it's a good thing to think about when writing.

Also as others have said, don't feel obligated to dump everything at once. If the world is well-realized and detailed, your readers should be able to tell and will trust you even if you don't explain everything at once. In fact, mysteries and hanging questions are a great way to hook a reader. Same goes for character decisions. Obviously I want to know why a character acts a certain way, but don't get bogged down in explaining every possible path. Maybe try to cover egregious plot holes but smaller stuff can be slipped in later and will be noticed by readers who are detail-oriented and care about that sort of thing.
