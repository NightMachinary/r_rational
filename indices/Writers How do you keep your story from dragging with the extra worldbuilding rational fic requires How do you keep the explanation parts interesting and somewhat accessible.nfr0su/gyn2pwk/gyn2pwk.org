Trust the reader to be intelligent, you do not need to explain how or why something is happening in the moment.

You don't need to tell the reader about why you can cast ice magic with only your right hand, and why it is considered rude to challenge another to a duel an hour after mid-day.

That is not to say you are absent an explanation. Those explanations do not even have to be rational or logical, plenty of cultural items are not. For a rational story only the main character(s) need be rational in their approach.

To avoid being dry though, you must be internally consistent. Especially if you want the story to be lauded as rational.

Take Lord of the Rings as the perfect example, Tolkien was wordy, but even so he cut a heck of a lot out of his stories to keep them clear and concise, but consistent. The whole history of his world, the reasons for many thousands of things, languages, kingdoms, backstories, was enough information to be compiled into a whole other novel (Simirilian).

Writing is a balance and it is too easy to fall into one extreme or another. Describe everything at once, so you know the reader has the explanation but is bored to death, or describe nothing because you have not thought of it yourself and simply want a less boring scene.

Give enough information to make the reader try and figure out the reasons for things. When you do answer, do so later when it makes sense to bring up the other point. You cast ice magic with your right hand to keep it away from your heart, so the mage with only a left hand keeps a hot plate over his chest to keep casting ice.

Trust the reader, and don't build something for too long, as people's own ideas will invariably be better to them than anything you eventually describe, like Medichlorians.
