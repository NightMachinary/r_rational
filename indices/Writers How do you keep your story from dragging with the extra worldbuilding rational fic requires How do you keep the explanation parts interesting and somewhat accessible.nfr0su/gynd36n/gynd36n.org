You don't need to explain the mechanisms to be rationalfic. As long as you /know/ the mechanisms, and keep them in mind while writing, you can probably get away with very little actual explanation except when someone is trying something that relies on the world working one way instead of another. The world's mechanisms can be a [[https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/solvable-mysteries][solvable mystery]] rather than outright shown.

This is in some sense a corollary of the conjunction of rationalfic with the rule of writing good stories which states "First, go through and write just the scenes you are most excited about writing. Second, stop there, take what you have, and publish it without the rest."
