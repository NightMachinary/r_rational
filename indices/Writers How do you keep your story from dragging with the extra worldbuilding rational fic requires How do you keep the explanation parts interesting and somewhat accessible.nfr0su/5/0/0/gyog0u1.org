Someone recently linked Kaj Satala's summary of the idea of chaining hooks. The idea goes that you create an interesting situation with a question that the audience wants answered, and then you answer it. One should include many of these,, because to keep the reader engaged, questions do need to be answered quickly, but there need to still be questions left to keep them moving forward. This doesn't necessitate lore dumps, necessarily; careful arrangement of the content so that the confusing parts serve as the hook, and the next sentence resolves the confusion, can work in some cases. There should generally always be at least one set of parentheses open, but it helps to have other sets that open and close quickly, overlap, etc, to keep the reader's curiosity both engaged and trusting.
