I'm writing a rational urban fantasy paranormal romance with intense worldbuilding and whose main conflict hinges on a pretty standard philosophical problem (deontology vs utilitarianism).

It's... basically all talking heads? The characters talk to each other a lot because it's about their relationship. There's action (vampires! Mysterious injuries! Kidnapping! Intrigue! Implied murder! COMPETITIVE TOWEL FOLDING!), but it's not the main point because that's not what my story is /about/. The worldbuilding doesn't come up except in what the characters have in their immediate environment.

And what's wrong with that? Your story is about what it's about. It's an ensemble cast so let the ensemble sing.

Some techniques for getting a story off the ground to a running start might help you, since you want to hook the reader in long enough for them to warm up to the cast. Things like /in media res/ and then flashbacks, starting small and then expanding, etc.
