Your story drags whenever the audience doesn't care what's going on. Therefore, the most important thing the story can do not to drag is to raise interesting questions to pique your audience's curiosity. /What does *that* mean? Who could have done *that?* Why would she have done *this?*/

If you never answer any of the questions, you'll lose your audience as they realize your mystery box is actually empty. So, you need to have answers to the questions.

In addition to outlining the sequences of events that made up the main plot of OCTO, I had separate notes for each character keeping track of where they were, what their current goals and obstacles were at each stage in the story, and what direction they were heading next.

From there, it was a matter of revealing things to the audience by following the perspectives of the characters positioned to discover those things, and raising questions naturally by virtue of the characters' limited perspectives.

I'd recommend building in some randomness, doing a lot of research, and listening to your gut when it /feels/ draggy. And get beta readers who are generous with feedback.
