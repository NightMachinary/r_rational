  Your story drags whenever the audience doesn't care what's going on. Therefore, the most important thing the story can do not to drag is to raise interesting questions to pique your audience's curiosity. What does that mean? Who could have done that? Why would she have done this?

  If you never answer any of the questions, you'll lose your audience as they realize your mystery box is actually empty. So, you need to have answers to the questions.

This is interesting. One other complaint I tended to get when I included this was that the beginning was confusing or had too many loose ends. So maybe part of my problem was conflicting feedback or readers who weren't in my audience as well.

I'm trying to incorporate more fair play mysteries into the story, though.
