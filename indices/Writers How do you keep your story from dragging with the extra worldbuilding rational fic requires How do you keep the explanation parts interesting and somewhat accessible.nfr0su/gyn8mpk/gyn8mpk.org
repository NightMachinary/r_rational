Frankly a lot of it is just practice. You learn how to implement explanations smoothly into the flow of events by trying to do it and seeing what works and what doesn't.

In terms of specific advice, I'd say try and mix the explanations into conversations and interactions between characters. It's much more interesting to learn lore as a result of two characters talking about the issue, or planning something, or dueling, than to read a paragraph of lore that just establishes context in abstract.
