When you write the character stories, do you tell the reader right away that the MC's father is still alive out there? Or do you dangle that plot point and possibility, place foreshadowing, and when the right moment comes, reveal it like a stage magician?

Yeah. Do *that* for the worldbuilding.

You're treating the worldbuilding as a requirement to enjoy the world. Instead, treat the worldbuilding as the enjoyment itself.

Give hints and let them play with the worldbuilding and come up with their own ideas first. Let them speculate, and slowly connect the dots. When you finally reveal how X, Y, Z part of the world is really like, it shouldn't come as a surprise to the reader. And it should be something the readers feel *excited* to read about.

Ergo: Don't treat your world like it's the table for your card game, treat it like it's a few dozen extra cards in your hand to play instead.
