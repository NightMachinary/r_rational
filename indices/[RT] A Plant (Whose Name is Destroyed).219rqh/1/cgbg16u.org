Actually, no, hold on, separate comment for a separate train of thought.

Let's /really thoroughly consider/ Hayden's hypothesis: /it is written/. Whoever's running the universe simply selects or programs events in such a way as to account for Hayden's desires (for some construal of desires).

Naveen actually hit straight upon the problem with all this: it means Naveen and most everyone else Hayden will ever meet are all pre-arranged, pre-programmed, and pre-destined in a way that will get Hayden what he wants. /The universe revolves around Hayden/, and probably around whichever other Akkadian gods like him are also roaming the world.

Now, either his desires really do affect the world in the normal chronological fashion, present writes future, in which case, we should continue with the plan to capture him and use him to become gods, save the world, blah blah blah. /Or/, his desires are "sent back in time" to whomever (I say "whom" because any entity capable of reasoning using the intentional stance can plainly be reasoned /about/ using the intentional stance) is "writing" the universe (oy gevalt, metafiction), who uses them to "write" destiny. /Or/, whoever's doing the "writing" pre-wrote Hayden's desires themselves, and arranged for those to be granted as prewritten.

The first and last hypotheses make the most causal sense. The problem is, the last hypothesis is a /severe problem/, because Whoever that is, they're engaging in some pretty damned evil mind-control. Ethical Free Will for Very Powerful People: /thou shalt not optimize the contents of other minds/.

/This person is evil/, and the Right Thing is to giga-drill a fucking hole in them.

If the first hypothesis, that Hayden has /powers/ is correct, then it's just a matter of figuring out why the universe itself takes the intentional stance towards this one guy, but there's still a really major ethical problem with other minds being optimized for what Hayden wants.
