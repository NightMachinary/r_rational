Good read.

The main character is not very rational though. "No causal connection?" There is something that behaves differently in presence than in absence. How much more silver-platter do you want your causality? It sounds like they got confused by a determinist interpretation of the universe into putting down their tools.

(Step 1 is obviously "Clearly it was written that you must now go and win the Randi challenge.")

(Step 2 is "clearly something outside or beyond the universe pays attention to your desires. (I shall exclude the case where the fundamental laws of the universe just happen to pay attention to a particular arrangement of atoms in somebody's head on grounds of ridicule.) If you honestly want love, then clearly some desires are excluded. From the pattern of what desires are permitted and what are excluded, we can draw conclusions to the nature of that outside selector.") Oh and, as a trend - minds pay attention to minds.

(Step 3 is "write an FAI and execute an AI-box attack on the outside selector")
