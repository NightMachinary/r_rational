I'm assuming you're referring to all setting shifts, not just from Fantasy to Urban Fantasy but in general (Space Opera to Western, Sitcom to Superhero, etc). In that case, the answer is "it depends." As with most things, it's the execution, not the broad strokes, that determines whether it's good or not. Ask yourself what the setting shift adds, and how and to what extent that shift might damage or distort major plot points. Do the positive outweigh the negatives? What can you do to limit the latter and strengthen the former? If you care about readership, to what extent will the novelty draw people in, and to what extent will it drive people away?

I realize that this is both off-topic and impolite, but you're one of the only [[/r/rational][r/rational]] posters I've seen to use internet-speak contractions like "u." How do you feel about the general tendency towards (admittedly wasteful and signal-y) grammatical correctness among our community, and why do you prefer your own dialect? Is it a habit, or a conscious decision? For that matter, do you use internet-speak when writing fiction, or only making general statements?
