  Sure, it's an argument against it. Not a sufficient one to change my typing, but it's there.

What is the argument, exactly? It sounds like you're saying that "signalling is bad and should be avoided in general, even if that means doing things like using poor grammar and tweet-speak." (I might be misunderstanding...?) If that is where you're going, I'll point out that you can't actually avoid signalling -- saying "sp n gramr dont mttr on teh net" is its own signal.

In general the argument I would make for proper SPAG (Spelling, Punctuation, And Grammar) is "do it the standard way and people focus on /what/ you said, not /how you said it/."
