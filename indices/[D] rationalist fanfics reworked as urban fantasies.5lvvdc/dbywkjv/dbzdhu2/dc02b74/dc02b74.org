Well, in the abstract it may be a waste, but given the difficulty of breaking the low-status associations of poor spelling/grammar, I'm not sure it's an argument against it. Some people (myself included) are distracted enough by poor spelling/grammar that it can ruin our enjoyment of whatever is being written. That enough is a good reason to type in full sentences, particularly for people who want high readerships.
