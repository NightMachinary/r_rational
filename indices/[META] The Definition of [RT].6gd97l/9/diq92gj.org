I've also had trouble trying to explain what [RT] is. Even with the sidebar as a guide, it doesn't come across as being particularly distinguished. Allow me to add a few ruminations.

Personally, I would add a point to the sidebar definition: Inexploitability. That is, if a character finds an exploit in the setting, there has to be a really good reason why no one else has found it before; and once known, it should be exploited to the maximum. This probably falls under the "consistent rules" clause, but I feel it deserves it's own point.

Lately I've been listening to /The Wheel of Time/. It's a bit dated, I know, but my sister is reading it, and I never finished reading it back in the day, so I'm taking the opportunity now, while I have someone to talk to it about. The contrasts with [RT] are quite stark. It should be noted that the series is an important influence for the fantasy genre as a whole.

It did some things that were unique within the genre at the time, and does have some [RT] elements. Characters have unique motivations which draw them into conflict with one another (which is super annoying because these characters are on the same side of the main good/evil conflict). What magic can and cannot do is fairly well circumscribed as the series progresses (there is a significant tonal shift after the third book, where the bounds of magic start to solidify).

But on the whole, this is not an [RT] work. From the very first book, the rules are laid out: the plot weaves as the plot wills. It is very explicit that the plot does what it wants without rhyme or reason. On the smallest pretext characters will stop what they are doing (things that seemed very important), and begin doing something else, or making decisions that are ridiculous on the surface simply because the author needs them somewhere else now. Also, the overarching conflict, which is very much simply "good vs. evil" is quite removed from [RT]. The very idea that men need to be subservient to some greater evil in order to go bad, or if not, that evil must be quantifiable and leave some imprint on the world -- these are all left over ideas from a previous era of fantasy writing (though I still find it showing up with disturbing regularity).

And then there's the idiot ball. Everyone takes their turn carrying it, and mostly for plot purposes, but if I'm being honest, that's how people are in real life. Real people are idiots. We all make what was in hindsight, a really dumb decision for really dumb reasons.

I've also been watching a bit of Doctor Who lately. And while I quite enjoy it, it's very far from [RT]. Even when it's trying its hardest, it still has quite a ways to go. There was this exchange last season between Clara and Missy (in /The Witch's Familiar/): "Why does the Doctor always win?" ... "Because he knows there's always a way out. And he keeps searching until he finds it." Needless to say, this isn't [RT]. There isn't always a way out. Why should there be? You can go for the Hail Mary play when your options are closed off, but it's called that for a reason. Most of the time, it won't work and you just lose.

I was once listening to David Brin talk about writing, and he said something about how every author should write a murder mystery. Some kind of fair-play whodunit. It doesn't matter the genre, or the setting. It doesn't need to be a detective story. There has to be a mystery, and the audience should be able to figure out the solution a few paragraphs before the reveal. He said this is an important skill for writers to master, because even if they aren't writing a murder mystery, their stories should have mysteries and questions for the reader to answer, and things should come together at just the right moment. I think this is something we value in [RT] stories.
