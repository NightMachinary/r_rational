Despite a few arguments I've made before, it's not entirely possible to define rational fiction as "fiction where a reader can make accurate predictions about the story, its characters, and its universe from information previously given in the story." While that definition holds for much of any particular story, it doesn't cover the base case of recieving no information, and thus it doesn't cover any new exposition.

Instead, I think an /exclusionary/ definition is superior-- that either information, once given, isn't contradicted (so, for example, if a character is established as being able to use "x" and "y" skills, and is established as using ONLY "x" and "y" skills, then they don't have a "z" skill) OR that if the information /is/ contradicted, then the reader can see that the information wasn't actually trustworthy to begin with, and therefore reveals not a contradiction, but how the story was all along (so, for example, if the character suddenly reveals that they had a "z" skill, then you can look back on the text and see that skill "z" was conspicuous in its absense-- both that skill using skill "z" wouldn't have been superior to using skill "x" or "y", but also that there were absolutely no situations where the use of skill "z" was warranted and they didn't use it.)

So from the perspective of character action,

1. You can predict the actions they WON'T take by examining their internal motivations and the resources available to them.\\
2. You can predict what internal motivations they DON'T have by examining the actions they took given the resources available to them.
3. You can predict what resources AREN'T available to them by examining the actions they took given their internal motivations.

And from the perspective of setting details and mechanics,

1. You can predict the details and mechanics that DON'T exist by the path the plot has currently taken,
2. You can predict the paths the plot WON'T take by the revealed details and mechanics of the setting.

Now, in the end, this ends up looking like a fair play whodunnit because a reader can generally look at the plot, eliminate a bunch of obviously and less-obviously specious predictions, then from the remaining solution space, make on-point predictions.

That being said, while all of this means that "good writing" and "rational fiction" /do/ tend to intersect, this definition of rational fiction leaves plenty of space for bad writing.

Take an portal fantasy story where a normal person wakes up in fantasyland. In good fiction, the author is expected to either treat the story as actually being real, or provide enough foreshadowing that it was a dream so readers don't feel like they're being shafted. In rational fiction, the author can wake them up with no warning in chapter three and write the rest of the story using a lorem ipsum generator because by the established rules of the text, the events in the fantasy world being a dream couldn't ever be ruled out as a possiblity.

So the tl;dr is that to be rational fiction, a work must take great pains to avoid plot holes of any sort, even the plot holes that most people don't usually contextualize as plot holes (for example, how most in most fiction, "munchkining the everloving shit out of new abilities" /isn't/ the norm), which makes rational fiction more likely to also be good fiction in that it avoids a common pitfall of bad fiction, but doesn't actually make the fiction good in and of itself.

Do note that, just like how even good fiction isn't always flawless, rational works don't tend to be entirely rational, sacraficing rationality at the altar of either "being narratively satisfying" or the altar of "authors aren't perfect."
