I've seen this topic come up before, and as far as I know there's no real consensus on what makes rational fiction.

The best way I have to frame it, which is sort of a non-answer but still sounds helpful, is that we consider a fiction [RT] when it fits the [[/r/rational]] zeitgeist. The zeitgeist includes the obvious like HPMOR or The Metropolitan Man, but also things like UNSONG, Mother of Learning, or Worm. Really, this pushes the question into 'what defines the [[/r/rational]] zeitgeist?', but it helps with a few points:

- In broad strokes, the zeitgeist encompasses fiction we all enjoy, which biases towards good fiction. This can create the not entirely untrue impression that we consider works [RT] when they are good fiction, but it would be more accurate to say it is rare for bad fiction to be [RT].

- Due to the zeitgeist of [[/r/rational]] being largely derived from the rationalist community, there are themes that are common in [RT] fiction, and there are also themes that are very rare in [RT], so the zeitgeist is not purely 'good fiction'. An example of this is Doctor Strange, which had a thread a while back about it being the furthest thing from rational, and having watched it I can confirm that it espouses themes that few here would agree with, but it is still good fiction.

- What is and isn't [RT] is hard to define not because we have trouble deciding what is and isn't (more than normal, that is), but because the zeitgeist is a nebulous thing composed of intricate facets related to our common ideals, preferences, and knowledge bases. The best simplification is that [RT] is 'what [[/r/rational]] likes', but that's not quite accurate as it implies subjectivity, as if [[/r/rational]] were a book club making recommendations, where what is and isn't [RT] is something that, in theory, can be objectively evaluated without bringing [[/r/rational]] into the mix. Still, without a proper description of the zeitgeist, it's the non-answer that's most accurate.

What we see on the sidebar derives from that last point. The sidebar describes a few traits or themes often seen in rational fiction, but it's not definitive because we don't know everything that makes up the zeitgeist, why a world as insane as UNSONG is part of it but Doctor Strange is not, why Worm is on the edge but Mother of Learning is fully part of it, and so on and so forth. We're working from induction here, the best we can do is take what we know is part of the zeitgeist and dissect it, comparing and contrasting to other works in and out of the zeitgeist, and hope we can gleam a bit more of what it is that make us 'know' that a story belongs here.

We can still probably do a better job on the sidebar, though, or at least make it look more like the pieces of a larger jigsaw puzzle that it is.
