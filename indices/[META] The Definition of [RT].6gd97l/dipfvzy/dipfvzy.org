[[/u/DaystarEld]] and I have an episode about this on [[https://soundcloud.com/rationally-writing/what-is-rational-writing][Rationally Writing.]]

The short answer I usually give is that rational fiction is "thinky" in some way. It's steeped in thought and meant to be consumed with thought in mind, rather than just passively consumed. That leads to a bunch of knock-on effects, like a lack of artistic license, more fleshed out characters, more introspection, more consistent rules, etc., but I consider those necessary but not sufficient (and actually, not all that necessary so long as the central focus of the story is on /thought/ in one form or another). I guess it's also important to distinguish between 'thought as superpower' and actual inner workings of thought, since I think it would be pretty easy to have the facade of thought without actually displaying (or creating) the meat of thought for the reader.
