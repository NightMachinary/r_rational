One of the common threads here seems to be 'there's no formal definition here, [RT] is whatever everybody says is [RT]' which makes sense in the context of this community being relatively new, relatively small and relatively decentralized. We all just showed up one day with our own idea of what it means and there hasn't been time to really hash out a common definition, and there's no one up at the top to really lay down the law. I imagine that in time we'll develop a clearer explanation.

Personally, I think of rational fiction as fiction which is trying to be good in certain ways.

There's more of an emphasis in ironing out certain wrinkles with the end goal of making sure that there are no holes in the worldbuilding or character motivations or whatever. Rational writers are trying to create a certain type of good story with certain desirable traits.

Given that most stories are trying to be ‘good' across the board in every aspect, I think a key aspect of it is the priority given to those traits.

So, a writer might have the goal of, say, set up an interesting dynamic between two characters, but there's also a different goal that everything makes sense and lines up neatly. Wherein a ‘regular' writer might decide to gloss over some minor hole in character motivations for the sake of doing something cool (maybe giving some cursory explanation that doesn't hold up to proper scrutiny), a ‘rational' writer is going to find that that second goal takes priority and just steer clear of the whole situation.
