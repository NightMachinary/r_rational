I appreciate that work through, in some detail, the exceptions and buts to the go-to hallmarks of [rt], such as consistency and intelligence.

Though, if I may remark with regards to your first point- a world whose inconsistency is exploited, is a world whose inconsistency exists in-universe, as opposed to author error. If the inconsistency exists, keeps doing so, and is acknowledged, I would argue we really only have a consistent world, the first rule of which is that the other rules can and do change.
