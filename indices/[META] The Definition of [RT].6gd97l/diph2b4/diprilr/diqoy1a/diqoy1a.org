  hard science fiction is actually just rational fiction in the scifi genre

I wouldn't agree with this. Sci-fi is hard if it is compatible with the physical laws of our universe. It does tend to be rational, because that's how its writers tend to think. But rationality is neither necessary nor sufficient for being hard sci-fi.

  rational fics with fantasy settings are just hard scifi set in universes with different rules than our own

This actually seems like a pretty great characterization, and I plan to use it next time I have to explain to someone.
