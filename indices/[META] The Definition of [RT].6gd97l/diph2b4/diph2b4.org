Wh-what? Your partner is just wrong.

The way I'd broadly define rational fic off the top of my head is that it is reductionistic. Settings have inviolable laws, which can be tested and defined. Magic A is Magic A. Causality always ensues.

So that's basically just hard science fiction.

But fiction posted in this subreddit generally include one or more of the following characteristics, and through them and a few others ratfic can be classified as a subgenre of hard sf:

One or more of the central characters are mentally superior to the others, usually in the form of being more intelligent or having a better grip on logic. Expect them to have weak abilities such as bug control or mental opacity but accomplish the impossible through ruthlessness and wicked cleverness.

The magic system is shamelessly cheated or exploited. One trivial example is using a network of masochists to circumvent the cost of an exchange system which transmutes pain into wishes.

Popular fiction or fictional concepts are rationalized: underlying rules are devised post hoc that make an irrational setting or idea actually sensible.

A focus on utilitarian, transhumanist, and other rationalist ideas.
