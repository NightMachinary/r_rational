I think it can be broken into two major groupings: aspects of good fiction that we insist on (though others let them slide), and features above and beyond the requirements for good fiction.

**** Key aspects of good fiction:

- *Coherence:* The rules stay the same throughout the story, unless a specific, rules-governed mechanism is used to change them. Further, they don't contradict each other. In short, this is a setting that can be reasoned about, even if the geometries are strange and the physics deliberately and openly runs on metaphor and rule of cool (as Pandemonium's does).
- *Fully-Dimensional Characters:* The simplest thing here is that no one carries an idiot ball. It's deeper, though: each character ideally has their own unique set of terminal values feeding their utility function, and their own personal set of biases and available information. They reason, they try, they strive, they fail, they succeed.
- *Only & Always In-Story Explanations:* Everything that happens occurs for an entirely in-setting reason. If the cavalry arrives, the cavalry existed before their arrival, even if they were entirely off-screen. Their lives and training and gear had impacts and costs. Likewise, there's more than just the one bar that the MC goes to, and those other bars have their own patrons. The pub-goer you need to talk to about the MacGuffin might frequent a different bar. The world needs to be better specced---a setting, not a set.

**** Steps Beyond Good Fiction:

     :END:

- *Give the Readers the Tools:* At no point should the MCs use something the readers don't have access to in their reasoning process. If they're using the knowledge that Vile-Land is to the north, and Vile-Land has been mentioned before, it probably should have been described as being north of Protagonistia. Ideally, the readers should be able to figure things out just before the MCs do if they work at it. Even if they don't, they should be able to look back and see the clues.
- *Independently Motivated Evil:* No one is evil for evil's sake. Either the villain values something alien to the protags, the villain and the protag have access to different information, or one of them is just plain wrong (this should have painful consequences for someone). The point of this is that they're motivated by actual goals, not t3h evuls.

These are just a few ideas, riffing on the general concept.
