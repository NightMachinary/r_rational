"It makes some goddamn sense for once and tries to make this the one thing that can't be compromised."

Star Wars is great fun and a favorite of mine, but holy shit is it not rational. The first movie's sense of pacing is very much something to be emulated, and the overarching plot, actions, and characters are all classic for a reason. /Nevertheless/, there is a gap between such "good fiction" and rational fiction. If you scrutinize it, there are plot holes, character/group motivation issues, and inconsistent setting problems, all of which are exacerbated with the addition of each new film.

"Rational fiction" and "good fiction" are not the same thing. You can have a rational fic that is boring, poorly written, with awful pacing, wooden dialog, unsympathetic characters, and all sorts of other blights upon literature, while still /technically/ fulfilling all of the things in the sidebar. And on the flip side, fiction can have the opposite of all those things and still be missing the Rational moniker.

I mean, come on, there aren't many who would claim Harry Potter is "bad fiction", and yet Methods of Rationality simply took that work, filled in the holes, and gave it a new spin. It managed to add "rational" to the work without taking away too much from the part that made it "good".

I think what happens when people make the "rational fiction is just good fiction" argument is, they see the four things on the sidebar and don't have anything to compare it to. There's no [[/r/good_fiction]] that has a sidebar with eight bullet points that constitutes What Makes Good Fiction. They don't feel the need to make such a list! Surely they're no monkey and they know what they like.

So rather than comparing those eight imaginary points to the four that are here and noticing the differences, they get lost in the vague software in their brain that identifies good fiction, and can't see any discrepancies, so they assume we're talking out of our ass.

Part of the problem is, this is not authoritative. It is not based on some empirical natural law, that a book with so many R-particles is rational fiction. This definition arose after people read Methods of Rationality, and Luminosity, and other related "fix-fics", and tried to put their finger on what exactly made those pieces of fiction desirable that James Bond somehow lacks.

And then we wanted more of it and fiction writers who came after have this list in the back of their mind, and what do you know, having the list around produces stuff that, by and large is compatible with the tastes of those of us who came here because of Metropolitan Man or Methods. If someone comes along with an existing work and finds it fits the bullet points, chances are there's a good number of us that are going to like it.

That means there's /something/ there. Maybe we're missing a bullet point or two, or maybe we've fundamentally missed what exactly is appealing about these works, but the fact is that we are served better by using the sidebar than not using it. Those who think it's not describing a distinct class of work either haven't read any of the perennial examples, or didn't care for them and so don't value the things that we think we've identified as the lowest common denominator.
