  Interesting. I know that magical realism is sort of unpopular around here, but I've always considered it to be fairly rational.

Rationalist fiction is about worlds that change themselves in response to the events in a story's premise.

Magical Realism, in contrast, is about blending fantastic elements into our world in a way that leaves our world fundamentally unchanged.[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_realism#Real-world_setting][1]][[https://www.britannica.com/art/magic-realism][2]] More, the magic remains unexplained, and uninvestigated.[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_realism#Authorial_reticence][3]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_realism#Ambiguities_in_definition][4]]

Magical realism has the genre-convention that the world stays the same in response to events that should change the world. This violates rule 1.

The authors explicitly avoid constructing consistent rules for their fantastic elements. And characters are, by genre convention, forbidden from getting curious about those rules or trying to investigate them. This violates rules 3 & 4.

Magical Realism and [RT] are diametrically opposed on the axis of, "how do people respond to the fantastic?" This is so core to each genre, that I'd see Magical Realism as one of the only genres that can't be [RT].
