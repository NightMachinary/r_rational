  Magical Realism and [RT] are diametrically opposed on the axis of, "how do people respond to the fantastic?"

Put that way, I think I agree with your assertion a lot more. I still wouldn't say that magical realism /can't/ be [RT], or vice-versa; I think you could probably introduce a limited enough magic, and accomplish enough tone-setting through description and such to end up with a story that is recognizably both [RT] and magical realist. I'll concede, though, that any such story would necessarily be a non-central example of both categories.
