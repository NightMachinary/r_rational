  /A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings/ is very much not [RT]. Magical realism is excluded, almost by default.

Interesting. I know that magical realism is sort of unpopular around here, but I've always considered it to be fairly rational. It generally fulfills bullet points 1 and 2, and I usually get the impression that it fulfills 4. (An important caveat to points 1 and 4 is that, just because things that happen need reasons, and the world has consistent rules, doesn't mean that the readers need to know what those reasons or rules are. A lack of self-contradiction is enough, so long as convenient coincidences are kept to a minimum.) /A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings/ seems to meet this standard, though I agree its not at all what we mean when we talk about rational fiction.

On the other hand, M. Night Shyamalan's /Lady in the Water/ is magical realism that meets bullet points 1, 3, and 4 of rational fiction (and 2, too, I think; I forget whether the "monsters" in it are agents of an enemy state or just dumb beasts that like the taste of Narf, but neither is evil in the sense of "wants bad outcomes for no good reason). It doesn't have much in the way of munchkining, slow growth of power, a puzzle-solvable plot, or other characteristic rational tropes, but I think it's not crazy to call it rational.

Magical realism isn't opposed to rational fiction any more than ordinary realism is. I think it's just that authors in both genres are not really interested in telling the kinds of stories that rational fiction readers want to hear.
