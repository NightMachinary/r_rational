  She objected to [RT] as being indistinguishable from just "good fiction" as understood by the present academic literature establishment.

That definition seems at odds with my understanding of literary fiction.

Gabriel García Márquez has a Nobel prize in literature. But *A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings* is very much not [RT]. Magical realism is excluded, almost by default.

I think it's useful to categorize genres based on their "payoff". That's the aspect of the book that readers are really looking forward to, and leaves them drooling.

In a romance genre, the key "payoffs" seem to be notable b-plots, and exceptionally good reconciliation scenes. Authors can hit those points hard to make their books stand out within the genre.

In speculative fiction, the key "payoff" is the world-changing idea that an author's exploring. Characters might be good. But it's sense of "if I were in that world, I'd ..." that makes books stand out in that sense.

In much of literary fiction, the "payoff" is an author doing interesting things with our expectations around the structure of a story, or even the physical layout of the book.

Other literary fiction seems to have a "payoff" focused around really building a sense of empathy with one or more characters. I think this might be what your friend is referring to. The idea is that a character who does stuff for no reason would break the reader's empathy and pull us out of the story.

Rational fiction seems to differ in two key ways. The big one is that the "payoff" is the feeling of a really clever plot-resolution. Characters need to be smart enough that the resolution is satisfying. But we don't really need to get into their head.

The second way is that, in my opinion, literary fiction allows for some kinds of 'stylized' secondary characters (read: the incurious idiots who populate magical realism) that are excluded from RT fiction.
