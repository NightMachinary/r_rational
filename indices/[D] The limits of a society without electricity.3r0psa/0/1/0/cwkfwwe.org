A monument to overthinking:

+I already considered this. What you're talking about is called free-space optical communication, achieved by laser or parabolic reflector.+

+First of all, a short relay length like the Great Wall (as depicted in Mulan, because I don't know anything about the actual Wall) is not going to cut it for long-distance communication. The Great Wall was one signal path with many relays staffed by many guards, and the average signal change speed was about 1/3600th of a baud. Sure, they set the wood on fire real nice, but how the fuck are they going to put it out? The Great Wall is not the best lead-in for your proposal; it is closer approximated by a fuse than a cable.+

+Let's look at the output of our relay stations. The lamps can't use electricity, meaning the only way we actually have to produce light is by burning fuel. So we have mechanically-modulated gas fires, and parabolic reflectors to get the signal to the next relay station. We already have problems here. Gas fires are better at producing heat than light, so increasing light output means increasing heat. Parabolic reflectors are not very efficient at redirecting from a point source like a flame, either, so you need a lot of light to make a usable signal out of the tiny fraction you have to work with. You need facilities that can withstand and dissipate the waste heat from the fire that provides all this light, and you need a large flow of fuel so you can make your signal as bright as possible. This means you want as few relays as possible, because they drain fuel like a motherfucker. It's true that increasing the distance between relays increases your energy costs, but there's an optimal medium between fuel flow and relay distance.+

+Now input. There's no way to take a light signal and use it to automatically modulate the relay station's signal fire. We have no way of detecting light because we don't have electromagnetism. That means human relay operators, which are fucking expensive themselves. This is different from telegraph operators, too, because if a telegraph operator is absent, the signal still propagates, because its medium doesn't actually pass through the human. In our system, the operator has to be present to modulate the flow of fuel to the signal fire. Our feasible relay distance is pretty short due to the cost constraints on fuel flow, which gets worse the shorter the relay distance is, and the small usable fraction of the flow energy, which gets worse the longer the relay distance is. Now with humans added, and their presence necessary to even continue the propagation of a signal? That is incredibly expensive and unreliable, and this isn't even bringing up things like the cost of human operators living in remote locations.+

+You can find the most cost-effective relay distance from these variables, although this is a simplification to begin with. You'll notice, though, that these are massive costs for any level of reliable communication across long distances. What you're saying is that you can communicate through a series of fire-lit lighthouses. I mean, yes, technically you can. But the most cost-effective way of communicating through human-manned lighthouse relay is still fucking expensive. When you add materials and construction costs, unreliability of human operators, the cost of providing and maintaining fuel lines, the cost of multiple human operators in every relay, no matter how remote... I doubt even the Civil fucking War would inspire this kind of insane infrastructure. The value added by these monstrosities is retardedly small next to the investment required. It just isn't tenable. The bandwidth this Rube Goldberg machine coughs out is nowhere near the bandwidth a mail train provides, and it's an order of magnitude more expensive and less reliable for your efforts, too.+

+I doubt real-world experiment or rigorous calculation will show my analysis to be incorrect, unless I've made some serious errors in my estimation of the visible light output of gas fires through parabolic reflectors at a distance. However, even with the small chance that I'm wrong, this is exactly the sort of analysis that would prevent this idea from ever being tried in the first place. You're not going to see optical communication in this setting.+
