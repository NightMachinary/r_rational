over all? It was easier to use muscle power fed with carbon rich materials to do most things then burn valuable carbon rich materials to forge metal to make circuits to convey energy.

They did eventually discover electricity and used it in manufacturing and eventually gather and direct power directly but the entire convoluted sort of journey to ever think of using it to transfer information never caught on because teaching a piece of brain in a fleshy life support system to process light sent over a fibreoptic wire reliably was easier then trying to invent a microchip.

Then again Deep nobles over all are not actually very innovative. Good at recognizing ideas when they find them but not particularly prone to inventing disruptive ideas.
