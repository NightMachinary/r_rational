Pressure drop through the transmission lines would mostly be a problem with steam, as a consequence of it only being useful when hot... fairly long pneumatic transmission lines are still used today, limited (mostly, probably) by the high cost of pipe, compared to electric line.

(Mechanical power is recovered at the end of the line by an engine working within the limits of the Carnot cycle; as any pipe full of steam loses heat through its insulation and the steam cools, both available energy and efficiency go down.)
