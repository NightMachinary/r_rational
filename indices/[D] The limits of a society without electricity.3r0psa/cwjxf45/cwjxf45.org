  If human society hadn't managed to generate and store electricity either because of cultural changes or simply because of some physical law that prevented us from harnessing it, would we have been able to reach the level of development we do today?

No. Electromagnetics was key to human development even in the 19th century. Without electricity, you don't get any of the long-distance communication innovations that revolutionized warfare and commerce. No telegraph (see American Civil War), no radio, no telephone. No appliances that use electricity. You have to transport power through gas lines, and you would have to burn it on-site to produce steam that doesn't lose too much pressure before powering various fixtures around the house. You wouldn't have electrical lights, even arc lights, so both in lighting and in heating applications like stoves, ovens, and water heaters (not sure if this needs to be separate from the steam engine) you have to burn it in many locations around the house. This represents a much greater fire hazard.

Mechanical computers could very well be miniaturized, though you are not going to see parity with electric computers for quite a long while. See The Diamond Age for technology that uses nanomechanical rods for computation (and they still use electricity, I believe). To get miniaturized mechanical computers on the level of ASICs, you essentially have to invent nanotech. Even then, you're not getting anything like an internet. At best you have near-field communication with HF audio. Still, you're going to see some pretty intricate mechanical components after Turing makes his mark. Not sure what the hell an efficient steam-mechanical computer would use, but binary is a questionable assumption to make.

Production and automation continues. Until mechanical computers become cheap enough to control general machining components (minicomputers with little to no communication in the components themselves), humans will be a part of the assembly line for a much longer time. Farming will be similar, though I don't know exactly how.

For entertainment. Film will be fairly unhindered (though audio will suffer). Music as well: steampunk vinyl. Magnetic tapes will never be a thing, so no cassettes or VCR Television will never be a thing. Radio will never be a thing. Books and comics would be the /primary/ source of entertainment while you're waiting for the next Hollywood release to be shipped to your town, or for a touring concert to reach you. Plays and musicals would also be very big. Lasers won't exist. Light shows will be nonexistent.

I don't know exactly where electromagnetics is used most in medicine, but I imagine it will be severely hindered. No pacemakers, no defibrillators, no imaging save manual X-rays (using radioactive isotopes), a lot of medicine never gets invented, no monitoring patients remotely (electrocardiograph? Psh.). A lot of things. No DNA or fingerprint databases. No paperless storage of /any/ data, until you get good steam-mechanical computer memory. Even then, you would have no way of scanning things, because computer cameras use EM to detect light.

All in all, societal progress would take a good long while to get to the level we're at today. Electricity saved all our asses.

Please note that nuclear-steam is still an option here. There are no batteries until nuclear. And in the future, you will have people driving around and powering their houses with thermonuclear isotopes. Also note that this world is as much dieselpunk as it is steampunk. Gasoline does not go away.
