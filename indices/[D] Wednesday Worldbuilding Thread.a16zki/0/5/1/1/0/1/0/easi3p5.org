  ...3rd level cleric spell that makes enough food for 3 humans and a horse for a day per caster level. So at level 3 you could make enough food for 9 people and 3 horses.

You would not be able to do that at level three. Note that you need a 5th-level cleric to cast a 3rd-level cleric spell, both in 3E, 5E, and Pathfinder. Check the spells per day for the cleric class. Spell levels and character levels are not the same.
