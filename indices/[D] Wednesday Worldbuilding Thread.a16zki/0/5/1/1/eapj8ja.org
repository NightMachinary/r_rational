I don't know from which edition Brandon Sanderson got his information, from what he said (and IIRC) it was a level 1 spell you could do once a day. It was enough to feed a party of 4 at level 1.

What changes are army supply, sieges, starvation, ship travel, economy, trade, family sizes, population density etc..
