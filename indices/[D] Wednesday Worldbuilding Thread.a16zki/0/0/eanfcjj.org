the stagnation is because tolkein had it. tolkein was a luddite. everyone copying it does so without the full reference so it makes a lot less sense.

aside from that- i tend to see the players as being in an age of improvement and recovery, after a great evil befell the land. which keeps happening, and will happen again if the heroes fail.

a lot of the D&D world makes sense when you consider both the mythology of D&D (aboliths and mind flayers in very old days, followed by other monsters, then elves and dwarves, then men), and remember that the same outer planes serve a multitude of material planes (you get to different ones via the ethereal plane). so we are looking at a post-diasporia, oftern post-apocalypse setting that has magic and a variety of different thinking races- many of whom are tribal and violent to outsiders. true polymorph could explain the wide variety pre-diasporia, possibly as the result of specific transhuman individuals ascending to godhood. the elven mythology is that they fell from godhood and remember this as children. mind flayers eat and accumulate brains, which has a slightly different interpertation in a transhuman setting.

in 5e, anyone CAN get cantrips- all those pesky gnomes have minor illusion, all high elves have 1 cantrip, and any variant human can start with 2 cantrips and a 1st level spell from the list of their choice. so the weakest magic is actually very common, and people probably learn spells that help their jobs (or have a profession that matches their magic). humans also get a skill of choice, which is a rather nice bonus.
