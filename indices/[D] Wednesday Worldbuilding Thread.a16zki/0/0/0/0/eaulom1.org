It's pretty common in D&D to have high-tech fallen/elder civilizations, and high-tech spacefaring civilizations that rarely visit backwaters like the standard campaign setting.

So there's really no reason to postulate stagnation. The standard D&D setting is basically Mythic Medieval Europe; surrounded by the ruins of Mythic Rome/Greece, potentially developing into D20 Modern and eventually going to reach Spelljammer.

There are also usually one or more nonhuman prehistoric civilizations in the standard D&D setting, which may have suffered an apocalypse (Aboleths, Primordialos, Mishtai, Yuan-Ti, Sarrukh, Eberron giants), simply not care much about apes scratching in the mud (most planar races, most Spelljammer races, Eberron dragons), or both (Illithids, elves).
