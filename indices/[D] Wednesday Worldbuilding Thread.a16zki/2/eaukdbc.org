Working on a world that's basically modern-ish, but with a lot of technology replaced with tailor-made organisms, many of them sapient. Think the Flintstones universe, or Twig, or a classic AI-but-no-superintelligence scifi setting with the robots being made of meat.

Key point - the setting has a single, powerful, benevolent-ish, center-left government dominated by baseline humans. So things are constructed to mostly benefit baseline humans, but with some basic rights for the transhumans.

For example, in this world a high-end fancy chair would have arms to pass you things, be a highly skilled masseuse, and an insightful media critic who curates your collection for you so that you always have stuff you like to watch. It has a sleepy sort of personality that doesn't mind being a chair, although it likes to sometimes watch TV when you're out. You pay it a dollar a month plus room and board.

Right now I'm working on the psychology/values of the appliance-people, and the general layout of the economy. How would you predict things turning out with this kind of technology, assuming some commitment to avoid a Hansonian-style dystopia?

OK, now you've decided, here's my work-in-progress ordering of the typical manufactured person's drives in descending order of strength.

1. Don't have sad, unsuccessful kids.
2. Have kids. (Requires a good resume, because #1).
3. Feel useful and help people - especially baselines, and especially your employers.
4. Do the sort of things your intended job typically requires. (E.g. a kitchen appliance probably enjoys cooking for it's own sake.)
5. Standard human drives insofar as there's room.

Does this make sense? Do you think such a society could be stable? How much humanity would/could the appliance-people retain?
