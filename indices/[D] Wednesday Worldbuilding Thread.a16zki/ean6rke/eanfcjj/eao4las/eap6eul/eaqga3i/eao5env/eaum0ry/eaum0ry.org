As an alternate way of looking at real life, Donald Trump can annihilate any city on Earth, or even wipe out human civilization if he chooses. That's a pretty important guy in a tower (the tower has his name on in big gold letters, can't miss it.)

Of course, he's not totally independent the way an archmage is. Kind of like a high-level Cleric in a clap-your-hands-if-you-believe setting; very powerful, but only because there are lots of low- and mid-level worshippers supporting the faith.

...maybe Clerics are actually the explanation for why D&D treats the politics of mere mortals as mattering?
