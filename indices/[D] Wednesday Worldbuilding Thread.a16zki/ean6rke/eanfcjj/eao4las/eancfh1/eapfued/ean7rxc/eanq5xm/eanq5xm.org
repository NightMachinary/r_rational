I'd stay away from the direct copy* of D&D type settings. Not only is it generic, it's also not very well designed for world building, power scaling etc. It's a game system, not a storytelling system.

​

i.e lvl 1 clerics can make infinite food, so you basically break economies. An actual realistic world can't exist in this type of setting without some heavy patchwork.

​

Brandon Sanderson for instance, has talked about this extensively, in fact in Stormlight archive he has the clerics can summon food spell, this meant he had to reconstruct how wars are fought, how supply lines work, how sieges work etc. It's interesting if you can pull it off, statistically that's unlikely to happen.
