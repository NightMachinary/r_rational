I see a homebrew [[https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/6804-summon-food][summon food]] spell for 5E, which is a cantrip that basically just teleports food up to 30 feet, creating the Harry Potter banquet hall effect but requiring that you've already prepared the food to deliver. Other that, I can't find any such spell for any edition of D&D, aside from the 3rd level Create Food and Water.
