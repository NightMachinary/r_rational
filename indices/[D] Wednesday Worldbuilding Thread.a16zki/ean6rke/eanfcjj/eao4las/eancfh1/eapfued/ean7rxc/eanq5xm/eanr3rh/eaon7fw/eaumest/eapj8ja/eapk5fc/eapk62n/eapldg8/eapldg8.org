Then I probably misremembered it, which is more likely than brandon sanderson being wrong.

Still if you can summon/transmute food even if it's more expensive than a farmer, the government can hire, train and deploy those people changing society and how wars are fought, which is what happened in his story.

In his setting the clerics can turn metal, or smt into food, I don't remember exactly it's been a while since I read it.

  Soulcasting is used for a variety of purposes including food production, construction and repair, healing, and killing. Soulcastings typically happen at night, and under strict guard to keep the holy rite from being witnessed by anyone other than ardents or very high-ranking lighteyes.[3] Almost all Soulcasting individuals are members of the ardentia and need a fabrial to Soulcast. (This is just one reason why Kabsal sought to kill Jasnah, the heretic, in effort to remove her fabrial from her.[4])

  King Elhokar charges his Highprinces to use his Soulcasters to feed and house their soldiers. Most of the food and barracks at the Alethi warcamps on the Shattered Plains were Soulcast. Bridgemen often collect rocks outside of their warcamp so that Soulcasters can Soulcast them into food.[5]

*edit 2 I'm fairly sure both sites you used for your search were 5e. [[https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Create_food_and_water]] 3rd level cleric spell that makes enough food for 3 humans and a horse for a day per caster level. So at level 3 you could make enough food for 9 people and 3 horses. It's infinite food, you can argue semantics if you want but that's what it is.
