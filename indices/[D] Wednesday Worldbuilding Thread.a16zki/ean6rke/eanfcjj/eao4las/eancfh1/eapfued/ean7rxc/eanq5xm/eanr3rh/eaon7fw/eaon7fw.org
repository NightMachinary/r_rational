  i.e lvl 1 clerics can make infinite food, so you basically break economies.

Level 1 Clerics in Pathfinder cannot make food. I haven't actually played D&D 5E, but looking at the SRD it appears that [[http://5e.d20srd.org/srd/spells/createFoodAndWater.htm][Create Food and Water]] is a third level spell, which should require a 5th-level Cleric. You may be thinking of [[http://5e.d20srd.org/srd/spells/createorDestroyWater.htm][Create or Destroy Water]], a first-level spell.

Additionally, Clerics in Pathfinder can only cast spells once per day. Clerics in D&D 5E can only cast spells once per long rest, which appears to be a minimum of eight hours. So, a fifth-level Cleric could create 270 lb. of food and 180 gallons of water per day. For comparison, a pound of flour is 2 cp, and water is potentially free if you're near a river or stream, or find local wells to draw water from. A peasant hired to bake bread might cost 2 sp per day, while another peasant hired to gather firewood might cost another 2 sp per day. In total, you could provide the same value as the cleric at a cost of 5.8 gp/day, and you get extra firewood for comfort. The cleric's abilities are significant, but they don't break the economy, especially since you need a fifth-level cleric and probably won't have huge numbers of them.
