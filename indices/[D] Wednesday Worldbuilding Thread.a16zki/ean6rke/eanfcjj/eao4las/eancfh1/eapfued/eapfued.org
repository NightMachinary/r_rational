  I'm interested in some input on the general idea. What kind of stuff would you like/expect to see in a setting like this?
#+end_quote

I would expect to see, essentially, a hybridization of magic and technology. Magic can be used to advance scientific discovery and can be combined with engineering techniques to create unprecedented technologies. For examples:

- *Shrink item cannons:* A permanent shrink item effect can be activated and reversed by command word. This allows you to create a piston which is magically activated and produces unspecified but presumably enormous amounts of force. With a pressure-triggered butterfly valve, you can exploit that to create air-operated guns and cannons which fire without black powder. Expensive at 7,500 gp, but may be occasionally seen.

- *Green industrial revolution:* With permanent wall of fire, a steam engine can be run without coal. It becomes cheaper to operate and does not produce pollution. Expensive at 10,000 gp, but the wall is 20 ft. long per caster level (140 ft. at minimum caster level), so you can run a /lot/ of steam engines with one. A steam-powered ship using this could be the equivalent of a modern commercial cargo container ship, moving tens of thousands of tons hundreds of miles per day. Electricity becomes cheap and affordable, and factories running on steam power produce absurd quantities of goods at lower prices.

- *Animated industrial equipment:* Animate object can be made permanent for 15,000 gp. This can be used to make gargantuan cranes, tunnel-boring machines, earth-movers, and strip-mining excavators. The industrial revolution can go into full-swing with the abundance of resources these provides.

- *Magical manufacturing:* The [[https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/fabricate/][fabricate]] spell can be used to create things that might take weeks by hand within a minute or so. Making complex arrangements of vacuum tubes and wiring, lenses, gear assemblies, valve and piston arrangements, nuts, bolts, screws etc. has never been so easy. Watches, clocks, mechanical calculators, microscopes, telescopes and cryptography machines, and even internal combustion engines could become commonplace.

- *Synthetic meat:* Stone to flesh can turn plain old stone into meat. At minimum caster level, the cost to hire a caster (660 gp) and the mass of meat produced (about 17,600 lb.) yields meat at about 3.7 copper pieces per pound. Not as cheap as flour, but cheap enough to become the staple meat for most of the world.

- *Divination science:* Some spells, like [[http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/contact-other-plane/][contact other plane]], allow scientific hypotheses to be tested using the knowledge of near-omniscient beings. This would allow rapid advances in the understanding of physics, quantum physics, chemistry, biology, neurology, and more. Batches of hypotheses could be tested every day, leading to an explosion of scientific discovery, within the limits of the knowledge of the gods.

- *Autonomous medical tools:* Yes, there's healing magic, no need for medical science, right? Except for when you want to enhance someone or prevent problems, rather than merely fix damage. For example, there's no 'tummy tuck' spell, no 'enhance dental hygiene' spell, no 'stent coronary artery' spell, etc. You'll still need surgeons and dentists, unless you make their scalpels, needles and scaling tools intelligent items capable of flying and acting autonomously. Now the tools can get to places that no human could get to and work with an efficiency that would make a hospital administrator blush.

- *Teleportation networks:* Teleportation circles make the world a very small place. As long as you're traveling legally, you can inexpensively go from one place to another instantaneously. Cities would be defined largely by the convenience of reaching their access points to the teleportation network. The world will quickly turn into a place of sharp contrasts between urban and rural, with massive and literal city-states glittering with the light of millions of torches of continuous flame as they transform into the central powers of the world.

- *Decanter of endless water rockets:* A standard decanter on jet mode provides enough power to push a holder back, i.e. thrust. An endless water rocket that could be used for interplanetary voyages, if enough decanters are available. This could be enhanced by running the water into a magical heat source, like going into a chamber with a permanent wall of fire and then being propelled out of a narrow nozzle as a steam rocket. Moon exploration and colonization of other planets is suddenly even more feasible than in real-life. A high-cost technology that would be explored by the larger city-states. Getting teleportation circles on other worlds would be the start of the interstellar-expansion phase of such a society.
