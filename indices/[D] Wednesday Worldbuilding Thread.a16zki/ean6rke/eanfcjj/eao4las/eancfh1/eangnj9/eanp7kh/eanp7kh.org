It also seems like it could be tied into the civilization's culture, and their relationship with nature. There's a thing a lot of people do where an elven civilization is closer to nature, but there's some variation in how this manifest - they're nomads living in "tents" designed to be set up in trees, or they use magic to reshape the trees into houses, and give them energy to grow.

There's a difference between building seamlessly on top of "nature" or reshaping it to your needs...and cutting it down, breaking it up, and and replacing it with something totally different, that requires lots of energy to maintain, etc. For example - what's the point of grass? What function does it serve? Why not grow food?
