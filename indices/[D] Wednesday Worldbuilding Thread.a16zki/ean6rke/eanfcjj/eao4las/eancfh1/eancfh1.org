Part of the stagnation seen in a lot of the settings is the insistence that history needs to have spanned tens of thousands of years. In real life? It's ten thousand years, with a lot of that simply being civilizations that didn't have the social/cultural technology necessary to progress, or for whom 'progress' was one step forward and two steps back, mixed in with a lot of social/cultural technologies that served their own functions but strangled innovation.

Personally, I almost always set my D&D campaigns in a time of progress, whether that's analogous to the Age of Enlightenment or the Industrial Revolution, and then history itself isn't all that much longer than actual Earth history, with a lot of the same 'beats' as far as the rise and fall of empires goes. Magic is typically one of the beneficiaries of advancement; there were things that people simply couldn't have done a hundred years ago, which is one of the reasons that magic didn't help as much with stagnation.

As far as differentiating types of magic, I /sometimes/ just let everything be wild and different, since that's easy, and inconsistent flavor is completely fine. If I don't, then the answer is usually 'gods'; three types of gods (or three pantheons) give arcane, divine, and nature magic. If you want a cleaving line between how these gods/pantheons think/act, then arcane gods are a meritocracy that rewarding effort and learning, divine gods prefer to choose their own mages, and nature gods are either ineffable or based on nature virtues. ('Hiding' the gods also works, this is just high-level explanation that might drive a few things if you want it to.)

The one other big thing to consider is magic items, one of the staples of D&D/Pathfinder and really important to play, but I'm not sure how you'd want to handle that, and there no one 'right' answer.
