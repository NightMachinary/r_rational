  and how that affects the rest of the society
#+end_quote

This view misses out somewhat on how society is more complex - it's a game with more players. For an example where moves are still basically Cooperate or Defect, there's littering.

#+begin_quote
  normal strategies
#+end_quote

You could make the strategies more probabilistic. For instance, a program p could cooperate on its first turn, and then use their opponents moves as a set to choose from, and pick one of those to play each turn. This:

1. always cooperates with all_c, tit for tat, spiteful, and soft majority,
2. after the first turn, always defects against all_d
3. would end up in a CDCD/DCDC loop against distrustful, and hard majority
4. Converges to playing C about 50% of the time against random
