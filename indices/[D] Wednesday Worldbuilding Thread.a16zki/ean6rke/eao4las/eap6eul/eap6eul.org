  Suppose I'm an immortal arch-mage. Some Herald comes to me and says that the King/President has decided to draft me into a war with our neighbors. Unless I care about the conflict, my answer might be laughing at the guy, and just teleporting to my demi-plane of beer volcanoes.

This kind of highlights the fundamental nature of governments. A government only really exists and has authority up to the extent that it has [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Political_power][power]], in terms of offering incentives, threatening harm, and being able to sway public opinion, powerful people, and organizations. Governments without the power to dominate will collapse, and in their wake, newer, stronger governments are formed. This is true of D&D governments as well - if it cannot control the mages, the mages will eventually control /it/. Much like in real-life, where billionaires almost entirely control the government through campaign finance and media monopolies.

With that said, consider how most governments actually treat their billionaires, as an analogy to mages. You /could/ draft Bill Gates and order him onto the front lines, allowing him to use his wealth to hire a well-equipped private mercenary army to keep himself alive as he completes the missions that you assign him, perhaps even nudging him towards an Iron Man approach. That would never happen though. Bill Gates is wealthy enough to easily flip close elections across the country in favor of legislators who will give him what he wants. If he does not want to be drafted, it would be career suicide to try.

Instead of drafting billionaires for a war, most countries would ask the wealthy to buy war bonds, /might/ raise taxes (not for stupid shit like Vietnam, but yes for serious matters like WWII), and otherwise generally not fuck with the wealthy so they can keep making money and bringing in tax revenue. This is likely to happen with mages too. The government might offer to pay them in land, money, privilege or prestige for helping in the war, but they would not try to forcefully compel a high-level mage to join the war.
