  I'm interested in some input on the general idea. What kind of stuff would you like/expect to see in a setting like this?
#+end_quote

I'd like to see an author explore the moral & political fallout of having a world where some individuals are exponentially more powerful than others.

Real-Earth people aren't all equal. Some are faster, or smarter, or stronger. But the differences between us aren't /that/ big. The strongest man in the world can deadlift 500kgs. That absolute peak of human ability gives him 10x the strength of some random highschooler.

The world's best MMA fighter would destroy me in a brawl. But he'd probably lose to 10 guys carrying sticks. So, we round down, say that 'everyone is created equal,' and create political systems where the goal is making sure that most people are happy.

But high-magic D&D settings have high-level mages. They can reshape reality on a whim, in a way that makes the low-level folk basically irrelevant. The Mages don't have to be evil about it; maybe they decide to care for us low-magic normies as a personal project, the way that I'd look after my pets.

But in the long-term, the base reality is that the stability and long-term success of any given society depends on the goals and good-will of a dozen or so known individuals. I'd love to see an exploration of what that does to people's mentalities, and the way they think about stuff like justice or democracy.

--------------

To add an example, neither Democracy or hereditary Kingship make sense in a D&D world. Suppose I'm an immortal arch-mage. Some Herald comes to me and says that the King/President has decided to draft me into a war with our neighbors.

Unless I care about the conflict, my answer might be laughing at the guy, and just teleporting to my demi-plane of beer volcanoes. Alternately, if the neighbors invade, and start threatening my tower (/the baker who makes the excellent croissants I like in the mornings) then I could turn the tide of the battle in an afternoon.

So, D&D settings have this nominal political structure, but what actually matters are the personal whims of Some Guy in a Tower.
