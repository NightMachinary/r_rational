Thanks for the reply.

I have mostly been experimenting with "Spitefull" as in some way it has parallels with DND Lawful.

So in the "Spitefull" case, I think there is going to be at least the following changes to society:

First people are going to be quite formal with deals in an attempt to minimize false defection (unaware defection)

Then there are probably also going to be a mechanic for the expulsion of defectors, but this might not be trivial as the defection is not towards the society but towards an individual, so either two individuals completely stop cooperating with each other or society needs to find some procedure to chose whom to expel, this might be solved by having clear deals so that deciding the defector is easy.

I think there are interesting societies inspired by some of the less obvious strategies such as majo, pavlov and tft.
