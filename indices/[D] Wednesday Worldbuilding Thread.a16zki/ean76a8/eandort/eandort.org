- *Always Defect:* Cooperation is only possible when there's no possibility of defection, or no incentive to defect, i.e. cases where the prisoner's dilemma doesn't apply. To the extent that it can be a functional society, it's one that's rife with corruption as people follow their incentives without regard for societal rules except those they can be punished for. It's most likely completely controlled by the people on top, who are naturally immune from the law.
- *Always Cooperate:* I think the easy answer is that they're utopic until a single non-neurotypical person or outside agent topples them ... but there's some room for other failure states, I would think. It sort of depends on /why/ they always cooperate, whether it's because they believe the best in people, or whether they expect the worst but believe in acting as though they didn't (always cooperate, with full expectation that you will be taken advantage of).
- *Spiteful:* A society that gives you one chance, and one chance only. If you step out of line, you're either exiled or killed, no longer part of the equation as far as everyone else is concerned. Presumably there would be some leeway with children, as children have a heavy tendency to step out of line. As far as how this strategy presents on the sociocultural level, I would think that it would be equivalent to claiming that some people are simply, irredeemably bad, and that as soon as they're 'found out', they need to be excised.
