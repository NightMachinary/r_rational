Applegate was pretty inconsistent regarding the Ellimist. At first there's a whole race of them, then there's the one. He's fighting a furious battle against Crayak in the name of everything good and decent and the only reason they hold back is to avoid destroying the universe, no, wait, he's just his superchess partner. Cassie is a temporal anomaly, except for some reason it didn't show in any of the three previous storylines involving time travel.
