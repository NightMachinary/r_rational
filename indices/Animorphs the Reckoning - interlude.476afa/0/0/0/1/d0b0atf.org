In the last Megamorphs book. Cassie turns to have weird "remember the original canon powers" that trigger when Crayak retcons the team into not meeting elfangor. It's mostly a very good book, because unlike every other Megamorphs and a lot of Animorphs there's not a status quo to go back to, so you're not sure what's going to happen, but the whole "Cassie is a time anchor" thing made no sense.

And yes, the inconsistencies can somewhat be explained by the narrator lying, but that's another way to justify a nonsensical plot point by saying "Because the Ellimist was bored".
