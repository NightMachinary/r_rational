I've only just discovered this subreddit, having blundered across this beautiful fic and binge-read it in entirety.

It's a work of incredible cognitive grace. When I'm addicted to rationalist fiction and recommending it to my pals, years from now, I'll be citing this fic as the one that got me into it.

Thanks for sharing it!
