lots of little things.

for instance, I was at first sort of buying the idea that the aliens were non-conscious and transmitting to them based on pattern matching, up to the point that they reacted offended to the idea that the crew thought they were a chinese room.

First, that concept is unlikely to be included in random ship transmissions. it's also a specific cultural reference not just an abstract concept. the meaning behind "chinese room" can't be inferred from pattern matching the words themselves, it's like Star Trek's "Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra" - you have to grasp the underlying metaphor.

I'm also just skeptical of the idea of Philosophical Zombies in general. the idea that they are capable of fully simulating conscious behavior but aren't actually conscious is shaky to me.
