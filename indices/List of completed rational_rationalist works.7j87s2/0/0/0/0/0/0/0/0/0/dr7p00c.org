yeah I follow. obviously the thoughts "I blah blah blah" correspond to neurons firing in a human mind, and you could have a mind that behaved the same outwardly without those thoughts occurring. This is distinct from hard pzombies, as you say. I'm not 100% sure this is the entirety of consciousness, though; it seems a bit bigger and squishier than that. I don't have to think about the fact that I am seeing, I just see, and that is part of my conscious experience. Do these non-conscious minds have memory or imagination? do they call up these memories and reflect on them, even if they don't refer to the "self" in a deliberate way? Do they plan things by imagining possible outcomes?

At some point the horror the linguist shows starts to seem a little false -- it's not that these are not minds capable of communication, even if they aren't self-narrating. Does it matter if you can communicate and understand their intent?

I like the ideas he's exploring, but I think at moments he falls into the trap of treating consciousness broadly, after having defined it narrowly.
