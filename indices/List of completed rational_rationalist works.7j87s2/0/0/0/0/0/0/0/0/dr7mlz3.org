Well, "sentient" is a fairly particular word.

The model of intelligence Watts is supposing is still sentient, still intelligent, but it lacked self-awareness. It isn't narrating to itself "I am in a bad mood. I like going into new solar systems but the buildout part is a grind. I want a salad, and more lanthanides." It's reactive, but not entirely passive. It reflects, but doesn't /self/-reflect. It doesn't get bored.

Watts is proposing that the "self," the narrator who tries to explain why its arm just moved, uses up a lot of CPU/glucose/resources and has done so as kind of an evolutionary quirk. It might be a disadvantage, and gives us the vampires (who are a little ways towards ridding themselves of "I" and these alien invaders, who might never have had it to begin with.
