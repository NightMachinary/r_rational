There are many reasons for thinking that Wertifloke is EY, but also many for Wertifloke not being EY. I wouldn't just assume that EY is Wertifloke though; HPMOR was better than TWA, in that TWA felt like a knockoff HPMOR.

Personally, I don't think that EY is Wertifloke, though many think he is. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
