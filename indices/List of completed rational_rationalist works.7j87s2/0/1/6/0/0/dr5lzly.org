yeah I think that was the root of it, there wasn't any tension after a while. she'd face someone indisputably stronger and more deadly who was absolutely trying to kill her, and get out of it through a fluke. The pattern to the action became so noticeable that I found the buildup chapters boring as I waited for the action to start, then once the action came i was just waiting for it to be over and for her to win somehow.

I'll probably go back and finish it here over the holiday when I have some time, I was almost through and I sort of want to read his follow up. I like the world building, just wish it held me more.
