Blindsight, though I didn't find it particularly enjoyable (way too dark for my taste). Of the ones I mentioned, Ra, Fine Structure and Worm (the "true rationality status" of the latter is called into question by many) are original settings.

If you don't mind if they are complete or not, just check the [[/r/rational]] backlog, there are a lot of original stories being posted. I'd recommend Worth The Candle (definitely rational) and Mother of Learning (kind of rational) out of them.
