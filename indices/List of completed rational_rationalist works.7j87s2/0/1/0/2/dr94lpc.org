  Honestly i prefer the sequel much more, because it's from a different point of view, the girl kinda puts more heart into it.

Radiance starts off extremely strong but gets into a rut about 60% of the way through and never quite recovers. I'd say before the rut Radiance is stronger than Luminosity, and afterwards it's weaker.
