The purity of a blind first read of Worm is priceless, but after finishing you should totally check out [[/r/Parahumans]] (Massive spoiler warning for the entire sub) and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/6yfjl0/weve_got_worm_podcast_readthrough_episode_195/?st=jb4b3n2s&sh=4bfb14f0][We've Got Worm]], where two literary critics perform in-depth analysis of the writing-style and craft of Worm arc by arc.
