  Time Braid: This story has the main character tortured into mindrape into another person's servitude in a very edgy way. If that seems like the kind of thing you can give a pass, feel free to read it, but it made me stop reading.

Fair enough, but i think it's worth it to get to the end, despite the fact that this part of the story exists. In fact, /because/ that part of the story exists, /don't underestimate her/, i much prefer this version of the character than the canon one. Also, of course it's edgy, [[#s][]]

  Luminosity + sequel: I think this is a rationalist story, but it misses all the fun parts of rational writing. It's just very very dry, even if it's excellently written.

Honestly i prefer the sequel much more, because it's from a different point of view, the girl kinda puts more heart into it.

  Worm: absolutely worth reading, but there are at least two long segments of the story that will make you want to stop reading (E and TS arcs). Don't stop, force yourself to skim if you have to, it's very much worth it to finish it.
