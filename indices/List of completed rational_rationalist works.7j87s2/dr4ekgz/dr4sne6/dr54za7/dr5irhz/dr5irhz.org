Yeah, Worm is by no means rationalist, it's just a good web fiction.

And yeah, after /that time/ with /that guy/ (everyone who read surely understands) nothing in the story is scary anymore because it's clear author will kill his characters when he wants to, and not earlier, no matter what the circumstances dictate.

And since circumstances don't matter, you quickly learn to not be scared of them. Half the body missing? Oh surely she'll heal somehow. Unless the author specifically wants to be a dick and kill her. Anyway, nothing I can change.

On the other hand, I had much less problems with pacing. TS? Whatever. It felt out of pace, but whatever.

It's still a nice book though.
