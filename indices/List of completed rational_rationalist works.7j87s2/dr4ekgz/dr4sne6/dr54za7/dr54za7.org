I've started and stopped reading worm so many times. I think it's the pacing - it just feels too episodic, like a penny serial. Each arc has a big baddie and she gets into a sticky situation where she should absolutely die given any shred of realism, but somehow makes it out through being scrappy. while the (*SPOILERS!!*) alternate timeline selection working in her favor early on sort of accounts for some of this, it's not always present and is still hard to swallow a lot of the time.
