I hope no one minds if I give my opinion on these, since completed doesn't always means good and I'd hate for someone to start one of these (mostly) massive works without being fully informed.

- HPMOR, Metropolitan Man, A Bluer Shade of White, Three Worlds Collide, The Last Christmas, The Waves Arisen: these works are pretty good, no real glaring flaws, funny coincidence that only two people wrote all of these.

- Ra and Fine Structure: the writer has a very long-winded, very confusing writing style and he's not very good at pacing or writing endings. It says enough about the quality of his ideas that I recommend you give it a try regardless. Just don't stick around if you are /very/ confused and don't like it, because it stays that way.

- Time Braid: This story has the main character tortured into mindrape into another person's servitude in a very edgy way. If that seems like the kind of thing you can give a chance, feel free to read it, but it made me stop reading.

- Luminosity: I think this is a rationalist story, but it misses all the fun parts of rational writing. It's just very very dry, even if it's excellently written.

- Worm: absolutely worth reading, but there are at least two long segments of the story that will make you want to stop reading (E and TS arcs). Don't stop, force yourself to skim if you have to, it's very much worth it to finish it.
