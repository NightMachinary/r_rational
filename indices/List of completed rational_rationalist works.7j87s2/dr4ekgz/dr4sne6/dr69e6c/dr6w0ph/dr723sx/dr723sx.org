No they weren't! The protagonist starts off at, like, 13-14 tops, as they're about the same age and Naruto doesn't turn sixteen until after the time skip in canon. So while she eventually does grow up, she keeps sleeping with her perpetually underage friends, using knowledge gained in previous loops to groom/seduce her underage colleagues to fuck her. That's seriously messed up. Just because /her/ body is younger than her mind the fact that she keeps sleeping with people who /used/ to be her age but are now much younger than her creeps me the fuck out.
