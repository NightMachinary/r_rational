The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August by Claire North

Basically about a man being reborn again and again, but always same place and year, and he is not the only one, now giving backwards in time comes a message that the end of the world is ist moving backward in time and coming closer ... As Harry nears the end of his eleventh life, a little girl appears at his bedside. 'I nearly missed you, Doctor August,' she says. 'I need to send a message.' ... its like a rational historical thing playing in our real world... nice writing style and absolut enjoyable! Highly recommend it!
