Seconding this recommendation. It has an interesting, unique time travel system which the author does a lot with (although it doesn't quite hold up to scrutiny), and there's some fun cat-and-mouse thriller elements to it that I really enjoyed

I will warn though that it seems to have some vaguely anti-science (or at least anti-munchkiny) themes.
