In addition, there is traditional literature that I would at least describe as /rational/ if not rationalistic. I.e., depicting smart people dealing with complicated situations intelligently and plots that aren't driven by stupidity or recklessness.

- *The Martian* by Andy Weir. Also damn good movie but the book is even better.
- *Anathem* by Neal Stephenson. His most underrated book IMHO.
- *Blindsight* by Peter Watts. First alien contact novel written by a guy who has a PhD in biology. Highly intellectual hard SciFi that is genuinely creepy.\\
- *Echopraxia* by Peter Watts. Followup to Blindsight and intellectually one of the most terrifying things I've ever read. [[http://www.rifters.com/real/blurbs.htm][Here]] are a bunch of blurbs to give you an idea. I'll quote my favourite:

  As for science fiction, well, traditionalists in the field now face some hard choices: either lobotomize themselves to dumb down enough to continue to approach SF without seeing the implications of what Watts is doing; or get serious about the science part of science fiction; or throw up their hands in helpless despair and go away and try some other genre instead. Horror, maybe --- because Echopraxia also manages to be more truly frightening than much self-styled horror fiction. ... I snarfed down this book as soon as it downloaded, and am writing this review at 6am after waking early to finish it. Recommended doesn't even begin to.
