The "hard" p-zed formulation bothers me, too. It's indistinguishable from an actual human and that sort of thing bores me a bit.

The /soft/ p-zed formulation is what Watts is talking about. Whatever data structures are being used, they've been trained on decades of human broadcasts, augmented by the Fireflies taking a "picture" of the planet, and are the result of many, many cycles of reproduction and survival. Markov Chain doesn't begin to cover it.

I've seen some /deeply/ clever chatbots before. Imagine if they reproduced and got "fit."
