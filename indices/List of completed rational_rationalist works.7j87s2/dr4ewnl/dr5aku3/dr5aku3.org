I would argue that Pact is definitely not rational, in that it breaks the rules of

#+begin_quote
  The fictional world has consistent rules, and sticks to them.
#+end_quote

and

#+begin_quote
  The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.
#+end_quote

which I believe was actually Wildbow's intention when writing that story (to create a world with nebulous rules, and an "act first, think later/never" protagonist).

Not a judgement on the story's quality, just saying it doesn't belong on the list.
