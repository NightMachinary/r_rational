Thank you for the comments. Also, I'm very sorry about the infantry, they are supposed to have rules, but I somehow managed to forget writing them. Probably because the interactions are rather complex, as you mentioned.

I'll go through some major revisions, and try to play it as well. If you like, I can let you know as soon as that's done.
