For California the chance your vote will be decisive is 1/100 million, in New Hampshire 1/70000. The mean is about 1 in 10 million.

Let's assume it takes half an hour to vote, and your vote lasts 4 years. Let's assume the average income is 20 dollars per hour, 40 k per year. The cost of a vote is 10 dollars. At the lowest value, for it to be worth it you'd need a financial benefit of 11*70000 =770,000 dollars or a potential penalty of that for it to have a clear financial benefit.

Some minor policy changes aren't going to be enough for that- you simply don't have enough to lose in four years to make that sort of gamble worthwhile. For that to be worthwhile you'd need some negative threat, like jail. If a politician promised to not imprison me for 20 years that could be 40*20=800 k worth of benefits, enough for me to vote independently.

Of course, if I actually value a policy a great deal, and really feel a substantial need to get it enacted then I'd join groups and spend money campaigning and talk to politicians. If some policy is so valuable to me that it's worth more than millions of dollars in financial changes to me then a vote isn't going to enough for me on it's own, even in a fairly small election.

Unless, of course, they promise really large benefits.
