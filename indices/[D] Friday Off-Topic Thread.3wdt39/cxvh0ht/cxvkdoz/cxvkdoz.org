Three issues, ranked from most important to least in my view:

1. Balance of opinion. The nearer each side's support is to each other side's, the more influence individual voters have: Powerful when races are close, less so when they're one-sided.

2. Volume, which you mentioned. The fewer people voting, the more power individual voters have: Powerful locally rather than nationally.

3. Quantitative effect. The more you personally will feel a difference between each option's governance, the more important your vote will be to /you/.

I'm guessing you're American, so let's take the worst case scenario: a presidential election.

Balance: Are you in a large swing state? If not your vote for anything other than a strong third party candidate is completely meaningless. A strong popular vote display for a third party candidate can provide them with election funds next time around. If you /are/ in a large swing state...

Volume: How close is a close popular vote? In 2000, the final recount in Florida came within a few hundred votes. Ohio in 2004, also famously close, was more than 100,000 votes apart. In the latter case you can still probably stay home. If you're in the Florida equivalent, however....

Effect: How much difference will one president make in your life vs another. Nobody can measure this but you.

This is extreme, but the same basic rules apply all the way down to local zoning measures and school board elections. Also, rather than just considering the time spent voting, consider the value of the time spent /researching/ your options. If the vote doesn't look like it's going to be close, or the numbers are huge, you probably shouldn't waste time on cost/benefit analysis of the available choices.
