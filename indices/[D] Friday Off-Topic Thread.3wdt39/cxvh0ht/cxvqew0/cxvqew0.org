I vote because it is my civic duty to do so, and also because as a citizen of the United States, I find it categorically imperative to vote. Not voting in order to save time while not negatively impacting government functionality is a self-defeating decision. Why? Because if universalized, this decision actually cannot be made in this form. It would negatively impact government functionality if this were a universal strategy. The only choice is to vote.

Also, when I vote, I get to loudly brag to my friends (who also brag about this) and mention that I have voted. We all talk about how cool we are for being Americans who vote. This is good and fun and cool.

Also, as mentioned by others: vote by mail.
