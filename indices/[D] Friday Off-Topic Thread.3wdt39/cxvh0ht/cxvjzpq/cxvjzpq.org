The thing about elections is that you're voting for multiple things at once, so your valuation of what voting is worth needs to take into account all the things on the ballot. If you were just voting in the national election, it probably doesn't matter [[http://www.forbes.com/sites/baldwin/2012/11/05/what-are-the-odds-that-your-vote-will-count/][depending on where you live]]. But if the local elections matter, then you're going to the polls anyway, so the additional costs involved with voting at the national and state level are marginal.

The other thing about voting is that as fewer people vote, each individual vote becomes more and more worth it. We're not anywhere near this point yet, but it's something to keep in mind. If turnout is only 50%, then your vote is worth twice as much as if everyone voted.

(I vote, because my state allows for voting by mail, which lowers the costs dramatically.)
