I'd argue that voting by mail is less efficient than either voting in person or not voting at all. If you vote in person, you might be part of a peer-pressure effect, incentivizing people who vote to keep voting, and if you don't vote none of your time gets wasted for an ultimately futile vote. If you vote by mail, your vote will be futile and you can't try to subconsciously manipulate greater voter turnout year over year.
