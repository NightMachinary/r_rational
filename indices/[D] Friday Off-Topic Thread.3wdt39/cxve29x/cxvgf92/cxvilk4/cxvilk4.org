Reading up on LLCs now.

Would it be legally valid for me to issue contracts to people such that they maintain ownership of their share of the LLC iff I use their work for the final product? I would be uncomfortable with a setup enabling people to bail on the project and still receive payment, and I'm sure my workers would be uncomfortable with a setup wherein they sign no contract until their work is completed.

For that matter, can shares of LLC ownership fluidly change over time at all?
