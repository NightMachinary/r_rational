I've been thinking. Are there more squares or rectangles in the set of all shapes?

If you define squares by <a>, where a is the side length and 0 < a < infinity, and rectangles by <a,b>, where a is the shorter side and b is the longer side, and 0 < a <= b < infinity, there ought to be more rectangles than squares, since there are more combinations of a and b than just a.

Growth rates ought to be the same, since the growth rate for squares would be n, while for rectangles it would be n^{2} /2.

Is any of the above correct, or have I gone down the rabbit hole?
