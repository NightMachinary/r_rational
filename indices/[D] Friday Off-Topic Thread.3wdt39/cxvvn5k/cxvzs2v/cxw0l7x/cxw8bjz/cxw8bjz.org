I'd note that "uncountable-infinity times" does not produce a meaningful concept, as far as I'm aware.

What you're essentially describing is a mapping of all rectangles to the points of a plane, and a mapping of all squares to a line within that plane. As the space-filling curve shows, these two mappings biject, which again, if I recall correctly, says that in as much two infinities can be considered to have any size at all, they are both the same size.
