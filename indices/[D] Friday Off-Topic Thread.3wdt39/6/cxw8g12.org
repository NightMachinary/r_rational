I spontaneously produced a board game (rule set) today, but I'm not capable of judging its playability or quality on my own. Available [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/11z27E3IVb5xILkthqRnxTdsjvngDo6o1_RTm9Aeppzk/edit?usp=sharing][here]], not reproduced in this comment due to excessive length.

I will appreciate any advice or comments that a reader cares to mention.
