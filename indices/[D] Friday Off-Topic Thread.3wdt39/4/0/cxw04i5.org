I tailor my strats for doing things to the thing I'm doing. Most what I do to "build up willpower" is actually tricking myself into being more productive, or making rules I think I can follow.

For example:

- In order to go to the gym more, I only play video games on days during which I went to the gym. If I have time for video games, I have time for the gym.

- My strategy for building up enough willpower to go to bed is to get ready for bed, wash up, change, turn off my computer, then get inside my bed. After I do this, I read if I want to, but since I'm already in bed I'm much more likely to sleep than if I'm in the living room playing video games.

- When I'm doing some kind of easier peripheral activity related to a major willpower expenditure (keeping a food diary for my diet, for example), I make sure to have fun doing that, or to convince myself it's awesome. This way, it always gets done.

- In general, try to remove obstacles to hard things and set up obstacles to things you don't want to do. If you want to go to the gym more, again, just always have a change of gym clothes in the trunk of your car, or in a gym bag ready to go. If going to the gym requires rummaging around for gym clothes, that trivial difficulty might be enough to stop you. If you're trying to avoid committing suicide, remove your gun from your immediate possession.

- Basically: Make it very easy to do what you want and hard to do what you don't want.

all of these probably fall into the category of "working with the willpower you have" rather than "building up willpower" but imo these are great
