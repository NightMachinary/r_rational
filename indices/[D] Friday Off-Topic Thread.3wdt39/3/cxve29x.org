What legal/taxation setup would be ideal for me if I wanted to start a business with essentially no capital put into it, and the workers, myself included, all paid with a fraction of profit rather than at a rate per hour, such that no surplus is kept?

To make matters more complicated, I am American and at least one of the workers would be international, working remotely.
