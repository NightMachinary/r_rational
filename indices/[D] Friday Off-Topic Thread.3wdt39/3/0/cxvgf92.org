I'm not a lawyer or etc, so you should double-check me.

It sounds like you want an LLC. All members get a percent of ownership with profits dividing based on ownership. I don't know about the international partner, though.

LLCs are generally very cheap to start -- like, $50 for paperwork sort of cheap.
