The price is just a ballpark. Obviously a society that has access to this stuff is going to have a wildly different economy than our own.

  The big limit then is the output rate, not the duration. You spend more for more effect but it lasts forever.

Yup, pretty much. It's long enough that you wouldn't necessarily know that there was a limit.

  I wonder about the bit about protecting molecular bonds. Things get dull mostly because edges wear out. If you could sharpen something to an extremely thin / monomolecular edge then enchant with Hava, would up to a large amount of energy prevent individual molecular bonds from breaking/changing give you a perfect edge for the next 500k years?

That's more or less the intended outcome, as it allows for cool things like impenetrable armor and wickedly sharp swords. On the scale of societies, it allows for more durable machines that go for longer before breaking down. The primary problem is that the output is still limited, which means that sufficient force can still cause destruction. There's some math to be done there (and some SI conversions), but I think it mostly ends up as something you use if you're rich and/or have some really great application.

  Can reducing inertial mass allow you to accelerate something in a vacuum up to the speed of light? If you reduce the mass of something to effectively zero and accelerate it with this in a vacuum, what happens? Other than physics breaking down.

This doesn't actually change inertial mass, it only uses available watts to fake that effect. So eventually (and fairly quickly, I'd think) you run into problems where you're getting an additional kW of power to pretend your inertial mass is less than it is, but that's not enough to complete the effect, especially at relativistic velocities. (Hopefully that makes sense. Imagine a tiny, hidden accelerometer if you need to.)

Edit: It's been a terribly long time since I've taken physics, and I never went that far, so maybe someone can correct me if I'm wrong. A watt is equal to one Newton meter per second. In other words, power equals force times velocity. That means power divided by velocity equals force, which means that as velocity increases, the force you get from that power decreases. But it's my understanding that even with constant thrust, which we don't have, velocity in a vacuum only asymptotically approaches the speed of light under relativistic physics. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong; I spent a little too much of today brushing up on my elementary physics.
