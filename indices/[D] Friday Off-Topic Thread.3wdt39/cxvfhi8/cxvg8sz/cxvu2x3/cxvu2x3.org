  The second question is how hava is made. Is it a limited resource, or can it be produced by some process? Does creating hava produce net energy, is it energy neutral, or is there energy loss? Would it be possible to make a magic machine which automatically produces more hava than it costs to operate?

This is one of the overarching questions of the story that I'm planning to write, but I guess the answer to that is that it's not trivially easy.

The above is just one leg of a three and a half legged system, so there are other parts that aren't seen. Those other parts I'm pretty firm on though, it's the engineering that I just needed someone to poke so I could make sure there's nothing that breaks immediately (like infinite power or cheap planet-busters).
