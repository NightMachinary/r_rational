The first question you always ask about magic systems is can this be used to make a superintelligent computer. I think with this one it would be difficult, as you would essentially have to build a macro - scale set of logic gates, which I am assuming couldn't be done at a practical size due to needing a minimum rune size on enchanted objects.

The second question is how hava is made. Is it a limited resource, or can it be produced by some process? Does creating hava produce net energy, is it energy neutral, or is there energy loss? Would it be possible to make a magic machine which automatically produces more hava than it costs to operate?

Third question is how this affects transportation industries. You could build cars, but you would need some kind of constantly running hava engine in them, and that would be a waste. I propose a mass transit system set up as a series of concentric rings. The inner rings spin faster than the outer rings, and cars on the rings can switch between adjacent rings. You get into a car on the outermost ring, moving at a slow walking pace, then drive it on inner rings to get where you are going quickly. If enough people are using such a system, you should be able to save hava overall by comparison to a personal vehicle system.

I imagine that a society running on this would quickly either allow a regulated monopoly to produce hava power objects or would enforce a strict standard between all companies using it. Making hava engines standard between all applications makes mass production more practical, and allows engineers to simply put in however many slots for standard engines as their creations need, rather than requiring non-modular hava engine design for every single magic object.

Edit: Here's what I imagine the hava engine business would work like: You order however many nearly complete hava engines you need. The engines need only the last step before activation in order to turn on. You complete that step yourself and install the engine in your clockwork device.
