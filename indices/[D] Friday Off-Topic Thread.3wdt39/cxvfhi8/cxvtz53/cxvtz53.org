  Imbue an object with a constant directional force (at maximum watts).

What vectors are available? Is it tied to the stars (eg. "towards Taurus"), the Earth (eg. "West"), or any object that you select (eg. "towards this second object").

How do the watts and slow speeds interact? For example, let's say I stick a 1000W "Constant Directional Force (Upwards)" enchanted object under a 100 ton block of stone. Would it manage to lift it at a rate of 1mm/s?
