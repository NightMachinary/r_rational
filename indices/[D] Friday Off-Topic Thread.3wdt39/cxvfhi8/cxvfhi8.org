I'm working on a magic system which works something like this:

- There's this stuff called hava that's fairly rare (let's say something like ten dollars a gram).
- When you infuse an object with hava, there are two effects:

  - An extradimensional battery is created which has a number of joules equal to direct mass conversion. In other words, a kilogram of hava gives you 9 * 10^{16} joules.
  - This energy is then output at a maximum rate of the total joules divided by 1.5 * 10^{13} as joules per second. In other words, a kilogram of hava gives you 9 * 10^{16} "stored" joules which are usable at a maximum rate of 6000 joules per second (6000 watts).

- The effects that you can use this power for:

  - Imbue an object with raw energy output in the form of heat (at maximum watts).
  - Imbue an object with a constant directional force (at maximum watts).
  - Effectively change gravitational and/or inertial mass (within the limits of maximum watts).
  - Effectively change one half of classical inertia (within the limits of maximum watts). For example, you can alter "an object in motion stays in motion" but keep "an object at rest stays at rest" the same (with the power being supplied by available watts).
  - Effectively increase durability by using available watts to prevent bonds from breaking.

This is all done with something like glyphs or runes or something, or maybe a more exotic method. Once set, the patterns can't be changed and more energy can't be added to the "battery". A pattern can't ever be shut off except through total destruction.

So the problem that I have isn't really with the /magic/ so much as the /engineering/ of what a society would do with it. Obviously it gets used for the generation of electricity and replaces a few appliances. Either heat generation, constant directional force, or partial inertia seems to be the best way to get useful work done, though I'm not really sure which (both have their engineering challenges). Because you can't turn it off, you need ways of getting around that, but that's not too much of a challenge depending on which direction you go.

So my question is, let's say you have this material and knowledge of the processes. What are the things you build with it?
