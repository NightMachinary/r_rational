The factions will be introduced gradually in the books. The MYC takes place during a world war with all the factions active, but in the actual books that's ancient history and everyone is dead. The reader is introduced to the abondoned capitol of one of the alliances, then explore some of the factions within that alliance, and then in later books we find out that the guys who used skulls in their architecture were actually the bad guys.
