A Make Your Choice game, like on [[/r/makeyourchoice]]. It boils down to (free) text only character creation but without a game to put them in, often giving a quick introduction to the world or scenario. It's less proper games and more the players speculating/talking with other people about how their characters would get along and what might happen with the world. It's fairly niche.

In my case I've made the world history short and skippable, but there are still 14 factions and around 150 skills, of which you'll be able to afford around five to fifteen, depending on how many handicaps you take on. The skills in the MYC are converted from the different ways people use magic in the book.

The 'game', which is just text, I'm planning on releasing when I have finished writing the book I'm working on, to hopefully draw some interest from the MYC crowd and get volunteer beta readers. Making the game also helps me see if my magic is reasonably balanced, and it's hopefully complete enough that if anyone discovers a way to munchkin the magic I had not thought of, I'll be able to adjust the books to either not have the magic be munckinable in that way or possibly let characters good and bad have access to it.
