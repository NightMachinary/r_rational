What style of game are you talking about here? Is this something you're planning to publish, or just something you're working on to feed into your book?

I love games with broad varieties of potential skills, but the more complex the game, the higher the barrier to entry for new players. For some styles of games, this can be acceptable; a lot of it comes down to how you introduce the abilities to players. Front-loading character creation with a billion choices is generally not a good idea unless you're specifically targeting an optimizer demographic, which is pretty niche - but niche markets can still be viable, depending on what you're going for.
