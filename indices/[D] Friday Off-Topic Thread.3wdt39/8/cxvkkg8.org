I haven't been writing on my book in the last few months. Almost at all. Instead I've wasted a lot of time making a "Make Your Choice" game based on my world where you get a few hundred points and have to choose magical affinities, faction, place in life etc. Because the world building is so extensive for the books already I've ended up with a MYC that is almost certainly too long. You can make your choices quickly if you go in knowing what kind of theme you want, but if not there are way too many options. It's impossible to purchase more than like 10% of the magical skills, even if you max out handicaps, and if you don't want to destroy half the world and have scizophrenia and have enemy factions taking your family hostage it's closer to 5%.

I don't know where to go from there. Do I shave off half of the cool magical skills? Pretend half the factions aren't there? At the same time I /want/ to show off the variety offered by magic and potential for munchkining in my world, since I'm hoping it will act as clever advertising for drawing in beta readers when I've finished a book I want feedback on.
