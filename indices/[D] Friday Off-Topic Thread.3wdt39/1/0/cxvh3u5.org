If I'm understanding this rightly, the kilogram of hava costs $10,000 and outputs up to 6,000 watts for 15*10^{12} seconds, or in other words about 500,000 years. The rate of dissipation is directly proportional to the mass of hava used so all hava usages should last for about 500k years. Which means that humanity will probably have no idea about the theoretical lifetime of hava, because things get lost and break and so forth before they are ended.

The big limit then is the output rate, not the duration. You spend more for more effect but it lasts forever.

Thoughts:

If you get 100% efficiency transforming to electrical energy, you can get 52560 kilowatt hours per year in perpetuity for only $10,000. It costs about $0.13 per kilowatt hour in my principality at the houseowner's rate, or $7000. So the hava represents a huge savings over what we're using now - $10k for perpetual amounts of power that would sell for $7k yearly in our economy but presumably power would be cheaper because the predominant source of energy is this stuff.

Revolutionizing space travel is obvious, if you can control it sufficiently. A set of hava-enchanted 'thrusters' can propel something in any direction by reorienting in space the objects - you need multiple so that you can idle by rotating all hava-lumps to counteract each other - wasteful, but when they'll last by default longer than the lifetime of your civilization, who cares? Hava tells the rocket equation to fuck right off. Even more so when you reduce inertial mass.

I wonder about the bit about protecting molecular bonds. Things get dull mostly because edges wear out. If you could sharpen something to an extremely thin / monomolecular edge then enchant with Hava, would up to a large amount of energy prevent individual molecular bonds from breaking/changing give you a perfect edge for the next 500k years?

Can reducing inertial mass allow you to accelerate something in a vacuum up to the speed of light? If you reduce the mass of something to effectively zero and accelerate it with this in a vacuum, what happens? Other than physics breaking down.
