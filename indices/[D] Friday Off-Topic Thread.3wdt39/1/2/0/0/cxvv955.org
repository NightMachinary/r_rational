I think you'll need to change the "constant directional force" ability in order to maintain sanity. Having the criteria be "enough force to equal X watts on the object" means that it takes literally infinite force to completely stop it.

A 12"x12"x1" piece of steel is roughly 20 kg. A 1W enchantment would lift it at a rate of ~5mm/s. Putting a 100 000 ton bridge on top of that plate wouldn't cause it to fall, it would simply slow it down to ~1nm/s. (1W/980 700 000N = ~1 x 10^{-9} m/s)
