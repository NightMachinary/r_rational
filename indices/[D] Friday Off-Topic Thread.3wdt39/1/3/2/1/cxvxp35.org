Is Hava compressible? If so how much so? Can the output of a larger whole focus it's effect on a subset with it's gravitational effect?

What happens if I activate a sphere of Hava to maximize it's mass, and substitute it for the hydrogen in a fusion bomb? Assuming sufficient blast wave patterning to keep the rune going. Can I exceed the minimum density requirement for a black hole?
