For communicating in difficult situations both [[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0143118447][Difficult Conversations]] and [[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0071771328][Crucial Conversations]] are good. [[http://www.amazon.com/dp/006124189X][Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion]] is the best book on how persuasion works, but [[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0671027034][How to Win Friends & Influence People]] is the definitive practical book on persuasion. [[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0553804723][The Definitive Book of Body Language]] is a good book on the subject, which is fundamental to face to face communication.
