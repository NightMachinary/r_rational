Books that I've (re-)read recently...

- /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4307536][Rewind]]/ (fanfiction of /Ben 10/; 76k words, complete): Charmcaster casts a spell on herself to remove her magic so that she can, without arousing suspicion, get close enough to the Tennysons to kill them--and, beforehand, she casts another spell that allows her to rewind and try again if she fails. However, the task is more difficult than she originally anticipated--and, after several loops, it becomes glaringly apparent that she's meddled with magics too powerful for her to handle as the timeline starts to go off the rails... (This was my second reading. I'd actually forgotten how extremely cool this story was, though I disliked the ending.)

- /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3326179][Doppelganger Non Grata]]/ (fanfiction of /Teen Titans/; 103k words, complete): The Titans' evil clones that Trigon summoned were not permanently defeated, and have returned to take their vengeance. (My second reading. Pretty fun overall, but has some boring philosophical blather near the end.)

- /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7820743][Ramen Days]]/ (fanfiction of /Naruto/; 123k words, incomplete): After dying to Orochimaru in the Chuunin Exams, Naruto discovers that he's living in a video game. (My second reading, IIRC. Super-fun!)

- /[[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362][Hard Reset]]/ (fanfiction of /Friendship Is Magic/; 37k words, complete): Twilight accidentally puts herself into a time loop a few hours before Chrysalis kills Celestia and an army of changelings takes over Canterlot. (This was, IIRC, my second reading. The story felt more boring than I remembered, and I didn't care too much about the ending.)
