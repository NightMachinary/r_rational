That is pretty much my rationale towards littering. I'm not going to throw my fridge into a lake, or throw my lunch carton out of my car window everyday, but every so often, I'll do something like toss my gum wrapper, or a balled up piece of paper, etc. and sometimes, my sister (who's young and idealistic) will get on me for it. I'll explain that I'm one of billions and that little paper I threw is ultimately meaningless. She'll counter that if everyone thought that way, then the problem would be terrible. I agreed with her, but then proceeded to remind her that my choice of littering or not has NO effect on these people, other than the marginal effect it MAY have on someone who witnesses me not litter and is "inspired". She can't counter, gets frustrated and stays mad at me for littering anyway.

Is that justification TO litter? Not exactly. But it also isn't justification NOT to litter. At the end of the day, a lot of what we (as an individual) do IS meaningless and insignificant, because there are so many of us. You can't have any significant impact on the world around you, unless you try to narrow your scope of effect to a small enough area, or you try to take a position that would lead you to being capable of making more important decisions (such as a political one, or becoming insanely wealthy) but even then, your decisions are restricted by a number of things.

EDIT: Plus, I find it laughable that we get on humans for consumer based littering, when so much more of the waste we produce is due to large corporations or governments.
