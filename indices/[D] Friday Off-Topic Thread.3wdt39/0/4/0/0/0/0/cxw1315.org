I mean if you want someone or don't want someone you are letting others vote for you. It doesn't matter if they have their own motivations you're free riding. Assuming majority is voting for your guy, if it's other way then whatever, it's so easy to vote where I'm from that I find it hard to justify not even with my vote being irrelevant. Same reason I turn off light switches.

Even if you don't change outcome the voting numbers are relevant in tons of places, from funding to news etc same with light switch.

There is no categorical argumentm against the free rider problem it is why it is a problem
