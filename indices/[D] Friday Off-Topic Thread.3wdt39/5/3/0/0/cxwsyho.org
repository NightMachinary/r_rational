This is a problem of definitions. If you give a set of shapes the measure equal to the cardinality of the set as your link did, the measures are equal. I used another measure. Which measure to use "should" have been a part of fljared's question, but since he didn't specify one we can just reply with a few examples. fljared, if you don't have enough info yet, some context for your problem could help. If it's a disagreement between peers, this paragraph could help :P
