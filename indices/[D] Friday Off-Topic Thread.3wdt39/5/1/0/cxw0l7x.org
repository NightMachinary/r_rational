Uncountable-infinity times as many non-square rectangles. Divide the set of all rectangles into infinity sets, one for every positive number n such that that set only contains rectangles where the length is n times the width. One of those infinity sets, n=1, is the set of all squares; all infinity other sets are equally large sets of non-square rectangles.
