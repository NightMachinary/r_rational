You're right. Since any square can have either of it's sides reduced a bit to produce a corresponding rectangle, there are definitely more rectangular combinations than square ones.

The only difficulty would be that you've defined it as an /infinite/ set, which means it's probably possible to map all rectangles onto multiple unique squares too, Hilbert Hotel style.

But it's definitely true for all the sets of all shapes /smaller than a given size/, for example.
