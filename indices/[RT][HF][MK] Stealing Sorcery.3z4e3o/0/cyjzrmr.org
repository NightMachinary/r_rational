If you don't mind my asking, how did the July 1 change to KU payouts affect you? I've pulled most of my short fiction out and am going to try going wide for a while, but I'm curious how others are doing. My novels were doing okay in KU, but the reporting makes it so hard to tell how it's working -- a few completions or multiple drivebys.
