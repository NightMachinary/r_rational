Since I only have published novels, it didn't hit me very hard at all. My overall income did decrease from month to month, but I think that was probably just a decrease in the number of people reading.

Unfortunately, it's hard to track because the criteria are so different now - I only know # of pages read, as opposed to the # of people who exceeded the 10% threshold before.

I get considerable spikes when I put my books on Kindle Countdown deals (in terms of sales rank, not income). That's the main thing that makes Kindle Select worthwhile to me; I think my first sale was a big part of why I managed to ride in the top 100 of a couple categories for as long as I did.

I wish I had more concrete data to give you, but I haven't really dug into the numbers in any detail.
