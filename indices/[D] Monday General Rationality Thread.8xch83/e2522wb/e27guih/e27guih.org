Hermeneutics is a thing, but not really a methodology per se. I sort of think of it as using brute force g (the general intelligence factor) on an object of study. That's not entirely true though, because it's also a discipline that can be trained. It's trained more by repeated applications of g to similar subjects, though, rather than by learning specific methodologies, as in science.

A problem with hermeneutics is that it's tied to rhetoric, because you need to be a decent rhetorician to get across any ideas you arrive at through hermeneutics. Though hermaneutics is probably the most powerful single way to draw insights about the world, and is kind of the only way to draw insights about the epistomological hall of mirrors that is individual human psychology and the products of individual human minds, the difficulty of transferring conclusions to others means that it doesn't leave us with the same kind of dramatic generational accretion as in science. However, it's applicable to every field of human endeavor, rather than the limited fields of endeavor to which science can reasonably be applied.
