Other people may not do this, but when I say that something is evil, it describes a certain category of behavior which is highly rational, but predicated upon selfishness or bad information, and which results in significant harm to self or others. I understand perfectly well why people choose to engange with ideologies and in activities which I categorize as evil, and I do not use it as a nebulous othering label meant to dismiss people out of hand.

I call the Republican Party and its leadership evil because every single one of their platform positions and nearly all of their recent legislative agendas have been focused on serving the powerful over the powerless, or because they outright cause massive, provable harm.

The strongest example of this is climate change denial. There is zero reason, from an evidence-based perspective, to disbelieve anthropogenic climate change. The evidence is staggering in both its size and its repeatability. The Republican Party, however, denies this. They do not do it because they are Saturday morning cartoon villains, but because they stand to gain -in the short term- from advancing antiscientific policies and because they are willing to sacrifice the future of the entire fucking human race to line their pocketbooks now. The evidence for this interpretation of their motives is also staggering, as numerous reports show that oil executives have known about anthropogenic climate change since the 70s and have chosen to ignore this in favor of greed.

I do not have a better word to describe behavior that self-centered, callous, greedy, malicious, and downright /existentially risky/ than Evil. If that behavior is not Evil, then the word Evil has no meaning or purpose. Therefore, I strongly disagree with your assessment of my nomenclature. Evil is a perfectly acceptable descriptor of the Republican Party, and for those who have the power to know and act better and still choose not to.
