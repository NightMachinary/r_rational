You should tell your father that the point of gerrymandering is to create 100/0 districts /only for the opposition,/ while your own party has a greater number of 60/40 districts. If he truly cares about his claimed principles he should still be against gerrymandering, as it means you are literally disenfranchising that 40% in every district they can't win, and effectively disenfranchise them in the 100/0 districts because they won't get enough representation to matter.

If he actually cares about his argument and isn't just trying to defend a corrupt practice which benefits his tribal interests, he needs to know that current gerrymandering practices don't accomplish his claimed goals. They don't put all Rs and all Ds into separate districts, they slice people up to make every district as unfair as possible. Of course, even without knowing you or your father, I can predict that he will deflect or shut down when this is pointed out to him. The Republican Party is Evil, and Evil corrupts even those who are otherwise good.

(It is important to note that, when I say the Republican Party is Evil, I mean that its ideology and leadership are evil. Republican voters are only evil if they realize that what they are voting for hurts people and still vote Republican. Remember that propaganda attacks known security flaws in human cognition, and you can't really blame individuals for failing to defend against those most of the time.)
