Hmmmm. There are two ways to think about this discussion here.

The first way, and the way that I suspect that you are thinking about it: /First/ the districts are divided up by some or other method; and /then/ the voters select their chosen candidate. In this circumstance, I do agree with you, a 100% vote percentage would be a cause for nonspecific existential horror.

The /second/ way to look at it is to invert that; /first/ have the citizens vote, and /then/ split them into districts depending (more or less) on that vote. With this ordering, it is no longer horrifying to suggest that district 1 had close to 100% votes for party A or that district 2 had close to 100% votes for party B - because the /districts/ were specifically chosen in such a way as to make that happen, and pretty near everyone gets the candidate for which they voted to be in charge of them. So, in this ordering, it's not that people have failed to discuss, or have been forced into agreement; on the contrary, they have picked their sides and /then/ those sides have been segregated and each given their chosen leader.

Now, I can't say for sure, especially since I'm only hearing your report on the original discussion, but is it possible that your father was thinking in terms of the second option, instead of the first?
