This looks like a template. Let me give it a try.

  (It is important to note that, when I say the Democratic Party is Evil, I mean that its ideology and leadership are evil. Democratic voters are only evil if they realize that what they are voting for hurts people and still vote Democrat. Remember that propaganda attacks known security flaws in human cognition, and you can't really blame individuals for failing to defend against those most of the time.)

  I call the Democrat Party and its leadership evil because every single one of their platform positions and nearly all of their recent legislative agendas have been focused on serving the powerful over the powerless, or because they outright cause massive, provable harm.

  The strongest example of this is climate change fearmongering. There is zero reason, from an evidence-based perspective, to believe anthropogenic climate change is harmful. The evidence is meagre for both its size and its consequences. The Democratic Party, however, denies this. They do not do it because they are Saturday morning cartoon villains, but because they stand to gain -in the short term- from advancing antiscientific policies and because they are willing to sacrifice the future of the entire fucking human race to line their pocketbooks now. The evidence for this interpretation of their motives is also staggering, as numerous reports show that green-energy initiatives and subsidies have had zero impact on the environment and Democratic leaders have chosen to ignore this in favor of greed.

No, wait, I can do better:

  The strongest example of this is their anti-life stance in favor of abortion rights. There is zero reason, from an evidence-based perspective, to believe that a developing fetus is not a human being. The evidence is staggering in both its size and its repeatability. The Democratic Party, however, denies this. They do not do it because they are Saturday morning cartoon villains, but because they stand to gain -in the short term- from advancing antiscientific policies and because they are willing to sacrifice entire generations of the fucking human race to line their pocketbooks now. The evidence for this interpretation of their motives is also staggering, as numerous reports show that abortion providers have been engaging in murder for decades and have chosen to ignore this in favor of greed.

GTFO. This is exactly what the "No politics" rule was imposed to prevent.

If you want to be taken seriously, you need to consider that maybe, just maybe, your own "cognitive security flaws" have been exploited, causing you to think irrationally about certain topics. I don't blame you for failing to defend against them.
