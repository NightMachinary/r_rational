I understand perfectly why the No Spiders rule exists. However, the topic came up, and now I wish to defend my position.

What I said could be a template only if any of the things I said were untrue, which we both know is not the case. On the pro-life issue, I concede that they could potentially have a point if one accepts the premise that provably consciousnessless possible-future-humans deserve the same civil rights as an adult human. However, their actions on other topics show that Republican ideology doesn't actually believe this, and their actions on the topic of female reproductive rights show that the only goal they could really have is a return to the times when women were completely dependent upon men. We can see this in their opposition to birth control, which is the single greatest means of preventing unwanted pregnancies and abortions. Though it is absolutely true that some Republicans do believe that abortion is murder, they do not rationally examine their other beliefs to determine what the best course of action is given this belief. They vote for the people who ban abortion, even though the other actions of those people have been shown countless times to /maximize/ abortion, legal or not.

Again, I am sorry for the spiders. But I needed to explain my positions on these topics because I honestly think the Republican Party is an existential threat to humanity.
