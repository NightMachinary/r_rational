Far from it! The ones who do genuinely believe it all are the ones who are the most blameless, as their only crime is failing to defend against propaganda. It's the ones who know that it's all lies who should hold our ire, as they are willing to let everyone else suffer for their own benefit. This is why I only call the ideology and the leadership evil. Everyone else is just mistaken.
