I'm reminded that [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PeSzc9JTBxhaYRp9b/policy-debates-should-not-appear-one-sided][policy debates should not appear one-sided.]] If someone wins with 100% of the vote, they can't be making difficult decisions on policy: the hard decisions won't be universally supported.

Beyond that, your intuition that everyone agreeing 100% isn't a good situation seems reasonable to me. If everyone is of a single mind... it's likely that everyone has literally lost their minds. Single mindedness is concerning in large groups.

It's only natural that times of peace and safety afford argumentation. It's at those times that the difficult problems that no-one knows what to do about can be addressed. If there's a war on, that has to be dealt with first. In some sense, emergencies are simpler and easier to address than optimization. However, if your house almost burned down last week, that doesn't mean it isn't important to carefully choose new furniture this week.

Still, sometimes it's "It would be best to knuckle down and just buy a couch already: we've been standing around for too long."
