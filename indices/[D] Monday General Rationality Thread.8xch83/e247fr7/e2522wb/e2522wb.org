A friend of mine has to write his bachelor's thesis.

He has to compare two countries education system using the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutic_circle][hermeneutic circle]]

Now the philosophy behind the idea when it was developed, seems kind of pseudoscience-y. I know, just because the explanation is allegedly BS, doesn't mean the method is wrong. And the method got changed since it's beginning. It claims to help interpret textes.

But still, it looks wrong. And I don't know if it has any advantages over just trying to interpret the school system.

So my question:

Does anyone know that methodic? Anything someone used it for? Is it useful in general? Is it useful for my friend?

(btw The countries are very similar. Both in the EU.)
