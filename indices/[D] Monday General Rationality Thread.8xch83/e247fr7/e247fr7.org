TLDR: I've been reading too much Practical Guide to Evil. Politics is undead, blue-eyed spiders.

I had a conversation with my father about gerrymandering, specifically the lately topical [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasted_vote#Efficiency_gap][efficiency gap]], and he expressed the opinion that the ideal vote percentage is 100%. In other words, the best possible candidate would be a perfect representative respected by all and thus receive the whole of the vote.

Indeed, he was of the opinion that the larger the percentage of the vote a candidate receives, the more effective they have campaigned or (indeed) the more effective their district has been shaped to allow that their political views should match those of the overwhelming majority.

To me that seemed vaguely horrifying. Every complex (broadly) political situation I've been in where everybody agrees has made me a little nervous. I've always gotten a sinking feeling that there hasn't been enough discussion, argument even, to justify whatever it is we're doing. So I'd rather prefer an unstable candidate with 30% of the vote in a field of five or six, forming local coalitions and thinking carefully about every decisions and how it might look to everybody who might elect somebody else next time around.

At the same time, I don't think my father is /wrong/ even if I doubt there are many who could truly represent so large a coalition as any district in a nation of millions. Except in times of crisis, of course, when a common concern is at the front of every mind as they listen to campaign speeches and assess ballot options. Things get simpler then.

Nor am I /right/ to prefer things complicated, especially when there are decisions that need to be made and acts to be performed instead of analyzed or inspected or discussed. When times are hard, it's frequently more profitable to be fast than to be careful. They who act first /act/, and as much as I might argue with their results at least they've got them. Right out there in the open. Results.

Makes me feel like my opinion is in the minority rather than the plurality.

Authoritarians are loyal to a fault, naturally arrange into hierarchies, and can be convinced of just about anything that the ends justify. States like we have today never could have formed without them, and the whole of the modern world depends on their foot soldiers. In fat times of peace and safety things can get multi-polar for a while, but if there's winning to be had then some authoritarian faction or other always wins... until the next one shows up.
