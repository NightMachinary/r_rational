Agreed that this chapter does a much better job of expanding in deepening the world, which is exactly what a chapter like this should do. I'm much more interested in Daisy and Laura now, and would like to see them again, while in the first version I just wanted to get back to the main story line.

You've done a great job with the tense stuff, and it seems a lot smoother to me. There were times in the last version where uses of "had" seemed off, but this time there's only one, and it really works either way. "She hugs the man who had been like a second father to her." It isn't wrong, but putting "had" in the past tense implies that him being that to her is no longer the case. "She hugs the man who *has* been like a second father to her" maintains the present tense, and has a slightly different meaning. Maybe you want to keep "had" here, but it's something to keep in mind.

Congrats on taking everyone's advice and incorporating it so quickly. Can't wait for the next chapter.
