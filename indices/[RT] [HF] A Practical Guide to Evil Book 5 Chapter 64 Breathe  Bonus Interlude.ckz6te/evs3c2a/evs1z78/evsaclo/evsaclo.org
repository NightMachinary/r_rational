Man it's wierd that Black is Cat's diplomatic partner after he was the muscle side of his partnership with Malicia. Also that his positions on most things haven't changed a bit.

I wonder how much of Cat's personal relationship with Amadeus is known to Cordelia? I mean even for an Evil Villain it's kind of asking a lot for someone to sell out their own father figure. Like can you imagine if Cat was more emotional and less able to take in the bigger picture? I mean Masego would have burnt down as much of Procer as he could have if had been asked while his Father's were still alive. Or hell if Scribe gets notice that about the trade and kills the First Prince just because she relatively indirectly threatened Amadeus?

Also Archer probably knows calculus for those long shots that take gravity into account. Wait is Creation flat?
