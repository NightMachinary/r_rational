Yeah, even if Black doesn't end up launching a bid for the tower, the only situation where Malicia wins is one where the Dead King brutally mauls the armies of Procer, the Dominion, and Callow (And probably the Drow as well). Her peace with Callow is only being maintained by the imminent threat of Keter, and if that is resolved without crippling every other major power outside the league, she's done for.
