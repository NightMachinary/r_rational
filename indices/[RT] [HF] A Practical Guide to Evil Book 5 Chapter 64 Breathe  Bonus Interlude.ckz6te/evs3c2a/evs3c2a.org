Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Cordelia The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Heroes would tell you. It's a Villainous legend. Darth Cordelia was a First Prince of Procer, so powerful and so wise she could wield diplomacy to influence the story to create peace... She had such a knowledge of politics, she could even keep the Highest Assembly from fighting itself. She became so powerful... the only thing she was afraid of was losing her power, which eventually, of course, she did. Unfortunately, she negociated with everyone to create a Grand Alliance, then the Grand Alliance pushed her to take over Procer. Ironic. She could save others from tyranny, but not herself.
