That's a big if, at this point. She hasn't defeated her internal opposition, which is significant, she doesn't have enough legion muscle to deal with it, and her only saving grace is that the rest of the Calernians don't know it was her who unleashed the Dead King. If they know without a doubt, which is just a matter of time with the Bard still around, they will be out for her head, and no amount of political manipulation will be worth anything.
