So that's Black's original goal: to reform the Empire. Not scoring a victory against the Heavens, but making Praes into something that can function.

Edit: I wouldn't necessarily say that Black was right: Malicia /did/ succeed in making the High Lords irrelevant. Although they /are/ making a comeback, and afaik she never reinstated the Reforms, which likely was a strong factor in the goblin rebellion. So Malicia hasn't won yet.
