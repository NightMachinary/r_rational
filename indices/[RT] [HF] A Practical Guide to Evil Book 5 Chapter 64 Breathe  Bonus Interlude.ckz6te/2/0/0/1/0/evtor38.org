Cordelia knows the two has meet only a half dozen times since Black went to the League after book two. Before then they spent the majority of their time separate and we don't even know how much they spoke between the scenes we saw, possibly they haven't spent more than a few weeks together /in total/ after book one since Black had a very hands off form of mentoring, only protecting her and handling her blunders from a distance.

She's likely unaware of the nature of the conversations they had since it'd be hard for a spy to listen in, with the notable exception of the time after second Liesse when Black walked away with a stab wound...

She probably doesn't have a rose tinted view of the Damneds relationship.
