I think Black looked early/mid thirties while he had this name, but has physically aged ~10-15 years since losing it. I believe he's like 55 chronologically. (~Late teens at the start of his adventures, mid-late 20s by the start of the conquest, 20 years after the conquest itself, then the 3-4 years of the story.
