  How does this work at the quantum level? are atoms cut in half, releasing a lot of radiation? That would make portal not safe anywhere on earth.

I'd assume it wouldn't hit that many atoms? How many atoms would be on the path of the cutting plane, which is probably sth like plank length thin? Individual atoms splitting don't create /that/ much energy; nuclear energy's powerfulness is based on chain reactions so that /large/ amounts of atoms break.
