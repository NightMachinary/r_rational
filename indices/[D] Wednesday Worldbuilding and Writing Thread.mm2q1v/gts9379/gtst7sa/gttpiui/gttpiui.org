Having the background framework of how powers work is helpful, and if I ever get to the entities in canon it'd be explicit. I've read Worm fanfiction that is a similar AU minus the monsters and it's still very recognizably Worm. It doesn't really feel like an overly restrictive constraint, just a guideline.

I also haven't written anything before, so I want to write something that I'll stay interested in so I'll get practice writing.
