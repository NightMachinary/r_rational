Ignoring the violation of causality that would allow for lots of crazy stuff and/or destroy the universe.

Regular transportation to and from nearly everywhere on Earth is easy and helpful. Politically difficult though. Although, Portal Man could do it without anyone knowing or consenting. Just go on Google Maps and spam portals. Low-tech solution would be flipping through National Geographic and newspapers.

In terms of traveling the universe we're limited to (solid, I assume) objects that have a flat surface that we have a visual of (assuming that making a drawing of a place that's real but no one has knowledge of doesn't work). I think this actually makes it pretty difficult to leave the solar system, as the amount of pictures of exoplanets we have is very small, and they look like [[https://blog.nationalgeographic.org/2014/05/12/best-photo-yet-of-an-exoplanet/][this]], so that's a no-go. We could use [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_artificial_objects_leaving_the_Solar_System][probes that have exited the solar system]] to get to interstellar space, if we wanted to be there for some reason. Getting to planets in our solar system is much easier, we could get to Mars and Venus immediately because of probes we've landed, the probes have flat surfaces and may have pictures of flat surfaces as well. Maybe some moons too, I'm not sure what objects we have enough clear pictures of that there's a usable flat region. This is assuming that Portal Man can't just look at a picture of an entire region and try to make small portals in different areas without knowing if they're flat.

If it works on objects that may or may not exist that would help, because we could possibly get to Jupiter and Saturn that way, through the remains of probes that have been discarded (Galileo and Cassini). Feels like a bit of an edge case.

All this space travel requires infrastructure though, especially if you want to do more than just make the portal.
