I think I must be misunderstanding this somehow. All of these are trivial, almost automatic, with how OP the power is, no need for any intelligence or munchkining. Possibly except for the ageing, but you can solve /most/ of it by stationing people near the supermassive black hole so they're frozen in time until medicine progresses enough.

The one non-obvious thing you might want to do is put up a small offworld research outpost to work on friendly AI, and then move the earth with everyone else near the black hole so other AI efforts or politics can't interfere.
