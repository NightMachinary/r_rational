How does momentum conservation work? If you take a portal that is "aligned" and flip it around, what happens?

Imagine a closed system rocket that fires into a portal, which opens into the same ship in the opposite direction, double dipping the momentum.

Better still, you could have a photon rocket with two portals both opening onto a mirror. Photon hits mirror, imparts momentum, bounces back into portal which sends it out the other one back into the mirror. The sole limiting factor to how much momentum even a single photon can impart is how good your mirror is.
