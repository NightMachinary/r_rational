The first three obvious things that come to mind are long-distance transportation, unlimited clean energy, and trivially easy space expansion / colonization.

Transportation: pretty obvious, build a giant "train" station and then the trains go through portals, plenty of details to work through but there are people who do that kind of thing for a living.

Energy: Dynamos, delicious delicious dynamos.

Space: Here is a picture of Mars! Here is a picture of the Moon! Here is a picture of a flat piece of the outside of the ISS! Now we have three portals!

Really the only hard part is finding someone with enough political, social, and/or economic clout to make sure the dude isn't kidnapped/assassinated and also is taken seriously and given the logistical backing needed to do stuff. If Portal Man can survive the first six months of being publicly active, everything should be fine.
