Honestly I did forget about the world being destroyed after they're done. I think originally the iteration was supposed to take like 100-300 years so it wouldn't actually affect the characters in canon, but that would be some fridge horror I guess.

I was toying with the idea of somehow defeating Eden with the power of friendship as an inverse to canon.
