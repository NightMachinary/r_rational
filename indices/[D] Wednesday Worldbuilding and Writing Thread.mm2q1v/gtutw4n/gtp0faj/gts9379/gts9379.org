Spoilers for all of Worm. If you don't know it, all you need to know for this is it's a somewhat gritty superhero story that's somewhat more realistic than your average superhero story.

I'm writing a story set in a Worm AU for personal fun, unlikely to ever be posted, but the world building is still fun to think about.

The basic idea is superpowers are first given out later (~1988, somewhat arbitrary but I want the “present” to be the 90s and powers to be less common) because the entities arrive later, and both of them survived. Eden is Ennoea, after a Gnostic Archean of “Thought”, and Scion is Thelesis after an Archean of “Will”. Eden being alive allows their avatars to act like humans.

They present as messengers from another world, bringing a warning of great change, including an invasion of dangerous creatures.

So, it's like Worm before parahumans were fully integrated into society, and monsters exist for them to fight. They primarily fight these monsters, defending humans from them, instead of each other like in canon. That's mostly because I want the setting to be a bit lighter, and I don't love the concept of a conflict drive. Also Eden being alive could allow them to be “smarter” about conflict generation. Or it's just an alternate Earth with the only AU element being Eden being alive. Villains still exist, but are as common as you'd expect from a demographic that's 1/100,000-1/10,000 of the population would be. Powers are still usually suited to combat, but less than canon, and more rogue/unaligned parahumans exist because of this.

Most of these monsters are not super significant in the present, between the scale of small dogs and bears, and are in isolated areas. They are slightly more prominent in greater longitudes, and are slowly growing in strength, number, and regions of occurrence (heading towards lower longitudes). They have one or two small scale powers and usually attack alone, but hives and swarms exist. Example powers could be fire breath, jumping large heights and distances, creating illusionary clones, and being anomalously strong and durable.

I'm thinking a disaster event could be a sudden global huge swarm of monsters. Not apocalyptic, but dangerous like mass forest fires and hurricanes are.

The main character is someone who is recently traumatized and gained a strong power (surprise!), and I'm planning to have a parahuman who was a cat burglar in canon (Circus) and another who was a mercenary leader (Faultline, her team didn't actually kill people) show up at some point, for fun. Story starts in rural Oregon.

Any twists, additions, or consequences that would be interesting? I'm thinking most countries are still roughly as stable as they were IRL at the present. I don't know my Cold War history very well l but I'd hazard that it'd end roughly the same way and the same time. Also thinking that parahumans aren't necessarily seen as “capes” in this setting, maybe it's seen more as magic or blessings.
