Hello everyone, first post here. I've dabbled in the fiction before, read a few of the major stories, like Yudkowsky's stuff and some of its derivatives (e.g. /Friendship is Optimal/), then /Worm/, /The Metropolitan Man/, a few others. Big fan of the first Bobiverse novel, that sort of thing. I got into it a few years ago, dropped it for a while, but I've just now finished /Thinking, Fast and Slow/, and it piqued my interest again. I've got /The Black Swan/ and Toby Ord's /The Precipice/ on my reading list again now, and I'm tackling /Luminosity/, which I didn't read in my first go around because I didn't know as much about Twilight as I did HP.

I've decided to try my hand at a bit of rationalist fiction myself, and this seemed to be the appropriate thread to ask this question and gather some thoughts about my premise:

What are the usual pitfalls of first-time writers in the genre, especially with my background of introduction-by-way-of-HPMOR? I assume there are some clich√©s that would be easy to fall into.

And more generally, what do you all think of this idea?

*Synopsis*

Modern day Earth is exposed to a brand-new outside context problem, and the story is intended as an exploration of different responses to it. A wave of mysterious energy moving at light speed engulfs the Earth without warning, causing around 1 / 10,000 people on the planet to develop reality-warping abilities. At first, these are believed to be unique superpowers ala Worm, but it soon becomes obvious that it is more like a hard magic system, and anything one of them can do, the others can learn to do as well with time and practice. The powers you start with are completely random, and for everyone except the protagonist, I've created a dice system to determine these.

The magic system is divided into nine Spheres or general categories, inspired in part by Mage: the Ascension, except that they are not equal in required effort: the more impossible the effect is under the original laws of reality, the more magical energy is required to produce the effect. There are other rules, but this is the big one. It makes some dangerous large-scale magic much less accessible (messing with time and causality, for example), but it makes neurological and biological magic the /most/ accessible, opening up the door to abuse and dramatic, villainous acts.

With the potential for a magic system like this to spiral out of control and ruin the planet, I decided to have the story begin right at the first exposure. This way, doing the necessary research to understand and control this power is something that needs to be done /right now/, to protect the world from completely falling apart. That seemed appropriate to the genre.

Follows two primary characters, at least at first:

*Protagonist* | rationalist grad student Ash Ridley, who is granted access to the mysterious powers by pure chance as part of the original wave; her big starting power is to make other people into mages, along with some neurological magic like framejacking and mnemonics, which give her an interesting point of view to write in.

Essentially an ordinary person thrust into an extraordinary situation, Ash rapidly becomes one of the United States' foremost experts on magic, a position she was absolutely not prepared to fill. In over her head, trying to help the most people possible, dealing with the highest levels of government and the machinations of her fellow mages both within the country and without, Ash has to leverage every scrap of rationality she can muster just to survive.

*Deuteragonist* | hedonist, psychedelic artist, musician and mystic Phoenix Brown, who is accidentally granted powers by Ash directly after she got her own powers. Ash's dirt-broke roommate, ex-girlfriend and part-time lover, she provides an alternative mode of thought that usually conflicts heavily with the more logical Ash. Her starting powers are related to alternative realities and biology. Has her own point of view that alternates with Ash.
