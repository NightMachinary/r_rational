If this was a prompt I made I wouldn't count that, it feels like a conceptual stretch from the intention of someone drawing a place that they know with certainty exists (and are correct about), with sufficient detail as to be generally unambiguous. Which remains nebulous, but still.

If you were able to do that, it would imply that intention is far more important than accuracy in using an image, which might mean you could draw places that may only theoretically exist to travel to. That's an interesting idea, but seems different from the intention of the prompt.
