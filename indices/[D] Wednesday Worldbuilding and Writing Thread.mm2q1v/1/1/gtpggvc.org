Space travel becomes vastly easier, every planet and asteroid we have a photo of is a mere portal away. Need resources? make a portal to the asteroid belt. Need energy? make a portal next to the sun.

  closing a portal on an object cuts the object perfectly, making a perfectly flat surface

How does this work at the quantum level? are atoms cut in half, releasing a lot of radiation? That would make portal not safe anywhere on earth.

Apart from studying how they are made, I don't see how the portal can help scientific discovery, beyond the obvious application in astronomy.
