*Saving the world with portals.*

Scenario: a random individual gains an ability to make pairs of circular portals. The portals can be any size, as long as they are either placed on a flat surface or within a ring-shaped frame,

How can this ability be used to uplift mankind, and spread it all over the universe? Bring about clean energy? End scarcity? Terraform planets? Extend human lifespan? etc

Some rules:

- the portals can be any size

- the portals themselves are indestructible, but the surface underneath them/frame is not

- closing a portal on an object cuts the object perfectly, making a perfectly flat surface.

- the portals let anything through: matter radiation, gravity waves etc

- portals adjust to "flatten" imperfect surfaces they are placed on, but only by about 5%. If the surface/frame is more crooked, the portals fails to latch.

- the portals persist forever unless closed personally by their maker, or the surface they are placed on is damaged (more than 2% misaligned with the perfectly flat portal)

- the "back" of the portal leads to the "back" of the other, each pair can be used in two ways.

- portals can be transported through another portal with no issues.

- transporting portal through its twin superimposes the matter between them on itself, leading to exotic matter with >2x the density. Or KABOOM, whichever makes more sense in the context.

- the travel time between portals is "instantaneous" (for physics sake, it is equal to light travelling 1 nm in vacuum) regardless of how distant the portals are.

- the Portal Man can make portals on any surface he sees, saw in the past and still remembers (provided it still exists) or saw on a picture/video/drawing/schematic that corresponds to a real object.

- the Portal Man himself is otherwise an ordinary 30 yo guy with no particular smarts or knowledge, except an insane desire to save and uplift humanity, and is likely to be pragmatic/utilitarian in his approach.

- It is not know at first how he makes the portals, and whether they will persist after his death.
