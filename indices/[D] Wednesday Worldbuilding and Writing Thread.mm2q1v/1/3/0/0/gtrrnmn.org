Yeah, if time dilation and all that implies still exists I think you can go back in time with this.

Edit: I don't have the math background for this but [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachyonic_antitelephone][this]] at least shows that it should be trivial to (if not impossible not to) send information back in time with this.
