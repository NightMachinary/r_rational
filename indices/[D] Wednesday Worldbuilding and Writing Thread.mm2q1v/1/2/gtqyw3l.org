- Build a spaceship

- Build a large tube around it

- Pump the air out of it (could use portal linked with one in space to do well, just put it inside the tube (probably should be hermetically sealed beforehand so it doesn't annoyingly 'vent' the air all the time while being transported on the Earth)

- Activate portals at both ends of the tube, put the one used to vent the atmosphere 'behind' one of them so it's not in the way.

- Tilt the whole tube 90 degrees so the spaceship starts falling

- It'll continually accelerate at 1G, going through the tube on a loop

- Wait about one year 'till it accelerates to ~c

- [Don't fuck up the timing] transport the portal which has a portal used for making the vacuum behind him through said vacuum-portal (which has a pair in space). Move it very very swiftly out of the way.

- Hopefully exit of the portal in space pointed /away/ from Earth, not towards it. If so, we have a pretty darn fast spaceship traveling somewhere. Hopefully there is some matching portal onboard.

IDK how it'd interact with relativity stuff through.

--------------

Clean energy is trivial, just put one portal above the other and 'pump' water or such. Hit the turbine on the way. Or put a portal near the sun (but maybe not too near?), warm up the water on the other side. 'gravity leaking through the portal' might be a problem through?
