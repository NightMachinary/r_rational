I'm not sure. But have some wild speculation, reversing entropy and nothing else:

In that universe, highly organized matter is stable, low energy. Disorganized, disparate matter is high energy and unstable. Crystals represent matter with useful energy removed. Mixtures like murky water and diffuse, low-pressure gas represent energy sources. Miasma is fuel: sold crystal is waste.

Their universe has dark energy, a mysterious force pulling all matter into denser shapes despite the expansion of the universe.

Everything cold and dead turns to dense, highly-ordered crystalline matter. Miasmas with many components are rich feedstocks. Stars are molten, with gravity providing energy to keep them from crystallizing. Stars try to release light and cool, but as they become more dense and ordered they heat up and don't crystallize. Light from stars can hit crystals and break them apart. Living things can feed on the entropy present in components trying to reassemble.

Anti-crystalline plants focus light to better break apart substrate. The plants have partially crystallized chemicals in them, but live by expending the energy released when their internal miasma becomes more ordered and crystalline. Excess miasma spreads from them.

Animals breathe in the miasma, condense it, and leave droppings of crystal. Alternatively, plants don't exude miasma: animals just eat plants, let the miasma contained in them condense into stable base crystals and then leave droppings of crystal. Filtering waste from food biologically is easy--you get energy while letting your food filter itself in your body. You want to eat the messiest, most disparate plants you can find. A plant that isn't a cloudy mixture is a plant without nutritional value.

It's a strange world.
