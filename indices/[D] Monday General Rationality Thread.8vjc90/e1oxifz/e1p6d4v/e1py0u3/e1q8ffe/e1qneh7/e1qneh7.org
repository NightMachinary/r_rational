This does not matter to the issue of cognition. The time directions are distinguishable by such oscillations, but there is no objective "forward" dimension: the type of oscillations you associate with "forward" is arbitrary. Wave function collapse also cannot provide a time direction if you assume basically any QM interpretation that is not Copenhagen. Only entropy can provide a sense of time direction, and it is deeply tied to cognition. (Source: Sean Carroll's time lectures on the Great Courses)
