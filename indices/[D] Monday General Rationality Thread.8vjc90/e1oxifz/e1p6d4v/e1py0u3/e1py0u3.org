Philosophically speaking, it should look indistinguishable from a normal entropy-increasing universe from the inside. This is because cognition itself relies on processes that increase entropy. Learning about the environment entangles the mind with its surroundings and increases their mutual information, which correlates to entropy increase (I think; I'm not a physicist). So there must be something else different about your fantasy universe to resolve this philosophical discrepancy. Perhaps the inhabitants increase in entropy while everything else decreases.
