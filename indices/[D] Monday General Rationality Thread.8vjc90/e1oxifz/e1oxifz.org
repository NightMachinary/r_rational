How might a world work if it ran in the opposite direction to our universe - starting from maximal entropy and moving towards order? What would physics look like? Biology? I'm willing to stretch outside of the strictly scientific realm here, so "exactly like our universe, but backward" is not really a useful answer. Using as a base for a fantasy setting.
