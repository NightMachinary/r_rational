The 2nd law is quite mathematically sound, so I think your options are 1) the entropy of conscious beings increases while that of everything else decreases (for some magical reason), 2) mathematics works differently in this universe on a fundamental level that may involve actualized contradictions, 3) something something a very precise magic causes brains to increase mutual information with the environment in a very precise way that technically lowers entropy but still gives the benefits of memories (I'm not even sure this is conceptually possible without falling into option 2, and I cannot fathom what it would look like).
