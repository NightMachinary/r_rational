He's also REALLY young, though, and I don't remember any indication that he's a genius like 6-year-old Ray was. I'd be surprised if he's actively scheming--I'd expect his agenda to boil down to "I love Mama, I'm staying with Mama," if anything.

Not saying it's impossible, but his unusual amount of screentime works just fine as foundation-laying for his becoming Mama's hostage and complicating the escape. It raises the tension more if the kid at risk of being left behind is one we're somewhat familiar with. It doesn't necessarily have to mean he's pursuing his own agenda.
