I think it's very unlikely that Emma, at least, planned for or expected that to happen. Her goal is to get /everyone/ out, and she's consistently emphasized her unwillingness to compromise on that. It would be dramatically out of character for her to leave a sibling behind to facilitate the others' escape. I also don't think it could have been Ray, because he pretty clearly didn't see this chain of events coming--he expected to be dead at this point.

It's not impossible that one of the other siblings arranged it behind Emma's back, though. But I think it's more likely that this kid just didn't fully understand what was happening, or didn't believe Mama could really be an enemy. Out of all those little kids--most of whom aren't exceptional geniuses like the main three--there had to be one who would flub the plan.
