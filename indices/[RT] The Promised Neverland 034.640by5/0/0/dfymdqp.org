I would have liked that too, but Emma's personality and handling isn't scheming- it's sympathy and people, getting them to work with her and trust her. She's the emotional and moral backbone of the group.

Norman the chessmaster, and Ray the cold and cunning hyper-intelligent individual. It's a good character dynamic in my opinion, although I would have liked to see more original and practical ideas from Emma specifically even if the overarching plan wasn't necessarily hers.

Though bringing the others in on it was her idea, I think.
