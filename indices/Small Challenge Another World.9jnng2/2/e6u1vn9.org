Is the twelve hours subjective time, or measured objectively?

If the time isn't subjective, I'd travel to a place where something like the Sovereign Gate exists, and Groundhog Day the next year or so of my life until I can achieve an optimal outcome, and then live that same year again outside of the loop.

If you can only experience 12 hours linearly... I'd go to a place where they can replace my body with an improved model, and upload information and skills directly into my brain.
