But wouldn't "convincing you your CEV has been attained" be way easier than actually making it happen? I'd worry that asking the zipper for that would zap me into a utopia sim. Which, you know, isn't the worst thing in the world, but I'd rather fix the real one.

I guess this is moot if the concept of CEV contains the stipulation that the CEV itself must actually come to pass?
