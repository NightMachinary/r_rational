You'd have to start with the last chapter in volume three, but yes, this is what I would recommend. Just... go backwards from the end of the book, because I'm fairly sure the page /right/ before the start of the Golden Age arc will tell you a giant spoiler in giant letters, even if you just glance at it. It's like if you opened up Lord of the Rings and there was a prologue with Frodo on the elven ship, talking with Gandalf about how Gollum fell into Mount Doom with the ring, and isn't it nice how Aragorn was able to reclaim his kingdom? /Why would you put that there?/
