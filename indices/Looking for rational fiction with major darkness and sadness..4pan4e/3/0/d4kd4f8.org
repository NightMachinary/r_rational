I'd say this story is worm-levels of darkness and is well written. The magical girl deconstruction that the genre deserved, not what it got with the irrational pile of crap that's Madoka. (Though I should say as a disclaimer that pretty much the only things I've seen in the genre are this story and Madoka)
