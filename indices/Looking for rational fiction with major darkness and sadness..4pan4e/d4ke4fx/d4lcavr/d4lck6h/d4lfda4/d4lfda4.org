[[https://qntm.org/structure][Fine Structure]] is great. The first chapter isn't representative of the book, so skip it if you don't like the pseudo-psychedelic lyricism, but come back it after you finish, because then it'll make perfect sense.

Compared to Ra, I found it much more engrossing (i.e. I didn't pick it up/put it down every month or so out of sheer lack of sufficient interest). The synopsis on the page I linked isn't /quite/ accurate, since it's a common complaint that the powers-of-two superhero plotline just sorta petered out in favor of /real/ plot (which I can't describe because my memory is bad enough I couldn't tell if it'd be a spoiler or not).

I've heard it said that people usually don't know why they like/dislike things, so if you ask them they'll just make stuff up. I liked FS. I think it'll be one of greatest pieces of web fiction when qntm gets around to ironing out the kinks. I'd say give it shot.
