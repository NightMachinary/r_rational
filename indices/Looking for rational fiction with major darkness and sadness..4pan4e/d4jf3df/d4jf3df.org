Berserk seems a nice fit. No stupidity, and the baddies are flawed in the normal ways that humans are flawed, albeit often dialled up.

It has very little angst. The main character, who receives more than most protagonists' share of darkness, responds by growing harder and colder. The world is also very rich in reasons to despair. It's got Lovecraftian levels of demonic entities that have the power to harm mankind, but unlike Lovecraft the demons of Berserk care very much indeed about humanity, and think we are delicious. The series is made all the better, I think, because it's not /always/ dark. Something like 25% of it is pretty standard heartwarming comradery and positive character development and adventures as you grow to love the main cast. Then the darkness sets in, and you think to yourself, "they wouldn't /actually/ go through with this," and then they do.

It's available in cheaply animated anime or in well drawn manga. I recommend the manga, but the anime has the advantage of not spoiling the end of the best arc before it even begins. Both are easily obtainable online.
