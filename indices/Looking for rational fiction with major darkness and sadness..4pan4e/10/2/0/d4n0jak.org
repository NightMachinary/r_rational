I don't really consider anything of value being lost, so not sure it's an idiot ball. The entire thing is at best a feverish first draft, I kept the data that felt irreplaceable. The images that evoke in me every utterance and word and crude aproximate translation.

Far as I'm concerned I have 80% of what I need to make the whole thing better the second go around.

It's mostly just annoying because I can't link the original... but the original was better as a living document, it's stilted and terrible as a crystalized thing.
