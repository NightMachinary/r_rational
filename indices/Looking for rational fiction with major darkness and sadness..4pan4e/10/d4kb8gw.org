I've been told that I managed to inspire true despair in my readers during [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DeepRise][Deeprise]], Sadly my hand is being forced on having to actually re-write that because the original site that holds the majority of the text of it went under without warning and has not come back in months.

I have all of the images and about a third of the original written text from the first half and the last quarter saved by a diligent archive trawling fan but ultimately it looks like it will not be available to read in it's entirety until I can go over that story and re-write it.
