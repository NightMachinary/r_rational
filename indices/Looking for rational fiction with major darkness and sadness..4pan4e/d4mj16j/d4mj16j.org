Why don't we just list all the rational fiction, then mark each one as either "with major darkness and sadness" or "without major darkness and sadness". You'll answer two questions in the same time as one, and it's a lot less likely you'll miss something just because it doesn't come to mind easily as a member of either category even though logically it has to belong in one.
