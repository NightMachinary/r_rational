You are confusing the model with reality.

"For all Y: (Y is X) ^ (Y is not X)" is a tautology, /in the model/.

If the predicate 'major darkness and sadness' carved reality at the joints, then you'd be right to say everything either satifies it, or doesn't. But asserting that your language is isomorphic the ontological structure of reality itself is not at all trivial.

The heap problem -- one thing isn't a heap, neither is two, so at what point does some amount of thing become a heap -- is the most common example of this disconnect. 'Heap' is a map. "Amount of things" is also the map, but it's closer to the territory than the binary 'is a heap'/'is not'.

Please note: I am not making any object-level statements here. /Maybe/ 'major darkness or sadness' is a predicate that cleanly slices the set of rational stories. Maybe it isn't. But the general form of your statement "I model objects of this class as having certain properties -- therefore all objects I'd recognise as a member of this class meaningfully instantiate those properties" is simple map/terrain confusion.

Think of the statement [[http://blog.kenperlin.com/?p=2068]["Gravity drowned"]]. Ask if it's true or false -- obviously false. But it's false in a different way than "the sky is green" is false. "The sky is green" /could/ be true tomorrow. "Gravity drowned" is false and it could never be true, because gravity isn't the /type/ of thing to drown. It's /ontologically ridiculous/ -- a category error.

Generally speaking, everything is probably ontologically ridiculous, because language =/= ontology.

That's all I'm saying
