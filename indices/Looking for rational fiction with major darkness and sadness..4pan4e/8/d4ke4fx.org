Surprised nobody's recommended the short fiction [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/y4/three_worlds_collide_08/][three worlds collide]]. It has some pretty dark elements. [[http://www.davidbarrkirtley.com/veilofignorancebydavidbarrkirtley.html][Veil of ignorance]] is also pretty dark. [[http://brainchip.thecomicseries.com/][Transdimensional brain chip]] is funny but it gets somewhat dark at the end, which is why I didn't recommend it in the other thread, lots of clone death IIRC.

Not sure about the rationality of the following but I thought these were pretty dark too:

Obviously the SCP stories. Notably, the memory/memetics series--I believe it starts here: [[http://www.scp-wiki.net/we-need-to-talk-about-fifty-five]]

RWBY vs the gamer is set in a pretty grim (heh) setting.
