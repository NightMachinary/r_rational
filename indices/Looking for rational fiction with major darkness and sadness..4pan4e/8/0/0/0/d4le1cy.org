Fine Structure is really, really rough - it's got a lot of good stuff, but that good stuff is buried in a lot of stuff that is much less good.

It feels like the author was experimenting a lot with the story structure, and got decidedly mixed results - it's a lot less linear and straightforward than Ra was (and Ra itself was not exactly the most linearly written story of all time...). Also, the characters are even weaker than Ra's decidedly skeletal cast.

If you didn't find Ra compelling or interesting, I think it's probably unlikely you'll like Fine Strucuture either... unless your problems with Ra was that it was too character driven and too linear, I guess?
