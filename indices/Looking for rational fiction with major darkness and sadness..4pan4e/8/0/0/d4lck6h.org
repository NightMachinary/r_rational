  Do you think I can read RWBY vs the gamer without having watched RWBY, or should I just watch it first?
#+end_quote

I didn't really like RWBY's first episode when I watched it so I've seen pretty much none of the episodes and still +was completely addicted to+ liked the story. I can't say for sure but from reading the fanfic it sounds like RWBY is a pretty generic monsters vs people cartoon and anything that is specific to RWBY seems to have been explained in the fic adequately.

  I'm pretty sure the antimemtics series is rational, it's written by the guy who wrote both Ra and Fine Structure.
#+end_quote

I guess. I've read some of Ra but haven't finished it but never heard of fine structure, would you recommend it?
