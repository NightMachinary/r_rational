If you're looking for a good FiO spinoff, [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/91933/friendship-is-optimal-always-say-no][Always Say No]] is one of my favorites. It deals with the concept in a less detached way than the original, and many of the implied consequences are directly addressed. Honestly, I think it's a more entertaining read overall.
