[[http://aidanmoher.com/blog/2012/02/reviews/review-prince-of-thorns-by-mark-lawrence/][Prince of Thorns]] is /gorgeously/ dark, set in a post-apocalyptic world in which Doomsday was the rendering of reality magical. It follows a precocious -(but not so much so as HPJEV, and with in-universe reason)- 13 yearold who initially seems to have psychopathy to rival HPMOR!Quirrel's apathy. Character's actions are always their own (or, if pawns, their unseen master's) and never the plot's, the amorality of the setting is altogether its own achievement, the protagonist wins only insofar as his resources merit (though sometimes these resources are hidden from the reader until after their relevance is revealed, and not every apparent win is real). I haven't seen the Rationalist community's take on it, but I think it fits the bill at least as well as any other non-Rationalist derived works and on top of that is, well, /gorgeous/.

Oh, and fun trivia: Its author, [[/u/MarkLawrence]], has a background in pure mathematics (PhD in Several Complex Variables) and [[http://www.marklawrence.buzz/about-the-author/][worked in AI]]. Come to think of it, I'm surprised I haven't seen his work mentioned here before.
