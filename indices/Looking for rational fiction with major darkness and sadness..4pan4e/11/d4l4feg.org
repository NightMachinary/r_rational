I heartily recommend the First Law trilogy and the four books in the same universe that follow it. It's fantasy with some magic, and it's rational in that battles are bloody and people die in them, villains have motivations from selfishness to really shady values, politics happen behind the scenes and mostly it centers on the characters and their struggles to change or to find meaning in their lives. It's written by someone who studied psychology and I find that it's mostly psychologically realistic, but I found nothing particularly irrational in other aspects. But most characters are very interesting and pretty much all of them are tragic in their own way.
