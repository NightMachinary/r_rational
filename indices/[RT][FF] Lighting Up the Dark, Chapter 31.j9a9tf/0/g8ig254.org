IT'S BACK!

Oh how long I have longed, how wait I have waited. Sweet nectar of divine narrative, it's back.

I'm sorry for Sakura (if she truly lost, we haven't seen that). I'm worried for the whole setting (being that if Hinata dies, Naruto will have to undo reality, and also fuck you overpowered homicidal Gaara). But most importantly I'm excited to get new chapter*/S/* (wink wink, nudge nudge)!
