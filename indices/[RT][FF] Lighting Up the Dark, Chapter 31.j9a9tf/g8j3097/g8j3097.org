This fic is back?

I cant, believe it! hahahahahaha

Anyways good stuff, had to reread previous chapter to remember story for this fic, after Waves Arisen and so many other fanfics it all jumbles up.

Overall cool stuff, maybe not have the cliffhanger from last chapter get skipped over, but so far so good.
