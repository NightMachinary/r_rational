I just found this subreddit, like it a lot, but I'd like to see more links to first chapters and brief synopsis in the threads, at least every couples threads. Most of the times its like 20 posts either hyper focused on the chapter or vague discussions about how the last arc wasnt that great.

Sorry, just saw your post and felt this might be the most relevant area to post.
