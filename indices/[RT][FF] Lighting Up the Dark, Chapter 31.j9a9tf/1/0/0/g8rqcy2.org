If you've ever watched Naruto and gone 'why doesn't anyone test how momentum interacts with substitution, because either way it's abusable', well. Naruto does in this fic. But it's still well written and has sane power scaling so this doesn't turn into a fix-fic romp where he beats up Madara with the power of Science or whatever.
