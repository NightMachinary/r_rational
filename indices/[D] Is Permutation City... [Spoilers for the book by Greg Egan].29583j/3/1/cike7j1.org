Personally, once we start screwing with personal timelines and continuity, the illusion of a continuous existence becomes secondary to the reality from a local omnipresent viewpoint following traditional causal computation.

It's like how packs in the fire in the deep (which I'm enjoying so far, it's amazing xenofiction) have a very loose sense of identity naturally, if you split an octet apart, you've got two quads with the same identity, and could run equally baffling thought experiments on them as the Ebborians.

Do you really think the anthropic paradoxes are covering the same question though? The primary difference I see is that in all those Ebborian Thought experiments, we know the 3rd POV scenario and rules, which paradoxically screw with the 1st POV's predictive engines. In Permutation city, the reverse is true. We know that PC was defined as a deterministic set of physics laws, with a starting condition that was highly ordered, including copies of people and surrounded by a border of replicators which build a copy of themselves, then become normal computronium ready to be used by the inhabitants. The complexity grows, and eventually the simulation is so large that even if all the matter in the visible universe was converted to computronium and ran until maximum entropy, it still wouldn't be able to reach an end-point.

What exactly happened when the simulation on earth ended? Is it still being simulated somewhere else in the multiverse, or does the self-consistent system itself exist somewhere? Was the simulation even needed, or are all probable and improbable PCs already existent by that principle multiplied by the infinite possible deterministic models and layouts?

It's like Greg Egan took the principle that the googolplexth digit of pi is a specific number even if we'll never be able to calculate it, and mixed it with quantum suicide.
