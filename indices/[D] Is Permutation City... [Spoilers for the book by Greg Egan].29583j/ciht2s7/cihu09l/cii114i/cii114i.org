Running a simulation of yourself doesn't affect you causally (one could do it on the other side of the galaxy, out of your light-cone, so that no causal contact is possible). This is a strong argument for why starting a simulation of yourself should not decrease your amount of magical reality fluid.

This is a bit confusing, because probability is also a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_%28mathematics%29][measure]], and it's not allowed to sum to more than one - if you have more than one copy of yourself per universe, this means that your probability-measure and your reality fluid measure can be different! (Though probably only by a normalization constant, given perfect information) What you call "no longer the same identity" is really a piece of information that distinguishes the original from the copy, so that according to each, the probability of being the other is 0% (according to perfect reasoners) - but this doesn't change the degree to which the original or the copy /exist/.

Anyhow, suppose we start with 1.21 [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigger_%28unit%29#Jigger][jiggers]] of measure. 1.2 jiggers are in the ordinary universe or a perfect simulation thereof, and 0.01 jiggers are being simulated differently, or are Boltzmann brains, or whatever (these numbers not to scale). Then we create a simulation of ourselves. This new copy has 1.2 jiggers of measure in the ordinary universe, because we just created it there, and the copy also exists as a Boltzmann brain, or an independent simulation, or whatever, so it also has a total measure of 1.21 jiggers.

Now we shut down the simulation in our universe, so now we're not giving the copy any more measure - it only has what it had all along, which was 0.01 jiggers. From an inside observer's point of view, it would look just like a very accurate sniper was about to take a headshot.
