Interesting idea, but how do you resolve the boundary between "actively simulated" and "magically simulated"?

When the scan is first made and initialized, your measure is 50% inside, 50% outside. Simulate it long enough, and the two identities diverge enough that each entity is separate enough that your measure is 100%, and, for example, the outside version is also at 100%, since they're no longer the same identity.

When the simulation switches off, how exactly does the measure get divided up, from the inside observer's point of view, if the simulation is of a purely deterministic physics model?
