The necessary idea here is called "measure." Also sometimes known as "magic reality fluid."

Currently, I have lots of measure. But if I do the Schrodinger's cat experiment on myself, so that I have a 50% chance of a radioactive decay triggering lethal poison, I'll have 50% less measure. Or if I drive so dangerously that just a few malfunctioning neurons in another driver's brain would get me into a fatal crash, maybe I lose 1% of my measure.

Now suppose I go into the Schrodinger's cat experiment, but instead of lethal poison, there is instead chocolate cake. After the experiment, 50% of my measure will be a version of me with cake, and 50% of my measure will be a version of me without cake.

The more of my measure is given to the version with cake, the more likely it is that I'll have cake.

In Permutation City, the magically-continued simulation has a lot less measure than the original world. You are therefore less likely to be in a simulation than in the original. Any plan that relies on this happening is a bad one - it should be avoided just like we avoid driving dangerously, or trying to wrestle tigers.

There are some other issues, like causality and dealing with infinities, but the basic idea is that Permutation-City-style simulations of you have extremely low measure (even though there are lots of them! It's not number that matters, it's magic reality fluid), and so when you look out the window, you will observe the normal world with extremely high probability.
