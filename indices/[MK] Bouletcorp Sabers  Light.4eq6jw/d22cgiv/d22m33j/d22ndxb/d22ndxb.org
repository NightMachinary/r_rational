The problem with a lightsaber crossguard is that lightsaber blade basically cuts through almost everything. To make an actual crossguard for a ligthsaber fight will require that the crossguard also be a form of lightsaber and that is just scratching the surface of what has been discussed on this. This topic has been discussed so many times the first time we saw that lightsaber. Almost every conceivable scenarios, considerations have been discussed.
