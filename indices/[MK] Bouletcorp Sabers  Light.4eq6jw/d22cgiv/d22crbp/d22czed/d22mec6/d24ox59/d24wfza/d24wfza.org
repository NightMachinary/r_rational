Unfortunately, I haven't seen too much Kenjutsu - most of the Japanese martial arts that I've seen has been kendo, where the style seems nearly suicidal. This is probably them just gaming the rules because of kendo's limited target area and required form - if they can't hit you in the right spot the right way, you're fine. This also means that their parries don't have to be as protective or controlled - as long as you just do enough to throw them off (plus a little for good measure) then you're fine.

As much as I'm picking kendo apart, there are a surprising amount of similarities between kendo and longsword. Jodon is nearly identical to a high vom tag, and hasso is close to a common one. Gedan is like alber, chudan is halfway between pflug and longpoint, and while Wikipedia doesn't tell me it has a name, when I watch videos of kendo, I can see the kendoka go into ochs.

Now, also remember that I'm terrible at Historical European Martial Arts - I just know the buzzwords and basic stances. I know a bit more about sport fencing, but I'm still terrible at that. More info on HEMA at [[/r/wma]]
