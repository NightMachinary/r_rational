I haven't seen Disney's Star Wars so I can't comment on how it was depicted in the film, but the modified lightsaber doesn't seem unreasonable; it's just a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossguard][crossguard]]. Obviously it would require a somewhat modified fighting style, but it's certainly not /obviously/ useless or impractical. The danger to the user is probably not that much more than a standard lightsaber, and almost certainly not more than a double-ended lightsaber.

In general terms, I don't think Star Wars is a particularly good universe for munchkinry. The original films had the goal of creating a compelling movie experience, not to create a coherent and rational universe. The Expanded Universe eventually did a pretty good job at filling in the holes and making something that on the surface seems reasonably consistent, but it remains insufficiently well specified to really be able to subject it to muchkinry.
