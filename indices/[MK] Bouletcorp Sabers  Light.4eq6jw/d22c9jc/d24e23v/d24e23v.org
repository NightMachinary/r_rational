Interestingly, the light sabers used by the Sith Inquisitors in Rebels are probably more munchkiny, and they're canon. Double bladed lightsaber, on a ring that can spin. So, shield function? Yup. Grievous-style buzzsaw of doom? Check. /Friggin helicopter!?/ Apparently the repulsorlift motor that helps the blades spin generates enough lift that it can lift the wielder /and let them fly, Inspector Gadget style./
