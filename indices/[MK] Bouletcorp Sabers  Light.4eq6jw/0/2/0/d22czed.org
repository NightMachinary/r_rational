It's not a question of /need/. Obviously a crossguard isn't /needed/ because the standard lightsaber doesn't have it, but that does not mean that having a crossguard can't lend itself to a modified fighting style.

A crossguard makes the most sense if the blades can slide against one another, I don't know to what extent this is the case. If the blades could slide against one another almost frictionlessly, then a crossguard still wouldn't be /needed/, but when parrying you would either have to rotate the blade to stop your opponent's blade from sliding up its length, or otherwise push and deflect your opponent's blade to the side before that could occur.

The crossguard stops the opponent's blade from sliding up, it can be used to parry while attacking with the main length, and it could lend itself to locks where the opponent's blade was trapped between the main blade and the crossguard.
