Lightabers bind extremely well, from what I've seen in the movies.

As a fencer who's attempted to do some fencing with lightsabers, it's extremely hard to protect both your hands and yourself without a crossguard. There's no real way to hold their blade away without it being caught on something, and without a crossguard, the only option is your hand. Not to mention that the lack of a crossguard makes my favorite move in German Longsword, the Zwerchau, nearly impossible. A regular sport fencing circle six is nearly impossible without a bell guard as well.

Edit: also, the amount of times I've hit myself with my crossguard while doing longsword sparring would make me incredibly leery about having a crossguard that would burn though my skin.
