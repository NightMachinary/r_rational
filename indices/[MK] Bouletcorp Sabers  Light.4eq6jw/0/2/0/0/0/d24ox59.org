It may be an issue of swordplay style. The moves you learned for GL are designed for a weapon with a crossguard, so naturally they don't work well without one. On the other hand, kenjutsu relies very little on the guard -- bokken don't have crossguards at all, and it's generally not an issue. As far as I know, the tsuba on a katana is mostly there to keep it from dropping too far into the sheath.
