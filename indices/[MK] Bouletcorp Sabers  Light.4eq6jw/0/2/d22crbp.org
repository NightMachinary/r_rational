The laser crossguard thing would make a lot more sense if you ever saw a jedi need a crossguard. I mean, physically, it's obvious you should need one or every lightsaber fight would end with your fingers liquefied by the other guy's saber. But since we never, ever see that happening, the crossguard seems a little useless.

Also, the rotating blade exists: it's the inquisitors' weapon in Star Wars Rebels.
