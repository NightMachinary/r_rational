The problem isn't the crossguard, but its design. The spokes of the guard are produced by two light generators on the saber base. The guard can't fulfill its defensive purpose, because if an attacker's lightsaber blade slips down the defender's, the attacker's blade will cut through the two generators, never touching the light produced therefrom. The guard is thus a wholly offensive addition, and in more than one sense literally cuts both ways.
