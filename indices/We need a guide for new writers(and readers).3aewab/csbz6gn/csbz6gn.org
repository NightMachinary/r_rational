Yeah, I agree. I've been idly trying to write something that can capture the ethos while also not stepping on too many toes, but I've got a lot of other stuff going on. If we want to cross-post to other places, we also want a strongly-typed definition that people can immediately understand (if not internalize).

Ideally, there should be a one-sentence hook that's mildly inaccurate but at least gets the point across. Something like, "Fiction with rules", but ... better.

The side bar is the starting point, but I don't think it's enough; too many of the characteristics of rational fiction are characteristics of good fiction /generally/ and I don't think you could reconstruct the subgenre from those rules alone.
