Absolutely. If you as the reader ever go "Now why the /hells/ would he do /that/?" and you are never given an answer (assuming you're not just missing something), then that is not okay. If you go "Now why the /hells/ would he do /that/?", and then at the end of the chapter say to yourself, "Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh," then, again, you're good to go.

In the end, there has be /some/ way for the character to end up at that place at that time in order to catch that guy stealing that thing--just make sure that it makes sense within the context of the story for him to do so. Otherwise, you made to do some replotting, or simply let that guy get away with stealing that thing. After all, its only that thing that that other guy made out of that stuff. It's even That Thing!
