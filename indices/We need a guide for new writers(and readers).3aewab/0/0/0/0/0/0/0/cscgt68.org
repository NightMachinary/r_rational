I agree. The character shouldn't /always/ act rationally. But there should always be a /reason/ for them to make whatever decision they're making, regardless of how rational said decision is. As long as the reason for them making a terrible decision is "they were scared, they're family was being threatened, and they hadn't slept in 36 hours," as opposed to "they needed to end up at that place at that time in order to catch that guy stealing that thing," then you're good to go.
