The difference is the ranking of the other choices. It's not that they're particularly wrong about the drow, it's that they're wrong about summer: first, summer and winter are irreconcilable. Second, the wild hunt rides; summer is gone and cat already has the hunt.

It's not that cat sees the drow as the better option, she sees them as the only option, and other players think there's others left.
