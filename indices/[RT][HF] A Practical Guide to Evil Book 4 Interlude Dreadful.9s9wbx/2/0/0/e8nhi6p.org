It was an obvious enough choice, from the perspectives of Cat and Juniper specifically, that they both jumped onto it without hesitation or pause for thinking through it. (Or at least Juniper specifically did - we didn't see Cat's initial line of reasoning.)

Other options outside of the Drow do/did exist. Malicia talks about one she finds more compelling here, and it's important to note that she considers the fae to be fucking crazy even as she dismisses the drow as compleltly unviable. Being worse than a terrible option does not make for a ringing endorsement.

Cat and Akua also had a talk about alternatives a while back (although that one was after finding out about the Drow, which solves some problems and creates a whole bunch more - but more to the point all the alternatives raised here where viable /before/ Cat set of to the Everdark).

The Drow were a complete gamble when all Cat knew about them was four pages from one book, and that didn't even paint a very positive picture. Most of Cat's knowledge could be summed up as the drow being the ruins of a former empire, having no centralised government with which to treat, being infamously violent and treachourous and being far behind the curve technologically.

Juniper herself said of the drow "we'd need of a functional army for that to have any degree of success. Nothing we've heard leads me to believe they have one".

This is what she ran off to see, when running off left Callow more vulnerable in that moment, as Malicia herself pointed out.
