I expect it's a huge part of it. The destruction of much of their farmland to the south (from Summer and Akua) is not something that's great for GDP, nor is losing large chunks of the population needed for tilling the remaining land.

Add onto that the cost of outfitting armies for all the battles, the loss of most of the government, and the destruction of Liesse, amongst other things, and it's not a great situation.

Malicia wasn't considering burning down fields, she was looking at burning down the /granaries/.

This is a good question. I wouldn't be surprised if Pres is running into food problems as well.
