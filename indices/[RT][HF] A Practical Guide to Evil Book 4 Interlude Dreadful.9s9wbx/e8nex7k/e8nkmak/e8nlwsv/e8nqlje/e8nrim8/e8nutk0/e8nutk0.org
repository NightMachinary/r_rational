So following this down the line, is this why Callow is having monetary economic problems?

Ultimately, I'm questioning how much grain is currently in circulation throughout the lands - as was mentioned in previous books, Callow is *THE* breadbasket. The most fertile lands with the greatest output. If that's the case, than how would burning that down not cause trickle down effects to the surrounding areas? If Callow is not providing grains, then who is? And how much can the provide to offset the loss that is the greatest exporter?
