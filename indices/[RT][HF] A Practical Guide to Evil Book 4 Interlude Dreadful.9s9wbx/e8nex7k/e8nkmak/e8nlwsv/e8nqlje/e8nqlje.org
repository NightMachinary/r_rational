  I question how much grain Callow is sending towards Praes at this point. Both because they're already running low and, you know, that whole enemies thing they have going on.

Isn't Callow's main export grain? If that's true, that no matter what Praes can and will receive grain - through proxy merchants, second-hand purchases through the wasteland, or etc, but if Callow is both exporting (period) and the leading exporter of grain as I'm lead to believe, then Praes can probably get their hands on some form or amount of despite the currently strained relationships.

It's how a lot of countries work through embargoes today, after all. Real-life precedent in this.
