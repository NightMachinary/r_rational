War is an expensive enterprise and Callow doesn't have any other trade partners that would purchase grain. Regardless, even if they don't trade with Praes it would be counterproductive for the long term interests of the Empire. If Callow is starving, it means it doesn't produce surplus of grain, which means eventually the Empire will starve too. It would be a very short sighted move.

What you've said about the drow is certainly true, however it's still a more conservative option. The risk of using fae lies in giving them a foothold in Creation, potentially dooming both Callow and Calernia as a whole. The risk of obtaining drow forces lies mostly in getting herself killed or just wasting her time (in the case where they turn out to be weak). Add in the fact Cat is very difficult to kill and I think she did chose the less extreme gamble.
