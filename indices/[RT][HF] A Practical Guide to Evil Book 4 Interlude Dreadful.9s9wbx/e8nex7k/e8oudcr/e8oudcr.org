Not on a whim; it's more like a MAD situation, as Cat can also end Malicia's reign when pushed. Remember Cat's army beat Malicia's, so she can take over the Green Stretch anytime she wants.

Malicia is walking on a tightrope; keeping Callow weak enough to not be a threat, but not pushing it hard enough that Cat would take her gloves off. For this to work she has to know all the variables, which is why the Drow army is going to be such a big issue for her.
