Fucking Malicia. Even as her Empire teeters on the brink while faced with an enemy crusade and it's greatest champion is captured she is plotting how best to attack a former ally she pushed into being an enemy. And contemplates how far she can push her most powerful remaining ally without turning him hostile.

Sounds like someone stopped keeping her Name in line a while back. Just another Dread Empress, barreling towards the usual end.

EDIT:

  We need a new guarantee that she won't gate in and burn a few miles of farmland to the ground every time she's provoked.

I have a fun idea, you could just not fucking provoke her.
