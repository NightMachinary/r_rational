Malicia's, and Praes by extension, weakness in general is that they don't understand using goodwill to win loyalty and alliances. She could have treated Cat well and gotten her allegiance, but instead she needs to have leverage to hold over Cat to keep her in control. Her relationship with Black is the exception, as seen at the end of this chapter, and even then she has plans in place to stop him and actively chose not to use them, knowing that it was probably a mistake to do so.
