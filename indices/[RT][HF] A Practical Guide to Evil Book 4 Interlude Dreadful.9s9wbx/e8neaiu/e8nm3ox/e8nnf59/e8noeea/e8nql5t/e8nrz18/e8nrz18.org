  Yeah, but he's here at his father's request, to defend the Empire against a common enemy. I think there's a degree of "never attack or lock up you promised guest rights to" at work here.

At a certain point it's also on Masego for walking I to the lion's den - Prasei don't really do guest rights so much as they serve guests poisoned wine, and the invitation he received didn't point towards there being any immunity. Masego himself acknowledged that his main protection against being locked up is his incredible power and his father's unwilling to use his own full might against him.

And if the alternative is having him killed in a conflict .. locking him up probably has better outcomes for all relevant parties here.

Plus, they're Evil.

  Also, I think the "arranging a failure to protect" plan would end up with Masego dead,

Don't mind me, I just failed a basic literacy roll there. Cheers for pointing that out.

I still get why she considers it though: she has a country to run, Hierophant's one of the main threats to that country, and Malicia is a stone cold killer, who was happy for Liesse to be destroy led for questionable benefits. This is sort of what OG Practical Evil is about.
