Murdering Masgeo? She considers "arranging a failure to protect Hierophant from vengeful nobles" and then having him "imprisoned for a few years rather than involved in a brutal knife-fight between the Woe and the Empire where death was a real possibility".

But you're probably right that this is what AntiChri5 was referring to - I just got distracted by the Malicia-Black relationship, which I kind of love.

I still don't think her musings on Masego are that bad though? He's on the opposite side of a serious conflict now, and that's going to have to be dealt with. It's going to suck for everyone involved, yeah, but that's not a good reason for just ignoring be the issue.
