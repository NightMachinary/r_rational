I agree that I liked mysterious Malicia, but this is a chapter that really humanizes her and adds a lot more depth to the character (perhaps setting the stage for Malicia vs Cat?) and works as an exposition chapter too. She's already had a lot of interaction (say vs Dwarves or Gnomes), so we already have a sense of her, she can't really be kept as an omniscient power.

This was more about her relationship with Black, her trying to weigh him up with cold rationality and failing.
