Agreed! I groaned at the beginning but the rest of the chapter was really engaging. I think that the nature of Malicia/Black's relationship is genuinely new information.

There aren't a lot of loving relationships on the side of Evil, but now we have Malicia/Black, Masego/TheDads, and possibly Archer/Ranger (though that one is complicated by abusive power dynamics & neglect).

This was the first chapter where Malicia's goals were a plausibly worthwhile alternative to Cat's.
