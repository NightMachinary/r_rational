I'm not sure what timescale Malicia is operating on.

But I don't think she's planning on a scale of decades, or if she does, I think that's evidence of her being deluded. There's no way her plans will survive contact with the Dead King, the First Prince, Catherine, Black, the mad Tyrant, the Wandering Bard, and all the major heroes for long enough for Callowans to go from "kill every single Praesi we can get our hands on" to being part of the Empire again.
