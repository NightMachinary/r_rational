I groaned when I figured out the viewpoint character. I think that some antagonists are more interesting as an opaque, all-knowing enigma. On the other hand, this was a neat contrast with Cat:

  "She was not Catherine Foundling, to carve out pieces of her own soul at a whim."

What does Cat want? Cat is like the ruler of a 4x strategy game: she WILL stabilize her empire, and eat whatever the cost turns out to be. Her interpersonal relationships, whatever Indrani says, have been largely transactional. It's not that Cat has much to offer to the rest of the Woe. Instead the members of the Woe were chosen because they have something to offer Cat. In exchange they are granted a narrative weight that is impossible to find anywhere else.

Cat & co. succeed not because they have protagonist superpowers (everybody in the Guideverse has some level of plot-armor). Cat is successful because she managed to make her story into Callow's story. When she was up against the Wayward Prince in book 1, she had the full weight of an entire nation.

There is some evidence for my claim in tonight's chapter. Notice how the countermeasures against Cat are things that would make her less popular. The Dead King succeeded in crafting a nation where his (evil) leadership enjoys the consent of the governed. If the Underdark campaign ends well then Cat might enjoy the same advantage during book 5.
