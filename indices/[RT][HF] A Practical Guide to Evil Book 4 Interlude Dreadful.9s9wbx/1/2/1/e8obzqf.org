It was more due to Bard's suggestion for Dorian to corner Cat in melee: she created a pivot where outcome (Squire rushing into the breach made by the cataphracts only to meet the Prince, or him flaunting his pretty face in Fifteenth's crossbow range) would be decided by who turns out to be more pragmatic, in line with her Lone Swordsman's own theme.

Then there's also the consideration that she may have been aware of Akua heading for the Hell Egg, and chose to not feed the demon two Named. The same pivot would either bring Cat straight to Marchford, or leave the defenders with two and a half heroic Named, maybe Archer, and a priest strong enough to short out scrying for all of the Silver Spears.
