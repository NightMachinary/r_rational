Magic items' failure rate seems like an ad-hoc explanation for observed patterns and not a predictive model of the Guideverse. Considering a hero with a magical sword, how should an observer distinguish between the narrative of “rightful king returning to the throne” and “over reliance on magic item”? It seems to me that there's a determinant of narrative direction (i.e. narrative weight) around which magical items' success or failure acts as a sort of crumple zone. It's easy for the magic effect to have a hiccup, so that's how the narrative gives an advantage to the more important character. When there's no magic item involved, the narrative manipulation may have to become more extreme or visible.
