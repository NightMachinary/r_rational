Attempting to censor stories in a narrative driven verse is almost guaranteed to cause a backlash.

We have certain examples for stories being eradicated (the end of the orcish culture under miezan occupation), but I'm pretty sure that "noble attempts to silence the people" would just lead to said noble becoming the villain in a narrative.
