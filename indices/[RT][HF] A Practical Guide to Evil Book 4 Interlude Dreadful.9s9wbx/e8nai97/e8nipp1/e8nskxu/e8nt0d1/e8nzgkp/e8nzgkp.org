I mean, sure, but nobles don't seem to care about being named. I would assume they don't want to die, and nobles were perfectly willing to suppress revolutionary propaganda. Maybe it's a race to the bottom, where they'd rather take out their rivals than change things, or it's not worth the effort since the first nobles didn't do it then, or just coordination issues, but it still seems odd to me.
