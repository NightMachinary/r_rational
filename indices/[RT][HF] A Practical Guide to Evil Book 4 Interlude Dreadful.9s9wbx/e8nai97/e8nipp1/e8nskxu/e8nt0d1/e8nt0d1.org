Censorship on that scale would be almost impossible even if they managed to get every noble in a country to cooperate. There will always be those who find ways to break the law, and information suppression becomes more and more difficult as numbers increase.

Besides, stories are part of what give Named their power. Suppressing them would lead to weaker Named in the long term.
