Yeah, Malicia seems a bit disconnected from reality here.

I mean, she recently had a huge chunk of Callow's administration murdered, including extremely popular people like Baronness Kendall, and yet she thinks she can still get Callow back as a vassal state with a puppet queen.

Forget cultural spite, there's not a single country on the continent that would accept this kind of shit without constant rebellions.
