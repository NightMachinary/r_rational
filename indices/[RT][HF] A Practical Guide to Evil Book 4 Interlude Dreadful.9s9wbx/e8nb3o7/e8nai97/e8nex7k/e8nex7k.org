So Black's alive! Probably. I thought an offscreen death would have been a little ignoble an ending, even if I was willing to take it. Pilgrim must have an angle here for keeping him alive, risky though that might be. If Amadeus really /is/ nameless, then that might have played into the decision.

  Callow might be somewhat stable, but it was one bad winter away from effective collapse. If Alaya ordered most royal granaries torched, starvation would afflict half the realm after the snows came

So Malicia could effectively end Callow at her whim. I can't imagine Malicia's agents can be rooted out at this point, if Thief's and Black's people can't avoid Malicia knowing most everything there is to know that's going on in the kingdom.

And hopefully Cat has a plan for all the hungry mouths she's about to add to these already strained granaries.

I'm not too sure what they're doing here. There's no good exit behind them, the mountain path was closed back when they fought the crusade and Ranker noted that the only paths of retreat were months of marching away. Is there a plan here?

Well, this should be fascinating. Say what you want about Malicia, but she's very good at playing the game of nations.

  How could she tell this familiar stranger that they had been one for so long some days she could hardly tell where she began and he ended? Maybe debt could have been the sum of them, if after the civil war he had treated her a figurehead -- as was well within his power. If he'd proved himself yet another cage, this one gentler than the last but no less a prison for it. But he'd understood, that it was not comfort or a furious avenger she craved. Kindness, consolation, all the sweets words their tongue could offer. Those things she could have measured and paid back in full. But instead she'd been offered something priceless: a world of endless paths, and someone to walk them with her.

Black and Malicia's relationship is great to see - I only wish we saw more of it.

But this:

  She was not Catherine Foundling, to carve out pieces of her own soul at a whim.

is quite the burn.

  The Everdark was a mess of primitive warring tribes, effectively impossible to mobilize quickly and highly unpalatable allies regardless

It's quite interesting that Malicia, who is one of the most well informed people on the continent, seems to knows nothing about what's really going on with the Drow and the Night. More evidence that powerful Mighty have not, for some reason, ever left the Everdark and made the sort of impact you'd expect people with that kind of power to make.

Malicia also immediately dismisses the Drow as possible allies and such a ludicrous idea she doesn't even entertain the possibility. It makes me wonder, again, why both Cat and Juniper leapt to the Drow as the obvious choice when all they believed was that the Drow were treacherous and unreliable savages.

But I quite like Malicia, and this chapter was a good look at some of the things she knows, and some of the things she doesn't.
