  Callow doesn't have any other trade partners that would purchase grain.

They also don't have /grain/, period, so...

In terms of it being a short sighted move, I also just want to note that Praes is not required to destroy all of Callow's food forever to break the country. Destroy this year's supply, watch riots, famines and diseases do their thing, and then let a weakened Callow move back towards building up that surplus. Praes isn't going to be getting good from Callow this year either way, so they can afford to play the long game. (Although obviously there are other considerations in play here).

  The risk of obtaining drow forces lies mostly in getting herself killed or just wasting her time (in the case where they turn out to be weak)

I'm talking about the case where they turned out to be scary-strong and with cultural and magical incentives towards being really, really bad neighbours who would like nothing more than murdering everyone in Callow if given the option, and Cat just led all aboard that train with a bunch of magical oaths (that definitely aren't a big obvious target for any story) and is maybe going to put Larat in charge.

Personally I think that indicates a certain level of risk tolerance.
