Burning Callow's granaries would effectively be suicide on Malicia's part. The Empire has been dependent on their grain for over twenty years and if Callow was starving it's likely the Empire would follow.

I think fae are considered to be the primary choice because that's what Cat would do before Second Liesse. She had a tendency to double down on long shots because she's always pulled through in the end and I could see her believing she would weasel out of any oaths she made to get their support.

Since then she's become more aware of her fallibility and is less prone to extreme risk taking. That's why the drow are the only option - worst case scenario she's wasted a couple of months for ten thousand weak bandits. If she went with the fae, worst case scenario is they take over Calernia. In essence, Malicia still believes Cat is reckless and arrogant enough that such gamble would be taken, when it's no longer the case.
