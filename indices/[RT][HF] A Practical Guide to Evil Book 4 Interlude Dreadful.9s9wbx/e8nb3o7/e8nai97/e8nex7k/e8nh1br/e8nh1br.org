I feel like it was less an obvious choice to try the Drow, and more that all other options were taken away. At least as far as Cat knows.

Malicia just made a mistake of knowledge. She knows Cat has more options and that some alliances might still be possible. She assumed Cat knows this as well and therefore overlooked the 2nd to last choice.
