  I figure Malicia is doing this precisely because her empire is on the brink. She wants to secure her borders and consolidate her power.

And creating enemies is a terrible way to go about that.

  Personally I thought the point of that segment was to show that Malicia's bond with Black is so deep and important that she refuses to risk losing him, even for the sake of a fairly major strategic advantage. She has to be pushed into looking at the situation coldy, and then outright refuses what the logic of the situation is telling her.

As others have pointed out, that part was about her musings on how much she would be able to target Masego before she antagonized Warlock. As it stands Warlock is her biggest remaining ally and she is sitting there wondering if she was just /subtle enough/ could she get away with arranging his sons death? Praes in a goddamn nutshell. The ship is sinking and she is sharpening her knife to stick into the back of the guy bailing water.

  That ship sailed with Liesse. Which itself was probably a bad idea and unnecessary to boot, but is now a thing that happened and it has to be lived with.

Liesse was a terrible idea that never would have worked. It guaranteed Cat would turn on her, but it guaranteed that that would happen /one day/. It wasn't an immediate threat. As far as Cat was concerned Malicia was on the back burner, a problem for another day. Then Malicia just keeps pushing and pushing and pushing, throwing plot after plot at Cat until Cat /has/ to prioritize her.

When she murdered half of the people running Callow Malicia turned herself from something to deal with in five or ten years to Callow's biggest threat, to be deal with as soon as possible.

Every step of the way she has unnecessarily antagonized the person picked out by her partner as the key to solving Paes' biggest long term problem.
