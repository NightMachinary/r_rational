I liked the insight. I'm getting a real Vetinari vibe from Malicia but without the near-godlike powers he gets from the even more story-driven realm of the Discworld. I haven't come across any character that even holds a candle to the Patrician and I'm glad that Malicia does. True mastermind characters -mildy believable ones at least - are rare.
