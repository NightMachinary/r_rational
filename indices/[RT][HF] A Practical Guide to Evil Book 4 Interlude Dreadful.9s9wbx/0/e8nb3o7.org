I really liked how she carefully considered the options Catherine had, made intelligent and reasonable deductions, and came to a completely wrong conclusion. It's nice to have a mastermind type villain who can be wrong sometimes!

I wonder what the full terms of the treaty are. It has to be something that would prevent Catherine / Callow from attacking Praes, and it probably is on the stick side of things rather than carrot. My guess would be that since it's a formal alliance between Praes and the Dead King, if Callow attacks Praes than the Dead King can attack Callow. That would seem heavy handed though.
