Because using it to shift through every single thing anyone says to you is too much time and energy for something that might not be that big a deal. Sure if you suspect your SO is cheating on you then it might occur to you to use it as a lie detector. But 90% of the time this is basically a passive source of free money with minimal effort, so it makes sense to sit back and let it do its job.
