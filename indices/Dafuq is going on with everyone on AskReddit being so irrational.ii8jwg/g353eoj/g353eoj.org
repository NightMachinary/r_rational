To be fair, the question was "how do you use it to get rich," not "how do you use it to improve the world." Using it as a lie detector has limited wealth-generation power because you have to be physically present. I guess you could rent yourself out to the FBI or whoever and get them to pay you a salary that's greater than whatever you make paying someone $10/lie to lie to you all day, but that process would take a long time, during which you could have been racking up the Benjamins.

EDIT: Also, exposing yourself to an alphabet-soup org for cash is probably a bad idea in the first place. It's highly unlikely they'd just let you walk around free once they realize you're a perfect lie detector.
