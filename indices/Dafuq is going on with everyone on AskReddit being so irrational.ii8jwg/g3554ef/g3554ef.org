There's a reason [[/r/AskReddit][r/AskReddit]] has a dedicated [Serious] flair. With ordinary questions, the intent is purely to entertain. Even the most creative answer to that question wouldn't be as widely appreciated in terms of enjoyment value as humour. I don't think any of them, if they got that power, would choose to attend sales pitches, or go to work as a pharmacist. They're not being irrational, they're being funny, because the point with the question isn't solely to munchkin.
