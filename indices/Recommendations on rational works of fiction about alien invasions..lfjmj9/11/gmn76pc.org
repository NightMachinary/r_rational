to expand on 2, i always had a thought that earth is the only habitable planet for hundreds/thousands/etc of lightyears. taking over earth could create a travel route as you said, but it could also be a secret outpost for alien governments for covert spying or experiments. earth could be the aliens' equivalent of area 51 lol

another thing could be that some earthling species, either humans or some other species, could be biologically similar to another alien race. either the superior human alien species tries to eliminate us for ruining their reputation, or their enemies capture us for experimenting bioweapons that would be harmful on the human aliens (which they wouldnt need to try hard for lol, as we humans have gotten very good at killing other humans)

i actually havent read many alien sci-fi books or other media, so idk if anything ive thought of has been explored much. i'll eventually try to find some, but i got a long list to go thru first lol
