I think that's different.

I'm thinking of a scenario where earth is not inherently a target of the aliens, but just collateral damage. The aliens may not even want to invade earth.

Imagine the following. Some alien space terrorist group is discovered hiding out on earth. The local Galactic Empire sends in the military to arrest him. It's not even an invasion force, just a small elite unit, a couple hundred thousand ships at most.

They aren't attacking humans. In fact their mission is explicitly to minimize destruction of the native life forms. Before the mission was even approved, experts analyzed dozens of scenarios, and losses to native life are expected to be no more than 10% to 20%, which is considered acceptable.
