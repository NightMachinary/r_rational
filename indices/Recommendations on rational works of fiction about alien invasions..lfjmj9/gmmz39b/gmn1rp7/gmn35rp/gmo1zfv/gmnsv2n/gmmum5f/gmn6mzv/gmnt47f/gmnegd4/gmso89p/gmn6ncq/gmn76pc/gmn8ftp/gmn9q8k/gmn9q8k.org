not exactly. i was thinking about if some alien species were like what MCU & popular media portray em as, aka humans but with green skin, then some of those species might not like the fact that earthlings are stupidly killing themselves & their planet. theyd kill us out of pettiness because they dont want to be compared to us

ultraterrestials could easily have similar motivations for wanting humanity gone. their race of superior beings would hate being compared to a barbaric species like modern humans & would maybe even destroy the whole planet just to erase theif dark history.

both reasons dont have to be because other alien species are the problem tho. plenty of empires would want the disfavorable parts to be censored, and removing humanity & earth entirely could be part of theid effort of glorifying their empire & their species
