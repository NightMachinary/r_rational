Maybe we should flip the question. Let's think about /us/. In what realistic scenario would we turn into invaders for another planet?

The answer is... all of them. Like, suppose we identified one potentially close livable planet with spectroscopy. We got excited, managed to drum up enough support to send a mission. A steady stream of fusion ramscoops with cryopreserved colonists leaves the Solar System. Armed, of course, you never know. Then upon getting there, we find out the place has intelligent life. Would the official policy be “let's invade them”? No. Would that convince a bunch of armed, hopeful colonists with a reasonable technological edge to just pack their stuff and come back, especially when they already have lots of prepackaged cultural explanations to rationalise invasion and enslavement? Also no. It'd be the Americas all over again.
