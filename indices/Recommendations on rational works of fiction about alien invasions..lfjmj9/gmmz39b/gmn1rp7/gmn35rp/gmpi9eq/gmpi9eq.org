Footfall was OK. It's "The Towering Inferno" (or any 70s disaster movie) but with Alien Invasion. Independence Day but with some actual SF authors. Cast of hundreds (etc etc), doorstop of a book that I remember a few scenes from.

As to why the Aliens decided to come to Earth .... They were the losing side in a civil war and were exiled.
