I'm reminded of "The Road Not Taken" (1985) by Harry Turtledove, a ~20 page short story. Apparently FTL is the scientific equivalent of inventing fire or metal tools, but that earth managed to miss it or is missing the element locally.

As a result, taking over territory is orders of magnitude easier than terraforming. Warfare is so easy in fact, that Earth is the odd one out with unique selective pressures on Earth, while the rest of space society develops differently in culture... (it's decent and short, worth the read IMO, and may be open domain as the PDF itself pops up on engines if you search.)
