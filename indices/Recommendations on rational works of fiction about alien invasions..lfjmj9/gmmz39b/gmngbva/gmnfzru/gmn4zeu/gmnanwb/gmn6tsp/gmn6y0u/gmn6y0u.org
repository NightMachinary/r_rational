Assuming that their needs are roughly equivalent to ours, Earth has a functional, self-regulating atmosphere complete with ozone layer and GHG to keep warm, an active magnetic field to ensure we keep it, an active carbon-oxygen cycle, and it's in the Goldilocks zone for liquid water.

Getting Mars to that state is /theoretically/ possible, but terraforming requires an expenditure of energy and resources on the scale of an entire planet and the resources of much of a solar system, generally over centuries, whereas fictional SF FTL usually involves energy expenditures on the scale of what can be carried along on the journey. (Just the energy required to give Mars a rotating core capable of generating a sufficiently protective magnetic field is staggering. It's probably be orders of magnitude cheaper to build a shield against the solar wind in between Mars and the Sun, and that's not small potatoes either.)

In contrast, when you control orbits, wiping out an earthbound civilization down to the level where the survivors are essentially Stone Age primitives with a manageable fraction of their population is the effort of a few years or decades of dropping rocks from above at most. Smash us to the bedrock, let a few generations pass to lose any remaining scientific and technical ability to resist, and return to reap the spoils.

And if you get too aggressive with the bombardment, you can just leave for a while and come back to a planet that might be stuck in an Ice Age but with still living oceans, which is leagues ahead of where Mars starts -- a frozen ball of rock with almost no atmosphere or surface liquid water, mostly thanks to no magnetic fields to prevent hydrogen from getting stripped away by the solar winds, much less any kind of self-sustaining ecology.

*Edit:* That's without considering all the things that may just be impossible or expensive to engineer nicely that humans will want in other star systems: near-Earth gravity, a day-night cycle that won't mess up our circadian rhythms, not being tidally-locked, survivable atmospheric pressure, lack of many natural contaminants like heavy metals and chloride chemistry, a good ratio of nitrogen to oxygen, gentle axial tilt giving seasons and reasonable weather, a simple tidal system due to one moon, an orbit well-cleared of dinosaur-killers, a stable star that rarely sends out solar flares beyond what a civilization can deal with, no nearby quasars to sterilize the system, etc.

Planets capable of supporting /some/ kind of life might be common and yet planets capable of comfortably supporting /us/ might exceptionally rare gems worth the hassle of dropping rocks on monkeys.
