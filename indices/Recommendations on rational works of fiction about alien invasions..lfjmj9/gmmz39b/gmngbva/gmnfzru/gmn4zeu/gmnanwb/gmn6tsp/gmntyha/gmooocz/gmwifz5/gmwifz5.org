True, but one of the benefits of colonizing an uninhabited planet like Mars is that you won't have to deal with problems from the locals. Granted, you could make the rationalization that the aliens would wipe us out with their advance weaponery, but I'd like to think we would put up a fight before they conquer us. But then again maybe I'm a little too optimistic.
