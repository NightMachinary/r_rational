I mean, there's a question of exactly how long-term a plan it really has to be. We assume terraforming is a ten-thousand year project based on our current notions of human industrial capacity, but imagine a von neumann probe that comes into the solar system and recursively reproduces until all the space-bound matter is industry (and say it starts cracking mercury, while it's at it.) How long would that take, given exponential growth and a relatively technologically mature level of technology? If you were willing to spend lots of energy to get seed probes to different parts of the solar system faster, weeks, maybe?

After that, it's a matter of 'how fast do we want those comets on mars, and what portion of the dyson sphere's energy output are we willing to spend on the project?'
