The specific mechanics of FTL matter too. To take an extreme example, you could imagine a situation like Stargate: the aliens have a teleporter that goes to Earth, and doesn't go to Mars. They can march over to Earth with their Death Robots or War Cyborgs or whatever, but they don't have any particular space launch capability, let alone terraforming.

Alternatively, maybe the alien's approach to interstellar travel is to launch a really big ship at a planet which lands automatically and dumps out aliens. For whatever reason, their ship doesn't realize there's already a civilization on Earth, so they can't jump over to Mars until they establish an industrial base here.

Or maybe the aliens use some kind of psychic stardrive that can only go to inhabited planets. If they go too far away from a source of bio-energy, their technology starts to fail.

Provided you're willing to accept technical constraints on the problem, it's /relatively/ easy to get "aliens are stuck with Earth" as an output.
