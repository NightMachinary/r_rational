Then colonization or terraforming is irrelevant, since humanity won't survive the project. Plus, that level of civilization doesn't need to terraform Mars or colonize Earth, they'll get more use out of converting the whole solar system to Orbitals and Ships.

Any civilization that needs planets can't be significantly ahead of us in Kardashev level. They're just another K0, maybe a bit richer.
