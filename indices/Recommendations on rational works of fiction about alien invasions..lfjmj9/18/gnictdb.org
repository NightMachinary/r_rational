Related to #3 was an old sci-fi story where aliens to to Earth to trade knowledge. The aliens only was of life was to travel between solar systems at sub-light speeds only stopping to trade and prepare for the next journey. The time scales involved meant there was no repeat business. The aliens' main trade good was knowledge pills of skills and unique experiences. The aliens' preferred option was to trade these pills collected from many other solar systems over untold years and have the locals build a giant laser to propel and power them onthe first leg of the journey to the next solar system. Building the laser would have left Earth materially impoverished, possibly for generations.

Earth had the options of trading and building the laser (but hey, you now have the knowledge and a giant propulsion laser to exploit the local solar system) or be used as forced labour to build the laser and produce new knowledge/experiences for pills. The aliens could also detonate a portion of the sun (and incidentally fry the Earth with radiation) to propel themselves onward.

Only really a traditional invasion story in option 2 but a rationalish setup.
