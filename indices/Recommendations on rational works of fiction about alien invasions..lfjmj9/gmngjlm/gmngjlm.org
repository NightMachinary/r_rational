Possible redemption of the 'harvesting resources':

They could just be harvesting everything in the solar system and Earth is enough of a threat that they choose to remove it first.

--------------

"We Are Bob" has some invading aliens that gamma ray blast planets and then suck up all the organic compounds for reuse to grow their own populations. Its generally a rational story and pretty fun read.

--------------

Another reason for invasion: Earth is just in the way of a mundane expansion. Its not important or strategic, its just that FTL doesn't exist and skipping over a solar system could mean an extra ten thousand years of travel. They don't really want to fight us, but we don't really want them strip mining the entire solar system either (even if they left Earth alone). And we /do/ have the capability of launching nukes into space, so maybe that is enough of a danger for them. Though they could just soften us up with a few asteroids before actually invading.

This is partially the story that takes place in half life. The Combine has an empire connected through portals, but not really FTL. And I think its necessary for the other side to open the portal for them to jump through. So they are just always going to invade when a portal opens up.

--------------

Another potentially rational reason for us to be invaded: for shits and giggles.

Ya it doesn't sound rational. But if you are a highly advanced alien race maybe re-enacting independence day is a fun scenario. Imagine a kid with an ant farm who chooses to introduce red ants to the black ant nest and watch them fight. The kid has any number of options for actually wiping out the ant farm, but that isn't any fun.

This gets even more messed up if we are the product of accelerated evolution and we were literally created for entertainment purposes.

Oddly I think of all the possible alien invasion scenarios this is probably the only one where we have a chance in hell of winning.
