There could be a fundamental reason for a tradeoff between having AI plus higher risk of escalation vs having no AI and low risk.

Take having a free, open society vs a more authoritarian society. The perks of a free society enable growth in science and the arts, but makes it more vulnerable to espionage and more difficult to plan long term projects. The perks of an authoritarian system chinese style are quick execution of infrastructure projects and a guided industrial policy, but suffers from less individual freedom and less creativity.

So you might not find a combination of high security and high productivity of artificial intelligence that let's you reap the benefits.
