It's a bit similar to 2, but I think a setup like the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoDominium][CoDominium]], [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/41767-starfire][Starfire]], [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074CG2QZ1?ref_=dbs_p_mng_rwt_ser_shvlr&storeType=ebooks][Antares]], or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorkosigan_Saga][Vorkosigan]] series does a good job of providing a rational rationale for interstellar warfare.

Basically, the way FTL works is that there are "warp points" that provided instantaneous travel between star systems (potentially separated by great distances in real space). This means that the number of systems accessible to any given civilization is pretty low, but that civilizations that are distant in real terms can come in contact with each-other. As noted, this is kind of like Earth being prime real estate, but rather that Earth being especially desirable it's more that there aren't very many alternatives.

Another thing these settings typically do is declare that FTL is relatively easy, technically speaking. This means that in addition to Sol system being the only choice the aliens have, they can't just terraform Mars or Venus into something better-suited to their needs. Arguably this is a stretch, but any kind of interstellar war scenario means a great deal of "tech tree" fuckery to avoid curbstomp scenarios, or extremely unsatisfying battle scenes.
