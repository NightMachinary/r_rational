Another possibility: An uncrewed, automated alien probe that wasn't programmed with the possibility of meeting intelligent life in mind. Aliens aren't aware that we're here, they just know that the planet has biological life so they send a probe that uses local resources (screws us over) to construct a teleporter. In The Expanse, the alien probe is a virus like nanotechnology that hijacks lifeforms and repurposes them to build a stargate, but by that time the makers have been extinct for billions of years.
