Peter Watts' novelization of Crysis 2 is along those lines--- The aliens keep Earth---and countless other planets---as “gardens” they can harvest materials from every hundred thousand years or so, and they attack us because we're messing with their garden. Also, the reason the invasion isn't a complete curbstomp is because we're just fighting the equivalent of some semi-intelligent gardening tools that were woken up prematurely and, not actually being designed for war, are just DeepMind-ing their way into a solution to “some of the native fauna are interfering with our job.”
