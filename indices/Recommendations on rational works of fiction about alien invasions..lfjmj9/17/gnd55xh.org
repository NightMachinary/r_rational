We know today that there's no such thing as a Martian civilization, but it's a lot more practical to invade a world when you don't actually have to cross intellerstellar distances to do it; old science fiction such as "War of the Worlds" can give Martians the same kinds of motives that humans have had for crossing oceans when that was difficult.
