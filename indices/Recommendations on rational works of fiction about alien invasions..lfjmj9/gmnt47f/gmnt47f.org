I think you've gone a bit more narrow than necessary here. You've talked about an alien civilisation invading, rather than an alien invasion. I mean, if you've got mass produced robot/slave/etc soldiers, you only really need a single alien in command, and then the big cultural/social/resource motivations don't really matter when it could just as easily be the alien equivalent of a kid with a magnifying glass burning ants. (which is basically the plot of Stephen King's Under The Dome novel, but limitted to one town) I mean, there's enough fucked up "animal crush" porn in dark internet corners, there's no reason an alien can't be a shithead too.
