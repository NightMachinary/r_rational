One scenario you missed is where earth is basically collateral damage in a conflict between two different alien factions. For example in the first Men in Black where an alien species shows up and threatens to annihilate the planet unless we return the macguffin, which was stolen by a different alien. Another example comes from StarCraft, where the Protoss destroy Terran worlds as part of their war against the Zerg (Although technically not Earth, they are still human planets).

I'm sure there are other examples of this basic theme.
