Oh, so in the books they fuck whenever they can and sometimes argue and wonder about what they're doing with the other person and whether they're just settling and act like dickhats until it's pointed out to them in a tearful screaming argument from which they stomp out and then later apologize and feel incredibly trapped while wondering how on earth they could go on living if they other person left them?

Some of what you've said is true, and some of it isn't. Were you attempting to make a specific point? It seems that way, but I'm not sure what point it is you're trying to make.

Would you care to explain?

Edit: I deleted the comment that you had replied to, because I posted it twice. Probably should had deleted the one you DIDN'T reply to, huh?

Yes, you should have. And I shouldn't have posted an oblique (non-rational) comment like that.

My point was that perhaps the books presents a model of romance that many people find to be unrealistic, unhealthy, or offensive in some way.
