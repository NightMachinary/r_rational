I would guess that the three basic components are: firstly, a genuine umbrage provoked by the notion of romance presented in Twilight; secondly, the knowledge that the expression of this will actually meet with widespread agreement and social approval; and thirdly, the nominal widespread popularity of Twilight, which is of course not actually all that popular in those environments where such opinions tend to be expressed.

However, to be honest, my understanding of group social dynamics may be a little naive, or jaded, or naively jaded. Did you ever see the ending of /Prince of Darkness/? That was actually me emerging from my parent's basement to see what was going on with all the film crews.
