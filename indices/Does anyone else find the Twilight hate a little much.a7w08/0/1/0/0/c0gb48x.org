I absolutely agree! I'm not in any way denying that the model of romance presented by the books and film is realistic or healthy, and I can see why that's a good reason to dislike the series.

I guess the only thing I'm really complaining about is that people feel some need to be very outspoken about that dislike. I don't hear anyone mentioning their dislike for other things they dislike.

I guess the act of complaining about other people complaining too much is a little silly of me. I just wanted a discussion with which to kick off /rational.
