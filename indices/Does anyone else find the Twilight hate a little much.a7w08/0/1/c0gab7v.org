I'll answer your bullet points in bullet point form! Since that would be easiest to read as a reply.

- I might just see the worst of it, but in most cases, where Twilight COULD conceivably be brought up, someone brings it up in a very negative context. One example is [[http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/a6zie/reddit_what_do_you_want_but_cant_have/c0g51h2][this comment tree]].

- Hatred of Twilight seems to be an internet-wide phenomenon. But again, it might just be that I see most of the internet through the eyes of sites like Reddit. I'll admit that elsewhere (The forums at Penny-Arcade, for example), I don't see it as much.

- I think the common themes are that the books are badly written, that they propose ideas which would be unhealthy for young girls to accept as reality, and that the films are badly made. There's also a lot of non-specific hatred, and I think these people are just following along, since there are a lot of people who haven't read the books or seen the films but still express hatred.

- Twilight is about a romance where a woman becomes dependent on a man, who is much stronger than her, and can't live without him. Visa versa, as well. Other people have stated other assertions, but it is my opinion that a lot of those assertions are disproven if you read more than one of the books.
