Fun chapter. Kirielle was adorable and fun, and I loved the illusion scene. It's good to see Zorian getting out of himself and really showing off his skill to those around himself.

Taiven remains dickish and cruel to the very helpful Zorian.

Ah, Xvim. Like Snape, the abusive father figure whose style and cold coolness pushes us ever further to win their elusive love.

Lovely chapter, and looking forward to the next one.

Since we're getting away from the people low environment of the wildness I've started updating my wiki again. If you forget who a character is this should be enough to remind you. The author's awesome and complex world should be easier to appreciate without a full reread being necessary.

I suck at all wiki magic and editing. If anyone wants to improve it feel free. My main purpose is just to have a basic reminder for people.
