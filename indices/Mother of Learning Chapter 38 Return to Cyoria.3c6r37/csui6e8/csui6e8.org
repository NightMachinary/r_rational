Why doesn't Zorian try to pull Kael into the loop?

Zorian has identified the soul marker and Kael has soul sight. It shouldn't be that much work for him to help Kael to figure out how to replicate it. Once Kael figures it out, they can pull whoever they want into the loop.

Currently Zorian's biggest limitation is that he is operating alone with no one else to double check his assumptions and logic. As far as Zorian knows there is only Zach and RR as loopers. While Zach is nominally on Zorian's side, his lack of discretion limits how much Zorian can share with him to collaborate. Kael is good at being discrete and has a skill set that complements Zorian's well. There are likely others that would be a good fit for a looping conspiracy that could also be added.
