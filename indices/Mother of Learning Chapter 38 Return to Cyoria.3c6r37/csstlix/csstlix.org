Some thoughts:

Zorian and Kirielle on the train was amazing. Not only does he find a mana-disruption ward strong enough to foil Ibery a mere annoyance, but he can do multiple shaping exercises under it. And the story he told Kiri was great.

.

I wonder what Ibery can help him with. We don't know what magic she specialises in, but she may well not have much to teach him. More likely, she can get him access to the restricted levels.

.

We've finally found out about Nochka, but it's really only raised more questions. Why are there cranium rats about, why is Rae so intimidating and what's up with the sad kitten? The obvious answer is that Rae is a cat-shifter or soul-bonded to cats somehow. That still doesn't completely explain why the rats are interested in them or why they only recently arrived. There's definitely more to see here.

.

The memory issue will probably be handled next chapter (since he's going to dedicate the weekend to sort it out). This probably isn't too important: the author probably wants a better explanation for Zorian's memory other than ‘it's really good guys'. Possible methods of solution could involve soul magic with Kael's help, attaching some spellwork to his soul with another spell to decrypt it. The issue with that is he doesn't really want to mess around with his soul. Alternatively, he could store important stuff in memory packets, knowing memory magic now, but they degrade over time like normal memories. If pocket dimensions aren't reverted he could try that, creating a room of requirement for himself. In a similar vein, he could somehow create a ‘magic notebook' that's tied to his mana signature, although that sounds difficult and unlikely to survive a restart.

.

More worrying is RR's actions. That he no longer bothers helping the invasion is quite worrying. Possibilities:

- he's frustrated and is no longer interested in Cyoria (unlikely).

- he's taking a break (unlikely, simply because it's kind of arbitrary).

- he's given up on the invasion since there is now another (smart) unidentifiable time traveller that is actively countering it (more likely)

- he knows about Zorian's arrival and has plans (terrifying, but pretty unlikely, unless RR is Daimen as some believe).

I think the third option is the most likely, but I'm surprised that Zorian isn't being more paranoid about option four.

.

Xvim's scenes are absolutely precious. I'm surprised Zorian didn't try to read his surface thoughts though: he was probably too busy with the exercises. I really want to know what he's been doing during the invasion.

.

Also, does anyone remember the scene where Zorian went to Ilsa and she told him about handless unshaped magic? He must be employing some of that to levitate the entire bowl of marbles (and the stationery orbit [heh] in the train).
