Red Robe and Zorian may be seeing the effects of the butterfly effect of Aranea elimination in which subtle events are now greatly changing the course of each reset.

Example: what if one of the Aranea originally used a military officer for intelligence? Normally at the beginning of the month, he sleeps in while getting psychically interrogated, misses a meeting at work and gets suspended. However, with the Aranea gone, he makes it to the meeting and deploys the troops to choke points in the dungeon (something the spiders wouldn't have wanted) and then goes gambling with his friends. Each die roll he makes, and the gambling habits of his friends are all altered... the winnings from the casino shift to different hands... And due to the randomness of the magic dice to prevent cheating, the outcomes are different for every single loop.
