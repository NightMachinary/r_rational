I have two ideas regarding Nochka, the bridge accident, and her mother.

The first one is that her mother is a cat-shifter.

  The .. girl wasn't there this time .. but .. There was a small-ish cat, probably a very young one, looking forlornly at the raging waters of the stream. .. *when the cat turned to look at him and their eyes met, he was assaulted by an intense feeling of sadness and loss*.

  Nochka's mother .. was honestly a little scary to Zorian. She didn't look frightening .. but it took only five minutes for Zorian to decide there was more to her. *Her movements were all fluid and precise, she never stuttered or wavered when she spoke, her gaze was frighteningly intense, and she gave off an air of absolute confidence and composure.* Frankly, if he had been alone he would have left the place in a hurry, but Kirielle didn't seem nearly as intimidated by the woman and insisted on telling her new friend stories. Such as the one of how they stumbled upon her in the first place.

  "Ah yes, the strange brain rats," Rea said when Kirielle told them about their encounter with the cranium rats. "I've seen a few hanging around the house, but never in such numbers. Disgusting things."

  Zorian frowned. Why were the cranium rats hanging around their house?

  "You should be careful," he told her. "They're called cranium rats and they can read your mind, possibly even memories if left unmolested long enough."

  "Hmm... *good thing I kill them when I find them*, then," Rhea said.

So in this case what'd've happened is 1. Nochka would've tried getting the bike herself and drowned, 2. her mother would've eventually become worried, 3. shifted into her cat-form for better speed and olfaction, 4. went by her daughter's trail and 5. ended up at the bridge. This is when she'd realised what happened to her daughter and when Zorian met her during one of his iterations.

The second idea is just that the bridge has some bad property attached to it --- a curse, maybe, or a monster lurking in the waters, etc. The point is that it makes creatures who try to pass over it lose things that they dearly care for. So, for Nochka it would be her freshly-gifted bike, and for the cat (which, in this case, is unrelated to Nochka's mother's mystery) --- maybe one of her first kittens or something similar.
