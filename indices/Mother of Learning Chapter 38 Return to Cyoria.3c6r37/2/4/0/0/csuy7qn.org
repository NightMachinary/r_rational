  Finally if after all the things he learned, the stuff he practiced and all that traning he did, he loses it at the end of the story I am gonna kill someone. It reminds me too much of pokemon where you grind the levels and the money and then suddenly lose your save and start from the begining. I do not care if he even dies but I would just lose it if he is reset out of the loop at the end of the story.

If that happens, I would actually die. The reason I'm loving this so much is how Zorian keeps levelling up and learning new skills in all these little ways. If he loses it all at the end it would actually be soul-crushing.
