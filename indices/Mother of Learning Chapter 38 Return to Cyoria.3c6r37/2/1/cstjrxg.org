I'm presently running a tabletop rpg campaign in this setting with only minor differences - mainly attempts to make the gamesystem's magic compatible with the way magic works in the story.

It's going really well, and after just two ~5 hour sessions I've taught the players they /can/ be hurt despite being in a timeloop. I had to hijack some cranium rats though. :/
