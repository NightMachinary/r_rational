Zorian, Zach and Kael are obvious.

Benisek is Zorian's annoying chubby friend who loves to gossip and chase girls. I seem to remember his mentor is an Aope, actually, but I'm not sure that's going to come up again.

Estin Grier is a boy from Ulquaan Ibasa, the frozen island of the necromancers. Zorian suspected him to be a time traveller for that reason. He's fighting the monsters in this restart and I suspect we could see more of him.

Briam's the boy with the fire drake, who Zorian asks about soul bonds. He can fight (via his drake) as well.

From the text:

#+begin_quote
  Naim was a first generation mage, much like Zorian and Akoja -- a child of some soldier that rose to the rank of general in the wake of the disruptions caused by the Splinter Wars. Edwin had golem makers as his parents, and they clearly passed on their enthusiasm for the craft on Edwin -- he was always tinkering with various mechanisms and making blueprints, even during lectures or other times during which he should have been concentrating on something else.
