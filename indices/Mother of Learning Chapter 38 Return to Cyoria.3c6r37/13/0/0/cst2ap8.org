Nevermind, I stand corrected. It's just that there was that point where Zorian did that spell and found out that he and Zach were the only time travelers it detected on the whole continent or something. Maybe the main antagonist isn't actually looping and instead already had a very big information network throughout Cyoria's underground by the time of the invasion, and they only started adapting to changes in the timeline after they did something to Zach's mind/soul to steal his memories. That might be why he keeps disappearing to the same place in all of the more recent loops. Maybe the bad guys are somehow manipulating him to go there even without their own time traveler. It's been seen that a lot of magical effects that target the mind or soul continue even through the restart. Maybe they did something like that to Zach's mind/soul? But then that leaves the question of why in /this/ reset, the bad guys don't have all the information red robe usually gives them.

It could also be that red robe IS zach, and he's trying to set up a really big enemy for him to defeat single-handedly, in order to gain fame, fortune and power as a hero of the realm, [[#s][Spoiler]]
