It's "Z*a*rya" in Russian specifically, vowels are more volatile, as English speakers should know. In Croatian (the author is from Croatia) [[https://translate.google.com.ua/?hl=ru#en/hr/dawn][it's "z*o*ra"]]. You can find other Slavic languages where it's "z*o*ra" or something like that (e.g. Bulgarian, Serbian). The root is recognizable to a native speaker of a Slavic language once you notice it (I am Russian and Ukrainian native speaker). There's even a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoran][Wikipedia article]] about an awfully similar Slavic name that spells out the meaning.
