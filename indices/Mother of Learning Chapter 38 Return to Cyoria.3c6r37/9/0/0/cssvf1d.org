Wow. I was looking at that name trying to understand what is the significance of it, and I totally missed it. But now that you mention it, the significance of Zorian's name has suddenly 'clicked'. "Zarya" is "dawn", so "Zorian" is more or less "Dawnian". And the time loop always starts in the morning. So /this/ is a (anti-)Twilight story! But I suppose everyone, but me, connected that already.
