Typo thread:

#+begin_quote
  They probably didn't want to attack attention
#+end_quote

Should probably be 'attract attention'.

#+begin_quote
  I'm not the one recruiting
#+end_quote

From context I think it should be 'only one recruiting'.

EDIT: I noticed that there may be a better place for this as it wasn't actually the author who put up the link.
