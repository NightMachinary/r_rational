Oh, and if you want admin powers for the wiki, feel free to say. As the author of this awesome piece of work, you obviously know all the stuff much better than I would. I think you need admin powers to do stuff like name changes.

Although of course, your personal free time and choices and work are important, and this isn't to say I feel you have any obligation to do such things, just if you want it.
