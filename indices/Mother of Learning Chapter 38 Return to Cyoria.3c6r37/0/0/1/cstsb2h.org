These are my notes on them. I should probably finish updating the wiki sometime.

Benisek. Chubby gossip obsessed, loud. Not concerned with magic, well placed family business. Friend of Zorian.

Veyers Boranova. Expelled for violence, noble.

Taiven. Skilled combat mage with a large mana reserve (up to level 3), crush of Zorian's, class assistant to Nirthak. Athletic and attractive. Aggressive and rude personality, her aid requires helping her with a mission a few days in to the month to retrieve a watch from the dungeon from giant spiders. Knows trick mana surge, where you saturate an area with your mana allowing you to sense mana constructs. Can cast the incredibly destructive fire vortex spell. Knows a host of other combat and environmental spells of great utility, e.g. spider climb, feather fall, other survival spells.

Akoja Stroze. Classroom assistant.

Neolu. Perfect scores in warding, avid reader of speculative fiction. Was at dance with Jade, Maya, Kiana and Elsie who were all giggly.

Briam. Firedraker owner, drake can cast fireball at will, familiar with a strong bond.

Zach Noveda. Immensely powerful time looper, bloodline trait allows him to have a massively enhanced mana reserve and reasonable control. Extremely skilled, but originally pretty crap. Knows many combat spells. Last heir to house Noveda, socially powerful, though his family was weakened by its strong military tradition, connection to the royal family and deaths in the splinter wars due to them volunteering to militarily support the royals. The weeping plague damaged them further. Raven haired, kind.

Raynie. Red haired goddess as described by Zorian. Attractive, good at classes, polite and reserved about her history. Only Kiana knows her history- she is the daughter of the leader of a wolf/human shifter tribe.

Kael Tverinov. Feminine voiced morlock with soul magic with bone white hair and intense blue eyes. Alchemy expert. Medicine expert. Soul magic expert with soul sight. Has a daughter, Kana, and a dead wife who is the daughter of a witch, Fria.

Tinami Aope. Member of Aope witch house who allied with Ikosia during witch wars for a house, rose to high prestige via use of Necromancy, Demon summoning and Mindmagic. Firstborn. Is shy, expert in spider lore, skilled at combat and has powerful pain causing purple beams.

Estin Grier. Immigrant from from Ulquaan Ibasa, the island populated by necromancers.

Kopriva Reid. Green haired member of green haired criminal organization house Reid (nothing was proven), swears like a sailor.

Aneka and Armie - the (in)famous Ashirai twins. Soul bonded twins, as is usual for the Ashirai family. Giggly twits.

Naim. First generation mage of some soldier.

Edwin. Son of golem makers.

Jade. Daughter of a high ranking member of house Witelsin.

Ibery Abercomb. Student with a green turtleneck at the library. Crush on Fortov.
