This chapter has a very satisfying feel to it, of returning home. I especially like how the girl with the bicycle shows up. When I think of an iconic moment in Groundhog Day, I think about Bill Murray checking his watch frantically and then sprinting down the street to catch a kid who is about to fall out of a tree. Nochka fills this same role as the girl he will habitually save (I hope!)

I also like how Kael's experiments play out. While its glossed over compared to the significance of everything else happening in this cycle, the iterative cycled experiment idea is one that I think about on a daily basis.

Zorian has dismissed healing as a serious discipline so far. Modern medicine owes a lot to the concept of the randomized, controlled, double blind experiment. If he were in charge of the hospital and could arrange for treatment A to be given to a cohort of participants and record what happens over the course of the month and then on the next cycle, he gives them treatment B instead... He eliminates the need for randomization -- eventually he can optimize the best individual outcomes for everyone who visits Cyoria's hospital!

TLDR: I wish I could time-loop so I could treat my patients with only the best medicine or procedure that they need.
