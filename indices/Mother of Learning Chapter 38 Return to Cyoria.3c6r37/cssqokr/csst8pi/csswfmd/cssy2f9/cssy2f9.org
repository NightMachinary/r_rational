Maybe for somebody to be a looper is not a unique enough property to him to get interested in that person. He doesn't even have to be a time traveller himself, come to think of it, --- merely to know /of/ time travel and TT loopers.

In terms of [[http://www.uesp.net/wiki/General:Elder_Scrolls][tES]] logic, he may be the highest level [[http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Trainers][trainer]] for exceptional people of such an extent that they're not only benefiting from a time loop, not only willing to train incessantly while being inside (instead of pursuing hedonistic purposes, socializing, etc), but are also successful in reaching such a mastery that puts them in “top 1 percentile” even when compared to all other time travellers of their area or era.

Maybe Xvim was the one who activated the Sovereign Gate and anchored it to Zach, or at least has some connection or knowledge of the procedure. It's also possible that even if Zach was given the better odds by the virtue of being the last member of a dying --- and powerful --- house, his victorious emergence from the time loop is still not guaranteed, and others can take the crown from him while the loop is still unbroken.

  "... Do you know how many magic missiles I can cast before I run out of mana?"

  ... average mages can fire somewhere between 8 to 12 magic missiles before running out of mana, while very gifted ones could manage as much as 20 or 30. Furthermore, while mana reserves increased with age and practice, they were not unlimited in potential -- most people's maximum was roughly 4 times the amount of mana reserves they started with, and usually less. ...

  "50?" he tried.

  "232," said Zach smugly.
