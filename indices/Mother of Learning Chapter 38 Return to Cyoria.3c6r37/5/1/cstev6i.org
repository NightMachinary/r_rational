About RR's supposed absence and the possibilities you list, I think your condition for #3 is unlikely, but the odds that RR has given up is high (because we don't know whether RR thinks he's caught Zorian in the mass soulkill genocide of mercs).

Thinking about the reasons why RR would (apparently) no longer share his knowledge with the invaders, the main factor is probably that Red Robe realizing his rampage inadvertently changed the course of the invasion. However, we don't have any info whether this has been happening consistently in the recent loops.

From what we've seen, he isn't part of the original invasion and might have only helped them to achieve his own ends. Perhaps he had a major argument with the lich (or even soulkilled him) after things went downhill post-aranea.

Because it's very likely he's using the invaders for something, he's probably still invested in their end-goal of summoning a primordial and razing Cyoria. It's also possible he's come across the same information as the matriarch that the time loop is destabilizing, so he can no longer afford to figure out how to make the invasion succeed like before. So he could be focusing on another solution in the background.

Until we see how things go at the end of this loop, everything is still wide open.
