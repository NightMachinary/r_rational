Pure speculation.

He's been mentioned multiple times but has never appeared in any form, nor affected the plot. Also, he' not on the continent and so outside of Zorian's soul tracking ritual. Zenomir said that the language Majara is seen in necromantic rituals enscribed upon crypts in Koth, which is where he is.

So it's extremely tenuous and nothing points directly to Daimen. But if an established character were to be revealed to be RR, he'd be the obvious candidate.
