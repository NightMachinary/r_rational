The time loop is only a month long because it ends when Zach dies, and Zach dies at the festival. If Zach /isn't at the festival/ then the time loop /doesn't end/. RR is probably chasing Zach around to make sure that he either dies or returns to Cyoria so that RR can get back to perfecting his plan.
