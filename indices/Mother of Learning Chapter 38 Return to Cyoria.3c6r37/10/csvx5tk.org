Just caught up with everything, and I'd like to wager that the aranea are potentially recoverable. RR obviously doesn't have the same marker as Zorian or Zach, and souls are not destroyable. So, simply enough, RR's marker is different somehow, and is being affected by the same spell anyway, or he is being affected by a different time loop spell entirely. To kill the aranea permanently, he would work some soul magic with his own marker to make the death condition in their souls loop back. He turned them into loopers after killing them, in other words. To fix this, if it is fixable, one would have to remove the markers from the dead araneas' souls.
