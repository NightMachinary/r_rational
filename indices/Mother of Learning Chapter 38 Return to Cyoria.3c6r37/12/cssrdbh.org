I think Red Robe may have decided that remaining in the loop wasn't worth the risk anymore and left it entirely. RR thought that the Aranea and an unknown number of others had been included into the loop, and probably figured that he might not be able to find them all before they could ambush him. This also would sidestep the issue that Zorian is currently facing of memories degrading over time. RR would still be pretty fresh on what happened before he threw some wrenches in the works with the "dead" Aranea and mercenaries, assuming they'll pop back up when normal time resumes.

As to why I think RR is capable of that, the Matriarch's message states: "[Missing] ...can leave at any time. Thus, stopping him was... [Missing]"

Unless she just meant RR leaving Cyoria at any time, which is a distinct possibility and works better in regards to him not needing a personal escape route from the loop.

We also finally have a name for bicycle girl, "Nochka". Still don't know for sure if she drowned in an attempt to go in after it in the other loops, but she does seem like she would have gone into the water now that we know a little bit about her. Since her family only moved her a couple of months ago I wonder if they're part of the invasion forces? If not, her mother has a surprising degree of awareness concerning the cranium rats.

It would be funny if Zorian spends decades in here and Xvim never changes. Although in this chapter, Xvim does seem to have run out of new exercises and is just grabbing whatever he has lying around. I'm wondering if Xvim is just really good at hiding his surprise at this point. I suppose next training session Xvim could set up an anti-shaping field in his office and have Zorian repeat everything.
