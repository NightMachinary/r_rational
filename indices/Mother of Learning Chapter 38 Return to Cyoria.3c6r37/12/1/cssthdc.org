My guess for RR is he decided the invasion is optimized enough here, and he is busy with other stuff. Because he doesn't care what happens in Cyoria this loop, this time the invaders there only had orders like "invade on summer festival" instead of "execute <detailed plan>".

I don't think remaining in the loop would is in any way a disadvantage for RR, I doubt he would choose to leave. And he is probably too bad-ass to have been killed.
