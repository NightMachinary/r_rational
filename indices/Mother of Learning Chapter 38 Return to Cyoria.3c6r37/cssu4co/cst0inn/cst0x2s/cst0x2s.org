A few comments on the chapter. First is I think the fact that it is stated that he wont probe minds of random individuals is just pretext when it later comes up that someone was dangerous and he could have known with a simple surface probe. I vote Rae to be honest but that is mostly because she is intimidating and he told her way too much which may bite him in the ass later.

Next I think the fading memory business is just to say that he wont be able to find a way at the end and some parts of the memory packet would be lost by the time he can decode it just to further the plot.

Finally if after all the things he learned, the stuff he practiced and all that traning he did, he loses it at the end of the story I am gonna kill someone. It reminds me too much of pokemon where you grind the levels and the money and then suddenly lose your save and start from the begining. I do not care if he even dies but I would just lose it if he is reset out of the loop at the end of the story.
