When I [[https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/aiawmf/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/eemgksl/][asked]] for alternate history written as a textbook rather than as a story, [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2785829][/Britannia's Fist/]] was [[https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/aiawmf/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/eemkbmq/?context=1][recommended]]. However, this book /definitely/ is written as a story.

(I haven't yet gotten around to any of the other recommended books.)
