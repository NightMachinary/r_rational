I also read this from a rec here. I also found the MC insufferable, with the setting and supporting characters seemingly engineered solely as a vehicle for him to distinguish himself as a special snowflake(common with these [[/r/hfy][r/hfy]] stories).

Worst for me is that the very long-lived elves are basically just short longer living humans. That's it, no thought was given to develop them beyond that. And then we find out that (iirc) wealthy elves can pay magic users to be ageless and healthy. Also no apparent societal repercussions.

How different would a society be if the ruling class were basically immortal? How would they function, how would things change? How would the outlook of a person who doesn't have old age mortality to motivate them be, with regards to ambition, family, conflict resolution and so on? Would people resist risky occupations, if death were a comparatively bigger deal? Would they institute mechanisms into their society to prevent stagnation, or would they even have a negative connotation to freezing conventions and failing to change?

To all this and so much more, the answer is: No, they're not at all different to just pointy eared, short humans with magic. Blergh.
