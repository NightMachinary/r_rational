That's a good point. I think we take it for granted that incremental progress is a natural part of civilization because that's the narrative given to history. In the west, at least.

I will say that westeros is a good deal larger than China is or ever was. The equivelant of going from Sunspear to Winterfell is farther than New York to LA, for example. Also china has a long tradition of civil service and bureaucrats, as well as sharing similar cultures and history and a sense of nationality(somewhat, anyway). Westeros is basically 9 different countries that all hate their neighbors which is ruled by jocks, and their bureaucrats (maesters) seem pretty sparse.
