I second this recommendation. I've been following the story for a couple months now, and it's very impressive. Tom isn't so capital-E-Evil, because he has restraining influences that give more incentive to acting like a somewhat normal human, despite his sociopathic nature.

Hermione is forced to rethink some of her stupidly idealistic ideas (though she doesn't lose her moralistic view of reality), and all-in-all, they complement each other nicely.

It is leaning toward romance (hinting at it), which often I'm averse to because it's done so stupidly and seems so unrealistic, but that is not the case here.

There are some interesting explorations of magic--warding and permanent enchantments, etc.
