Osmosis is a perfect way to describe how I'm learning the plot of so many popular series. Off the top of my head, I've never read Harry Potter or Worm, seen Naruto, or watched GoT yet I can probably list out key points in the plot of each one of those.

Or I could be reading too many trash fanfics.
