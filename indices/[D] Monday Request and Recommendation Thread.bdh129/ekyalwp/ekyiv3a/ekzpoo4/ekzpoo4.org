That book's been recommended a few times here. I think most people tend to enjoy it because it's a newish idea that's well executed and fun, but it's definitely not rational. Just the events with the Deltans(iirc) is enough to disqualify it. You have a superpowerful AI, with cognition many times faster than a regular human, perfect recall, and a factory capable of producing pretty much anything he can imagine, including atmospheric entry craft and interstellar spacecraft, and despite all that he gets repeatedly wrong footed by what's basically dumb space gorillas. Just ridiculous. I couldn't get past it, ruined the book for me.
