I'd like to recommend [[http://www.all-night-laundry.com][All Night Laundry]], a webcomic with themes of time travel, eldritch horror, and genre-savvy protagonists. The author committed to a page-a-day at the start, and it has been running for /seven years/ without missing a beat. It looks like it's finally, /finally/ wrapping up and seems to be tying up all the loose ends, so now is a good time to jump in and ride out the final few months.

Beyond that I don't have much to throw out right now. It's a bit of a dry spell for me- every serial fic I'm reading is either on break or updating very slowly, and I haven't come across much finished work that I haven't already read or dismissed in the last year.

Maybe it's time to start writing a serial fic of my own with all this free time.
