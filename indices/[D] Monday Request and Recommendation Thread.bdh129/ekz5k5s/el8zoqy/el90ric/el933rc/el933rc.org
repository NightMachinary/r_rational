You write this like it is some throw away line in the book, instead of the entire book revolving around his designer clothing. They get aroused as he tries on designer clothing. He literally performs a stage show for them - if the author could have justified pole dancing, he would have danced. He has a nigh spiritual experience due to his designer clothing that washes away his insecurities. He has the confidence to approach a woman at a bar because of his designer clothing (this is emphasized). She becomes interested in him largely because of - you guessed it - his designer clothing. When they have sex, she wears his designer clothing, etc, etc.

^^^ this is the content of the book. I'm not kidding, this is what you will be reading if you read the book - other than descriptions of how aroused he gets submitting himself to powerful women - oh, and his superpower is that he is good at being tested. All well and good, but there is very little SciFi aspect here.
