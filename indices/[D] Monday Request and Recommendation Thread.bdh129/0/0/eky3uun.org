They don't exist, probably. Things like that are subjective, or carried by the lawyer's persuasive ability. And real courtroom procedure is designed to be as boring as possible. The Ace Attorney Investigations spinoff is good in that it is just a straight detective game, where (hypothetically) you combine facts into logical statements, and logical statements into hypothesis. But if you want actual lawyer shenanigans you might need to make that game yourself.
