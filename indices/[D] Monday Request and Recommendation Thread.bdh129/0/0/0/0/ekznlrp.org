This [[http://www.makeyourcasegame.com/][courtroom sim]] should be right up your alley then. Or if you want a (not very engaging) legal roleplay in objections, [[http://texaslregames.org/games_web_eng/objection_your_honor/objection_your_honor.html][Objection! Your Honor]] might be interesting for a few minutes.

Anecdotally, there might be more games or similar resources aimed at criminal justice majors in the future, apropos of a lunch chat with a bar president about pattern recognition and AI's impending takeover of the legal system. Algorithms are supposedly slated to replace judges in sentencing suggestions and will probably be relegated more duties wherever empirical pattern matching can improve the subjectivity of "justice." So if AI doesn't outright replace the industry, there oughta be more stuff. It seems the textbook-adjacent industry has already got [[https://www.objection.com/sub-page/products/all-games/][a money-grubbing foot in]]. These "games" might not give the same dopamine kick as an ace attorney saving the day though.
