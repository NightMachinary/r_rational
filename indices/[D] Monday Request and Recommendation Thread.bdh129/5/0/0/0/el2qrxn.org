I agree that reading on kindle is a far superior experience. I transfer all webnovels and such to my kindle. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/afwmz5/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/ee32znj/][Here's a comment]] I made a few months on easy ways to do that.

As to books I'm enjoying at the moment, I'm reading the final book in the [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25895524-red-sister][Book of the Ancestor]] series, it's very good. I highly recommend the series. Interesting, original worldbuilding, good characterization, kickass action scenes, and very tight pacing.

I also read [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion][Super Minion on Royal road]] recently. Pretty good, though unfinished. I was waiting for a bit more story to be released before recommending it here. You can easily download it with the [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webtoepub/akiljllkbielkidmammnifcnibaigelm?hl=en][WebtoEpub]] extension, or one of the other methods I outline in my aforementioned comment.
