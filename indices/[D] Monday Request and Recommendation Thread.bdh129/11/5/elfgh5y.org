I remember really liking this story, but I actually can't remember what happened in it well enough to give more detail.

This one might be controversial. Harry is...too competent, and there's some bashing of Harry's family that abandoned him in favor of his brother, the "real" Boy Who Lived. Now, there /IS/ a reason for their actions, but if my family used the reasons that they did to abandon Harry with the Dursleys, I would still hate them, and probably think they're honestly unimaginative idiots. Over time, some of his family redeem themselves, which is rare in fics where you have serious bashing, and a sign that the author at least is attempting to use it as a plot device rather than a personal vendetta.

Basically, Harry's more than a bit Mary-Sue, but...I still enjoyed this story, and I continue to read new chapters when they come out. There's a lot of explanation and development of the world and backstory, as well as exploration of magic, mind magic, etc. It also features a hyper-competent Lockhart, which is one of my favorite tropes.

Overall, YMMV, but this story does definitely get into mind magic, and specifically the ways you can augment your own thoughts and perceptions with it.
