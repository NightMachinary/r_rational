Weaponizing advanced mind magic makes for a lot of paranoia... so if it's an entire society, it might be a constant state of cold war if defenses aren't equally adequate (mind-melded coalitions?). I don't know of any fiction that goes deep into the magic aspect, but you might be interested in mind magic in real life, AKA mentalism. There's a lot of quacky stuff out there, but for the layman, methods of manipulating perception and instilling suggestions are as good as magic.
