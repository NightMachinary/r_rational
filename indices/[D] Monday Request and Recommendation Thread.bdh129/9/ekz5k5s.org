I don't know if anyone's recommended it yet, but the Sci-fi series, "Trader's Tales from the Golden Age of the Solar Clipper" is amazing.

Starts with "Quarter Share" and it's a series that explores the economics and life of merchant traders in the far future.

It doesn't delve into the physics of how the drives work too much, but the rest of it is great.

I understand the author used to be in the merchant navy and has used many of the experiences he had.
