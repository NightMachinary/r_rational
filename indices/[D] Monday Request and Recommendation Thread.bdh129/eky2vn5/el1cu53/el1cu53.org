It's an intersting idea.

I suspect the main limitation will be financial. You'd have to hire at least one lawyer to consult on your plot and game design, and lawyers who're any good get expensive fast, while independent game development tends not to make much money.

​

That games like MS flight simulator, Kerbal Space Program, Fam Simulator and Bus Simulator make money, implies at least a niche market for a highly detailed law simulation game probably exists. But I can't guess at how big that market might be.

​

The otehr problem would be that there are laws about non-lawyers providing legal advise, and a game that lets you run a legal case of your own crafting in a simulated courtroom and get a simulated verdict which you present as being "realistic" is close enough that you might want to be carful about it, as if any profession is going to make an effort to defend their protectionist laws in court it's lawyers.
