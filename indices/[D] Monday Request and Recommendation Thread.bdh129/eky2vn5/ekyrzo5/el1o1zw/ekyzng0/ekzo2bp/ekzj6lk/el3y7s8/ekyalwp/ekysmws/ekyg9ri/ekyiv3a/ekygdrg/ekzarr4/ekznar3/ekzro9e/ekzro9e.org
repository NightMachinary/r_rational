Yikes, 130 years is a long time to rule without your superweapons. Fear of them hatching new ones certainly helps for awhile after, the only other explanation I can think of is inertia? Relying on dragonpower prior leaves them with a very fresh, although green, military and people that haven't been able to think about organized rebellion against the dragons for generations before. Throw in some divinity/magic and decent rulers (that got worse every generation)?

I'd actually expect them to handle famine pretty well, since they need to be stockpiling huge amounts whenever it's not winter. What's one bad year when you're always preparing for a possible generation long winter?

They'd also have less blights. They can't have huge long term monocrops outside of the deserts due to periodic winters and the variety of climates going from South to North, unless the blight can survive on the stored seeds or food it would get wiped out every winter. The winters help get rid of parasites and insects (I actually don't recall any insects in the show?) so that would significantly help low tech yields.

So yeah, maybe yields could be high enough without magical food sources. (I guess you could also cheat and just claim their plants/soil are just better than ours too.)
