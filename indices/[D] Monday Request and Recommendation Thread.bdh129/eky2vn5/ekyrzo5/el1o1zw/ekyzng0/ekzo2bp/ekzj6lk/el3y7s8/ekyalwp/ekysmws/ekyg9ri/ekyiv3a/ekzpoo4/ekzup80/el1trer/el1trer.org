The whole thing took days or weeks. He had time to build several probes and send them down, and he could have weeks or months of dilated time if he wanted to think of better solutions.

With that in mind, do you really think it's possible to be repeatedly surprised by animal attacks when you have nearly unlimited cutting edge technology in your toolbox? Right now we have the capacity to read someone's phone screen from high orbit, what do you think he would have hundreds of years in the future! He was incapable of building even infrared cameras, night vision, or radar, and that's tech that's 50+ years old!

And then there's his inability to build weapons, so he uses his probes to ram the space gorrillas *at low speeds*. LOL. On top of that, these fucking things break down from repeatedly ramming flesh and bone? Really? Capable of atmospheric entry and high speed acceleration, but break down when bludgeoning some meatsacks. Very plausible.

Even putting aside the arbitrarily fragile probes, why not put sharp blades on them instead? Make it retractable, if necessary. Or better yet, take these probes capable of going supersonic and just accelerate them at the ground like fucking cannon balls and make a gorilla shaped crater. Or even better, USE THE PROPULSION JETS TO FRY THE GORILLAS AT CLOSE RANGE.

Holy shit, the 5 minutes it took to write this comment just made me even more aware of how stupid this part of the book is. It's been years since I read it, and I still remember these details because /it's so so dumb/. It's possible to enjoy dumb shit, I do it all the time, but that doesn't make it not dumb. And this book is dumb as fuck.
