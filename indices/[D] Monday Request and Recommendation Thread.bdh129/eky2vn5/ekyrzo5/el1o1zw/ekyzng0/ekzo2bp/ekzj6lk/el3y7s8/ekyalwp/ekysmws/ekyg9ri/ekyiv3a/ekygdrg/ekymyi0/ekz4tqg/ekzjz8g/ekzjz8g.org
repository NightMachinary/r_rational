Yeah it's great because although the concept of the story is "what if Voldemort was shoved into Potter's body back in 1981", this Voldemort is a very sensible person. That leads to exchanges like this:

  I snorted. "If Malfoy were the Heir of Slytherin, he'd be bragging about it. All the time. He would be right here, in our faces, bragging."

  "We're in the girls' loo," Hermione said.

  "Like that would stop him. He would follow us into the girls' loo /just/ to brag about it. I mean, honestly, this is Malfoy we're talking about here. There are two things he mentions in every conversation: his father and his money. If he were the Heir of Slytherin, there would be three things he'd mention in /every/ conversation."

  Hermione pouted. "So, that means we don't need to brew an illegal potion with stolen ingredients, knock out three of our classmates, tie them up in a closet, sneak into the Slytherin Common Room, and interrogate Malfoy?"

  I gaped at her. "Was that your plan?"

  I fear that Hermione may be the most evil of us all. That is concerning since I am a retired Dark Lord.
