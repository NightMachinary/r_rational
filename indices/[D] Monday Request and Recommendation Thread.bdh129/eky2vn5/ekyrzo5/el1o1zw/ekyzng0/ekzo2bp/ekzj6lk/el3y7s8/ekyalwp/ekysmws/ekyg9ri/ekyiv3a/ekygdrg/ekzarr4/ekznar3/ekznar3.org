From checking the wiki, the last dragon in westeros died 130 years or so before the events of the novels. So the argument that they provided stability doesn't really fly(hah) for almost half the reign of the Targaryen's 290 year reign. I agree with the rest.

In the middle ages famines were pretty common and devastating. Imagine a famine the year before a long winter... I think a decent explanation for the sustainability of their society would be no crop pests and a more consistent climate during the seasons. Pests reduce yields by a lot, and unseasonable weather in springs and summers caused a lot of famines, even up to recent history.
