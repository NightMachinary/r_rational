[[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1135300/][The Dollhouse]] explores a subset of mind magic relating to crafting artificial personalities and overwriting them onto people. They got two season out of it and in my opinion does some really neat things playing with just how creepy their basic premis actually is working against the ease with which one can relate to some of the punch-clock villains/designated heroes that make up the main cast.
