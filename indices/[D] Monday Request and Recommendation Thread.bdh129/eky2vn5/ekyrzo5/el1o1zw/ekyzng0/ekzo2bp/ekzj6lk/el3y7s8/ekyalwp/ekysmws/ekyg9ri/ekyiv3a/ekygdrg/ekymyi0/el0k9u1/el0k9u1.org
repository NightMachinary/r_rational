Someone recommended Birds of a Feather about Hermione being born and growing up with Tom Riddle and its one of the best Harry Potter fanfictions I've ever read. Absolutely phenomenal characterisation, great use of setting (lots of small realistic touches that really make the 1930s films look amateur). Everyone acts according to their motives and there's some genuinely heartwarming moments along with a nice dose of humour.

I'm in love with how Tom is portrayed and Hermione too it's great.
