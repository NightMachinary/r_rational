Side comments about Magical Me:

Magical Me as far as I could be bothered reading into it was way too full of itself (which is crazy considering the guy is taking over Lockhart) and morally righteous to me. The villifying of Dumbledore and the SI being right about literally everything and never making a mistake was a bit annoying. If Dumbledore is that evil (at some point the guy is like Dumbledore needs to go before he tackles Voldemort and I'm just like what??? even if you think Dumbledore isn't good surely this is a Chinese United Front situation not a Princely State infighting while British conquer the continent).

I think Lockhart could be a good funny full of themselves SI, you have a lot of opportunities to be funny with the arrogance, but the problem is the SI keeps it up in their internal monologue and it's so grating. I think I got to chap 8 or 9.

At least for me, YMMV.
