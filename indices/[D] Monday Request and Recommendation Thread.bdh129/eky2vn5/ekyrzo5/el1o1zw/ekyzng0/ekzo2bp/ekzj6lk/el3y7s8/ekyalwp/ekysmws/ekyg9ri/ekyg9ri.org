[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11861559/1/Wearing-Robert-s-Crown][Wearing Roberts Crown]] was enjoyable. GOC SI on Robert Bearatheon. I don't think that it was significantly less wish fulfillment than other SI's but the fact that you see it from the perspective of everybody but the SI makes it appear much more plausible. I don't think that I would enjoy many books with this approach because it did make me a lot less invested in the SI but the newness was refreshing.
