I appreciate the recommendation. While I absolutely love MoL, I don't feel that it dives deep enough into the mind magic aspect. Reading other people's memories and thoughts are all fine and good but that doesn't really explore it.

On the pure technical level I would love to see learning/trading skills from people, enhance learning ability, enhance certain important memories and remove other irrelevant ones to maximize storage capacity, put in conditional orders, having a semi-sentient mental weapon developed for mental attacks, mental combats that involve more complex patterns than just comparing attacks and defence, etc. On a more societal level I'd also love to see how a society can be functional with advanced mind magic being widespread.
