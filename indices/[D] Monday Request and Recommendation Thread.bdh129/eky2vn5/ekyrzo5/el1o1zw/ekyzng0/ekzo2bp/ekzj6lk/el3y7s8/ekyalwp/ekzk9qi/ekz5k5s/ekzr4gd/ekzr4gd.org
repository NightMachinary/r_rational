I found it alright. I couldn't finish the second book, there didn't seem to have any plot, conflict, or meaningful happenings or surprises. I think it's for people who like 'slice of life' type stories with a leisurely feel.

I'm told [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/170872-wayfarers][The Wayfarers]] series is similar in feel, if you're looking for more.
