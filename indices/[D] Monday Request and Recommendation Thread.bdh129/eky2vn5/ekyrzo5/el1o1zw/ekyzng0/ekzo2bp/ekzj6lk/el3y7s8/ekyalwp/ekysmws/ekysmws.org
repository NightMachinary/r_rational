Going to un-rec [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/61ya08/oh_this_has_not_gone_well/?st=juirw8ix&sh=eec4f900][Oh This Has Not Gone Well]], a fic which I learned about through this thread a while ago. I have a /strong/ antipathy towards "The summoned hero is a smug douche who fucks his way through the harem cast while Mary Sueing his opponents into oblivion," even moreso when the author seems really uninterested in exploring the /consequences/ of that behavior. This fic was the worst kind of Isekai- the kind that is entirely a self insert "Boy I'm so smart and interesting, I'd start a sexual revolution /and/ conquer half the known universe if you just sent me back 800 years, also let me tell you how good I am at video games" wankfest. Kill me now.
