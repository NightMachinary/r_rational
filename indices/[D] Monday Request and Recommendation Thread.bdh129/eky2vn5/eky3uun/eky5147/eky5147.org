Oh, I'm already thinking about how I would design a more correct legal game. It would probably take a ton of work just to do a proof-of-concept first case, but you could have a jury selection phase, opening statements, witnesses, expert witnesses, closing statements, etc. Maybe more than that, if you wanted to expand outside the courtroom, like, I don't know, being with your client as they're answering questions with the police.

And yes, a lot of being in the courtroom is boring, and a lot of arguments are subjective/nuanced in a way that doesn't lend itself to selecting different dialogue options. But I'm thinking about the way that /Return of the Obra Dinn/ did things, and I'm thinking that you could get something close to that. Maybe each line of dialogue could be objected to, with reasonableness rankings for each of the options, e.g. you could object on the grounds that it's hearsay, or irrelevant, and whether or not the objection was accepted would depend on the background numbers assigned by the developer. Sustained objections then help to alter either a global meter, or an individual meter for various parts of evidence and/or witness/defendant credibility.

(You'd still have to (or want to) play fast and loose with courtroom procedure, since the typical case isn't filled with objections, but it would still in theory be closer than Phoenix Wright is.)

Edit: Obviously, I'm hoping that someone has already made such a game.
