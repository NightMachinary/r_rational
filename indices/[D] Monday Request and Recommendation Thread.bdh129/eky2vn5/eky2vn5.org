I've been playing through Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney after its release on Steam, and it's got me wanting something that at least /tries/ to be realistic to how courtrooms and the law actually work, rather than effectively being a detective game in a courtroom setting. Does anything like that exist? A courtroom game where you could make actual/accurate objections like "question lacks foundation" or "relevance" or "hearsay" or something like that?

(Though I've been happy enough with PW:AA on the basis of what it is, it's just not got a lot to do with actual law.)
