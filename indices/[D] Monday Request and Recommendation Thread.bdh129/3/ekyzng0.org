Some time ago someone recommended [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5398503/1/Embers][Embers]], an Avatar: The Last Airbender fic. It's definitely worth reading, even if the story itself is a bit mediocre and ends in a disappointing manner. The original premise is that the Crossroads of Destiny episode of the original show does not result in Zuko betraying Iroh and the Avatar, but the fic starts somewhat before that episode so that it has time to ensure the dominos result in that effect, and it eventually ends up diverging fairly hard. It starts shortly after the start of the second season, with Iroh and Zuko traveling the countryside alone as fugitives.

(Oh, and I'm quite certain that this isn't readable if you aren't familiar with the show; if you weren't able to follow the above paragraph in your head you won't be able to follow the work. Entire episodes occur mid-text without much more than a passing reference, even after it begins to diverge.)

The real benefit to the work is the high-quality worldbuilding. The entire world of Avatar is reframed and fleshed out: the various factions, kingdoms, and movements are tweaked to be more consistent, more distinct, and have much more of a cause-and-effect relationship.

As an example, Sozin's warmongering is due to Sozin having too much draconic ancestry, making him vengeful and bloodthirsty. The Fire Nation is forced to follow him due to the Fire Nation being bound to the whims of a single Fire Lord (rather than the feudal system of old, which was self-correcting). The Fire Lord's position was created by decree of Avatar Kyoshi, which has spiritual weight. Kyoshi made the decree due to the Fire Nation not accepting the responsibility for rogue pirates staffed by ex-citizens. And Kyoshi only got involved because one of her own was killed by those pirates. None of the major events in Embers (or the parts of the canon show that it borrows) exist in a vaccum; everything is someone reacting to something, and once details are revealed it's usually the case that everyone had at least a shred of justification. It feels very realistic, politically.

The Air Nomads benefit the most from the reworked worldbuilding; their pacificity is both explained and lambasted (the author frequently mentions that they have a hard time steelmanning Aang's position, yet does so admirably anyhow). The Water, Air, Earth, and Fire nations borrow heavily from the real-world Inuit, Buddist, Chinese, and Japanese cultures they were based on to great effect. The spiritual ramifications of "bending is a gift of the spirits" have much more concrete results (and even weaknesses!), and spirits in general are much more 'real' and present in the world than just as Avatar-bait.

The author does an excellent job of weaving their new lore in with canon quite seamlessly, to the point that I'm certain I'll have a hard time keeping it straight from canon in the future. As an example, Sokka at one point notes that when the Gaang find Monk Giatsu's skeleton among others at the Southern Air Temple, there were no child bones in spite of the temple having a large youth population. After confirming that the Northern Air Temple did have such skeletons (buried out of respect by the earth kingdom inhabitants of that temple), he suspects that either the Air Nomads had prior warning or the Fire Nation did something with those survivors. The real reason that's the case in canon is Doylist, but it's a perfectly justified Watsonian observation, and this ends up a subplot of its own.

All in all, A+ worldbuilding, A- characterization (the character's voices are an excellent rendition of the show's), B- pacing (it's slow, albeit satisfyingly so), C- plot and ending, tho for what it's worth this is only obvious in retrospect; the plot was engaging enough until it was over.

If you're looking for an example of how to make the setting of a work rational, or how to make characters think and still have conflict, this is it.
