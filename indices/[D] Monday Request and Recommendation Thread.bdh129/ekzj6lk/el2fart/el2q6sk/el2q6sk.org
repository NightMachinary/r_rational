I don't know if I would say that - the vast majority of things that are posted here on a day-to-day (or month-to-month) basis aren't collected into official ebooks at all.

I posted this question after finding qntm's /Ra/ on Kindle, and rediscovering how much of a better reading experience a dedicated e-reader is than a browser.

Also, I'd rather not bias the recommendations by specifying a specific preference, since I kinda like looking in to whatever people have been enjoying recently.

So I guess to re-frame the ask for recommendations: have you recently read a story you'd recommend to this subreddit on Kindle (or other e-reader app)?
