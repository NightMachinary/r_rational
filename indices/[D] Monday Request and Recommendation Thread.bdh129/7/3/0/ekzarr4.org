Playing devil's advocate in defense of canon:

The government "stability" was due to dragons: unbeatable, terrifying, and magically fast flyers. Tyranny isn't too unreasonable when you can fly out and roast anyone anywhere without real resistance. Also the winters incentivize strong central governments, anyone who doesn't have one to stockpile and defend them dies in winter.

Technology isn't always progressing like we are currently used to, for most of human history the "golden ages" were in the past before they fell and things fell apart with tons of examples in Egypt, China, Greece and Rome. For most of history technology ebbed and flowed to an extent, horse's were the best transportation until less than a hundred years ago now. Also again, the winters and magic probably knock everything back periodically.

I think all you need to make the world's food logistics possible is magically rich cold/winter hunting:

1. Winter warping government and culture answers a lot of questions, we hear a lot about how they've survived in the past and are preparing for the next one (a lot of tell don't show in my opinion). They've survived insane winters by having strong governments that stockpile astronomical amounts of food, not being urbanized. You don't need much tech to just hunker down with enough food, hunt (magical?) winter animals, and defend against those animals. Southerners stockpile more, northerners hunt and tolerate cold more.

2. My understanding of the North, and people's hatred of them, is they survive largely by hunting, raiding, and fishing. There'd have to be some magic supporting wildlife numbers to support them all or an abundance of seafood we don't hear about. When it gets colder they just move down as they get uncomfortable, thus their nomadic styled life and southern people's hatred of them. They don't get crushed due to low tech levels, warrior lifestyle, and homefield advantage cold (that periodically travels south).

3. Agreed that I wish there were more heat forts since presumably every other northern fort has to get abandoned every long Winter. A cave fort, volcanic, or just natural springs to normalize the temperature would add cool themes.

4. With just a few efficiency tweaks animals could super hibernate through it, or be like woodland frogs and literally freeze then come back. A lot of our plants as seeds can survive for absurd amounts of time without growing, Michigan State University has an ongoing experiment with seeds 120 years old that still germinate, without any direct selection. Aside from these, wildlife could just migrate south or recolonize North every cycle.

TLDR: Magic away the food logistics (imagine trying to keep vermin out of years worth of food!) and it might work. Culture is incredibly flexible and could explain the rest.
