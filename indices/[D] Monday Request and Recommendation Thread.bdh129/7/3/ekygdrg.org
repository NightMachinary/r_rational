(review without spoilers)

I've been reading the aSoIaF fic 'King Robert's Crown', [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bauwc6/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/ekeb177/?context=1][recommended last week]]. It's a solid fic, I've enjoyed it. The writing is pretty good, particularly in the beginning. The innovation of having the SI not be a POV character is interesting, it definitely gave the fic a different feel to most Self-Insert fics. I was about 60% of the way through and rapidly losing interest, but then the author finally started to throw down some curve balls and stuff started to go wrong, which reignited my interest enough to finish .

Thanks for the rec, [[/u/XxChronOblivionxX][u/XxChronOblivionxX]]!

It does have its problems, mostly in that it takes almost 100k words to really get to a significant point of diversion from canon, in terms of major events anyway, if not characters. Additionally, the SI is totally a mary sue(as usual), and the fic feels very much like a fixfic for most of it, which I would normally hate, but it's something I've never encountered before with aSoIaF so I was able to persevere until shit started to go south. Also, the timeline is often confused, chapters have very little exposition outside of dialogue, and the author writes with no regard for establishing characters or setting. If you never read the books or watched the show, I imagine this fic will be very dry, but that's a very common fault with fanfics, so no points off.

Finally, I wish the SI would have introduced more innovations. What captured my interest in the first place was that I thought there would be more "uplifting", but that was very low key. I can only think of three or so things off the top of my head. Oh well.

*Verdict:* A solid aSoIaF SI fic that tries something new, and pulls it off decently well. 4/5

--------------

Additional thoughts: I would like to someday read an actual rational fic of aSoIaF that tries to plausibly explain how the world of aSoIaF is the way it is, beyond the doylist "GRRM is a middle ages/chivalry weaboo who's bad at geography and logistics". How does a feudal society that spans a continent larger than north america remain so (relatively) stable with early medieval tech and political institutions? Even with dragons, I don't think it would work. How did technology fail to advance? Have they been stuck in 12th century european technology for what, 4 centuries? Longer? Add to that the unpredictable seasons...

How do low tech humans survive even 1 year of winter, let alone 5 or 10 years. It seems to me that people wouldn't venture too far north with such a massive disincentive without a substantial upside to living in a land that's so deadly. The less affected southern regions would dominate the northern regions, if only by virtue of being able to sustain a much larger population that doesn't half die or starve to death every arbitrary number of years.

It would be interesting if all the north would have built castles on geothermal sites like winterfell, rather than it being a special feature that's unreplicable. Such a boring trope. Congregating at these sites come winter would go a long way to explaining how the north manages to survive.

How do animals and plants survive that? It would be interesting to examine the adaptations that the local flora and fauna would have.
