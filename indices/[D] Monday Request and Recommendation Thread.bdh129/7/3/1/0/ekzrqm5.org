I think that's too creative for GRRM to have come up with it originally, though he might make it canon nowadays just as a fuck you to all his detractors. A more modern take on the "it was a dream all along" trope.

Maybe you know this, but one of the more popular theories as to why the climate is so random is that the it's set on the inside of a sphere. I think that raises more questions than it answers, but again, wouldn't put it past GRRM at this point. He must be desperate.
