It was definitely a novel viewpoint and honestly did much to help cover up any sue-ness. I've never watched the show or read the books, so all I knew about the original storyline was through osmosis; that said even I could tell that there was a checklist of plots being thwarted, characters being saved, and problems removed before it was too late. Everything was just a little too perfect, until it suddenly wasn't.

(which. The idea that the SI had his mind merge with Robert rather than replace him sort of explains /why/ the world wasn't uplifted more; dude was probably a nerd that knew Westeros like the back of his hand, but probably didn't know much more about engineering societal ills than "put the poop and tanners somewhere we don't walk".)

I have to say I didn't expect the SI getting killed, especially so finally. You can kind of see how the author didn't know what to do after that, tho; everything meandered and I'm not sure what was being worked towards beyond some big climactic battle.
