I read the Bobiverse series as recommended here ...

There's some fun examination of some rational topics. I'll give it a soft rec because there are some irritating anti-rational tropes:

- Bob is an easy-goin' guy who stays easy-goin' even when knowingly engaged in a conflict where all sides have access to exponential growth tech. Bob's growth delays should be fatal.

- Bob picks a winner in an evolutionary race due to emotional attachment (“prime directive, bah!”), then plays tribal deity for tens of thousands of words. It could have been an interesting uplift sidestory, but is largely cliche filler.

- virtualxhuman romance sidestory so cringeworthy, I almost stopped reading.

- no one wants to upload despite the physical human race being threatened with imminent total extinction.

- relativistic kill vehicle is super secret “hail mary” option that only the protag considers, instead of being a core military consideration by all parties.
