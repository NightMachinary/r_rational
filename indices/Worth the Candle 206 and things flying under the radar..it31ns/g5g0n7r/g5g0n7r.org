I think the author's whole point was that it's awfully tempting for us to just eroticize the harem sex, like the in-world newspapers are doing. But if we do that, if we think it's all about hitting a kink scorecard, we'll miss things.

Yes, they're having clone-augmented sex. But it's not the important thing about her clones to Mary, and it's not the important thing about their sex to Joon.

Which in turn ties back to the disconnect that drives the whole story: the disconnect between playing a tabletop RPG hero and living as one.
