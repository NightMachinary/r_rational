singular lever

was eventually able to find the lever for romantic and sexual attraction. All I did was reduce them *both down* to nothing

(so is that two levers and it was a grama mistake or is it one lever and it was a wording mistake)

how I read this is that she used soul magic to turn of sexaul and romatinc atraction.

and if taking into acount her current actions it is clear that the romantic attraction bit has restored it's self as soul magic is only temporary.

well her sexual attraction has not been reset whether that is because it never will be or because she has not been in situations that force it to reset I don't know ( I bet it never will be).
