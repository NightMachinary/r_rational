Mary was built by DM for Joon. Wasn't that confirmed?

If so her lack of ability to feel pleasure in sexual act was also built in. Is it asexuality? I don't know but i do know that asexuality isnt normal, and usually based on physiology issuses ot mental issues since whole point of existance evolutionary wise is to procreate. Didn't she say multiple times that she is attraced to him?

If she didn't feel sexual attraction to him, she wouldn't be doing all this stuff.
