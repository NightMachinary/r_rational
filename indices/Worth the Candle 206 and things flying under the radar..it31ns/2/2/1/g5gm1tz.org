Arthur, Reimer and Fallatehr all read as "masculine intellectual/nerd" to me.

But a lot of the story is about how Joon feels. So anybody close to Joon also is going to be shown responding in some way to Joon's introspections, or the story wouldn't have a good way to include scenes focused on that character.

They might care with rolling eyes or with self-hating frustration or with sadism, but all Joon's companions treat his thoughts and feelings as worth noticing.

And "interested in your feelings" traditionally codes feminine, or else a man who's romantically interested in you.

Classic masculine tough-guy antics? Those go well with "it's just business, we get the job done, and in between witty quips we bite down on our feelings."

Which is a fun story, but the exact opposite of WTC. WTC is protagonist navel-gazing turned into art.
