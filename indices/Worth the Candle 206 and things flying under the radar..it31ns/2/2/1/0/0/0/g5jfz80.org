I was gonna say that Lois Bujold's Curse of Chalion kinda fits with having an mc that is introspective without being depressive. He faces lots of difficulty but looks for (and is able to) find enough support to pick himself back up, while also understanding his own needs and flaws.

To a point, Purple Days (A GoT joffrey time loop fic) also fits, but the protagonist kinda see-saws between periods of good and bad thought patterns, although he is at least able to find measures to lessen that through meditation and self-care.
