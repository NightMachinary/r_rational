Lois Bujold and T. Kingfisher both specialize in effective, thoughtful, introspective protagonists.

But in their case the introspection is more about sensibly facing the situation you're already dealing with, rather than getting better at your life or career /by/ better mental hygiene.

On the other hand, their characters are a whole lot saner and sweeter than the heroes of Lord of the Mysteries or Time Braid.

I definitely recommend Lois Bujold and T Kingfisher (aka Ursula Vernon) if you're looking for smart, sweet, 70% sensible characters who do genuinely heroic things for smart, sweet, and 50% sensible reasons.
