No, they haven't. Some people interpret the quote in the OP as them having had sex, but it doesn't make any sense from a character/story perspective. Joon is repeatedly shown to place importance on full sexual intercourse, and to have the leadup and resolution of that in his relationship with Amaryllis /happen off screen and only be mentioned once/ would be pretty terrible story telling. My interpretation of the above is that Amaryllis is giving Joon blowjobs, and he feels guilty that he isn't really able to reciprocate.
