Your actual argument was that Amaryllis is not asexual and that the DM blocked her sexual pleasure. Atleast thats what started it. I'm not sure what you are arguing now to be honest. I think its that asexuality doesn't actually exist, which is an absurd statement and not really an argument. I was just pointing out that Freud was wrong about so much that if he said something its more likely than not it isn't true...
