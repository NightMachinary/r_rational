"According to Freud" isn't exactly a ringing endorsement, considering the way a lot of his work's been debunked/minimized as psychology's evolved as a field. Not to mention, evolution isn't the be-all, end-all of what determines how an individual organism is structured. Defects and inconsistent things happen all the time. For example, there's no biological, evolutionary reason for homosexual attraction to exist but it very clearly does in a decent amount of people.
