Eh. The first bold bit comes across as teasing, and the second bit could easily be more generally about hangups on monogomy and how that becomes blurred with clones. The last bit does imply intimacy in a group manner, but the specific depth of which isn't a given, due to the variety of paths they could take and Joon's general hang ups with expressing his sexuality.

Something probably happened, "foursome" unlikely the fully accurate term, but given the text before is talking about how the actual action is less important than the specific details I don't think this is going to matter in the grand scheme of things.

Also, I used to spend time in the kink/bdsm/queer club scene (pre-quarantine, pre-best place in my city shutting down) and there are a variety of ways of being a variety of levels of intimate, but given such places haven't been explicitly mentioned in Aerb I'm assuming the comments by the general public are prone to simplifying the situation a lot too from a lack of experience/knowledge. So grains of salt on everything being talked about in universe too.
