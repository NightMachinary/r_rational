I think this is a good opportunity to specifically say "I don't know". It can certainly be parsed as euphemism for sex, or it can just be Mary appreciating platonic relationship time.

Three things point toward the null hypothesis imo --

- (Pri-)Mary likes spending time with Joon, and the other clones have relatively less fun jobs -- and this is why she's so bubbly of late, because she's the locus of "fun" for all 30 of her. Now there are 3x as many Marys in the "fun" role
- Joon makes an incredibly big deal about sex, and he doesn't make another peep about any hypothetical orgies with him involved.
- I almost forgot the obvious one - Mary is still ace, yeah?

I almost wonder if I'm supposed to parse this as "the DM dropping bait for Joon" -- like, hey buddy, nudge nudge, the newspapers are writing the most /salacious/ stories about you and your loving wife who would totally indulge you in anything that would make you happy. Too bad they're just stories, totally unlike this virtual universe that definitely doesn't ever run on anything resembling storybook logic...

Then they just play a board game and go to bed
