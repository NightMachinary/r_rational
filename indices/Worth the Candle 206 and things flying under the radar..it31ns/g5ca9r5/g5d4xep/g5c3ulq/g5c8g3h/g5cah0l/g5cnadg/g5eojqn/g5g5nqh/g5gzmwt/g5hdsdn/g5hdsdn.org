I'm pretty sure dobri is off base with his comment; unless I missed something major, Mary has always been depicted as simply asexual. She can take "pleasure" in a sex act that helps fulfill and satisfy a partner in the same way that a person can take "pleasure" in rubbing their partner's feet, or something similar. You don't get off on the feeling of toes in between your hands (fetishists aside, obviously, and that's completely fine) but you do enjoy comforting and helping your partner feel good.
