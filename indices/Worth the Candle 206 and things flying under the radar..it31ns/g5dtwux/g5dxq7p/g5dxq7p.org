  There's a planar entity,” said Raven. “Under certain circumstances, it's capable of altering the electron stream within a television in order to produce moving images of its own design. Some of those designs are capable of producing ... effects.”

  “Specifically,” said Amaryllis, gritting her teeth.

  “Mental changes in those who view them,” said Raven. “The effects vary.” She continued on quickly, because it seemed like Amaryllis was going to press the issue again. “The best case scenario is increased mental acuity, decreased reaction times, better impulse control, and lessened emotional response, which comes packaged with a direct line of communication to the entity itself. Non-replicable when the moving pictures are recorded, in case you were wondering. The ‘gifts' are temporary and used as leverage. In the worst case ... there are a lot of worst cases. The entity can make people into flesh puppets. It can leave them comatose. It can hold them hostage in their own bodies, locked in, which it does if it thinks that will give it an advantage.”

  “And why wouldn't you --” Amaryllis paused. “Ah. Cultists.”

  “Cultists,” nodded Raven. “Not like those that worship the infernals though, because there's every indication that the entity is forthright in honoring the promises he makes. There have been scenarios where knowledge of the entity was presented to the world at large, as you suggest, in the hopes of mutual cooperation. The result, every time, was a race to the bottom as the nations of the world attempted to be the first to get on the entity's good side. World population undergoes a precipitous drop once the entity has its toehold, until eventually the last one percent of survivors live in something approaching a paradise for a decade or two before the entity is brought to immanence. From there, it's a paradise with bodily sacrifices. The contorted writings of those living in that world are something to behold.”
