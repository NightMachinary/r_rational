Volume and mass are both 3-dimensional. If Mt. Lady can increase mass/volume by 300 times, it makes sense for 1% of that to be increase mass/volume by 3 times.

For gravity, force=mass times acceleration The acceleration is the earth's gravity, 9.8 meters per (second squared).

Munchkinry with a power that isn't well described or understandable doesn't appeal to me, but maybe other people like other things like the characters or the commentary on the setting.
