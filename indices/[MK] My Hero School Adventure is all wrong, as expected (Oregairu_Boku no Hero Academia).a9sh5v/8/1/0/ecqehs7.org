Some quotes

#+begin_quote
  During the Ball Throw, the standout was obviously Uraraka, who was much nicer about letting me copy her quirk than Todoroki had been. Although she called it Zero Gravity, it didn't quite nullify gravity precisely, it just made objects float. The precise mechanism of how it worked was a little strange to me - if I understood as much science as Yaoyorozu then I might have been able to explain it - but the upshot was that where Uraraka could float up to three tons, I could handle a max of three hundred kilos, and where Uraraka could make things actually float, I could make them about 10-15% lighter. Before I could see how useful that would actually be, though, there was another big surprise: Midoriya.

  Focusing on the ball, I channeled Uraraka's Zero Gravity quirk into it, wound up, and threw the ball as hard as my miniscule piece of Stockpile could send it. I didn't quite crack the sound barrier like Midoriya had, but it probably wasn't that far off, and with Uraraka's Float active I still managed to eke out a win over his throw - and, by extension, Bakugo's.

So 10-15% is mentioned immediately after copying the power without mentioning stockpile in connection with that 10-15%. Soon after, stockpile is mentioned as 'miniscule' (although which stockpile is ambiguous, but I think it might refer to the gravity stockpile, which would make sense to be miniscule since he just copied that power).
