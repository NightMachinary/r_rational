Okay, if that is true, then there is a different contradiction.

#+begin_quote
  the most useful power I had copied that day wasn't All Might's

  the most useful power I had in my entire collection of 108 skills... was the one that I had gotten from that slimy pile of ooze
#+end_quote

copyOfOoze allows for 2 quirks to be used at once, so roughly a doubling of power.

However, if copyOfAllMight were a 'permanent passive buff' then in order for 'copying of floating objects' to 'reduce weight by 10%' that would require that copyOfAllMight to have the effect of 10x.
