Also consider if the limiter is on force, acceleration, mass or a combination of the three. The equivalence principle in general relativity would normally suggest acceleration, if the power works based on gravity, but then there must be a limit on the force as well (a limit on the force would be equivalent to a limit on the mass in this case).
