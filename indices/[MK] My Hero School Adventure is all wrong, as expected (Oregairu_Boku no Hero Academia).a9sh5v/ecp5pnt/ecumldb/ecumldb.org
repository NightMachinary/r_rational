I have to strike a balance writing the fic. If I go too in-depth into the mechanics of how everything works, the story suffers; on the other hand if I don't explain enough then it'll bother people like you and me.

Uraraka's quirk is particularly problematic because her 'zero gravity' abilities can reduce the velocity of falling objects to zero (as seen when she saves Izuku from falling) can let her quickly accelerate extremely massive objects (as seen when she swings a support pillar like a baseball bat) and can also negate the impact of gravitational forces on objects (when she throws a softball into space.)

Also, she has a weight limit, a quasi-time limit, and a effect that could be diminished. If I recall correctly, I arrived at the 10-15% number by diminishing the quirk along each axis by the cube root of 108 - but explaining all of that in story would have been incredibly tedious, so I didn't. I hope that explains how that happened!
