It'd be a big stretch to call this rational, so while I son't Neccesarily think highly of that in general tagging this story with the munchkinry tag and avoiding the RT tag was the right choicr ; certainly, it isn't more rational than OreGairu proper, and both that work and this rely heavily on story elements - to say nothing of MHA. Still, considering Practical Guide is posted here despite not being remotely rational anymore, it fits well enough, and I can't say I didn't highly enjoy this fic. Even as the work isn't rational, Hikigaya Hachiman is here believably, genuinely smart, and at the same time very much a real person. Whether it's from personal experience or artistic skill letting them copy the voices of canon when appropriate, the people here act, like, well, people, not plot devices. I can't say there's no contrivances, but it's done rather well and doesn't detract from the story being told in any serious way.

Seconding this rec, as it were, just with the added notice that the lack of RT in the title is for reason.
