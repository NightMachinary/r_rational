No? It started out promising that. "The story" these days is very much Black / Cat / Occasionally bard says x; literally the only exception to this is grey pilgrim vs black, as far as I'm aware. It's nto something you can predict ahead of time, or model, or shit; it's an as the plot demands power, only it's the actual plot.

Honestly comparing this to unsong does unsong a serious disservice.
