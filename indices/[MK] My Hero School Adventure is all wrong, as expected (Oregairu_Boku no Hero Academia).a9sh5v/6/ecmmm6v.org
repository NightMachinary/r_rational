I couldn't get past the first few chapters because of the blatant signs of wish fulfillment coming in. This hachiman feels more like a self insert rather than a true representation of hachiman. I felt like this hachiman is rather too much in the limelight because my opinion of hachiman is that hes suppose to be the unimportant unassuming snarky side character that rational deconstructs everything around him. I am also a little biased because my favorite fic of all time is a danmachi/hachiman crossover called [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/my-trans-dimensional-overpowered-protagonist-harem-comedy-is-wrong-as-expected-oregairu-danmachi.367903/][My trans dimensional overpowered protaganist.]] and I am quite unfairly comparinng the both of them.
