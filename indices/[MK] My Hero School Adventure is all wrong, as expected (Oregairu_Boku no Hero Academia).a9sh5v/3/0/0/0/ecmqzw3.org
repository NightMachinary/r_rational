PGtE is rational mostly in the same way /Pact/ is, in that it turns the genre-savviness of the average fantasy story up to eleven. It notably lacks scenes where the main characters make the /first or second/ mistake that would be dramatic in any other stories, and instead has them plotting around plots. I think it also counts in the worldbuilding department (actual maps and consideration of terrain and travel time!) as well as the "creative application of their resources" criteria. There's a scene in the second book where the main character uses her ability to pilot the undead as a way to create undead goat suicide bombers, and that comes up as a Chekhov's gun at the very end of the third book, in a way I won't spoil.

I won't call it mainstream rational fiction - its use of subjectiveness and tropes probably puts it closer to UNSONG than to HPMOR - but I do think it's deserving of being posted here, especially if people enjoy it.
