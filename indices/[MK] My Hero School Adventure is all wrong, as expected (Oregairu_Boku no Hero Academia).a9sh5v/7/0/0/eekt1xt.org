"Of course I had only copied it at 1/108th strength, so really I could only use two quirks simultaneously, but that was one more quirk than I was able to use at once before."

He starts of with one Quirk at a time. Useing the Ooze exploit he can now use another quirk, so now he can use two quirks at a time. If what you are suggesting is correct then he should be useing Three quirks (Ooze + two others) and should have said that is "but that was two more quirks than I was able to use at once before."

Now I think about it, it is probaly just suposed to work like you said and the author just forgot that he was useing Ooze as well as the other two quirks.
