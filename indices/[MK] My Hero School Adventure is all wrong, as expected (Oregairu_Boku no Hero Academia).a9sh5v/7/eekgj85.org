The main thing that winds me up about this fic is how inconistent all of the power intraction are. Like after geting the ooze quirk he can use 2 quirks at the same time, the ooze quirk and a diffrent quirk. but the story just ignores this and lets him use any 2 quirks. The fact that OfA works diffrently to how it dose in the manga and even in this fic when All might is useing it. Other than that it is ok i guess but that kinda stuff ruins the story for me.
