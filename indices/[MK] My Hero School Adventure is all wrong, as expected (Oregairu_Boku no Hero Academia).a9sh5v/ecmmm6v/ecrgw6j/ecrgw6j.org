Aside from the actual harem protag comparison with transdim, I'm also kind of confused how you think transdim!hiki is any more of an unimportant side character than here, considering how he becomes one of the most important and wealthy people in Orario, at least one of the top ten, if not top five in combat ability, singlehandedly decides the outcome in some of the most important battles of the plot, has arguably the most broken skill/spell build period, so on and so on.

He even explicitly says he tried to insert himself into (what he thinks is) Danmachi's plot as a mentor character, which is hardly unimportant, and succeeds beyond his wildest imagination.
