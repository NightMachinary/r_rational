Fiona Sam Fisher'ed the hell out of Alecto, that was very funny to read. I am glad her cat is ok. This shall be interesting to see if she manages to save the other people on the squad. I hope she can find some cash to get some proper clothing as she is down to nothing but her PJs, she will need another recorder to stave of obliviation too.
