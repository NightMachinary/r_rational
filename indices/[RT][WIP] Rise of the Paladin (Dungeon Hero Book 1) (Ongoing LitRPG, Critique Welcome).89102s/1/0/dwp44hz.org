Read the rest. I think you're still solid, but I'm not finding it fun enough to read the fights and info dumps about mechanics. I think in those sections the main character's emotions and viewpoint aren't as present, so that may be why I'm not liking them as much - maybe I think they're too dry? I would like to more of his internal emotions in fights, I think? Try to convey what it feels like be in that fight more than what happens?

Also, you've got what could be an interesting and deep character, but we're still really only seeing the one side ("protective older sibling"). I would really like to see more of the other sides of this character (outside of his own head - where you do a great job of conveying them).

Edit:

I do really like this story! I'm interested in seeing where it goes. At a later point I'll try to write up more about what I'm particularly liking about it.
