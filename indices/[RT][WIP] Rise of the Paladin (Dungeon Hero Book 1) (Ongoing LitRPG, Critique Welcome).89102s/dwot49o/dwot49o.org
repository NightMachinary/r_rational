Read Chapter 1, and I like it. When I get through more I'll give you more critique, etc; so far -

Your writing and characterization is solid and effective. I have a good idea of who even just these three people are and the life they're in. Same goes for the pacing and the literal word-craft.

I very much did NOT expect "little sister" instead of "partner", the first few paragraphs definitely seemed like they'd be about a wife, instead.
