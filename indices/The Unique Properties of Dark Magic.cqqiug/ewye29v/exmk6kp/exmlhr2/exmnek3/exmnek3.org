From what I've read, I've mentally +suppressed+ replaced all mentions of MLP with typical humanoid features. Hands instead of hoof, fingers instead of horns, simple replacements like that. The story itself hasnt really been anything special but it's not shit. That makes it at least in the top 50% of fanfics/general literature I've read.
