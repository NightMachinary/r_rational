Alright, I've read a couple dozen chapters in and I rate it as poor on the rationality and munchkining. Perhaps it's my own personal experience as an university lab student but the way every solution is just magic'ed away breaks any sense of rationality.

Magic is interesting and sometimes necessary to break pesky laws like thermodynamics but it shouldn't solve everything. But when it becomes the universal hammer, everything becomes a nail. Magic gotta have some downsides, or at least more than being hard to learn.
