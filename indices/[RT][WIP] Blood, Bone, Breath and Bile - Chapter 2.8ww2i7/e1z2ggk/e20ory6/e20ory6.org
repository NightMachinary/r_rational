The decision to flesh out the setting and his circumstances is not one that I was expecting. I can appreciate the classic self-absorbed amoral organization that is more concerned about its reputation than its constituates, but I feel like it would be best to yell us more about Aswen first. Of course if you are doing it with purpose, for example never giving him a physical description as a writing tactic, keep going because that might be interesting.

I didn't catch any typos the first go around.
