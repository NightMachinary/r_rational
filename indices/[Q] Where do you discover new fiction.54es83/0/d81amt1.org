In terms of published fiction, I like [[/r/printsf]] a lot. [[/r/fantasy]] is.... not exactly bad, but not as good or focused as [[/r/printsf]] in a lot of ways.

For fanfiction and other purely online stuff, I quite like [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/forums/creative-writing.18/][Spacebattles Creative Writing forum]] and the [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/forums/user-fiction.2/][Sufficient Velocity user fiction forum]]. SB and SV tend to be taken over by fads periodically, right now we're in the middle of The Worm Fanfiction Fad which has been going on longer/stronger than most other fads ever have, so if you like Worm fanfics it's great but otherwise not so much. Previously they've had similar periods with e.g. things like Familiar of Zero. Spacebattles also has fairly good discussion forums for various types of fanfiction posted elsewhere in it's [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/forums/the-index.63/][index subforum]], which hosts among other things [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/general-recommendation-thread-13.295360/][a general recommendation thread]]. The general thread has a potpourri of recommendations, while major fandoms tend to have their own discussion threads.

If I find a fanfiction.net or AO3 author who I like, I will check their favourites lists. This is a tentative thing because many authors who write things I like have completely different tastes than me, but it can be helpful sometimes.
