The [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/forums/quests.29/][Quest Forum]] on Sufficient Velocity is also a fantastic source of new stories for me. If you sort by Most Replies you'll get a lot of quests that have been going for long enough that it'll keep you occupied for a good amount of time. Very few quests like that are actually finished, and some of them are dead forever, but there are a lot of ongoing ones.
