[[/r/narutofanfiction]], [[/r/wormfanfic]] and [[/r/hpfanfiction]] are all moderately active and have various recommendation threads, plus you can ask for specific styles of story. I use [[/r/narutofanfiction]] a lot, and there's also a rec list on the wiki there, likewise for Worm. I think the HP subreddit recently started their own wiki rec list too. [[/r/fanfiction]] isn't as good a source as you might think, because most of the discussion is either about writing rather than reading stories or about fanfiction for a small enough setting that you won't have heard of it (at least, that's been my experience).
