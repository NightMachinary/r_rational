More darkly, if the crown can only change hands after the death of the previous owner, I suppose they could just kill the queen and duplicate her method. The crown better involve some pretty sweet powers to make up for possibly incentivizing people to murder you. All the more so once the tower challenge is no longer difficult.

Presumably the crown carries /some/ power which somehow results in people listening to your governing decisions one way or another. Otherwise no one would care who had the crown. But the protagonist better be reasonably powerful if she's going to blithely wave the crown at Baldie and Beardie like that.
