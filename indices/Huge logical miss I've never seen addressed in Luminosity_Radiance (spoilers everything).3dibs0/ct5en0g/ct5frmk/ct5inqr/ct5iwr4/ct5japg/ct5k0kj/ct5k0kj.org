Interesting, but this brings another point:

#+begin_quote
  full informed consent
#+end_quote

With human minds being as limited compared to vampires as apes' are compared to humans, how can you provide enough information that the consent would really be fully informed?

The increased strength, speed, intelligence, emotions, senses and communication, they cannot really be expressed in words, and even Elspeth's power would quite simply not be able to represent a Vampire's state of being to a human, who lacks the tools to understand it.

And, indeed, out of the 5 vampires who were brought back as humans, 4 wanted to be turned again, and the only one who didn't was because last time he was killed soon after turning while Aro was searching for Witches, so he didn't actually have the chance to fully experience his capabilities as a Vampire and all he remembered was basically 3 days of extreme pain and then being murdered.
