Why? Through the story eating humans was only shown as something vampire do because of their instinct (thirst of blood, and human blood tastes better), there was no rational argument brought in FOR eating humans, or at least to keep a neutral stance on the matter like the Vulturi did.

And this in a story that's supposed to be a founding pillar of the rational fiction genre.
