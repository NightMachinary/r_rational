Actually, there doesn't seem to have been much vampire R&D at all. I /think/ there were some mentions of vampires doing handicrafts (not sure?) but the backstory doesn't have any vampire researchers or scientists or engineers that I recall. I don't think Carlisle invented any new surgical techniques, for example.

Do vampires actually /have/ a civilization of their own, or are they parasitic on humans?
