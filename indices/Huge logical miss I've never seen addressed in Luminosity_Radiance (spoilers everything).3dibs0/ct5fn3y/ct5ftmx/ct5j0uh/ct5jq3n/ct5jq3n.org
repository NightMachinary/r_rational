  On the other hand, vampires are mutually infertile. They need to breed with humans to have children. Humans can be converted into vampires. This isn't anything like a new species, they're more like humans carrying a symbiont. Possibly the extra chromosomes started out as part of a virus.

Very interesting point, and indeed it might be true that the venom that transforms humans in vampires is a parasite whose purpose is to fuse with another species, elevate it and then hunt the species itself for it's own survival. Though we don't really have in-universe information on that (or any real information on what vampires or magic is, for that matter. Despite millennia of vampire society, and intelligence way above humans, there doesn't appear to have been any R&D in the origin or characteristics of the species), so it's all speculation.

  Also, evolution isn't a directed process. There's no such thing as "higher" or "lower" species, or a "next step" in evolution. No rationalist would give an argument based on that kind of interpretation of evolution any credit.

Indeed, I might have misused the term "evolution", but the point remains that vampires are way above humans as far as capabilities go, AND they are human's natural predators, sitting on top of the food chain, so I'm not sure considering them as part of the human species makes much sense.
