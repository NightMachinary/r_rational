See, those are better arguments to have, albeit one this sub have hashed out before. I think most people here say the last four or so chapters of L and most of R isn't very rational. The first half of L is, however, almost flawless /rationalist/ fiction.

All this still doesn't justify the original argument about /vampires Ã¼ber alles/. That was what people ITT seemed mad about, and what I demolished in my comment.

Maybe not a great way to have started the discussion if you actually wanted to talk about the other stuff. If people are misunderstanding, including myself, I'm sorry that happened.
