  Re-read the sidebar, Characteristics of Rational Fiction, and show us where you think the story is missing something. That's a fun debate. This isn't. It's just annoying people.

Oh, I can assure you, I have tons of qualms with those as well, especially the "Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason. " rule.

The sheer amount of scenes that happened because the plot required it (2nd time Bella was burned, Caius deciding all of a sudden to get rid of Abby, Cody's defection, etc) and Bella holding the idiot ball through situations that any rational character would have resolved or at least attempted to before they exploded (powers development [this is a HUGE one, both on Bella, who had two points at which she realized her powers could do a lot more, yet never actually worked on them except for Jasper's emotional power, and for Elspeth, who in the car just decided to STOP growing her power, completely], Irina's situation, James' hunting and many others I don't remember anymore) is ridiculous.

As another user said:

  I think the reason you had to use coincidences is because you made too few changes in the universe. You made Bella smarter and more rational, but everything else, as I see it, is the same. >There was no other way to make life more difficult for the heroes without some major bad luck. I think it would have been better if you altered the universe to be a harder challenge for Bella's wit; made the Volturi smarter, changed some of the laws, introduced new elements - whatever.

The enemies kept holding the idiot ball, so it was necessary for Bella to do the same, otherwise the plot wouldn't have developed how it was supposed to...

But anyway, that's another discussion for another day (probably never, as I'm starting to read more and more critical reviews and I guess from now on I'll just link those when someone recommends Luminosity/Radiance).
