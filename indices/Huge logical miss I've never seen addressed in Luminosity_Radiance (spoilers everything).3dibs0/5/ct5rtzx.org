There are serious power imbalances and clearly conflicting goal sets, making such negotiations pointless in the first place. Her just nope-ing straight out of any debate is very, very rational, given the information she has.

As is her resisting irrational new instincts by declaring hard personal rules that defend her chosen goals. Valuing human life for her isn't irrational, as she acts appropriately given that goal. The ruling elite just trying to stomp her without giving a stupid, weak argument she won't buy is also rational, given what /they/ know.

Even here, after possibly months of low-stress consideration, you haven't presented a very coherent version of this morally gray and power-game-y argument. You're just complaining a certain power fantasy scene never happened. And you're doing it poorly. So yes, you did miss something.

Re-read the sidebar, /Characteristics of Rational Fiction/, and show us where you think the story is missing something. That's a fun debate. This isn't. It's just annoying people.
