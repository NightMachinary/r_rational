On the other hand, vampires are mutually infertile. They need to breed with humans to have children. Humans can be converted into vampires. This isn't anything like a new species, they're more like humans carrying a symbiont. Possibly the extra chromosomes started out as part of a virus.

Also, evolution isn't a directed process. There's no such thing as "higher" or "lower" species, or a "next step" in evolution. No rationalist would give an argument based on that kind of interpretation of evolution any credit.
