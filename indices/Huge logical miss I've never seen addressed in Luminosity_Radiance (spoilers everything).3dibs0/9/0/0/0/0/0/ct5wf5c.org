  The only capability that matters in this context is intelligence, because we're tool users, and they don't actually seem any more intelligent than humans. Maybe that's a problem of the author not being more intelligent than humans, but still...

Indeed, they don't appear to think at a higher level, at least judging by how it was written, just think faster and interact with each other faster. This is probably because the author wasn't able or couldn't be bothered to model the interactions of an entire species of smarter beings, so she just went the just as smart but faster route.

  And they're not even obligate predators of humans. As you note drink they drink human blood because it tastes better. Not because they need to.

Correct, but their compulsion is to drink human blood, and so is their instinct. It's true that later is found out that the thirst can be quenched by animals, but they are repulsed by it.

On top of that, if they drink animal blood they become weaker (although apparently with a clearer mind).

  Also, "elevate it"?

Seems fitting, since the virus transforms a human into a being way above any baseline human, which shares little with the original human, with even the memories fading.
