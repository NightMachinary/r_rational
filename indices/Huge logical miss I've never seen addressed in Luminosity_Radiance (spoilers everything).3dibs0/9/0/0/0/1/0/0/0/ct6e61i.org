To be fair, they don't really need to bother furthering the technology itself, as they lack most of the needs human have: they don't need sleep, shelter, food (aside from blood), clothing (they don't suffer cold or hot) and are deeply independent so better communication tools are not so important.

Not only, as long as they drink human blood they are not able to have big covens because it leads to fights continuously which means that pooling resources for research is not that easy (without Chelsea).

So, they are parasitic because they have no need to grow further, but they definitely have the potential to not be if they had to (=all of a sudden their food source disappeared).
