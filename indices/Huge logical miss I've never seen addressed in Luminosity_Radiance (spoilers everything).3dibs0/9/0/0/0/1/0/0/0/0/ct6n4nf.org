As I said, it's been a long time since I read the stories. Apparently there is no such thing as vampire science or vampire technology; is there any evidence of vampire-created culture? Paintings, music, poetry, math -- do humanivore vampires actually create anything at all? I don't remember any of them doing so, but it might just be my memory.

If vampires create no art and no science, I don't feel that it's reasonable to call them a superior species. First off, they aren't really a species, since they can't reproduce on their own. Second, humanity's value (to the extent that we have any) is not in our combat capability, it's in our ability to create, to bring things into the universe that never existed before. If vampires don't do that, they are simply very efficient parasites. Not even terribly smart parasites, honestly, since most of them haven't figured out the concept of farming. There's a reason that most bacteria don't kill their host.
