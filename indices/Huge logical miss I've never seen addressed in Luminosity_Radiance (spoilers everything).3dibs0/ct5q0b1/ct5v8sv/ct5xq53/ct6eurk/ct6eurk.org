  The thirst is a definite downside.
#+end_quote

Agreed, but it doesn't tip the scale since the upsides are so huge.

  I'm assuming this isn't your argument or anything you believe. If you do believe it or find it even vaguely sympathetic, I hope you never gain any significant amount of power. >Even more so than when I just thought you were a redpiller and an apologist for sexual assault.
#+end_quote

Please stop the personal attacks.

Yes, I believe every rationalist needs to read and internalize the research TRP has done into human mating strategies, no I don't believe in pushing said data on them.

So, if you want to discuss that, we can take it outside. This thread is not the right place for that discussion.

  That requires people to have time to think about the issue when it feels threatening to their way of life personally. Maggie is sympathetic to arguments that affect her on a direct emotional and practical level, and they aren't impacted by any sort of divine or natural right to eat humans. Siobhan was never banned from drinking human blood -- in the first book, it wasn't even under consideration, and in the second, she had an exemption as long as she didn't murder anyone.

Right, and the other people who attended the meeting, Romanian included, weren't informed of Bella intending to force vampires to Vegetarianism.

#+begin_quote
  Doubtful. Maggie seemed to acquire it when she started eating animals.
#+end_quote

Hmm, I don't remember that happening, actually. I remember her accepting eating animals because it was a condition for her to live with her mate, and later just continued with that. Perhaps I forgot, but I have no recollection of her showing particular interest in humans, her daughter aside.

  The Cullens seem to have basic human decency, though they feel they can't impose their will on others. The Denalis likewise, though not to such a great degree.
#+end_quote

You are probably right on the Cullens (especially Carlisle who had such a strong desire that he founded the whole Vegetarianism), but I don't think the Denalis value humans that much.

#+begin_quote
  We saw one argument of moderate length. It appeared even when the ending was already slightly bogged down. How much more bogged down do you want the story to be?
#+end_quote

It didn't really feel bogged down to me, but you might be right.

#+begin_quote
  You can always ask the author directly why she didn't include more discussions and objections to the no-eating-people rule. She's on twitter.
#+end_quote

Oh, right. We're in 2015. Thanks.
