  Yes, I was referring to the fact that vampires are stronger, faster, tougher, don't need food/water/air, are smarter (or at least think and act faster) and are an overall improvement over baseline humans in basically all characteristics.

The thirst is a definite downside.

  Thus, since humans eat both animals inferior to them and plants, why shouldn't Vampires eat both humans and animals?
#+end_quote

I'm assuming this isn't your argument or anything you believe. If you do believe it or find it even vaguely sympathetic, I hope you never gain any significant amount of power. Even more so than when I just thought you were a redpiller and an apologist for sexual assault.

  I was just wondering why nobody made these remarks to Bella before the thing was established, especially in the first book when they first encountered Siobhan and Maggy.

That requires people to have time to think about the issue when it feels threatening to their way of life personally. Maggie is sympathetic to arguments that affect her on a direct emotional and practical level, and they aren't impacted by any sort of divine or natural right to eat humans. Siobhan was never banned from drinking human blood -- in the first book, it wasn't even under consideration, and in the second, she had an exemption as long as she didn't murder anyone.

  I'm starting to wonder whether Bella's shield not only protected against powers and fire, but also against entering the Vampire mindset upon turning, which left her self-identifying as a human while in the body of a vampire.
#+end_quote

Doubtful. Maggie seemed to acquire it when she started eating animals. The Cullens seem to have basic human decency, though they feel they can't impose their will on others. The Denalis likewise, though not to such a great degree.

  We did, there was that critique on the "don't forcefully turn mates" rule.
#+end_quote

We saw one argument of moderate length. It appeared even when the ending was already slightly bogged down. How much more bogged down do you want the story to be?

You can always ask the author directly why she didn't include more discussions and objections to the no-eating-people rule. She's on twitter.
