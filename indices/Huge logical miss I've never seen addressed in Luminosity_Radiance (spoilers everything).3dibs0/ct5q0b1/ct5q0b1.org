  Why did NOBODY bring up the superiority of the species argument?
#+end_quote

Superiority on what terms? If you merely mean that vampires can kill humans easily, that's not an argument worth considering. It would work just as well for ebola! A century ago, it would apply to measles, and nobody's sad that we eradicated measles!

The interpretation I could agree with is that people have reasonable cause to prefer to be vampires rather than humans -- you get a better memory, you maybe become smarter (at least, you can read and type much faster, which is smarter on one axis), you don't age, you're more durable, you're stronger, and your senses are better. Plus the whole mate thing is convenient, in a way. The thirst is a nontrivial downside, naturally, and since it's slaked primarily by killing sentient beings, you might hesitate or choose not to turn.

  there is no point in worrying about killing humans
#+end_quote

The general thrust of your argument seems to be: people would often prefer to live as vampires than to live as humans, therefore we should let vampires kill as many humans as they want. That's a complete non sequitur. You may as well say that the uber wealthy should be able to hunt humans for sport because most humans would rather be wealthy than poor. This is the exact opposite of rationality. The two concepts are entirely unrelated.

If instead your argument were that /you/ personally didn't care about humans and you did care about vampire freedom and autonomy, therefore you are fine with vampires eating people...that is rational, but it's not compelling to any moral person.

  Did I miss something, or Luminance/Radiance really has no place being compared to HPMOR or other rational stories?

Luminosity. Get the title right.

You missed any shred of human decency. The Golden Empire was founded on human decency (well, and killing a lot of Volturi, and being able to trap vampires in essentially a prison world).

Before that, nobody has encountered a non-human diet outside the Denali and Cullen covens. Those two covens are non-judgmental and do not proselytize. We don't see extended interaction between non-humanivore and humanivore vampires for the most part, and when we do, it's focused on defeating the Volturi. There are literally only a dozen vampires in the world who care about humans and think they're people. The thought of eating animals rather than humans is too bizarre and not well publicized enough for people to come up with objections. It's all "you can try your outlandish diet, I expect you to die from it, and I'm just going to steer clear in case it turns you into a ravening beast."

Normal people don't just hear a bizarre idea and immediately treat it seriously and try to come up with objections. And in this case, it only takes a few seconds to get to a basic value mismatch, which lets you dismiss the other person's attempts to persuade you (if they're even trying) without further debate.

However, since the books end with an authority mandating strict non-humanivore behavior with the ability to enforce that mandate, if the books continued a bit longer, we would see people petitioning the Golden Throne with bullshit arguments like the one you put forward.

I looked at your comment history. Are you sure your real objection isn't that the books were written by a woman? Considering you post in [[/r/theredpill]], plus the stuff you wrote [[https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/3cz8nb/comiccon_women_tired_of_groping_geeks_and/ct0ncpv][here]], plus [[https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/3bzlup/google_trends_reddit_alternative/csrvqvj][apparently you think even 4chan is too feminist for you]] -- that doesn't mean for certain that you'd be dismissive of a work simply because a woman wrote it, but it's pretty damning.
