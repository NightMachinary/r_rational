I'm trying to think what an actual war between humans and vampires would look like. (I'm leaving the magic aside for a second and just look at the rest of it.)

Vampires are physically superior in a hand-to-hand fight and are very durable but can still be blown to pieces with blunt force trauma, so bullets and grenades and bombs oh my should work just fine on them. Flamethrowers will do them up a treat.

Vampires are easily spotted during the day and can't teleport or turn to mist, so it's possible to fort up at night.

Vampires can convert humans, but it's a long-ish process, and the newborns are useless as covert agents, only as battle chaff. Converting humans is a case of removing a human asset and turning it into a poorly aimed weapon -- some strategic advantage, but not much.

There are...a few thousand? maybe a few million?...vampires in the world, and seven billion humans.

I don't think that would be a fun fight for anyone. I'm honestly not sure who would win, but civilian populations would take a massive pounding and if the humans won it would be through genocide.
