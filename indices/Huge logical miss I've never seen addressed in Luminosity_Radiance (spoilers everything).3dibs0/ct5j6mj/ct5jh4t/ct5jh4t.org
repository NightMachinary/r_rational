  What definition of "superior" are you using? Vampires are stronger, faster, and tougher, but they don't seem to think better. To the extent that we are superior to apes it's due to superior intelligence, not improved physical abilities.

While it is true that within the scope of the story they do not appear to think better, they do demonstrate superior cognitive capabilities, especially mnemonic capabilities and communication (the perfect example being them often sustaining multiple conversations at once at speeds far exceeding what humans could keep up with). From what Bella has analyzed right after being turned into a vampire (while she was still thinking rationally) it seems that for most vampires the issue is that while their mental capability increased by orders of magnitude, emotions increase by that same amount, and instincts (especially those surrounding the continuous thirst) grow as well, putting compulsions at a higher priority than rational analysis, to the extreme that a vampire in presence of an extremely tasty human (singer) stops thinking completely.

Agree on the reproduction issue, the lack of which might indeed undermine the status of "species" for vampires, though for immortal creatures reproduction itself doesn't hold that much evolutionary value I think.
