  since [vampires] are as superior to humans as humans are to apes

What definition of "superior" are you using? Vampires are stronger, faster, and tougher, but they don't seem to think better. To the extent that we are superior to apes it's due to superior intelligence, not improved physical abilities.

On a separate subject -- it's been a long time since I read those stories, but the way I remember it is that vampires can't reproduce physically, they can only (a) convert a human or (b) have a kid with a human, and the latter is a very high-risk option that will almost certainly kill the mother and will get some of the most powerful vampires angry at you. Am I remembering that right?

[1] A few vampire also have special psychic powers, but that's supposedly a very small percentage.
