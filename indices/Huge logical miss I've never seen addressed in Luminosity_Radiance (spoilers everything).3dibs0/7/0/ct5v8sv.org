  Superiority on what terms?
#+end_quote

Yes, I was referring to the fact that vampires are stronger, faster, tougher, don't need food/water/air, are smarter (or at least think and act faster) and are an overall improvement over baseline humans in basically all characteristics.

  The general thrust of your argument seems to be: people would often prefer to live as vampires than to live as humans, therefore we should let vampires kill as many humans as they want.
#+end_quote

No, my argument is (or would be, if I had to bring it to Bella in story): Vampires are not humans, they are another species superior to humans, and their main susteinance source is human blood. They can sustain themselves on animal blood, but at the cost of strength and eating satisfaction, and with the benefit of a clearer mind.

Humans eat other animals (included dolphins, which are the 2nd smartest species on earth), and can sustain themselves on vegetables, at the cost of some long term issues (B12 deficiency is the first that comes to mind) and with the benefit of a lower risk of cardiovascular diseases.

Thus, since humans eat both animals inferior to them and plants, why shouldn't Vampires eat both humans and animals?

Yes, there is the issue of sentience, to which I currently do not have an answer, although from what I could gather I doubt many humans would stop eating pigs even if those started to speak a little english overnight. Hell, we often attribute sentience to dogs and cats, yet asian cultures still eat them without issues.

  You missed any shred of human decency. The Golden Empire was founded on human decency (well, and killing a lot of Volturi, and being able to trap vampires in essentially a prison world).
#+end_quote

Precisely, The Golden Empire (a VAMPIRE governing body) was founded on HUMAN decency.

I'm starting to wonder whether Bella's shield not only protected against powers and fire, but also against entering the Vampire mindset upon turning, which left her self-identifying as a human while in the body of a vampire.

  However, since the books end with an authority mandating strict non-humanivore behavior with the ability to enforce that mandate, if the books continued a bit longer, we would see people petitioning the Golden Throne with bullshit arguments like the one you put forward.
#+end_quote

We did, there was that critique on the "don't forcefully turn mates" rule. But yeah, we'd have probably seen way more of that after the Empire was established. I was just wondering why nobody made these remarks to Bella before the thing was established, especially in the first book when they first encountered Siobhan and Maggy.

  I looked at your comment history. Are you sure your real objection isn't that the books were written by a woman?
#+end_quote

Thanks for digging, but no. I thought about it multiple times while reading, but despite some doubts on the story dropping the rational pretense halfway through, I don't think I am judging this more harshly than I would something written by a man.

I really wish it was that simple, though.
