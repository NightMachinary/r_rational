In what morality is it OK to kill something solely because you are superior to it? You mention apes specifically and there is already a large debate about whether apes should be given the rights and protections of personhood (same thing with dolphins). Even with less intelligent animals, there are people who believe killing them is morally wrong (vegetarians).

While I personally think it's ok to kill some of the less sapient animals as long as it's done humanely, any species that has sapience, regardless of how much, should not be killed unless the relative gains are enormous. Since vampires don't need to eat humans, and humans have sapience (regardless if whether or not vampires are "superior") it is obvious that the correct moral choice is to not eat them.
