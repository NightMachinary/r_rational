Let me decompose that for simplicity, if I may:

1. Bella tried to forcibly convert the world to vegetarianism.
2. No one verbally challenged her on this.
3. Therefore, L/R are not rational.

If that's your position...well, I'm not sure it's one that really needs a lot of debate. There seem to be perfectly reasonable responses:

- Doylist: Alicorn didn't think of one particular thing. Meh, it's not that big a deal; these characters aren't really noted for their verbal debate skills anyway. Give a pass on this one and call it a plot hole at worst.
- Watsonian: humanivore vampires lack social organization more sophisticated than "pack". It makes perfect sense that their first and only response was violence.

I guess, really my response comes to this: you said that you'd never seen this argument discussed elsewhere. You've laid it out here and I don't think anyone in the thread has found it convincing. It's possible that you're the only sane man here, but thd odds don't seem to favor it.

Even if, for the sake of argument, we grant your point, that would mean that the story was flawed, not that it suddenly became completely non-rational. I don't think you'll have any trouble at all getting people to agree with the proposition "L/R were not completely rational."

Shoot, when you look at it, HPMOR, the founding cornerstone of the genre, has some imperfections. $antagonist's (whichever name you choose) plot was ridiculously overcomplex and had at least one major plot hole that I can think of offhand, yet it's still the cornerstone of the genre and a really good story to boot.
