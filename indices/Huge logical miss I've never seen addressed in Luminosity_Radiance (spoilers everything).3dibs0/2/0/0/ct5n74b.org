Please present your evidence in support of the theory that each vampire has one and only one potential mate.

I find it unlikely that so many vampires find their mates within such a short span of time. It seems much more likely that there exists a set of people suitable as mates for any given vampire, and they form a mate bond when they meet one of them.
