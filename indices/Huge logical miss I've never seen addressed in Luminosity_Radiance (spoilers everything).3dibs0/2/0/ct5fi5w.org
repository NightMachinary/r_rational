I understand that, the issues here are that:

- The turned is magically guaranteed to love the partner, and given enough time guaranteed to love or at least like being a vampire (we only had two examples of vampires who hated being such, afaik, one was Carlisle who hated it on moral grounds but then accepted it when he discovered he could survive on animals, and the second is the Italian guy who was killed by Aro as a newborn so barely had time to experience the advantages of being a Vampire).

- Not turning the Mate makes a member of the Vampire species useless and potentially hostile, disrupting the stability of the vampire social strata itself, all to guarantee a (meaningless) choice to a member of the inferior species.
