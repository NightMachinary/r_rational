While Bella is a rational agent, I think its a stretch to say all or even any of her enemies fell into the same boat. I haven't read Luminosity in a while so bear with me, but it would seem to me that the Vulturi thought along the lines of...say...far right republicans. "We eat humans because that's what we do." The argument for eating humans seems to stem largely from instinct on the part of vampires, or tradition on their part. They eat humans because that's the way things have always been, and it seems to work well enough for them, that why try to break what clearly works? Its like the whole "marriage is between a man and a woman because that's the way it is." They make no attempt to critically or rationally address their point of view because they don't feel the need to. Animal blood was so 'obviously' inferior to them that there's no real reason for them to consider it.

Its definitely a bit of arguing by definitions instead of by sense "Vampires eat humans because that's what vampires do." Their definition of vampire includes eating humans, they don't need to argue why they eat humans, they just do. Its "Just the way things are". This is of course some fallacious logic on their part, but why bother being logical when you can just kill whoever disagrees with you? Not to invoke godwin or anything, but I doubt Hitler had a deep and logically reasoned out explanation for killing all jews that would actually give pause to a serious rationalist. Bella is able to outwit her opponents specifically because she employs rationality while the other side relies on brute force and intimidation.
