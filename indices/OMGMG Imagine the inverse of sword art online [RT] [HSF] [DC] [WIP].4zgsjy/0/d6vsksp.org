I thought Log Horizon was the inverse of Sword Art Online. Instead of being trapped in a videogame where death is real, they're trapped in a real world where they respawn. Instead of the main character going it alone, the main character is a support class and works with others. Instead of making up how videogames work, you can practically learn how to play an MMORPG from watching it.
