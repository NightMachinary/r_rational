I really like the concept. And the initial few comics you made.

You've got a really good idea going here. There is a lot of interesting conflicts and stories that can come up between monsters vs humans.

But I went back and read the old story that this is based on, and I was not impressed.

Please, please, stop masturbating about monster girls, and genderbending, and porn. You've got a cool potential story here. No need to mess it up with the same mistake that every other internet fan fiction writer makes. Which is to needlessly fill it with their fantasies, and slash pairings.

Romance and exploring these concepts can have a place in a story, as long as it is there to SUPPORT the story. But making romance, and fantasy fullfillment the FOCUS of the comic, where it is mentioned every other page..... Please don't mess up your cool story like that.

Edit: Or perhaps I misjudged the old comic. I guess what bothered me the most about it was that it was so extremely slow, and spent a bunch of time on things like the dress-up scene, musical numbers, this wierdo Gecko hug attempts, and NOT on the interesting story. And I was sitting on the edge of my seat waiting, for SOMETHING to happen, and because it was so slow, all I saw was a 50 year continuing to masturbate about being a demon girl.
