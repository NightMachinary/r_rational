A videogame/mmo is injected into the real world.

Instead of it being heroes it's monsters/mobs. Who are forced to obey software handicaps on some pretty obscenely cutting edge tech built into their bodies that emulate game mechanics.

The monsters/mobs are actually people and/or contain memories of people.

society deals with this in all its varied ways.
