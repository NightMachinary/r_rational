Could you please start using JPG instead of PNG? The latter one is supposed to be used with [[http://images.sixrevisions.com/2010/12/01-04_jpg_vs_png_gif.jpg][solid colors and clear lines]]. It's good for logos and simple comics with lots of text (like [[http://i.imgur.com/ZvS1lUs.jpg][XKCD]]), but text smudging is not a problem with your size of picture, and PNG makes it [[https://alhomaizidesign.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/jpeg-n-png-123-photo.jpg][obscenely heavy]] at 1+ MB per page.
