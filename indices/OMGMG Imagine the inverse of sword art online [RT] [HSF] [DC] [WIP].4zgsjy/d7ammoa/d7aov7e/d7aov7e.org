The pacing problem was the main one I identified and I'm working on it.

On the other points it's a tricky thing to try and write satire bout a thing without ending up BEING the thing you are trying to deconstruct. That ultimately is why I abandoned the last one, things did not happen with a good pace, characters were handled badly and the focus was all over the place.

Some of that was a result of the format but as the author it also was my fault, hence the re-write.

I'm trying to get two pages out today by the way but got hit with a bit of a wammy of a sickness and it's been throwing my brain off.
