She seems deep in her temporarily embarrassed +millionaire+ Guardian complex. She identifies more with the elite than with the people in similar circumstances to her, and is holding on to that in spite of all the evidence that everything she knew about Paragon is basically lies.

It's complicated a bit by the fact that she /is/ a projector, but I kinda doubt that, even if she continues along this path (and doesn't die in the process), the story is ever going to vindicate her idea of a special destiny. At least not in the way she wants. It does a good job of emphasizing how messed up her thinking is without ever spelling it out too deliberately.
