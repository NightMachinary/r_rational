She also uses her legitimate problem (dying for a new body) to justify a bunch of rally horrible actions. She's not as evil as the terrorists, but she's willing to ruin other people's lives and support Lorde, a truly reprehensible person and probably the only person we've met who takes pleasure in others suffering.
