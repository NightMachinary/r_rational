That's honestly my favorite part of the serial right now. I like how we're repeatedly shown the jarring disconnect between Ana's life and her views on society. For example, Ana's need for a new body is an all consuming drive right now, and the speaker at the Commonplace rally in this chapter says /this/:

#+begin_quote
  “The median projector in the Principality has a net worth of two hundred and fourteen times that of the median Humdrum. They own an average of four bodies apiece, while we get cancer at their factories and go into debt for our replacement bodies. If we're lucky enough to get a loan.”
#+end_quote

And what's Ana's response?

#+begin_quote
  /The rhetoric of victimhood and vengeance./ They listed legitimate problems, then used them to justify an incoherent wave of violence and resentment.

  We'd barely won the largest war in human history. We'd defeated the Shenti by the narrowest margin, and these people wanted to eviscerate the heroes who'd protected us. That wasn't the right way to do things.
#+end_quote

Like, holy fuck, that disconnect. "My poverty is literally killing me. What?! How dare you point out the severe inequality in our society! Every single one of our wealthy overlords is a war hero who deserves three spare bodies!" It's especially jarring considering how much she suffered at Clementine's hands.

Thankfully, she seems to be making some progress, if rather slowly. Her thoughts towards the end of the chapter about Clementine and the boy she killed are a small step in the right direction, for example.
