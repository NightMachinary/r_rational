I really love this. Definitely had to check twice to make sure it wasn't by wildbow (on one of his better days). The dysphoria is believable without overwhelming the rest of the horror.

I did have a number of questions, which I guess might be answered later. The heart of my confusion is: How prevalent are vocations (that is, ability to use magic powers)? Like, back when the Guardians were secret, would Clementine have necessarily been accepted into Hogwarts, just to keep the secret? Or killed?

Is it genetic? If so, shouldn't it have evolved to fixation already? If not, how do we have Guardian families without having "squibs" (who, given how cutthroat Guardian society is, would have no reason to keep the secret)?

I'm also confused about how a secret was kept across nations given the usefulness of vocations in war.

But I'm willing to suspend my disbelief and mostly just enjoy the story.
