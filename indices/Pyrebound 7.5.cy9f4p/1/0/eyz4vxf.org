The world at large is, for human purposes, mostly the Dominion. We just saw our second pyre, and number three is coming up--though as the plot unfolds, things might start moving a bit more quickly and in unexpected directions, and I'm somewhat limited by the intimacy of Ram's perspective. What were you hoping to see more of, specifically? The other races, or what? I've already substantially modified the story in response to one reader request; this thing is far from fixed in stone.
