Thank you for reading!

See, I was digging through Wiki's list of subgenres and guessing it was high fantasy based on their criteria of "our world with magic stuff intruding" for low and "completely different world where magic stuff is normal" for high. Oh well, the vagueness of the criteria probably means not many people think about this for purposes other than arguing on the internet anyhow.
