I think this story falls into grimdark, IMO. Just using the definitions above, it's definitely dark and seemingly grim. We'll still early in the story (at least IMO), so maybe Ram will be able to make some big changes for the better, but I'm somewhat doubtful of that happening.

That said, I'd agree about not labeling it as such. Grimdark definitely has negative connotations. I probably wouldn't have started reading if it'd been labeled as grimdark, and I'm quite enjoying it.
