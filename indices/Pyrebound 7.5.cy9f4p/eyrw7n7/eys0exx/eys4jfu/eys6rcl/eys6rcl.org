I wouldn't describe either GoT or your story as grimdark, so the definition is even more vague than you're thinking. I'd generally describe something as grimdark if it never moves out of black and dark grey morality. If there are any actually good-hearted, kind people (who aren't immediately killed to laugh at how foolish they are) then I don't think something qualifies.

I'd caution against labeling your story as grimdark whether or not it fits a looser definition than I have. I would generally go into a story that labels itself grimdark with pretty low expectations if I even bother at all, and I'm pretty sure I'm not alone on that.
