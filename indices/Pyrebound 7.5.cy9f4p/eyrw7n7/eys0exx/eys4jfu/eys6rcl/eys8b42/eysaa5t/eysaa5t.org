The difference, in my mind at least, is that while characters in asoiaf aren't usually rewarded for their goodness, the narrative still depicts them as admirable and noble. It's realistic that bad things often happen to good people in a place like westeros, and that's sad. A grimdark story would be one where the narrative depicts any person trying to do good as a naive fool deserving nothing but scorn and mockery from the reader. At its core, in my mind, grimdark is an author saying that niceness is stupid and trying to do good has no value. Ned Stark is naive, yes, but we still admire him for his ideals and his honor even as we wish he had compromised them for his own sake.

I would probably classify pyrebound as low fantasy (gritty and realistic), and as swords and sandals (set in antiquity.) Fantasy subgenres are fairly vague, I feel like.

I liked the latest chapter, by the way. Thanks for writing :)
