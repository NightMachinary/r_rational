Huh. I'd say ASoIaF goes out of its way to punish altruistic people, so I'd say it would fit your definition, more or less. But I have run into people talking about grimdark like it referred to things more along the lines of HP Lovecraft, hence my hesitation.

I just wonder where to shelve this thing for marketing purposes. Is there a subgenre I can call it as a shorthand? "Dark fantasy" is a thing, but doesn't seem to fit either.
