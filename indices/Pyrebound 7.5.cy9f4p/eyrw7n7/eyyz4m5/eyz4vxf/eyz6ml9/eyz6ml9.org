I love the intimacy of Ram's perspective. I don't think you should change that up in-story. I would just love to know more about the history of politics, religion, and warfare in the dominion and beyond.

MoL's author does these worldbuilding-only posts, removed from the main story. I'm not saying you should necessarily copy him or her, but it is one way to convey information to the reader without messing with the story.
