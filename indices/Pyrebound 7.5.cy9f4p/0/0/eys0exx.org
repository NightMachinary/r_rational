I would say it could fall into the category of grimdark, yea. The term comes from an way to describe the feel of a story via a coordinate plane. On one access, you have how "bad" the world is, on a scale from dark to bright. Dark means the world is, well, a pretty awful place. Things suck. Bright is more like a fairy tale; things just work out nicely for everyone. Your world definitely falls on the dark side of things.

The other axis is how much power your characters have to influence the world and events surrounding them, on a scale of grim to noble. Grim means they are acted upon more than actors, and while they obviously can make decisions those decisions are unlikely to have an significant, lasting impact without a LOT of effort, if it's even possible. Noble means that your characters have the ability to make drastic changes to the world around them, improving it as the results of their actions. So far, you seem to be on the grim side as well although we'll see what happens when the characters aren't starting from a place of total and complete ignorance.

So yeah, so far I would classify your story as grim dark.
