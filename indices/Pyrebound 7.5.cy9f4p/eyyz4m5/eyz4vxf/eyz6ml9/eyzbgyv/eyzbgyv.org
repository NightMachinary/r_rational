You'll be learning a good bit about at least the first two, though it might be a while, as the story progresses. There's not a big difference between religion and politics here, and warfare I suppose ties in as well. The plan is to write appendices for the print edition I'll be publishing when it all wraps up. One doing an overview of the Dominion, and one on the Five Peoples of Ki. Maybe others, depending how much stuff I have leftover when the story's told. The print edition being a sort of alternative to setting up a Patreon, which I feel weird about.
