You're confusing slow, deliberative thinking with rationality. Rationality isn't how long you take to think nor how careful you are about it. Rationality means thinking in ways that are effective at forming accurate beliefs and achieving your values. If you value sex, social status and social inclusion, then it is not irrational to think about those things. You just need to be honest with yourself about why you want those things. Rationality isn't for determining what your values are, just for making sure they are consistent with themselves.

Your neocortex and limbic system are BOTH very important parts of you. Without your limbic system you wouldn't feel emotions and you would have to control body functions like your heartbeat /consciously/. So if you didn't have your limbic system, the moment you would stop paying attention to your heartbeat and breathing, you would stop breathing and your heart would stop. Also without your limbic system you wouldn't care about anything anyway because you wouldn't have emotions.
