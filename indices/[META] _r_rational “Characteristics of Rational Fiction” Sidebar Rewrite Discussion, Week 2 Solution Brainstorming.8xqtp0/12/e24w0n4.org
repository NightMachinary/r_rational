A week may or may not be long enough.  The previous two threads have petered out after just a few days, although that could easily be because people were waiting for /this/ thread to start contributing.  

Potential options from this point: leave this thread up a week, leave it up for two weeks, replace it with a “part two” next week to continue the discussion afresh.

If you have opinions on this, please reply to this post.
