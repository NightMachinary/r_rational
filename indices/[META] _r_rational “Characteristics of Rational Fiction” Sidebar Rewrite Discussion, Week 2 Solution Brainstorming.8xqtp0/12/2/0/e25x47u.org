  Is there any downside to leaving this up for two weeks or longer to maximize the number of contributions? Why rush things?
#+end_quote

Loss of momentum, possibly (if we've picked any up; it's hard to tell).

I don't know if assigning people to review would work; I wouldn't say no to volunteers jumping in, but I'm the only one actually running this particular show so there's no one else to assign.

  It would be a shame if a great idea in this thread died in the next because the original author didn't follow up.
#+end_quote

I intend to announce that people feel free to repost their favorites in that thread so long as they link to the original author. That way a popular yet neglected option doesn't get left out.
