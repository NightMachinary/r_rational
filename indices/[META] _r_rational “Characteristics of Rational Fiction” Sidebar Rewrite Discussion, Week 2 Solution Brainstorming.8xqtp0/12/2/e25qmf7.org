Is there any downside to leaving this up for two weeks or longer to maximize the number of contributions? Why rush things?

A suggestion for part 3 of the discussion: specifically assign people to read over this thread and ensure that the best ideas in it are included in at least some of the part 3 proposals. Or request that certain people who responded to this thread also respond to part 3. It would be a shame if a great idea in this thread died in the next because the original author didn't follow up.
