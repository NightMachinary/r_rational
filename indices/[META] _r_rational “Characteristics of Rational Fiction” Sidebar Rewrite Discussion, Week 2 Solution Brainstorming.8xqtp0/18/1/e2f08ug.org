I think this goes more towards my definition of "rationalist" fiction, though obviously rational characters would use some scientific thinking in their day-to-day life and problem solving.

"Smart tends to beat Virtuous" IMHO is more of a consequence of setting up the universe with logical rules and sticking to them. If the universe you built does not care for morality (not all have to be like this! You could have a universe with an actual God who actively punishes evil), then sure, smart will probably win over not-so-well-thought-out, regardless of the moral motivations behind the latter.
