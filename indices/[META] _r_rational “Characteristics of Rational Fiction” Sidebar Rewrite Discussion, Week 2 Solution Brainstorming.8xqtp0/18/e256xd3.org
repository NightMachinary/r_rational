IMO the essential qualities to rational fiction are:

The story does not take a stand against the principle that the world is knowable and that it is possible to learn how things work through experimentation, and preferably takes a stand in favor the usefulness of testing assumptions, trying ideas to see what happens, and generally doing science.

The story should generally show it's work, in the sense that the reader should be able to see (at least in retrospect, possibly with the aid of a more attentive reader pointing out something they forgot) how the characters came up with their ideas rather than falling back on interchangeable tech/magic-babble that doesn't comunicate any information abut how/why they expect it to work (reverse the polarity of the neutron flow, to overload the energy being like an overfilled ballon!), or relying on deductions that are indistinguishable from guesses that juts happen to be right.

Non essential but also important:

Smart tends to beat Virtuous. That is when a character does something just because it's the right (or in the case of villanous protagonists evil) thing to do without also having a plan, or doing it because it's has a high chance of success, rational fiction is more likely to have that choice turn out bad compared to fiction in general.
