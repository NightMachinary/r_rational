I disagree. Say that you could control anybody by saying 'jeronimoe' but it only worked on Tuesdays and only if you had gotten at least 8 hours of sleep and were wearing blue clothing. If a protagonist used this rule, regardless of it's consistency with the established ruleset, to solve a problem and the reader didn't know about it earlier I wouldn't call it rational. Having consistent rules and bringing those to the awareness of the reader are two different things.\\
It's arbitrary sure but only about as arbitrary as the dungeon opening in the Daily Grind.
