I think that it needs to be said, though as far as I can see it has not yet: the thing that we talk about when we use the words "rational fiction" is category that is not adequately classified by a single word in English.

That is to say, it is not a genre or a technical term. Rather, "rational fiction" is a category that includes a genre, stories that fulfill a technical definition, and an artistic movement that is defined by themes and techniques that are endemic to our community.

To re-iterate: Saying "BOOK is a rational fiction" is equivalent to saying R(b), where "R(b)" is an extended OR statement with each term being an extremely complex compound statement. We cannot get away with saying "it's a genre where at least n of the following conditions are met [insert remarkably short list of specific points]". Of course, giving that as a sufficient but not necessary condition of a rational fiction is fine, so long as there is a stipulation that meeting few or no requirements does not disqualify any particular story (keep in mind HPMoR had a wildly irrational magic system).

So we need a definition that is more inclusive than exclusive. I know it runs counter to the sensibilities of this subreddit as a whole, but any exclusions should probably be more (both in terms of mechanism used and language to express) of a gut feeling than as a list of disqualifiers. I say this because artistic movements (like the one we are currently discussing) are essentially a natural progression of a culture in an artistic fugue state. They are a mess, and when the culture starts eating itself over what to include and disclude, the movement can stagnate and halt, usually becoming toxic along the way. I don't want that to happen; we need to grow more if we are to have an impact.

So I don't think we should restrict what is rational fiction too much, if we want our community to grow and our movement to have some effect on the world. That's half the reason we're here, right?

We should classify rational fiction as what it is: an art movement defined loosely by our community, and a genre that is defined by works in that movement. A rough draft:

#+begin_quote
  Rational fiction is an artistic movement in literature where stories generally touch upon themes of philosophy revolving around epistemology, utilitarian ethics, realism, solipsism, humanism, transhumanism, atheism , agnosticism, and others that are usually held by individuals with a worldview that also includes several of those. Further, the story is typically driven by characters rather than a plot, and the actions, motivations, and thought processes of those characters are typically in line with what is expected of a character that has the degree of intelligence that character is portrayed as having by others of that degree of intelligence. Works with these themes and literary devices are conventionally grandfathered in to the "rational fiction" category, when they predate the movement.
