Maybe my example isn't the best, but HPMOR does go into the rules of the world in a way central to the story - the biggest example being transfiguration magic. Some fairly specific rules are laid out governing how transfiguration magic works, the implications of those rules such as transfiguration sickness, and the implications of breaking those rules with the philosopher's stone.

To go back to the airship example, a rationalist story with airships might mention the existence of a nonvolatile gas that can be used for more lift than any in real life, and if that gas would have other uses relevant to the story they would be explored as well.
