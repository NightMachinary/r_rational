What are some potential frameworks we can use?

Do we do a point-buy system? "Here are ten bullets worth 5-20 points each, if it scores more than 60 it will probably fit here."

A tiered bullet point list? "Rational Fiction fulfills both of these points, at least 2/4 of these points, and at least 6 of these 10 points".

A few different labels with different bullet point lists? "this is what qualifies as RST, this is an RT, this is an 'adjacent' fic, etc". If so, what labels do we use?

An unbounded list of bullet points like we have now?

A prose paragraph?

A mix of any or all of these?
