  I noticed another possible problem with this definition anyways: *Mystery/detective stories*. Do they give off intellectual payoffs? Do we count them as rational? From my biased POV, I could argue that detective stories give more of a "confusion unravelling" feeling than "that's smart".

I think your definition works pretty well.

Cozy mysteries, like "the cat who ..." series, don't feel especially rational. But the author isn't spending their time setting up a complex reveal. They're building a really pleasant town.

Hard boiled detective stories could have a 'clever' bit at the end, where everything is revealed. But the bulk of the pages are spent on the characters physical tribulations.

Sherlock Holmes is kind of a toss up depending on how you read the authors intent.

Maybe Doyle was trying to write a fair play mystery. Then "tries to be a rational mystery, but bad" fits. The books would have been great if his clues had been better.

Or Doyle could have been writing about a superhero with the power of 'always right'. Then that's just some other genre
