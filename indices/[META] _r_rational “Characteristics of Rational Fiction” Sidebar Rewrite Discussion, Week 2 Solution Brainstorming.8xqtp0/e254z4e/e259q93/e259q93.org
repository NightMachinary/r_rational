I heavily like this line of thought. Even if we don't use the suggestion verbatim, the direction is one I support.

It gives the breathing room to not be a simple checkbox and lines up with my own discussion last week about each person having their own personal measurement of rational fiction (the 80% rational fiction idea: where one person can allow some mishaps in the story but still consider it rational because of other focuses).
