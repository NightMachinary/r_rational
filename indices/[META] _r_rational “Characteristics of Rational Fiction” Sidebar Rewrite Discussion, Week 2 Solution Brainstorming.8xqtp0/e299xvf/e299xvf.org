The genre of comedy is not defined by the characters necessarily being comedians, or necessarily making jokes at each other, it's defined by what the author is attempting to do, namely elicit laughter from the readership.

Any definition that contains how the /characters/ are supposed to act or be like, seems to me far too restrictive and missing the point. Every single character could be an idiot, and the story could still be in the rational genre.

A description of the rational genre, would seem to me about what the author attempts to do, the attitude they're putting into the story, what the readership is seeking to find in the story.

To me these are the two important qualities, as I've written before:

- The author displays respect for the value of intelligence, reason, forethought, and preparation.

- The author attempts to explore the moral and material implications and consequences of the elements in the story, and to investigate alternate solutions to presented problems, even if they violate the usual conventions of the genre.

In my earlier suggestion for a rewrite I previously had a third bullet (About how the author doesn't use 'narrativium'. The characters should not rely on events happening as they would happen in a story, unless there's explicitly a force conspiring to make them happen this way. (Any usage of destiny, divine providence, miracles, willpower-produced powerups, etc, must be justified in-story or not used at all.))

But I think even that becomes overly specific, and it actually follows from the two bullets above. The /consistent/ world without arbitrary plot contrivances, is a necessary background in order to showcase the value of intelligence/preparation/etc, and also a necessity in order to truly meaningfully explore consequences.

Talking about lack of narrativium too much makes it seems as if the author can't have their story sometimes have plot-convenient things happen. I feel they can.
