Rational fiction rewards [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/B7P97C27rvHPz3s9B/gears-in-understanding][gears]]-seeking.

By gears-seeking, I mean a stance to reading which is essentially the opposite of suspension of disbelief.

Suspension of disbelief involves accepting something as a brute fact, not trying to understand how it fits into a broader framework, not asking why, and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8w95xIdH4o&t=26s][not dwelling on it]] (as that would interfere with enjoying the story). A gears-seeking reader is doing the opposite of this: looking for the underlying processes behind what's happening, taking each thing that happens as [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wyyfFfaRar2jEdeQK/entangled-truths-contagious-lies][deeply entangled]] with the rest of the world, and being curious about the nature of the coherent world in which these events are taking place. They are letting their world-modeling skills loose on this fictional world.

One place to see obvious symptoms of this approach is with fictional worlds that fall apart when modeled. Gears-seeking readers will notice plot holes, idiot balls, and similar, including deep flaws as well as nitpicks. Sometimes this leads to attempts to rationalize/retcon the world by devising their own set of underlying processes in which events much like the ones in the original story do fit together coherently. Rational fiction which is intended for gears-seeking readers typically strives for internal consistency, where the world runs on systematic "laws of physics" (even if they involve "magic"), the characters do things which make sense to them at the time, and the society is what you'd get from a whole bunch of these beings with their physics and technologies.

But internal consistency is not enough; rational fiction also *rewards* gears-seeking. The story is written so that gears-seeking leads to deeper understanding and appreciation of the story. For example, often a character's success depends on figuring out more about how the world works and scheming about how they can use these raw materials to accomplish what they want. If the story provides the reader with enough information about the world, then the story is calling on them to join in on seeking gears and scheming. (One of the main ways that a story fails to be "rational" is by not giving the reader enough information to seek gears; instead it's just one thing after another. The author may have a coherent world in mind, but the reader can't see enough of it to let their mind loose on the world.)

This is a main reason why rational fiction is often set in a magical world and alien society. Internally consistent realistic stories can just use the actual world as background; they [[http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/earthfic.shtml][don't require world-modeling]] from the author or the reader. Whereas an internally consistent fantasy world can easily call forth efforts to understand the gears behind the laws of magic, how the society ended up as it did, and what awesome opportunities might exist for a person in that world.
