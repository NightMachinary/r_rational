I agree that intellectual pay-off is an important part of rational fiction; in my terminology, it would likely be an "important trope" woven into the sidebar definition.

However, I think that basing the entire definition on it would lead to some of the problems that the current definition causes. It's underspecified, for one.

Sure, consistency helps maintain SoD, which ensures that the reader stays engaged, which makes intellectual pay-off larger. However, relatable characters would also increase engagement, which would also increase the pay-off. Exciting action sequences? Discussion of pressing issues? Realistic portrayal of everyday activities? It all fits, if done well.

If we define rational fiction as fiction that tries to maximize intellectual pay-off, we risk being overwhelmed by fiction that maximizes its /pay-off/ period, be that pay-off intellectual, emotional, or some other. It's not only "good fiction", just "engaging fiction".

We could try to somehow specify that the maximization has to go towards the "intellectual" part, but I'm not sure how exactly to do this, and I'm not sure if it would solve all issues.
