If it could work, I'd be very interested in seeing how it is done. The problem is that detective mysteries of these sorts are a kind of race between the detective and the audience to see who can solve the mystery first. If the audience has access to the detective's line of reasoning the whole way through, then there's no big reveal at the end.
