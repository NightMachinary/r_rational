How would you feel that after the two bullets describing the intent, we had some additional bullets, indicating the elements most often used for that purpose? E.g.

--------------

In rational fiction:

- The author displays respect for the value of intelligence, reason, forethought, and preparation.\\
- The author attempts to explore the moral and material implications and consequences of the elements in the story, and to investigate alternate solutions to presented problems, even if they violate the usual conventions of the genre.\\

For the above purposes, rational fiction often contains:

- Consistent worldbuilding. In preexisting settings (like fanfiction) the author seeks to remove or justify seeming incongruencies.
- Intelligent characters that seek to understand their world, and to competently pursue their goals in accordance with their value systems.
- A focus on the thought-processes of the characters as they pursue said goals.
- Themes and topics that relate to the extensive exploration of solution-space, e.g. metaethics, effective altruism, munchkinism, transhumanism.
