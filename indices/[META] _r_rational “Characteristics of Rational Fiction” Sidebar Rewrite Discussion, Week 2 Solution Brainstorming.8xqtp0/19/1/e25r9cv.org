I suggest a small number of criteria, such as the Three C's I talked about in my post. Under each criterion should be specific examples of how it might be implemented in a story, designed to give people a sense of what to look for without limiting them to the listed examples. In addition to the criteria, there should be a short rule for qualitative evaluation, such as "Rational fiction should conform to at least two criteria, or very strongly to one; rationalist fiction conforms to all three; rational-adjacent fiction recognizes but consciously subverts these criteria," etc.
