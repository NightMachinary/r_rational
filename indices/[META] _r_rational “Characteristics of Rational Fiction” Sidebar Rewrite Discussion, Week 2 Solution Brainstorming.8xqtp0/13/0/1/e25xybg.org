Stories must be solvable, as in predicting what the main character can do at a given time? That I can agree with, tho as far as the general case goes, it's impossible to know what you don't know you don't know, so not all twists can be anticipated, which tarnishes the wording of 'solving the story' in my eyes a bit.
