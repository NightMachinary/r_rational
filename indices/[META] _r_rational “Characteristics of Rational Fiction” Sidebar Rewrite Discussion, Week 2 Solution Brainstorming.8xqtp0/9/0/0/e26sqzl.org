I agree with this. However, I'm heavily leaning toward subsuming "conservation" under "consistency." Conservation seems to be a consequence of standard conservation of detail (Chekhov's gun) applied to consistency as defined above. I'm trying to find absolute minimal criteria which generate the standard rationalist tropes when fleshed out. Three is a nice number; if we yield to the temptation to add one more relevant thing, soon we'll have a useless list of twenty bullet points.
