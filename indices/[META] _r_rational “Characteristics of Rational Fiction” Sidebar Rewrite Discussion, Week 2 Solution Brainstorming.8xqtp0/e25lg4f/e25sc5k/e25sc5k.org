I think the definition for conservation should go more like this:

*Conservation:* All details important to the narrative must either be mentioned or hinted at in the story significantly before they become relevant. They must also be logical extensions of other details present in the story.

I think the requirement to put it early-on in-story is a bit too restrictive and prevent effective world-building. As long as the details of a story one after the other, I think it should be fine.
