  They don't hold Idiot Balls, don't conveniently "forget" about things, don't get angry for no reason, and so on.

I feel that Harry in HPMOR held a pretty big Idiot Ball in regards to his mysterious connection to Quirrel. Would that disqualify HPMOR from being in the rational genre, even though it's what started it all?

This sort of thing feels to me not only highly subjective (what's an Idiot Ball for one reader may be an understandable flaw for another reader or the author) but also referring to the quality of the work rather than its genre. I feel that particular idiot ball of Harry to be a /flaw/ in the story, but I don't feel it moves it outside the rational genre at all. Because the quality of the story and its membership in the rational genre are two separate things.
