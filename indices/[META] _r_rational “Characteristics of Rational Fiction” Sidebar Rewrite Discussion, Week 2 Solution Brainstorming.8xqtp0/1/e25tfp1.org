I propose to divide our "definition" in two.

- The actual definition, which encompasses our preferences for rational characters, true moral conflicts, and consistent worlds, and defines "rationalist fiction" as a subset of rational fiction.

- A collection of unrelated tropes we came to collectively enjoy, which are nonetheless important.

*** Definition
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: definition
    :END:
*Rational fiction* is fiction that features people who [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent][honestly]] try to achieve their goals, as successfully as they could given their intelligence, motivations, and resources. *The important part* is that they do not act as plot demands. They don't hold Idiot Balls, don't conveniently "forget" about things, don't get angry for no reason, and so on.

It's a continuum, and could vary in "depth" and "breadth".

*"Depth"* is how well a given character exemplifies the virtues of rationality, how well they pursue their goals.

1. Rational fiction could have stupid or irrational characters, as long as their beliefs are realistic (i. e., something a real person could believe in, not a strawman) and they continue to honestly pursue them, with no out-of-character behaviour.

   This also leads to *realistic motivations/morals*.

2. Smart people exemplify rationality better, however. A competent protagonist or a team of main characters using their intelligence to solve their problems is a classic example of rational fiction.

3. When a character tries to become /more/ rational, i. e. to /improve their ability to achieve their goals/, we get *rationalist fiction*.

*"Breadth"* reflects the number of /levels of the narrative/ that are rational.

1. Only the protagonist is rational, or only some of the main characters.

2. All or the majority of plot-relevant characters are rational. (The protagonist, the antagonist, the minions, the allies, and so on.)

3. The background characters are rational. This is a more complicated one: it leads to *consistent worldbuilding*.

   Worlds usually have history, and history has people (or other goal-driven agents). Did these people honestly try to pursue their goals? If yes, they should have a) noticed many inconsistencies in how reality behaves, if there are any inconsistencies, b) picked up all low-hanging fruits of munchkinry, c) created a realistic status quo.

   If no inconsistencies in the world's rules are known, and all background characters (or "optimization forces"?) were modeled honestly, that means there's no inconsistencies. If low-hanging fruits start appearing as the story's plot moves along, characters should notice how strange it is that this has never happened before, and react accordingly. And if the story's civilization would've collapsed on itself if it was made up of real people, that means background people aren't modeled as real people.

"Rationality" of a work would be something like =depth x breadth=, i. e. how many levels of the story are modeled as having people of which levels of sensibility.

Let's test it. Consider these story ideas:

1. In a consistently-built cyberpunk world, a detective attempts to catch a competent serial killer. (Depth 2, Breadth 3.)

2. A group of characters are dropped into a strange world. It's riddled with inconsistencies: physical laws are broken seemingly at random, magic refuses to be comprehended, economy is unsustainable but sustains anyway... and yet none of the natives notice anything amiss. Our main characters attempt to figure out what's going on, using science and methods of rationality. (Depth 3, Breadth 1.)

3. A simple story set in our world, about a young, not especially gifted child learning math. (Depth 1, Breadth 3.)

4. A story set in a low-fantasy world, about savvy heroes attempting to bring down a similarly savvy evil overlord. The evil overlord is cartoonishly evil, because he honestly /enjoys/ this for complex personal reasons. Economy doesn't make sense, but it's not really very plot-relevant. (Depth 2, Breadth 2.)

5. Same as 4, except the antagonist isn't human, it's an evil-maximizing AI. (Depth 2, Breadth 2.)

6. Same as 4, except only the protagonist is rational, and the overlord's cartoonish evil isn't explained. (Depth 2, Breadth 1.)

7. Same as 6, except the protagonist isn't rational. (Depth 1, Breadth 1.)

(I'm not proposing to use this =Depth x Breadth= equation seriously, by the way, it's just for demonstration.)

*** Tropes
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: tropes
    :END:
/Separately/ from the definition, we also have preferences for certain tropes. Such as:

- Munchkinry.

- Genre-savviness.

- Deconstructions, i. e. re-imaginings of settings or plot points in a more realistic manner.

- Hard Science-Fiction.

- Fair-Play Whodunnit (solvable-by-the-reader).

- Good writing with regards to Deus Ex Machinas, i. e. absence of them.

- In-depth exploration of the world.

This list is incomplete, and, as I stated, these tropes aren't /inherently/ related to the definition of rational fiction; they're just something we as a community came to like, because of where we come from, what genres the most high-quality rational stories occupy, what tropes are most convenient for showing off rational behaviour, and so on.

They could move a low-rationality story (e. g., my sixth example) up to something we would enjoy. Some of them are *very important* to us, such as Fair-Play Whodunnit and No-Deus-Ex-Machinas. Some are less important, such as HSF.
