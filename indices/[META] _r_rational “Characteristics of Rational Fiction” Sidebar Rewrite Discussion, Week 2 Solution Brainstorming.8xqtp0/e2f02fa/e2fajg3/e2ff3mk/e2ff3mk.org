  a story qualifies as scifi or fantasy by having specific world building elements, even if it doesn't focus on them at all

Not necessarily. See the endless "is Star Wars sci-fi?" debate, with some people arguing that it's /really/ a fantasy set in space, based on tropes and genre conventions. Personally I belong more to this camp. Just having space or advanced technology alone does not sci-fi make. Obviously all of this stuff is blurry anyway, there are no sharp boundaries between genres.

I'd say definitions about goals and focus concern what I call the "need" of the story. If I want to talk about technology and a self-consistent world, in theory it'd be obvious this needs to possess a certain level of rationality. Rational fiction stresses that aspect and focuses on actually trying to get it right.
