I'm a strong proponent for the idea of a 'spectrum', the fact that rationality isn't a binary property of a story but a dial that can move continuously from 0 to 1. At its minimum, 'rationality' simply means a form of good writing, i.e. avoiding some of the trappings of plot convenience that are very common in some narrative fiction.

However, if we limited ourselves to a definition like "a rational story is one where the setting follows clear rules and all characters act like human beings with an internal train of thought and consistent desires and motivations", we could get to the rather weird conclusion where, for example, Ernest Hemingway's "The Old Man and the Sea" is rational fiction. It has clear, consistent rules (the ones of reality) and it has a single human character with very understandable motivations. Yet I think most of us would feel that, however good that novel is, it doesn't seem like it's what we would call "rational". It's a story where holding to those rules doesn't even pose a specific challenge, and where the motivations are understandable, sure, but also simple, and believably so. However its main purpose isn't to focus on any of that, but to serve as a metaphor of the harsh relationship between man and nature.

I wouldn't want to push it as far as to say that only sci-fi or fantasy fiction can be "rational", of course, that'd be /way/ too restrictive, but the general point I'm trying to make is that we usually seem to intend "rationality" as something that pairs with plot-driven and world-building heavy kinds of stories, aka the ones where the temptation to just slip in one or two plot contrivances to move your goal along is strong, and where suspension of disbelief is both fragile and critical.

So I guess that I'd like to see something like "rationality isn't a genre, rationality is a quality" on the sidebar as the head declaration of intent. We can then clarify how there are works that /need/ this quality more to achieve their intended purpose, and how we tend to be more interested in works that both need and /possess/ it. Hemingway's novel would be an example of one that possesses it despite not really needing it (he could have made the same point with a surreal or supernatural parable, he chose realism instead). "Alice in Wonderland" or all of magical realism are examples of stories that neither need it nor possess it. A movie like, say, the recent "Life" is the example of a story that needed it, but didn't possess it.
