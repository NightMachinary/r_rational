Rather than “the world has consistent rules,” I think the rules being /explained/ is a big part of rational fiction. You can write a good, internally consistent story without needing to actually explain the rules the world operates on to the reader, but a big part of how people engage with rational fiction is speculation based on those rules.

To give an example, a fictional world where airships are a common method of transportation doesn't need to explain /why/ they're more common in this world than they are in real life to be consistent, it just needs to ensure characters consistently make use of them when you'd expect them to. A rational story would in addition to that explain /why/ airships are a common form of transportation and the effects that difference has on other parts of the world.
