I made a similar example below with Hemingway. Other interesting idea: if you add "an evil almost invincible white whale roams the seas" to the rules of our world, "Moby Dick" /totally/ fits the bill of rational fiction up to the part where it launches in long digressions about the very consistent mechanics of all that is happening.

The solution I suggested is to distinguish between two axes, how much a story /possesses/ rationality, and how much it /needs/ it. Romeo and Juliet in a way certainly possesses it - if we account for the absolutely realistic detail of two teenagers in love being the stupidest creatures in the Universe - but it didn't intrinsically need to. It just happens to. I'd argue there are certain types of story that need more to be rational, and that stick out more when they don't, and often directly lose in quality because of this lack.
