Hrm.

Okay, imagine a story where two houses, both alike in dignity -- well, fine, imagine /Romeo and Juliet/. Pretty classically not what anyone would think of using the RT tag on, unless they're being completely contrarian.

In this new story, the plot follows /Romeo and Juliet/ without deviating at all. The dialogue is all the same, the actions the characters take are the same, etc. /However/, interspersed with the actual plot of the story, there are a handful of long digressions into:

- trade along the Adige
- the principle holdings of the various houses
- the business considerations of an alchemist making a sleeping draught
- the mechanisms of such a draught, and the procedures that were followed in determining when and how a person had died
- the legal problems that an apothecary might face for selling a fast-acting poison, as well as a secondary digression on the role of the guilds in forming law

Now, would that story be more of what we mean by RT? I suppose I would argue that it would ... but the RT stuff is only the stuff that we added, and we haven't really "infected" the main plot of the story all that much, so maybe the background to the story is RT, but the story itself is not? After all, the bits of exposition we've added haven't given us /any/ predictive power as far as the actual story goes, because they haven't touched the story.

Don't we need characters interacting with those rules in some way, or at least aware of them so that can inform the plot and characterization?
