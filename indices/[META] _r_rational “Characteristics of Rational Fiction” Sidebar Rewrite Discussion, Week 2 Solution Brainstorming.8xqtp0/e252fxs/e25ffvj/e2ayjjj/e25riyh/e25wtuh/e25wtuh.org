"Show, don't tell" still applies, though, I think.

To be /simulationist/, IMHO, a story† must simply /demonstrate/ the implications of rule "in action" well-enough that the reader understands the rule, appreciates its edge-cases, and can predict how further interactions with the rule will go.

A /rational story/, then, is a simulationist story under the above definition, where, additionally, there are at least some characters ("rational characters") who are---or who become---as aware of the (important) rules and their implications / edge-cases / interactions as the reader is.

Let's talk about cringe humour. Cringe humour is humour generated from set-ups where the audience is aware of a (social) rule, that a character is not. The character not only violates the rule, but continues to violate the rule, because they have low "awareness of the need to update"---i.e. they are not very good at noticing when there is a rule in play which is affecting them, which they are not yet aware of.

A rational /character/ is a character who is immune to being the subject of cringe-humour. They can still violate the rule initially, but they'll never /continue/ to violate a rule, because---as long as they're "at their best"---they'll always be aware of any new rule, and quickly begin attempting to figure out what it is. Whether they immediately /succeed/ in deducing the rule is somewhat irrelevant---as long as they're trying, it's not a cringe-humour situation any more.

A rational story is just a simulationist story with rational characters in it. (A /non/-simulationist story with rational characters in it is a supercategory of the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluelessMystery][CluelessMystery]].)

--------------

† Simulationism as a concept extends to games (and the term came from there originally.) A simulationist /game/ is one that allows /the player/ easy access to a "controlled environment" where /they/ can test the rules of the game-as-simulation; it is also often a game that rewards such testing with power that would be inaccessible otherwise. (See e.g. Magic: The Gathering, or early-edition Dungeons and Dragons, where there are "decks" or "builds" that do crazy "broken" things, that the rules were actually designed to /promote/, rather than /prevent/.)

This probably implies that there is a way to be a "rational player" of a game, by prioritizing a combination of:

- attempting to extract rules-knowledge from the game (that doesn't necessarily want to give it to you), and

- using newly-acquired rules-knowledge to Win (or, at least, to be more aware of what Winning and Losing look like.)

It's a sort of half-scientist, half-munchkin perspective, where rather than trying to discover edge-cases to a game by brute force, you intentionally execute experiments that give you the highest ROI in increasing the fidelity of your rules-model of the game; and then you attempt to analytically discover edge-cases in your model.
