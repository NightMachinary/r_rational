Of course “show, don't tell” applies, sorry if I implied it didn't.

I'm not really sure what you mean by Simulationist since I've only ever seen it applied to games and your definition is different from the one I'm familiar with anyway. I'd shy away from using the term here because “simulation” to me has the implication of /starting/ from a ruleset and allowing the story to develop from it, which is a valid writing technique but not the only way to write Rational stories.
