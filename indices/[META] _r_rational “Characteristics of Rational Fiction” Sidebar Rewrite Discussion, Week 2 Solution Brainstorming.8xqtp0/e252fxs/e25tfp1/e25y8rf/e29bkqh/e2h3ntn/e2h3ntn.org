  Because the quality of the story and its membership in the rational genre are two separate things.

The problem I have with this distinction is that a lot of what defines the genre in my view is a deliberate attempt to stay away from a specific set of very common storytelling flaws. Rational stories can, of course, still be bad (because there are a lot different kinds of flaws and not all of them disqualify you from being rational fiction), but to some extend saying that a story is rational is making a statement about the quality of the work.

Honestly, I think it might be better to think of rational fiction as a qualifier that attaches to other genres, rather than as a genre on its own. You can write rational fiction in just about every genre you feel like, but you can't write just rational fiction. Rational Fantasy and Rational Sci-Fi are the most common combinations and I can easily imagine rational westerns, rational animes, rational horror, rational mysteries and even rational romance stories, but I come up short trying to imagine a rational story that isn't also part of some other genre.
