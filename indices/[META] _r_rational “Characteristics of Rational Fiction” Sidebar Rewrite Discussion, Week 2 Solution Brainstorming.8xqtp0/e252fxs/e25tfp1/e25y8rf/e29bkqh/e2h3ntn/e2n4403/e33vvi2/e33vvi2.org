  I think it might be better to think of rational fiction as a qualifier that attaches to other genres, rather than as a genre on its own.

I think most genres are modifiers themselves, and exclusivity is an effect of some modifiers being perceived as dichotomies. Fantasy versus Sci-Fi for instance. These modifiers also occasionally contain molds that aren't always followed - some people find rational fantasy reminds them of sci-fi, that kind of thing.

  I come up short trying to imagine a rational story that isn't also part of some other genre.

Remove 'story' and you've got non-fiction?
