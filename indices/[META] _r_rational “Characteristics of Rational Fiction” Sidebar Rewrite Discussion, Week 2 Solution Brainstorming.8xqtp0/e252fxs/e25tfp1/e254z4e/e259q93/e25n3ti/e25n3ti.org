I can imagine a rational story in a simplistic setting -- you don't need a lot of rules or a complex world. It's important, though, that the protagonist deeply explores (and thus exploits) what /is/ there. So how about:

#+begin_quote
  It focuses on deeply exploring the rules of a coherent setting
#+end_quote

But then, /Mother of Learning/ doesn't do this, and it definitely belongs in this sub (according to the votes). What do you make of that?
