Very interesting. Even though you say:

  Rarely do people set out to write something that's neatly confined to arbitrary standards

...I would say that it's actually very helpful to have a standard which is phrased in terms of generative, creative guidelines for "How to /write/ rational fiction", rather than a set of criteria for "How to judge whether something already-written /is/ rational fiction." Even of you're using it to judge already-written things.

It allows the reader to "work forward" from an abstract premise to evaluate whether the process taken by an author was one that "put rationality" into the work.

I.e., it separates "is this a rational work" from "is this the work of an experienced, skillful author." A work might be clearly rational (i.e. a lot of rationality was put into it), but that fact might be obscured by the author's inability to e.g. write intelligent characters. I don't think such authors "aren't writing rational fiction"; they're just writing /bad fiction/ that is, nevertheless, rational fiction.

Or, to put that another way: a band can compose a blues song and then perform it so unskilfully that it sounds like a dance song. If another band with more experienced talent in it were to cover the song, though, it'd clearly be a blues song.

So there's a separation between the "genre of songwriting", and the "genre of musical performance." And the best way to see whether something is of a particular genre of songwriting---without the sheet music---is to look past the performance to imagine what went into writing the song.

If "Rational fiction" is a "genre of songwriting", then we should be looking into what goes into writing the song, rather than looking at the performance.
