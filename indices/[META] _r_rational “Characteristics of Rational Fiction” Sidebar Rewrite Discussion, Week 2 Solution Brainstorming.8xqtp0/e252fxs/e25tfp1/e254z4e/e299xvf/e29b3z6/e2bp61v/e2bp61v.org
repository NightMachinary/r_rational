I like this approach, defining rational fiction via intent and trying to give principles that automatically generate the other tropes of rational fiction. The criticisms I have are 1) not every genre is most naturally defined via intent, 2) readers do not have access to the author's mind, only to the words on the page, and there must be something about the words on the page such that intent is recognizable.

Regarding (1), although comedy seems naturally definable in terms of intent, genres like action or romance seem naturally definable in terms of what's contained in the writing; namely, "action scenes" and "plots centered around relationships." These specific attributes of the stories are what draws audiences in the first place.

Regarding (2), if an author intends to write a comedy, but uses /none/ of the conventional forms or techniques of comedy, then the humor may be so subtle that the audience doesn't consider the work a comedy. (Of course, conventional techniques can shift as people pioneer new ones, and we don't want to discourage pioneering in rational fiction).

It's unclear how much rational fiction should be defined by author intent as opposed to specific techniques used in the writing. There may be room for a mixed definition, such as "rational fiction displays respect for themes of intelligence, reason, and logical consequences; this is usually presented in the writing via competent and intelligent characters and thorough exploration of the mechanics of a setting." (I'm not satisfied with that definition, but it's a start).
