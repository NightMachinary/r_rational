If the setting is an unusual situation in the real world with a different win condition from doing well in life, then it can be written by an author that isn't a genius and still be rational fiction. The Martian is rational-ish and is about the protagonist using their expertise to survive a hostile environment. A fair play whodunnit with a detective that uses real techniques could be rational.
