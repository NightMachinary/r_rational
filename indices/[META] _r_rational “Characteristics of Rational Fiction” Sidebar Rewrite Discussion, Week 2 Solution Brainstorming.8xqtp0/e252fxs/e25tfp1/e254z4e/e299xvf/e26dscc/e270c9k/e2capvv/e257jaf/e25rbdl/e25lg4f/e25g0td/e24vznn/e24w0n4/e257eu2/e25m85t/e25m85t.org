One of the current points is:

- The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.

To me, this is a crucial part of rational fiction. However the formulation is too general, so that it is almost merely a feature of good fiction. Rational fiction is different in the /degree/; a rational character is expected to be /particularly/ intelligent and resourceful. Additionally, this should be the /main/ form of problem-solving; /deus ex machina/ and similar should rarely if ever happen.

How can we change the formulation to reflect this? My suggestion:

- In rational fiction, characters solve problems through intelligence, knowledge, and resourcefulness, rather than relying on any /deus ex machina/

Please suggest better phrasings.
