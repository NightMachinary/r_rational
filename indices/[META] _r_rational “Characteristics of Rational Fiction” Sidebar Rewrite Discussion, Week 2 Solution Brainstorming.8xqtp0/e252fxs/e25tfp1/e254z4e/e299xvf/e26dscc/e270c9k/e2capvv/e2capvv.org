Building off [[/u/causalchain]]

--------------

Rational fiction is a genre that tries to emphasize intellectually-satisfying payoffs. Some common techniques include:

- Deconstruction: Authors explore the deeper and less-obvious implications of an already established universe or trope.
- Fair Play Whodunits: These mysteries are solved using only clues and information that are available to the reader.
- Good versus Good Plots: Stories are driven by the conflict between two factions seeking different goals
- Onscreen Reasoning: Readers are invited to follow along as characters discover clever solutions to complex problems.
- Exploiting Consistent Rules: The work establishes (or borrows) a consistent set of rules and then shows how characters could take advantage of them.

That wording is bad. I'm probably missing some common techniques. But it sketches out a general shape and would be short enough to fit in a sidebar.

The definition is pretty short. But I think the questions "is this an emphasis of the work?" and "is the payoff any good?" are pretty central to the things I'd want to recommend here. Everything else is a list of tropes that aren't strictly necessary, but tend to point in the right direction.

Listing tropes like this gives room to say stuff like, "Mistborn has some great rational elements, especially when characters exploit the magic system, but the focus of the book is on the action-adventure."
