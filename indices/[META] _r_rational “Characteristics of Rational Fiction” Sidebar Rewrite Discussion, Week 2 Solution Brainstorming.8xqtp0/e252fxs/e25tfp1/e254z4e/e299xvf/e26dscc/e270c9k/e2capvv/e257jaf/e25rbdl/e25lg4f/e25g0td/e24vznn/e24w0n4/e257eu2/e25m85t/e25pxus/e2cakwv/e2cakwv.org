Someone on the previous thread said something about thought being at the core of rational fiction. I think that could be used to refine a definition like Noumero's into something like this:

--------------

*Rational fiction* is fiction that explores the way people *think* to reach *goals*. This exploration tends to include:

- Worlds with consistent rules, so that thinking is a viable strategy to reach goals.
- Characters whose way of thinking is competent or otherwise interesting.
- Plots that revolve around the consequences of people seeking goals by thinking.

Rational fiction often contains tropes that are useful to such exploration, or that result from it, such as:

- Munchkinry.
- Genre-savviness.
- Deconstructions
- Hard Science-Fiction.
- Fair-Play Whodunnit (solvable-by-the-reader).
- In-depth exploration of the world.

Fiction that contains these is likely to interest this subreddit and if you enjoy them, you are likely to enjoy rational fiction.

I like the idea of a single definition that is explained, not added to, by bullet points.

I find the explorations of idiosyncratic thought patterns in eg. Natural D20 and Glimwarden immensely stimulating. They are still relatively good at achieving goals, but I believe that a story that explores how people utterly fail to reach goals because of specific flaws in their thinking could count as rational fiction.

Viewing the tropes as not something random that we happen to like, but as things that are useful to the exploration has the benefit that it fully embraces an author finding a way to use a trope we don't like to explore thought in a way have not seen before.
