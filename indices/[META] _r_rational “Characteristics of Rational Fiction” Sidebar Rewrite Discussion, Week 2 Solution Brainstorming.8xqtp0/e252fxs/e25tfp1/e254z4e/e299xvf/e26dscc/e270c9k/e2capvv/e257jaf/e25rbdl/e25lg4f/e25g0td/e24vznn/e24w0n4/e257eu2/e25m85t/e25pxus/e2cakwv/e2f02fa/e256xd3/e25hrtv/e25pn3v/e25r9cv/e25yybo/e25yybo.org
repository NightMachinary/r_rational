Another question to ask is /when/ do we ask those questions for a specific novel. (edit: regarding the qualifying questions.) Just earlier today I read a comment in a thread saying about someone's new chapter update:

#+begin_quote
  it doesnt have any rational or rationalist element per se but i am willing to wait and see personally.
#+end_quote

This isn't the first time I read a comment about delaying judgement to determine if something is rational. This suggests that this genre is more than what we might ask of fantasy genres, such as "does it have elves? magic? fairies?"
