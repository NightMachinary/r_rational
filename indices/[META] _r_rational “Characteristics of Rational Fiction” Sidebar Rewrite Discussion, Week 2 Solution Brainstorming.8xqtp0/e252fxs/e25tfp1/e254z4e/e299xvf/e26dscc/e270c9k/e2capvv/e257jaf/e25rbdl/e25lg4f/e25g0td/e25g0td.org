I'd add text like, "Rationalist fiction *tries to emphasize*..."

The "emphasize" is there because I want the exploration of character-thinking to happen on screen. This lets us rule out stuff like well-written romance novels. The characters might be as vibrant as real people. But if that's not where the book is spending its energy, it's not a great fit.

The "tries to" is there to distinguish "is this in the genre?" from "is this any good?" That way I can say, "HPMOR has a plot hole in Chapter 217, JarJar obviously could have ..." without having to argue that a character's bad decision make the work irrational.
