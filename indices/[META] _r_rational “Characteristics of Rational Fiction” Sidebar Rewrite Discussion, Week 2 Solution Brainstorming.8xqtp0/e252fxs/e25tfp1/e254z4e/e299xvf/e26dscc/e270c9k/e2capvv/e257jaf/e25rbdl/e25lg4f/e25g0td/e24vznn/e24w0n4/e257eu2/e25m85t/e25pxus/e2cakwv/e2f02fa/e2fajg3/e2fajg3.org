Your point about rationality not being a genre made me think about how genres vary greatly in how much they need to dominate a story for the story to properly belong in the genre.

For example, a story can have plenty of romance without being a Romance story. It really needs to focus on romance to qualify. On the other hand, a story qualifies as scifi or fantasy by having specific world building elements, even if it doesn't focus on them at all. They are more world-genres than plot-genres. I think your "Old Man and the Sea" example shows that rationalism needs to be fairly dominant for a story to qualify. It is something of a plot-genre.

Which makes it not just a quality, though. I think that the definitions that talk about the goals and focus of the story avoid the problem you point out with a condition-based definition. As you say, "Old Man and the Sea":s purpose is not to focus on these things, so if we define the word in terms of purpose, it won't qualify. No need for an extra clause.
