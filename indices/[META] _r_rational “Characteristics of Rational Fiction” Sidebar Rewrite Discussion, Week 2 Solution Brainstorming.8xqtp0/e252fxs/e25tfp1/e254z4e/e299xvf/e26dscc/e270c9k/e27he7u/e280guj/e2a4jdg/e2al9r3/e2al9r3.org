  If it were a rational story, I would expect to get Holmes perspective and thought processes. Obviously, this can't work for a mystery novel.

I don't see why this couldn't work for a mystery novel. Holmes is the detective, not the culprit. I don't see what would be so wrong if we got to follow his thought processes as he solved the case. In fact, I think it would be better than the alternative. (In the BBC sherlock show (which is admittedly terrible for many other reasons too), Holmes frequently taunts us with information we don't have, and it's really tiring and annoying.)
