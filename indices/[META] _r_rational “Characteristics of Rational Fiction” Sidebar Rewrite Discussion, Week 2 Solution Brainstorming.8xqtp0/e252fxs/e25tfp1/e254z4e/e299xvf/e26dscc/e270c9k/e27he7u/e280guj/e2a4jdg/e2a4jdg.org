  I noticed another possible problem with this definition anyways: Mystery/detective stories. Do they give off intellectual payoffs? Do we count them as rational? From my biased POV, I could argue that detective stories give more of a "confusion unravelling" feeling than "that's smart".

  [EVERYONE] Do you enjoy detective stories that follow the tenets of rational fiction as much as sci-fi/fantasy webnovels?

Detective stories make me feel conflicted. I enjoy them, but I would never mistake them for /rational/ stories. It's for the same reason /Sherlock Holmes/ stories are narrated by Watson. If it were a rational story, I would expect to get Holmes perspective and thought processes. Obviously, this can't work for a mystery novel.

On the other hand, I really like [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/235/Detective_Conan][Detective Conan]] because it's told from Conan's perspective. While it follows the typical pattern and doesn't spoil the prime mystery before the reveal, it does follow Conan as he solves smaller problems (usually related to the central conceit.) Though it's not /rational/ per se, I feel it has some elements.
