I hereby propose the Three C's of rational(ist) fiction: Competence, Consistency, and Conviction.

- *Competence.* Characters display general competence in reasoning and acting, the techniques of reasoning used by the characters are realistic, and the writing devotes special attention to showcasing these qualities.

- *Consistency.* The setting is probabilistically self-consistent, i.e., the world and narrative are not implausibly unlikely given the setup, and the writing devotes special attention to showcasing this, often by means of consistent and transparent narrative rules that are strictly adhered to.

A note on Consistency: initial conditions, such as the magic system, are allowed to be /a priori/ unlikely because they are boundary conditions for the story, and are thus subject to the anthropic principle of storytelling, which is "If the story weren't interesting, I wouldn't be telling it." So it's fine if a story starts with a character winning the lottery, but not fine if it's resolved that way. Other improbabilities that are okay include characters occasionally getting plausibly lucky (which does happen in real life), and things like the improbability of drawing a random hand in a card game. By drawing a hand in a card game, I mean that the odds of you drawing the exact 5-card hand that you have are 1/(52 choose 5), which is very small, but this is true of literally /any/ hand you could draw, so you shouldn't conclude that you're in the matrix just because you are holding /some/ unlikely hand by necessity. Also, budding off of Consistency, perhaps there is room for a fourth "C", *Conservation*, which means that most or all details relevant to the narrative are showcased early-on in-story, so no late Deus-ex-Machinas (arguably this is just a quality of good fiction, but perhaps it is still worth including?)

- *Conviction.* Not only are competence and consistency showcased in the story, but they are integral to the purpose, appeal, or themes of the story, often but not necessarily in the context of an overarching transhumanist philosophy.

I propose that "Rational" fiction generally possesses the first two qualities, whereas "Rationalist" fiction possesses all three.

The advantage of this setup is that it is simple and memorable, while corresponding to most people's intuitions about rationalist fiction and leaving room for flexible judgement. HPMOR solidly checks off all three criteria, Worm checks off the first two, and most ordinary fiction does not check off any criteria because it does not devote special narrative attention to showcasing competence and consistency. It goes along with what other people have said about defining rationalist fiction not by what it is, but by what it does in practice.

I also propose that rational(ist) fiction be evaluated on two axes: by whether or not it fits the genre, and whether or not it is well-executed. I think a story can be firmly rationalist by author intent, even if it is poorly written and poorly thought-out. I picture two axes: the x-axis has non-rationalist on the left and rationalist on the right, and the y-axis has poorly-executed at the bottom and well-executed at the top. A good rational(ist) fiction is in the top right; a good rational crack fic or rational-adjacent fic is in the top middle; a bad rational fic is in the lower right; a good non-rational fic is in the top left; etc. etc.
