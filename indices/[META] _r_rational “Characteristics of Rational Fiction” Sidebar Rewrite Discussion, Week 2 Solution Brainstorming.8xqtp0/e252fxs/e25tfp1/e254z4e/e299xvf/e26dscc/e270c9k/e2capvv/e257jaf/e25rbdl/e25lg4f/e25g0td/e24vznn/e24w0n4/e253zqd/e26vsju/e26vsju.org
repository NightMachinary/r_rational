My current thoughts: A lot of the comments here nail only one or two aspects, so by their incompleteness can not be voted as a final definition. I can imagine this thread holding everyone's thoughts on what the solution should be, and then we hold a second thread where people construct complete definitions using the opinions here, pandering to as many people as possible. We can then vote on those complete definitions; this could hopefully reduce the feeling of minorities' ideas being ignored by democracy.
