Thanks for your response! I would indeed say that rational fiction would try to maximise intellectual payoffs in particular. It is underspecific, but I don't think it's as underspecific as you're presenting it to be (I'm sorry I'm picking at your examples, I'm not good at coming up with new ones):

Exciting action sequences: if it's exciting because it's showing main character intelligence then it absolutely fits in rational fiction. If it's just flashy, then it's optimising for other payoffs, not intellectual.

Discussion of pressing issues: I got the impression that's what a lot of transhumanist fiction is about. I don't really know what to say about it in rational fiction or for intellectual payoffs, it isn't what I require to see for either.

Relatable characters + Realistic portrayal of everyday activities: I agree that this is a contention point: empathy with character increases all payoffs, even if unrelated. I argue though, that this won't create an intellectual payoff on its own, only contribute.

Perhaps I could take a page from [[/u/best_cat][u/best_cat]] and reword the claim: *Rational fiction tries to emphasize intellectual payoffs*. This puts a spotlight on the kind of stories we like while also allowing "bad" examples of the genre; ones that give a little intellectual payoff and not much else.

I noticed another possible problem with this definition anyways: *Mystery/detective stories*. Do they give off intellectual payoffs? Do we count them as rational? From my biased POV, I could argue that detective stories give more of a "confusion unravelling" feeling than "that's smart".

[EVERYONE] Do you enjoy detective stories that follow the tenets of rational fiction as much as sci-fi/fantasy webnovels?
