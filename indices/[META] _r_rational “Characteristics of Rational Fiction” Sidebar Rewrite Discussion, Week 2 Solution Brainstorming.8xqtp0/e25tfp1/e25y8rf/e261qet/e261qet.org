That raises the problem of being concise. I think I could scale down my definition pretty well, but I'm not sure what to do with additional tropes. Some of them could be woven into the definition ("[tropes that] help in highlighting and exploring...", "[we] enjoy engaging with the work by 'solving' it..."), but things like "transhumanism" would be harder to include.

Write a Wiki article, perhaps?
