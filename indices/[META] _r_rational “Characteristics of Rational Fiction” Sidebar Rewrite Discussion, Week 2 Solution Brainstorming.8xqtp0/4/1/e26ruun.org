  So I don't think we should restrict what is rational fiction too much, if we want our community to grow and our movement to have some effect on the world. That's half the reason we're here, right?

I'd prefer rational fiction staying as it is rather than growing into something different, even if that limits it. I also don't care about having an effect on the world -- I just want to enjoy entertaining fiction. I think you're generalizing a bit much from your own n=1.
