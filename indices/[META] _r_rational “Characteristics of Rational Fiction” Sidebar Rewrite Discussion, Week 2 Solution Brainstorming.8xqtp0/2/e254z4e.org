As I've said in the previous thread, I think the characteristics of rational fiction should shift from defining what it is, to defining what it does. This would promote more fruitful discussion which is particularly important as a lot of rational writing exists as amateur work on the on internet and could use the extra attention.

As an example, take the following:

#+begin_quote
  The fictional world has consistent rules, and sticks to them.
#+end_quote

And turn it into something like:

#+begin_quote
  It focuses on exploring a complex and coherent setting.
#+end_quote

This does two things. One, it acknowledges that rational fiction is about more than just internal consistency - it also needs to have extra depth to it. A lot of fiction is consistent simply by the virtue of not focusing on its setting and this would be conveniently separated by this definition. Two, it moves us away from the binary approach of consistent and inconsistent rules.

I would employ the same sort of procedure for all bullet points. As in, move away from "rational fiction is so and so" towards "rational fiction does so and so". Besides the benefit I mentioned in the beginning, it's more true to how a genre comes to be in my opinion. Rarely do people set out to write something that's neatly confined to arbitrary standards, however they do quite often have an idea of what they want to accomplish with their writing.
