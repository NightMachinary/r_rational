You're actually right about that -- the world-building is there, so yes, the /author/ explores the system. I should have been more precise: Zorian doesn't explicitly sit down to figure out the rules and exploit them to nearly the same degree as we see in some other stories. So that part does not seem to be a necessary condition for rational fiction.
