  Hamilton path is a layout style,

No, it's a way of traversing graphs. I guess you could call graphs "layout styles", if you look at the cave solely as a series of intersections and connections; but for any given number of intersections (graph nodes) there are many possible graphs that have a Hamiltonian path.

  My thought process was this: if i used real world graph theories (that most readers wouldn't even know existed),

Maybe just don't call it a "graph theory" ? Maybe say it's "a standard layout" without specifying in what and both readers who don't know about graph theory and readers who do will be pacified.

The story is still quite good, I'll definitely keep reading, but this put me off quite a bit. Along with the continuous description of women as objects of sexual desire, though I guess this second can be part of the story and appealing to some readers.
