Here's the quote I read before writing this scene:

#+begin_quote
  My fireman friend told me that there were always TWO people on the hose as they entered a hot blaze. The rookie was always the guy in front, because he felt the most heat, whereas the guy right behind him ( experienced fire-fighter) got the cooling mist that sprayed back. That would seem to indicate that water in any form would help you survive, assuming you do not stay in one place long enough to get that water very hot, in which case, the ability of water to hold heat could work against you. Short trip through fire? Get wet. Longer trip? run like hell.

And I really hate to use the term "because magic", but I've given a lot of reasons where the reader can assume hydromancy may play a role in fighting against heat. I do not think the write up, as it is, is irrational.
