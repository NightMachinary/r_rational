I like this more. We get to speculate.

There's been some talk of controlled abilities and banned niches already. How would you prevent someone from using a power you didn't want them to be able to?

The obvious question that comes to mind is why didn't she take control of them during the test? I think it'd have to be because she knew there'd be a negative reaction.

I wonder if she'll become some type of indentured servant now controlled by vivamancers.
