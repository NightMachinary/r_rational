In that case, you probably should just cut out the paragraph entirely and jump to the line break. However, I understand that you wanted to include the following paragraph about Tobias silently questioning if Seti changed his mind about sparing Libby.

You could work it in by writing about Seti's musings on whether he should have changed his mind as he walked out of the building (bolding is the original text from the chapter):

#+begin_quote
  *Everyone came out of the building, one at a time. Mindy and her parents were in front. Ivan wobbled after each step, his eyes downcast and empty. Libby didn't need anyone to force her forward, as she happily skipped and jumped ahead. Tobias and Seti were last* with Seti lost in thought. Seti wondered if he should have changed his answer about letting Libby live. Seti wouldn't say it aloud, but in some way, he understood Libby, even if her actions were abhorrent. He wondered what that meant for the future.
