Yeah 4/6pi r^{3} if it's a half sphere. I suppose a quarter mile makes his sense about as good a regular vision at distance anyway,and better in every other regard so yeah,that could work. Here's a question, if he sees a 10% increase in radius every week with no diminishing returns, what tier will he reach in a year?
