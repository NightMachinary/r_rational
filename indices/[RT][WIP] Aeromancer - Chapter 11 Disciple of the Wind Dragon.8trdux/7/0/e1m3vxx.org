my guess is... cristella was looking for reasons to reject him and googled the maze (which is authentic to the time the 5 created it)... she found out there /is/ a hamiltonian solution to the maze (which is impossible to find out without, yanno, seeing all the paths before hand). so she nailed him for not /using/ that maze's hamiltonian path (which would be the optimal solution to the maze, but finding it is impossible without memorizing it ahead of time xD)

of course, since she just looked up the name, she botched it. but who cares? she makes polearms! why does she need to know graph theory. she's not a geomancer
