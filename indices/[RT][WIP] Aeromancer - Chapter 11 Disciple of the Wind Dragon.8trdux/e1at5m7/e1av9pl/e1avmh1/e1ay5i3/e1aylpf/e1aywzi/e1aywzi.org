On a side note, it's actually a cubic increase in volume - but I expect a mostly 2DataFish omniview used with higher range. As to levelling a city, he doesn't need to see a city to level it, he almost killed Tyron without seeing what happened to him. If he could create a Storm with that radius, it'd destroy a city easily.
