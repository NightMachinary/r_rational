I wonder how long till he starts his inevitable climb up the tiers then. Tier is just a measure of mana capacity/production no? I think the size of his air sense is a measure of his tier. So maybe every double is a tier? Hmm that doesn't seem good enough though. At T5 that'd give him 10*2^{4} =160 ft of coverage. At tier 8 that's 1280 ft radius which seems a bit small. Hmm.
