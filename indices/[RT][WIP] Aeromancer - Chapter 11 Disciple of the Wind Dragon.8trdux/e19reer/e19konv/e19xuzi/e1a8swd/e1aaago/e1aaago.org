I've read a few things regarding this scenario, and the answer is simply: it depends. In fact, I've read the opposite where you'd want to wrap yourself /and/ make the clothing wet in a short burst run.

In a mancer world, though, how a second year Prestige hydromancer fights off heat with water is another topic. I have, even in this chapter, made mention that an aeromancer is capable of suffocating the flames by withholding their air if their grit is strong enough. A similar concept with hydromancers is likely to exist.
