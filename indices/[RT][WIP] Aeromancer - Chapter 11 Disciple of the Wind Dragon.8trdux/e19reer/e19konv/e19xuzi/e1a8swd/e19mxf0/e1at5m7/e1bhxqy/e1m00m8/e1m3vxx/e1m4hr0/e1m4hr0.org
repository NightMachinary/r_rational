Hamilton path is a layout style, which was something i looked up before writing the last chapter. The Hammington one i wrote is indeed a made up one, based on real world graph theories and a mix of what would likely exist in a mancer/primal world.

My thought process was this: if i used real world graph theories (that most readers wouldn't even know existed), someone might eventually ask how a mancer world came up with the exact same name and whatnot. So changed the name and didn't go deep into it. Which is a reasonable question as magic existing in the world changes how technology advances too, and all that.
