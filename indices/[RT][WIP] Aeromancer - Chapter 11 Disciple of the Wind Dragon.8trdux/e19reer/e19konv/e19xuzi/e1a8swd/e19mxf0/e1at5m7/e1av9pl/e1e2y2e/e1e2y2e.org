The Night Watch books by Sergei Lukyanenko had a similar protagonist who starts off at the very low end of the power scale.

Let's just say that very rarely in fiction does the underdog truly stay at the bottom of the power levels the whole time without getting some sort of boost/equalizer/etc...

Incidentally, highly recommend the Night Watch series. Urban fantasy, post-Soviet style - has a very distinct voice from Western lit.
