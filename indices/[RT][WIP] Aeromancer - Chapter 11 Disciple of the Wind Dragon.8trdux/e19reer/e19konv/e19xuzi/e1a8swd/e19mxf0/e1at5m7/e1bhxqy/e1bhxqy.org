I've just caught up with this story. You seem to have a knack for plot, in terms of hitting on various tropes that appeal to fantasy/webfiction readers.

However, there are a few issues with the story i've found frustrating. Part way through this chapter I decided to make notes on some of these issues as they arose:

Inconsistent values displayed by Seti- nearly unwilling to be soaked in urine in a situation where lives are on the line and time is of the essence but all high and mighty in a dumb narrow minded way with elderly lady. The fact that the time taken to only possibly save the previous lady would likely result in further deaths wasn't addressed.

No tension - never felt like SETI was in danger (character never ruminates on situation or genuinely worried plus not plausible that elder doesn't save them if worst comes to worst).

Characters behaving unrealistically - eg. Asking Toby's thoughts of the mafia while in a raging inferno trying to save everyone's lives where times of the essence or Libby's plan coming apart around her but she's rocking back in a chair relaxed and oh so casual when people discover her and Ivan. Mindy, not someone shown to be a calm individual, going from intense fear at being held hostage and to calmly cleaning Seti's face less than a minute after rescue.

Comically arrogant ‘bad guys' ala Libby. ‘Eyes wide with madness', ‘hysterical laughter', “no one can judge me”, reveals entire plan to the ‘good guys'.

I don't want to be all negative, I am still enjoying parts of the story.
