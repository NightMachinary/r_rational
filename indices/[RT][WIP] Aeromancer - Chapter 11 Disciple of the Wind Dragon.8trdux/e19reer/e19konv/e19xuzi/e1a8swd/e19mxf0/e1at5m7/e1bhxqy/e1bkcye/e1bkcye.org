I'll do my best here to reply to some of your complaints.

  Inconsistent values displayed by Seti- nearly unwilling to be soaked in urine...but all high and mighty in a dumb narrow minded way with elderly lady
#+end_quote

Two entirely different spectrums here. No one wants to be soaked in urine; he just had a hard time coping with it. As for the old lady, she was a physical being that would've definitely died had Seti ignored her, so her life and death was something in his hands. Indirectly blamed for something is judged differently than a direct blame.

  The fact that the time taken to only possibly save the previous lady would likely result in further deaths wasn't addressed.
#+end_quote

It was. When that Kimberly person was found dead.

  No tension - never felt like SETI was in danger
#+end_quote

I never thought he was in danger. Seti never thought he was in danger. So we're of one accord here.

  Asking Toby's thoughts of the mafia while in a raging inferno
#+end_quote

That questioning came up when Toby was taking care of the fire. The two were happening simultaneously.

  Mindy, not someone shown to be a calm individual, going from intense fear at being held hostage and to calmly cleaning
#+end_quote

She cried with her parents while they hugged her after the fact. Only after she broke from their hold did she come to Seti.

I won't comment here as her motivation plays a part in her actions.

  I don't want to be all negative, I am still enjoying parts of the story.
#+end_quote

It's easy to find things we dislike about a story! Nothing will ever match what we want to see happen.
