I want to say that Abigail's action to soak Seti and herself in water before going into the fire is actually a terrible idea. You wouldn't grab a hot pan with a wet towel would you? It's because the fire would flash boil the water into super-heated steam to burn your hand. Water is great for cooling you down after a fire or when hot, but if you expect to run into a burning building, wearing something thick and dry would work better as insulation.

You don't see firefighters drenching themselves with water before running into a burning building do you?
