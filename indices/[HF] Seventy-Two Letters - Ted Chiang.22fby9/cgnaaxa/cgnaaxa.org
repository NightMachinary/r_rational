Another good story by Ted Chiang. I liked how the world the narrator lived in had classical ideas of nature like spontaneous generation and the male contributing most of the characteristics of the children be the reality of the universe. I've read some other stories that have done similar things, but those were usually fantasy, not sci-fi (like with stars being people and a flat world in Narnia).
