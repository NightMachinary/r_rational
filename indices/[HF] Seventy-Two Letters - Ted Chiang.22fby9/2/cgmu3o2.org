About a third of the way through reading this, I realized it was by Ted Chiang, whose book I had on a shelf but hadn't yet read. Sure enough, this story was in it. Almost through it now /(Slow reader/) and I'm completely in love. Can anyone recommend other stories by this author, outside of those in "Stories of Your Life and Others", namely "Tower of Babylon", "Understand", "Division By Zero", "Story of Your Life", The Evolution of Human Science", "Hell Is the Absence of God", and "Liking What You See: A Documentary", or at least let me know which one I should read next?
