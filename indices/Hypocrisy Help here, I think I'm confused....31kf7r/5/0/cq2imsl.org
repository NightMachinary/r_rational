There haven't been any specific incidents, but here are some hypotheticals that were thrown out. Specifically, she says that she'd never let a fat person tell her how to lose weight. She would ignore what they say. Same for smokers telling her how to quit. Her thing is that, "If you can tell me how to do something, or give me advice, that you can't follow yourself, what you're saying has no worth." And I understand where she's coming from. You wouldn't take stock advice from someone who's always losing out on trades. That indicates they're not good at what they're doing. I'm cool with assigning /lesser/ value to the words of a hypocrite, as it's possible their advice just doesn't work, hence why they seem like a hypocrite. But assigning zero value seems stupid.

Here's a better example. I'm fairly overweight. But I've been to the gym a couple of times (a few 3-4 week stints over the past couple of years) and I have a couple friends that go to the gym. As a result, I've passively acquired a good chunk of knowledge about things like strength training, weight loss, etc. I couldn't be a personal trainer, but I'm not totally clueless. But if the subject comes up, and I try to contribute anything I've picked up (reducing carbs is a good idea, frequency of eating is a good thing as it keeps your metabolism up, etc.) she discredits it because I'm overweight. Which, I try to argue, makes no sense. That's kind of how the discussion started.
