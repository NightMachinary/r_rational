Pretty much what I said to her. She tried to defend her point by saying there's a difference between hypocrisy and "making an error in judgement". For example, someone who got pregnant as a teen could still advise people about using protection. She wouldn't consider them a hypocrite. But a smoker, or an alcholic (someone who's hypocritical behavior is ongoing) wouldn't be able to advise her on the dangers of either activity. She wouldn't put value on what they say.
