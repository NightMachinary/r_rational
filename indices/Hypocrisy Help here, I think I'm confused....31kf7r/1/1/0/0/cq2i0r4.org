I understand you not wanting people to judge you, if they themselves are doing the same thing. The pot calling the kettle black, as it were. But I'm concerned as to why she can't take factual information from it. If a smoker bitches at you because you smoke. Fine, de-value their words. But if a smoker tells you that you shouldn't smoke because you'll get yellow teeth and trouble breathing, seems like you should believe them.
