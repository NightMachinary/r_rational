I would say that not listening to hypocrites is a relatively effective use of time. Not that what they are saying is definitely wrong, but its less likely to be correct, in the same way that it is more likely that a science teacher will give you correct information, versus some religious preacher that will mention some scientific "facts". Sure both might tell you the truth, but the first one is more likely to do so then the second. If you have lots of time it would be fine to research both, to be sure its correct, if you don't have much time it would make sense to attach some probability to the information being correct and to work with it, so the teacher would get higher probability while the preacher would get a low one.
