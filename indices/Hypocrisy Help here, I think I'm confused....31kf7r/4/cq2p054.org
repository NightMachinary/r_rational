Something to consider: evaluating if something is true or useful has a cost, in time/effort/frustration. Since we have access to so much information (internet, books, etc), coarse filters on what information to not bother evaluating seriously can make sense.

As an example, consider advertisements, on the internet, billboards, tv, whatever. Tons of information being thrown at me. Sure, some of it might be true or even useful to me, but I ignore everything that looks even a little like an advertisement because it's not worth sifting through the shit.
