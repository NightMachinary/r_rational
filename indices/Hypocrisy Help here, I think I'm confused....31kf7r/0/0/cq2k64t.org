The formal version of it is /tu quoque/.

- X claims Y.
- X does not act on Y.
- Therefore, not Y.

An example:

- Joe says smoking is bad for you.
- Joe is a pack-a-day smoker.
- Therefore, smoking is not bad for you.

Never mind that Joe could have a death wish, or be speaking from personal experience and trying to quit, or be friends with someone who believes that smoking is a moral obligation, or otherwise be unable or unwilling to not smoke.
