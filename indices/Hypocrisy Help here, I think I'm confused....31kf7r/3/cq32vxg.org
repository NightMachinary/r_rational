You're logically correct, while she's correct in a probabilistic sense.

  A fat person telling me I should reduce my calorie count and exercise more to lose weight doesn't make them incorrect, just because they are incapable of following their own advice.

Yes. But a fat person /might/ be more likely to have false beliefs about the best methods of not being fat compared to a thin fit person. Not every fat person always, but it may be something that's /generally/ true. (Because if they knew how not to be fat, and if they prefer to not be fat, they wouldn't be fat.)

Is this a vast oversimplification, and are you better off evaluating arguments based on other, better criteria? Yes. So you're /more correct/ than your mom.
