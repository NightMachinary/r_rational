Eh, depending on the context it could be a rational decision that something isn't worth your time. Additionally, hypocrisy & other personal failings can strip the speaker's words of the benefit of the doubt, which is worth noting. "Ad Homenim" arguments are perfectly fine if you're saying "this person isn't worth listening to" - it simply doesn't /refute/ whatever that person said.
