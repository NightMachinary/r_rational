In fairness to your mom, "not putting value in what X says" is not the same thing as "thinking what X says is wrong because X says it".

Like, if someone tells me smoking is bad, but they smoke -- if I were on the fence about smoking, I would be /less significantly influenced/ by this than by someone who tells me smoking is bad and they follow their own advice. Hypocrisy in a person leads me to value less strongly their own rationality and knowledge, and thus put less stock in their ability to know/believe correct things, and thus put less stock in what they say. Guard myself against aligning myself alongside what they say just 'cause they say it. Etc.

That doesn't mean I would necessarily ascribe /negative/ value to their statements, though. At worst it might drop down to zero.

Do you think it's possible your mom was trying to say something like that? Or was she actually anti-believing something based on the fact that a hypocrite said it? Like, she was on the fence before, but since a hypocrite said it she's /against/ it now, sort of thing?
