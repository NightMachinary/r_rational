Did this start off as an object-level argument which involved a hypocrite making an argument against something your mom believes, and then get into a meta-level argument about the general validity of hypocrites' advice? Particularly this post about errors in judgement vs ongoing hypocrisy, while potentially a legitimate distinction, also feels like it could be the result of backwards reasoning from "I believe A and a hypocrite #1 is arguing against it" and "I believe B and a hypocrite #2 is arguing for it," then trying to find a distinction between the two hypocrites which makes one's observation valid and the other's not.
