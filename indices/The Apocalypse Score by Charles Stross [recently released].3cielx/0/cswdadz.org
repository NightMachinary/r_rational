I'm about halfway through this right now; it's pretty classic Laundry Files, even with a different main character. I highly recommend all the books in the series; [[/u/cstross]] does a really good job with both research and that quality of "thoughtfulness" that I associate with rational fiction. "The Rhesus Chart" in particular had a few moments of discovery and exploration of principles that tickled that same spot in my brain.
