The series has been recommended in [[/r/rational]] by many people, so I figured y'all would appreciate a heads up.

The magic system is also one of the most fun I've ever seen, even if it's not precisely defined enough for us to get munchkining.

To quote from the prologue :

#+begin_quote
  A brief recap: /magic/ is the name given to the practice of manipulating the ultrastructure of reality by carrying out mathematical operations. We live in a multiverse, and certain operators trigger echoes in the Platonic realm of mathematical truth, echoes which can be amplified and fed back into our (and other) realities. Computers, being machines for executing mathematical operations at very high speed, are useful to us as occult engines. Likewise, some of us have the ability out magical operations /in our own heads/ at terrible cost.
