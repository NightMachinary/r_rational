I'm glad you agree with the importance =)

  consciousness arises from the "pattern" that our matter takes
#+end_quote

I agree, tentatively, with this. I used the word "structure." It is the physical structure of the brain that gives rise to consciousness.

But the important detail here is the word "matter." For physics to act on it, it must be a pattern of matter. it cannot be a pattern we merely imagine, or describe- it cannot be an /abstract/ pattern. Physics does not operate on abstractions.

If you agree that in our hunt for the source consciousness we are looking for a physical pattern in matter (be it neurons or silicon or what have you), then we are on the same page.

It's from that basis that I find software suspect. A /simulated/ pattern is not a physical object. it is an abstraction - a series of numbers we have simply declared to /signify/ something physical. Its relationship to the physical pattern is metaphorical - it represents, it does not reproduce the physical structure we are interested in.

Now, IF the structure of the underlying hardware contains the "pattern" we are looking for - if the physical circuits themselves, or quantum bits, or whatever adhere to that pattern and structure - it is /possible/ we will get consciousness.

But if the software is just an abstract calculation run on a general computing machine that has no similarity to the physical pattern or structure required for consciousness, I don't believe it will work.

Does this make sense?
