Okay, sure. The wetness metaphor is pretty nice. So, you make a good argument that one should not expect to make artificial consciousness through physical simulation of a brain.

Why does that mean that you can't make an artificial consciousness using a different structure?

Or, to poke at the other implication: What is it about the interaction of neurons makes that "consciousness"?
