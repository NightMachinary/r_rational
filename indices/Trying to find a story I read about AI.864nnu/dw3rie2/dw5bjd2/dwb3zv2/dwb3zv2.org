  why can't there be a direct and *abstract* translation

this is the key term.

Our universe is comprised of matter and governed by physics. Consciousness is necessarily a physical process. Physics interprets the interactions of the neurons in the brain as conscious.

Physics does not operate on abstractions - even a perfect digital model of hydrodynamics is not wet, and cannot power a watermill.

An abstract model of the brain is not something physics can operate on. it doesn't matter how detailed we make the model - it's still at the physical level just math we are declaring to /represent/ a brain. Physics doesn't care what we describe something as.

If an artificial brain is to be conscious, it must have /physical/ attributes that have the structure physics interprets as conscious.

If you were to build a physical copy of a brain with 1 to 1 correspondence between neurons you may be able to create an "artificial" consciousness. But I do not believe that an arbitrary program run on a general computing machine that is only said to /represent/ a brain abstractly would necessarily be conscious.
