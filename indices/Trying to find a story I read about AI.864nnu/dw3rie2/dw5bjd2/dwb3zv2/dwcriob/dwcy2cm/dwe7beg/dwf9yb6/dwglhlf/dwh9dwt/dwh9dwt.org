  I think that at this point we've begun to get into a semantic argument about what constitutes "real".
#+end_quote

I agree we are in part arguing about what makes something real - but I do believe there is a fundamental break over whether simulations can create matter, universes, and consciousness. I believe our universe is more "real" than a simulation or a brain in a vat because that simulation is a subset of our reality. It cannot exist without our reality - you need the physical computer or the physical brain in the vat! The inverse of this is not true - our universe can exist just fine without the simulation. This I propose makes our universe "more real" than the simulation.

  If you are a materialist it follows that you believe that consciousness arises from interactions of matter.
#+end_quote

Yes.

#+begin_quote
  Then it follows that IF (and that's the if that we'll probably differ on)matter can be abstracted, and you abstractly simulate that matter, then consciousness can arise from interaction of that matter[1].
#+end_quote

Saying that there is something more fundamental than quantum particles doesn't mean that matter is analogous to a simulation, and that thereby a simulation can /create matter./ To do this the "simulation" would have to mimic - not describe, but actually reproduce - the action of strings, or whatever else the bottom layer is. I don't believe mere computers performing calculations have this magic power you ascribe to them. That is, I don't believe that a computer describing matter is the same thing as strings - if they exist - doing whatever it is they do to /create/ matter. It is a long and unsubstantiated leap to say that just because we don't know how matter comes about, but have some mathematical models that might describe it, that these models can /create universes./

  Then the way it will have no way to tell that the matter it interacts with is virtual to us in the containing universe.
#+end_quote

Again, you are having to ASSUME consciousness at the outset to then claim that the simulated universe is /real to them/. This is backwards, you are begging the question. You claim simulated physics will create consciousness, but then you use the simulated consciousness to justify the "reality" of the simulated physics! it's a closed loop.

#+begin_quote
  Traditional simulations are not even close to the level that abstracts an entire physics
#+end_quote

And cannot be! I agree that this is the key element we are circling around.

All simulations are by definition lower resolution than the universe they are running in. You cannot be higher resolution than reality, everything in your simulation is comprised of the material you are attempting to break down or describe, and must by necessity be more complex than the thing being simulated.

For this reason, you cannot have a "perfect" simulation of the fundamental layer of physics. a simulation will always be a bit blurry, compared to reality. And again, regardless of the fidelity, simply describing something with numbers does not physically create that thing!

At this point, though, I'm not sure we are even arguing about my original position. I want to restate it, in case our disagreement has actually dissolved.

My position is that, when deciding how to create artifical minds for the purpose of "uploading" humans to avoid death, the safest option is to reproduce the physical structure of the brain, and not rely on software that merely simulates behavior.

This is because we do not (and possibly cannot) know what exact physical processes are necessary to create consciousness. We only know that physical human brains are /sufficient./

Software run on a general computing machine that is not phyiscally similar to a brain has a low probability of being conscious, IMO, and is not a safe bet when gambling with the survival of human consciousness.

I don't believe it is sufficient to simulate the physical structure of a brain, because a mere simulation is not the same thing as the physical process that produces or controls matter. A description of a thing is not the thing itself.
