  Based on what? And to whom?

My bad, should have connected better with my String Theory point. If ST turns out to be true, we are "just math". Particles and Physics emerge from a many dimensional set of rules from a substrate that may otherwise be the same other than for the many dimensional values they hold as vibrations (we just call them vibrations).

  Simulations are not just as real to the only universal interpreter

You seem to be anthropomorphizing the universe/physics. "Realness" is a semantic distinction that only denotes whether the realities match up.

Addition: I don't think a virtual watermill or a virtual consciousness can tell that it's virtual physics is "fake". Its senses can even be directly linked to sensors in the "real" world. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat][The Brain in a Vat]] thought experiment again shows how untrustworthy even our senses are (theoretically).

  The simulated universe thought experiment relies on the assumption that an infinite regress of simulated universes containing consciousness is possible.

I admit that it's probable that each layer of the proverbial matroska doll of theoretical simulated universes could lose some computational power/resources if each sub universe is necessarily strictly smaller (or lower resolution, or something) than it's container, but we don't /know/ that when we deal with possible infinities. I had an exam including infinite series and sequences yesterday. A monotonically decreasing sequence that is bounded below (in this case the lower bound is zero or greater as the theoretical minimum resources to run a real enough sim) will converge to a finite value (/at infinity./ though). Unless you have some other reason to believe it's not possible.

I'm not treating the thought experiment as it were real, but we don't have any reason to believe the assumption is false. Therefore we don't have any reason to believe your point that it's false is true. The fact that we can't immediately find hard faults with the thought experiment means that it's not obviously false.

I realize we can't just say something is true because we can't prove it is false. I'm saying that you can't justifiably say something is false without sufficient proof either. You're arguing the assumption is false because simulations don't seem to match up with your feeling for the human word real (I think). *If you're trying to say something isn't possible, I think the burden of proof lies on you. If you're trying to establish a meaningful distinction (real/virtual), I think you should provide a better argument* than /our physics feels more real than numbers/. It would if you were made of numbers (which physics is).
