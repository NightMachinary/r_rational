  What is it about the interaction of neurons makes that "consciousness
#+end_quote

No idea, this is the big question isn't it? If we can learn this we can build artificial consciousness of many different configurations. The problem is it's not testable in the traditional sense, at least I don't see how to.

You can't just make something that behaves like a conscious mind to an outsider, because we can be fooled. A simple conversation lookup table like the Chinese room thought experiment wouldn't be conscious IMO, but it could trick someone into thinking it was. This is super dangerous, because if we get it wrong we could kill everyone who we are trying to save by uploading.

edit: MAYBE we could build artificial minds with varying configurations with a minimal capacity for communication, and not feed them the concept of consciousness up front, and see if they come up with it on their own? I think I would accept this as weak evidence of consciousness, but it's not a very efficient way to test the search space of all possible configurations of "minds."
