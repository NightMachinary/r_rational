Huh. It occurs to me that, if I'm even close to understanding Scott Aaronson's discussion on Free Will, you can actually imagine a test to distinguish the look-up table with "the real thing".... maybe.

A look-up table has constant time complexity. "The real thing" requires the entire universe to compute to the point of action to determine what "the real thing" does at that point.

But... You'd never be able to prove that the look-up table has the correct answer without doing the universe calculation...? I think maybe under this view, constructing such a table would actually be impossible.

Thoughts?
