  so you believe consciousness is...
#+end_quote

I think that: There is no substance you can point to and say "this is what causes it". Mind/body dualism simply suggests there's a totally different kind of substance (than matter) that's responsible. I think consciousness (or whatever we have) arises from the "pattern" that our matter takes. If you re-enact this pattern in another medium, I would expect consciousness. I also expect there are other "consciousness islands" in the pattern state-space.

It's possible that the particular chemical (including anything quantum) interactions between neurons is a crucial part of this pattern; but I don't think so, and if that were the case, I'd expect that simulating them (with enough fidelity) would be sufficient.

You make solid points. You're very correct that going for something like human upload is incredibly risky unless you have a solid test that you believe in for things like "consciousness" and "continuity of self".

However, I'm extremely skeptical of there being any possible physics test for this. I can only even imaging a behavioral test; this starts getting into solipsist territory.

I guess another way to phrase my position is that any test I'd use to determine that other humans are also conscious is sufficient for me for AIs / uploads; not that I actually have a such a test.

So for /me/, it's more about the boundaries of that risk. You've solidly convinced that without such a test I should not undergo human upload.... prior to imminent death. Or try to convince other people that it'd be a good idea. (Which wasn't the plan anyway).

I'd pick on this point tho, separately from the "consciousness test" discussion (because you very definitely convinced me via "no seriously this is important") -

  Surely you are not asserting that to believe something is to make it true?

There's a saying I like, from psychonautics: "Cars are hard. Fire is hot. If you think you can fly, start from the ground. All else is consensus.". There's things that are real. There's things we think and act as if they are real, but there's no /thing/. AFAIK, there's no physical thing to point to that delineates music from noise, and yet (for the most part) we all agree that music is a real thing, and can generally agree on a set of things that are music and set of things that are noise (although the line is real broad and fuzzy).

There /are/ things that seem to (generally) become true when you believe them. AFAIK, they're also all things that there's no objective measurement for: Luck. Confidence. Stress. The placebo effect is a real thing with real effects.
