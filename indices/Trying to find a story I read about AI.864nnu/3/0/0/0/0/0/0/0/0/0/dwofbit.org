I'm now tangled up in a bunch of reading on this, as I hadn't encountered Aaronson's free will lectures before. Free will has always seemed like a silly discussion to me , but this thread has led me to consider the relationship between quantum mechanics and free will more closely. Not sure where I've landed yet.

I think my position on consciousness isn't shifted by this, though -- even if you use a time dependent algorithm to basically compress the lookup table (Aaronson touches on this briefly), I don't think it becomes conscious.
