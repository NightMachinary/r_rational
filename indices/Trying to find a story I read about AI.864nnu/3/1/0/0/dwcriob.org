  Physics does not operate on abstractions - even a perfect digital model of hydrodynamics is not wet, and *cannot power a watermill*.

It can power a simulated watermill? It would be wet to a simulated human in that universe if they developed the same concept.

If we lived in a simulated reality (powered by abstractions of physics), would that make us less real?

*I posit that simulations are just as real*, but they're different to what is being simulated only because imperfections in the simulation. If String Theory is to be believed all of physics emerges from different values on some kind of fundamental object. Consider that everything is a perfect simulation of itself. Conceptually simulations are a copy. The practical difference is that they are usually in a simulated reality.

*I don't buy that there's anything that can't be abstracted* /if/ all the comprising elements and governing rules were understood. *The only plausible limitation I can currently conceive of is some fundamental mathematical limitation of computation/physics that doesn't allow all the rules or characteristics to be observed*, but nothing would limit us from chancing upon a set of rules and characteristics that do work ourselves.

I don't see why simulated physics is less real than real physics. *We can't even conceptually rule out that we're in a simulation.* Some even argue that it's likely.
