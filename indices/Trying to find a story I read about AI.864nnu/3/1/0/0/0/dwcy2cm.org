  I posit that simulations are just as real

Based on what? And to whom? You are just assuming the conclusion, that simulated consciousness is real, without any basis for it other than you want it to be that way.

Simulations are just math. They only represent something at all because we say they do - the observer is required to give it any meaning at all. otherwise it's just arbitrary numbers being crunched.

Simulations are /not/ just as real to the only universal interpreter-physics. Physics defines what is real in our universe and how it behaves. Simulations are not physical, they are just math we claim represents something real. I see nothing that convinces me that pointing to an arbitrary number and naming it makes it "real"

  We can't even conceptually rule out that we're in a simulation. Some even argue that it's likely.

The simulated universe thought experiment relies on the /assumption/ that an infinite regress of simulated universes containing consciousness is possible. It takes the premise we are discussing as a given, so it cannot be used to argue for the truth of that premise.
