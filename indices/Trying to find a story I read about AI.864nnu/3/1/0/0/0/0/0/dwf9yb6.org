I categorically reject your assertion that we, and physics are "made of numbers."

Math is a descriptor. It is not reality itself. Saying we are "made of math" is a nonsensical statement. You might as well say "we are made of poetry." Invoking string theory doesn't change this - string theory has nothing to do with simulated universes or whether a description of something is the same as that thing.

""Realness" is a semantic distinction that only denotes whether the realities match up" seems like gibberish to me.

The brain in the vat experiment is also irrelevant, as it is not proof that simulated universes are "real." There is still a physical brain in a physical vat.

What you are proposing is non-materialism - that any abstraction can represent a universe unto itself, and in doing so CREATES that universe. If you don't believe in an objective physical reality then sure, you are free to posit absolutely anything at all. We will have no common ground.

If you believe physics - and it appears you study it - and are a materialist, then we can converse on those terms.

You argument so far as I can tell is merely to assert that simulations are "real", and then defend this by defining "real" as "self consistent to conscious inhabitants of a universe."

This begs the question. You must assume consciousness to assert consciousness.

If you are a materialist, then the idea that a representation of something is identical to the thing itself is absurd.

I agree with John Searle on this:

  “The wall behind my back is right now implementing the WordStar program, because there is some pattern of molecule movements that is isomorphic with the formal structure of WordStar. But if the wall is implementing WordStar, if it is a big enough wall it is implementing any program, including any program implemented in the brain.”

If consciousness - or an entire universe - can be created by nothing but math, an abstract concept merely said to /represent/ said universe, then every pile of pebbles is teeming with simulated universes. I find this conclusion ridiculous, but maybe you accept it as it is.

But then, why bother with complicated simulating hardware at all? Just shuffle some rocks at random. They represent numbers, after all, and reality is just numbers, so just declare that your latest shit is isomorphic to a universe where your consciousness is dwelling in eternal paradise, and blow your brains out at the next opportunity to escape this sad excuse for reality.

I'm kidding, of course - please don't take the above as a serious directive or invective directed at you personally. I mean only to point out how silly the idea that "reality is math" is, and how you can't possibly believe any such thing and care to live in the /actual/ reality.

Physics isn't made of numbers. Numbers describe physics. So I reject the idea that any arbitrary numbers can create a reality.
