I think that at this point we've begun to get into a semantic argument about what constitutes "real".

I am a materialist; I do believe that everything we see and experience is the result of interactions of matter and energy.

I follow physics, and I have friends who study it. I aim to be a computer scientist by specialization (no time for everything unfortunately). However, string theory is the theory that aims to understand how /matter/ itself works and exists.

I was saying that if matter is just a pattern on this fundamental substrate, then matter itself is just an abstraction.

If /you/ are a materialist it follows that you believe that consciousness arises from interactions of matter. Then it follows that IF (and that's the if that we'll probably differ on)matter can be abstracted, and you abstractly simulate that matter, then consciousness can arise from interaction of that matter[1]. Then the way it will have no way to tell that the matter it interacts with is virtual to us in the containing universe.

Traditional simulations are not even close to the level that abstracts an entire physics.

  latest shit is isomorphic to a universe where your consciousness is dwelling in eternal paradise.

Just cause it's got numbers in it doesn't mean it's isomorphic. If it were isomorphic, that would be very interesting. However, there's nothing short of god-like technology that can achieve that. It's also not like I'd want to stop living because a perfect simulation of me has it better (subjective).

I feel that somewhere in your understanding of our physics/universe your imparting to it some characteristic of super-special-realness that it may not necessarily have.
