I find the hypothesis that consciousness is a phenomena that emerges[1] from the patterns of our physical brain compelling.

Given that, why can't there be a direct and abstract translation of the fundamental characteristics and arrangement of the comprising elements of the brain into software? The trivial solution[2] would be to just directly scan and simulate the exact physics+chemistry of an existing brain like this story does.

[1] arises as characteristic of the system not found in elements comprising the system, but out of the interaction of those elements.

[2] trivial as in trivial to conceptualize, not trivial to implement or meet the prerequisites of. If we assume we can copy the physics over, we can have a brain that lives in virtual, but is identical to our own, but that is a false assumption for now. However, it seems to stand to reason that anything in the physical world can theoretically have an analog in the virtual world (be simulated).
