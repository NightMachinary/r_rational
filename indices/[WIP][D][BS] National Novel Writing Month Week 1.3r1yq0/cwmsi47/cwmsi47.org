For NaNoWriMo I'm going to be writing an erom, /50 Shades of Grey Except Not Awful/. (It's a working title.)

Unfortunately, last month I did a NaNoWriMo challenge for 80,000 words, of which I've only written 68,000, so I need to finish /The Change Storms: Induction/ before officially starting on NaNoWriMo. Wish me luck.
