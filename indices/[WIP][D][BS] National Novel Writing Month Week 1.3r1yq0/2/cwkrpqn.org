Finished Day One at 2,275 words. An excerpt:

“I think I'm going insane,” Manch offered to the table at large. The assortment of tabletoken players rolled their eyes and continued the current round of betting.

“Get yourself a wife, boy,” said an old weever. “Then you'll know.” He laughed sharply, then coughed and said, “Four greens on the fourty. Fill ‘er up, Terzo.”

Terzo shuffled the tokens around to their new places and flicked the turn-counter to his left. “Your bet, Rudo,” he intoned, his hollow-sounding voice matching perfectly with his mask-like face.

The longbrow trowling yanked on the eponymous feature of his race and screwed up his face. “Smoke it, Genki, I feel like I'm playin' with a Scavenger here. My luck's run out and kept on runnin' the other direction. Go easy on us, will ya?”

The weever cackled, jumping a black token across the six fingers of his bottom left hand. “Experience trumps luck every time, Rudo, my boy.”

“I'm old enough to be your father, you spiny loon,” said Rudo, tossing a handful of muddy brown tokens onto the table.

“I'm older at heart, Rudo, I'm older at heart. So, Manch, what brings you moping to seek the company of us tabletoken rascals?”

“Insanity loves company, or something like that,” said Manch, tilting his head and peering blankly at the mess of colored tokens arranged across the table. “What's the count, Terzo?”

“Seven-and-one,” Terzo replied, voice passing through the air like a raindrop through smoke.

“You're crazy if you think you're insane, boy,” said the weever on Genki's other side. “What's got ya down?”

“The turning point of my life is approaching and my brain is falling apart into a mental game of tabletokens where each of my thoughts bids against the others to gain control of my focus. Are yellows still wild?”

Genki glanced back at the stack of tokens in front of him. “Aye. So when's this turning point, anyway.”

“Five days from now, at the Midcycle Exams. How many turns until the Shift round starts?”

“After Terel here makes up his mind about how he wants to lose,” said Genki, his bottom right hand splurching out to point at the other weever.

“Are you going to apply for Squireship, then?” asked Rudo, wrinkled face scanning his tokens for a pattern he hoped he'd just missed.

“Mm,” said Manch noncommitally. “Take five white, Terel, then declare and double.”

“What?” said the young weever. “Why would I double, especially after I declare? Why would I even declare in the first place, that's letting Genki take the side-pot right off.”

“Don't listen to him, he's obviously insane,” Genki said, eyes flicking to the table's tokens before becoming interested in the black token he was still flipping between his fingers.

Rudo's voluminous eyebrows twitched as he found whatever it was he hadn't known he was looking for. “Hey, Terel, the boy may have something.”

“If you don't, Genki's going to trade all his yellows for whites first turn of the Shift round,” Manch said, eyeing the pile of whites in front of Terzo.

“What?” said Terel, lost. “But he doesn't have any-”

“Smokes!” yelled Rudo. “He'll have a finger on everyone else's by the time his turn comes around!”

“How?!” asked Terel in exhasperation, still not seeing it.

“The count's seven-and-one now, right?” said Rudo, shaking his head in amazement. “If you do nothing but bet flat and pass on doubling, Genki just has to double at the start of his turn and he'll get the pick of any color he's got nil of! I was wondering why you kept passing up the chance at nabbing a few yellows yourself, you wily bastard,” he said, this directed at Genki.

Terel sat back, deflated. “Damn.”

“Will you shut up and bet,” said the fifth denizen of the tabletoken game, a towering aspin fay with a bushy white beard.

“That's all you ever have to say, even at a time like this?”

“This time is no different than any other.”

“I almost lost everything!” Terel cried. “We all did!”

“Take five white, declare, then double, Terel,” Manch said boredly, repeating his earlier advice. “If you play as bad of a Shift round as you do the primary rounds, you'll still come out on top, though not by much. Have a goodnight, you guys.”

“Yeah, you'd better leave,” grumbled Genki, arms crossed, four hands tapping an angry beat against his exoskeleton. “I'll have you know that in the past, they used to string up a spectator by his bottom-wrists for interfering in a game of tabletokens.”
